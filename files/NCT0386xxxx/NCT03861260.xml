  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised parallel trial is to compare the efficacy of Glycosaminoglycan&#xD;
      layer replacement against cystoscopy and urethral dilatation in the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      urinary tract infection in pre-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be randomised to 1 of 2 arms.Arm 1 patients will receive standard treatment&#xD;
      from the Urologists. This will involve rigid cystoscopy and urethral dilatation, under&#xD;
      general anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 patients will receive standard treatment from the Gynaecologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is defined as infection, following complete&#xD;
      resolution of a previous UTI.Recurrent UTI (rUTI) is defined as 3 or more microbiologically&#xD;
      confirmed UTI within 12 months. rUTI is an economic problem for healthcare services. rUTI is&#xD;
      also detrimental to the quality of life (QoL) of women who suffer the disease. 61% of women&#xD;
      who suffer rUTI report symptoms of depression and an associated decrease in their reported&#xD;
      QoL scores. QoL was found to improve significantly with successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-coli is the most common bacteria causing UTI and 10% are thought to be antibiotic&#xD;
      resistant. Consequently, new treatment strategies are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) layer is thought to be instrumental as a defence mechanism&#xD;
      against uro-pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAG's are polysaccharides forming a gel like substance on the apical surface of the bladder&#xD;
      wall and act as a barrier to uro-pathogens. There is now strong evidence that a reduction in&#xD;
      the impermeability of the GAG layer is linked to rUTI. Urethral dilatation is an alternative&#xD;
      treatment to GAG replacement in the management of rUTI. It is a treatment option more widely&#xD;
      adopted by Urologists, although there is a paucity of data to support its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no standardised strategy for the management of women with rUTI. Treatments&#xD;
      vary between GAG layer replacement (intravessical therapy with hyaluronic acid and&#xD;
      chondroitin sulphate) or a cystoscopy and urethral dilatation. Evidence for each regime&#xD;
      varies greatly and is of poor quality. This is a randomised study comparing GAG layer&#xD;
      replacement with cystoscopy and urethral dilatation.&#xD;
