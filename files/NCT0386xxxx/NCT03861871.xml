      This study will be enrolling 10 patients, ages 2-18 years old, with a confirmed&#xD;
      genetic/clinical diagnosis of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) in an open label trial of&#xD;
      fenfluramine for seizure control. Patients will be titrated over 14 days to a dose of ZX008&#xD;
      0.8 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 30 mg/d).&#xD;
