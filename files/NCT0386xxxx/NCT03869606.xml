  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first of several studies that establish the value of measuring fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in children undergoing general anesthesia. The first study in this series will&#xD;
      determine whether fluid responsiveness, as measured with the NICOM cardiac output monitor in&#xD;
      normal children before and after passive leg raising, predicts changes in stroke volume,&#xD;
      cardiac output, and blood pressure during the early stages of anesthesia. A second study will&#xD;
      determine if early treatment of the fluid responsiveness will prevent the decline in blood&#xD;
      pressure that accompanies general anesthesia. If the NICOM monitor permits accurate&#xD;
      prediction in normal patients, future studies of pediatric patients undergoing major surgery&#xD;
      would be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to add 25 additional patients who will have the NICOM&#xD;
      assessments performed in the pre operative area - Pre anesthesia. General anesthesia may&#xD;
      alter the results of the NICOM assessments. The investigators will use these 25 subjects to&#xD;
      serve as a comparison/control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be identified from the surgery schedule and will be contacted by a&#xD;
      research team member via phone ahead of their surgery date to inform them of the research&#xD;
      study. This call will allow the research team member to answer questions and establish the&#xD;
      subject's interest in participation. If interested, or not able to be contacted by phone,&#xD;
      patient/family will be approached in the pre-operative area or other private hospital&#xD;
      setting. He/she and their parent(s) will have ample time to read the consent and ask any&#xD;
      questions regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject and his/her parent(s) agree to participate, all standard techniques for&#xD;
      general anesthesia compatible with the particular surgical procedure will be employed.&#xD;
      Clinical decisions concerning the subject's perioperative care will be made by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist of record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac output will be measured with the NICOM cardiac output monitor. The NICOM is a&#xD;
      non-invasive monitor using bioreactance, a proprietary technique developed by Cheetah Medical&#xD;
      that utilizes delay time shifts to measure stroke volume when an alternating current is&#xD;
      passed through the thorax. It requires the placement of four surface electrodes (similar to&#xD;
      ECG electrodes) above and below the heart on each side of the patient's chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure cardiac output, stroke volume, and fluid responsiveness (increase in&#xD;
      stroke volume &gt; 10%) obtained via passive leg elevation immediately after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Adult studies have demonstrated that fifty percent of fasted patients are fluid&#xD;
      responsive. The investigators seek to determine the incidence on children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All decisions concerning clinical care of the subject during the perioperative period will&#xD;
      made by the anesthesiologist of record in accordance with accepted standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The NICOM® electrodes will be applied in proper position in the pre-op area. In pre-op,&#xD;
           baseline and passive leg measurements will be recorded using the NICOM®. Electrodes will&#xD;
           remain in place and will again be used during the OR NICOM® measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard physiologic monitors will be used: non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, pulse&#xD;
           oximeter, capnograph (end-tidal carbon dioxide), BIS (bispectral analsysis/depth of&#xD;
           anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Induction of anesthesia to be determined by the anesthesiologist of record. May be&#xD;
           either inhalation or intravenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurements recorded after application of NICOM electrodes include blood pressure,&#xD;
           heart rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide, arterial oxygen saturation, BIS level, stroke&#xD;
           volume, cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After measurement of baseline cardiorespiratory parameters, passive leg elevation to 45&#xD;
           degrees will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiorespiratory measurements describe in section d will be repeated after passive leg&#xD;
           elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cardiorespiratory parameters will be measured during the next 60 minutes of anesthesia.&#xD;
           This information will be used to determine whether fluid responsive patients require&#xD;
           additional intravenous fluids or vasoactive drugs during the course of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures listed above will be performed Pre-anesthesia in the Pre operative area,&#xD;
      while the subject is fully awake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia may alter the results of the NICOM procedures. The investigators will add&#xD;
      25 patients who will be evaluated with the study procedures pre anesthesia as a&#xD;
      control/comparison group.&#xD;
