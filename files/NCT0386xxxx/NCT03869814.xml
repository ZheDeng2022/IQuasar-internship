  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bluestar Genomics is developing a screening test from whole blood for the early detection of&#xD;
      multiple cancers. The goal of this study is to employ genomics, epigenomics and proteomics&#xD;
      methodology for the detection of cancer signal in the blood of subjects with solid tumors.&#xD;
      The study will also include subjects without cancers that will be followed up for up to&#xD;
      3-years from blood draw.&#xD;

      Epigenomic changes in cancer cells can provide a rich source of biomarker signals for the&#xD;
      detection of disease. As cancer cells manifest their epigenomic changes in blood due to cell&#xD;
      death, DNA and protein molecules can be probed using specific molecular analytic approaches.&#xD;
      Bluestar Genomics employs epigenomic technologies to measure dynamic changes in DNA&#xD;
      demethylation events via direct measurement of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine residues in cfDNA.&#xD;
      Companion assays are also run to provide information on cfDNA digestion patterns and&#xD;
      protein-based changes in plasma. This information, combined in a machine learning framework,&#xD;
      enable the provision of prediction models that report on the presence of cancer and the&#xD;
      determination of the tissue of tumor origin. This study will build predictive models and test&#xD;
      performance of these models to detect the presence of cancer and tissue of origin in several&#xD;
      cancer type by using a matched case-control study design.&#xD;
