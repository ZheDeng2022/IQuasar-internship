      To examine how helpful the iExaminer will be as a training aid for medical students. The&#xD;
      investigators will look into whether 1) it helps the medical students find pertinent eye&#xD;
      findings for certain diagnoses and 2) it improves the medical students comfort level compared&#xD;
      to using the PanOptic alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Direct ophthalmoscopy is a vital skill for screening emergent conditions as well as chronic&#xD;
      ocular pathologies for nonophthalmic physicians. Many eye care practitioners are first&#xD;
      exposed to this tool during their medical education and are expected to have a certain degree&#xD;
      of proficiency with it down the line. This skill requires practice, however, and given that&#xD;
      there is a limited amount of time and exposure, it is not surprising that there is a general&#xD;
      lack of familiarity and confidence among students and physicians with using the direct&#xD;
      ophthalmoscope (Gilmour et al.,2017; Schulz et al., 2014; Day et al.,2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A myriad of techniques and models have attempted to change this and improve the efficacy in&#xD;
      teaching direct ophthalmoscopy. Studies have shown that students prefer learning how to use&#xD;
      the direct ophthalmoscope with human subjects rather than simulators, and that the students&#xD;
      prefer using fundus photographs to learn important diagnostic findings over the&#xD;
      ophthalmoscope (Kelly et al.,2013). There have also been studies comparing the direct&#xD;
      ophthalmoscope to the PanOptic, which gives a fixed working distance from the patient and a&#xD;
      larger field of view (Day et al.,2017). These studies have noted more &quot;ease of use&quot; and&#xD;
      accuracy in using the PanOptic among first year medical students and physicians (McComiskie&#xD;
      et al.,2004; Petrushkin et al., 2012). New technological advances such as the iExaminer&#xD;
      application have also been recently introduced, allowing the eye care physicians to take&#xD;
      fundus images on their smart phone using a smart phone application and attachment to the&#xD;
      PanOptic. Studies have shown the iExaminer application is able to produce &quot;clinically&#xD;
      adequate&quot; fundus images (Day et al.,2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the literature review, there have not been any studies that compare the PanOptic alone&#xD;
      versus the PanOptic with the iExaminer application as an introductory teaching tool for&#xD;
      medical students. The iExaminer will not only allow the user to utilize the view obtained&#xD;
      from the PanOptic, but also allow an instructor to observe and help coach the user on&#xD;
      relevant findings and take pictures for future reference or instruction. This provides a&#xD;
      potentially effective learning device which can help users accurately identify more relevant&#xD;
      ophthalmic findings. The investigators also believe that this will help increase the medical&#xD;
      students confidence level and encourage them to practice with these devices again at future&#xD;
      opportunities.&#xD;
