      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine disorders involve changes to glands that produce hormones. Hormones are released by&#xD;
      these glands into the blood so they can direct the function of other tissues in the body.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study people who may have endocrine disorders. They want to learn more&#xD;
      about the conditions that affect endocrine glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study adults with a variety of endocrine disorders for research and physician education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have an endocrine or metabolic-related disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the study and the schedule will vary by participant. Tests may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool and saliva samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies: Participants will lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
      They may be injected with a substance to make their organs more visible in the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of endocrine tissue function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consultation with other specialists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be treated for their endocrine disorder. This could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery. If tissue is removed during surgery, it may be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have genetic testing. This will be done with a small amount of blood, cells&#xD;
      from a cheek swab, or saliva.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of adults with a&#xD;
      variety of&#xD;
&#xD;
      endocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our accredited&#xD;
      internal medicine endocrinology training programs. Participants will receive clinical care&#xD;
      per standard of practice for their condition. Data collected from standard clinical practice&#xD;
      will be retained for future research. The research-directed evaluations may include&#xD;
      collection and retention for future use of blood, feces, saliva, or urine samples or&#xD;
      evaluation of tissue that was routinely collected for clinical care. In some patients with&#xD;
      endocrine disorders, laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm a&#xD;
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient, using standard approaches in current&#xD;
      clinical practice. In some cases, the patient will receive medical, radiation or surgical&#xD;
      treatment for their disorder.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The possible disorder of the patient subjects must complement the case-mix in the&#xD;
             IETP, as determined by the Principal Investigator. A log will be used to assure that&#xD;
             the training needs of the teaching protocols are being met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unstable patients and patients with severe organ failure, or those with a condition or&#xD;
             medical treatment that may affect/limit the endocrine work-up and exhaust Clinical&#xD;
             Center, IETP resources will be excluded if appropriate. Decisions will be made on a&#xD;
             case by case basis by the investigators. For example, there is a weight limit for the&#xD;
             interventional radiology table used for venous&#xD;
&#xD;
             sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability of a subject to adhere to a proposed schedule of visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
