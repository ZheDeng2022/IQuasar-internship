  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hands are the most frequent injury sites caused by burn, and appropriate rehabilitation is&#xD;
      essential to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved. Many interventions have been&#xD;
      developed for patients with burns; however, hand rehabilitation tools are limited. Virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR)-based rehabilitation has proven beneficial to the functions of upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities. To investigate VR-based rehabilitation effects on burned hands, we compare the&#xD;
      results of VR rehabilitation group to the results of matched conventional(CON) rehabilitation&#xD;
      group.This single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial involved 31 patients with burns and&#xD;
      dominant right-hand function impairment. Patients were randomized into a VR or a CON group.&#xD;
      Each intervention was applied to the affected hand for 4 weeks. Hand function was evaluated&#xD;
      using the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), grasp and pinch power test, and Michigan&#xD;
      Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ). These assessments were evaluated pre-intervention and 4&#xD;
      weeks post-intervention.Our study results suggest that VR-based rehabilitation is likely to&#xD;
      be as effective as conventional rehabilitation for recovering hand function in a burned hand.&#xD;
      VR-based rehabilitation may be considered a treatment option for burned hands.&#xD;

      Appropriate rehabilitation is important to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved.&#xD;
      Burned hands are usually treated and managed by a multidisciplinary team at a burn center to&#xD;
      conservatively manage hypertrophic scars. Rehabilitation of the burned hand should be&#xD;
      initiated in the acute stages to set individualized positioning, splinting and exercise for&#xD;
      functional activity. Frequent exercises throughout the day are more beneficial than one&#xD;
      intensive exercise. Repeated range of motion (ROM) exercises are helpful in decreasing edema&#xD;
      and conditioning the tissue. Despite adequate rehabilitation of the burned hand, hand&#xD;
      functional disorders may occur. Many interventions have been developed and trialed for&#xD;
      patients with burns; however, hand rehabilitation tools are limited and remain controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have recommended that for the functional recovery of upper extremity disorder,&#xD;
      repetitive exercises using VR have been useful. Task-specific training has been shown to be&#xD;
      more effective when tasks were ordered in a random practice sequence using repetition and&#xD;
      positive feedback. VR is an interactive and enjoyable intervention. VR creates a virtual&#xD;
      rehabilitation scene in which the intensity of practice can be systemically manipulated. This&#xD;
      study aimed to evaluate the effects of VR-based rehabilitation on burned hands, and compare&#xD;
      the results to those of matched CON rehabilitation in patients with burns.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients' burn scars had re-epithelialized after aseptic care or skin graft. We&#xD;
             included patients aged ≥18 years with a deep partial-thickness (second-degree) burn or&#xD;
             a full thickness (third-degree) burn to their hands, with joint contracture(hand and&#xD;
             wrist), having been transferred to the rehabilitation department after acute burn&#xD;
             treatment, and less than 6 months since the onset of the burn injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who had fourth-degree burns(involving muscles, tendons, and bone injuries),&#xD;
             musculoskeletal diseases(fracture, amputation, rheumatoid arthritis, and degenerative&#xD;
             joint diseases) in the burned hand, or neurological diseases(such as peripheral nerve&#xD;
             disorders), preexisting physical and psychologic disability (severe aphasia and&#xD;
             cognitive impairment that could influence the intervention), and severe pain impeding&#xD;
