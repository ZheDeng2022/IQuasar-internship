    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of solriamfetol in improving sleep in patients&#xD;
      with grade II-IV glioma. Solriamfetol is a wakefulness-promoting drug. Giving solriamfetol&#xD;
      may improve sleep, memory, fatigue, mood, or quality of life in patients with brain tumors&#xD;
      (gliomas).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the safety of solriamfetol at 75 mg daily, 150 mg daily, 300 mg daily as&#xD;
      assessed by NCI CTC Adverse Events (v5.0) in patients with primary gliomas compared to prior&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on sleep by Epworth Sleepiness Scores (ESS) scores&#xD;
      in patients with primary gliomas and compare the effect to previously published scores in&#xD;
      patients with OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
      scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on neurocognitive function based on a&#xD;
      disease-specific neurocognitive battery (see neurocognitive battery below)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on patient-reported fatigue (Brief Fatigue&#xD;
      Inventory, Cancer Fatigue Scale) &amp; mood (Beck's Depression Inventory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on patient-reported QOL (FACT-Br)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on objective sleep-wake times by actigraphy and&#xD;
      sleep diary (pre- vs post-treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore a biologic gradient effect of increasing doses of solriamfetol on actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore differences in clinical activity of solriamfetol by corticosteroid use,&#xD;
      antiepileptic use, and tumor grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive solriamfetol orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 6 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
