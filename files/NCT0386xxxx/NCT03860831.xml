  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine and Midazolam are well known sedative drugs that can be given through different&#xD;
      routes such as intravenous, intramuscular, oral, rectal and intranasal route. Anesthetic&#xD;
      staff usually prefer intravenous route but sometimes inserting venous access is difficult in&#xD;
      uncooperative mentally disabled children. Intranasal ketamine+Midazolam can be a needless&#xD;
      effective alternative in these vulnerable patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation and analgesia decreases the need for general anesthesia outside the operating room.&#xD;
      Intravenous route is the standard way of sedation, but its use can be limited in&#xD;
      uncooperative mentally disabled children. Active Physical restraint of children causes&#xD;
      emotional trauma for both parents and children particularly in these patients. Oral sedation&#xD;
      has multiple disadvantages as delayed onset of action, better taste, the need of different&#xD;
      types of syrup or honey according to the preference of the patient, children may refuse to&#xD;
      take oral drugs or even spit it and it also causes postoperative nausea and vomiting. In&#xD;
      contrast, intramuscular sedation is an easy effective way of administration and it is&#xD;
      preferred due to its rapid onset of action and higher predictability of the duration,&#xD;
      however, fear of the pain of injections is considered a disadvantage in this vulnerable&#xD;
      pediatric patients. nasal route is an important alternative route because it is a painless&#xD;
      and needless approach with rapid drug absorption from nasal mucosa reaching the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid and bypassing the first pass metabolism in the liver. Intranasal midazolam for sedation&#xD;
      of children was first described by Wilton et al .Recently studies proved the use of nasal&#xD;
      ketamine spray for treatment of resistant depression in adults. Ketamine as a premedication&#xD;
      in children has been also successfully given through the nasal route. In Ain shams University&#xD;
      hospitals we give either oral Midazolam or intramuscular Ketamine followed by sevoflurane or&#xD;
      propofol for pediatric procedural sedation. Nasal Midazolam or Ketamine has not been tried&#xD;
      despite being a feasible choice with many possible advantages. Combination of ketamine and&#xD;
      midazolam causes deeper sedation and less dysphoric reaction of ketamine so in this study, we&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of administration of this combination through intranasal&#xD;
      route for procedural sedation in children with mental developmental delay outside the&#xD;
      operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval from our Ethical Committee, written informed consent from the parents will be&#xD;
      taken. Forty children presented with autism,mongolism or cerebral palsy classified as&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged between 4 and 12&#xD;
      years will be enrolled in our study, and computer-generated assignment will be used for&#xD;
      randomization and to allocate patients to one of two equal study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients will fulfill the fasting hours if elective while the patients in ER will be asked to&#xD;
      wait for six hours after last meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups Group IN:will receive intranasal ketamine 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      and midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, and we will give intranasal sedatives by using mucosal atomisation&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IM:will receive intramuscular ketamine 5 mg/kg, and midazolam 0.2 mg/kg Sedation levels&#xD;
      after 10, 20, and 30 min will be evaluated by Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs will be given 15- 20 minutes before procedure then Heart rate (HR), Oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (Spo2), and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) will be continuously monitored and recorded&#xD;
      every 5 min after drug administration for 60 minutes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthesia will be given in painful procedures. Intravenous ketamine 1 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      given if needed due to prolongation of procedure or if required sedation level not reached&#xD;
      through intranasal or intramuscular route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      respiratory events as airway obstruction and desaturation less than 92% will be treated by&#xD;
      jaw thrust and oxygen supplementation, apnea or laryngeal spasm will be managed with&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. Wheezing will be recorded and properly managed with bronchodilators&#xD;
      and steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency cart and drugs will be available for haemodynamic and respiratory instabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recovery of the patients, parents and doctors will rate their overall satisfaction by&#xD;
      using simple image of 5 point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: effectiveness of sedation. Secondary outcome: onset, duration of sedation,&#xD;
      adverse effect, parents and doctor satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point of the study: if our technique failed to sedate the patients general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be given either intravenous ketamine 1mg/kg or inhalational sevoflurane to complete the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
