    <description>Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and specificity to RANKL, preventing the RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring and resulting in reduced osteoclast numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and cancer induced bone destruction.</description>

    <description>Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide competitively inhibits binding of androgens to androgen receptors, inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with DNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens.&#xD;
Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years and male.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically/cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and without&#xD;
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Documented metastatic disease with at least 1 bone metastasis on bone scan and&#xD;
             confirmed, if necessary, by CT scan or MRI, if results of the bone scans are&#xD;
             ambiguous. Patients with or without visceral involvement / lymph nodes (documented by&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have documented Progressive disease (PD) either by radiographic or PSA&#xD;
             criteria as defined in a) and b) below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For the Radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging&#xD;
                  modality (ie CT/MRI or bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required&#xD;
                  to document radiographic disease progression during or following the patient's&#xD;
                  most recent anti-neoplastic therapy, (note: the 1st bone scan can be from before&#xD;
                  most recent therapy but the 2nd scan must show disease progression during or&#xD;
                  after the most recent therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  For patients with bone disease, progression will be assessed following&#xD;
                  recommendations by the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3) (Appendix I):&#xD;
                  appearance of 2 or more new lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by&#xD;
                  other imaging modalities (such as CT scan or MRI), if results of the bone scans&#xD;
                  are ambiguous).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  For patients with soft tissue lesions progression will be assessed using RECIST&#xD;
                  1.1 criteria, (see Appendix C). Patients may have measurable or non-measurable&#xD;
                  disease according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 (see Appendix C)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PSA progression as per PCWG3 (Appendix I) is defined as an increase in PSA, as&#xD;
                  determined by 2 separate measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed&#xD;
                  by a third. If the third measurement is not greater than the second measurement,&#xD;
                  then a fourth measurement must be taken and must be greater than the second&#xD;
                  measurement for the patient to be eligible for the study. Furthermore, the&#xD;
                  confirmatory PSA measurement (i.e. the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA&#xD;
                  measurement) must be defined. If a patient has received prior anti-androgen&#xD;
                  therapy (e.g. bicalutamide), PSA progression must be evident and documented after&#xD;
                  discontinuation of anti-androgen therapy, (note: The 1st PSA reading taken to&#xD;
                  document disease progression when the patient presents can be while the patient&#xD;
                  is on Casodex or other ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (e.g.&#xD;
             GnRH analogue) with testosterone at screening less than 1.73 nmol /l (50ng/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.&#xD;

                  potential, a condom and a highly effective birth control must be used (i.e.&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine&#xD;
                  device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal&#xD;
                  occlusion or a vasectomy that has received medical assessment of the surgical&#xD;
                  success) during treatment and for 5 months after treatment.&#xD;
