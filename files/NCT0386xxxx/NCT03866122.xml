  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A team of researchers at Rice University and Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) are&#xD;
      working to develop a low-cost temperature sensor that can continuously monitor an infant's&#xD;
      temperature (NTM). This robust, low-cost device will allow for the individualized monitoring&#xD;
      of each infant with alerts for hypo and hyperthermia. A reusable band placed around the&#xD;
      infant's abdomen to hold the temperature sensor will eliminate disposable components. This&#xD;
      study will assess the accuracy of this novel device against a gold standard (Philips&#xD;
      Intellivue patient monitor) and up to two existing devices (Bempu and Thermospot).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the accuracy of this novel device against a commercially available&#xD;
      patient monitor (Philips Intellivue MP30). Results will be compared to that of two existing&#xD;
      devices designed for low resource settings: Bempu, a temperature monitor placed around an&#xD;
      infant's wrist; and Thermospot, a sticker that changes color with temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll up to 150 infants at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital. Up to 75&#xD;
      subjects will be collected from the neonatal ward and 75 subjects from the Kangaroo Mother&#xD;
      Care (KMC) ward. This sample size will ensure that the investigators are able to collect&#xD;
      sufficient data from infants with a range of gestational ages, weights, temperatures, and&#xD;
      treatment locations (ie open cot, radiant warmer). The data from this study can be used to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size needed in a larger study to evaluate changes in outcomes and nurse&#xD;
      behavior related to the different temperature monitors (NTM, Bempu, Thermospot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, the following steps will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained study nurse will assess the subject for clinical complications before attaching the&#xD;
      temperature monitoring devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A trained study nurse or clinician will attach the test temperature monitoring devices&#xD;
           to the infant. A trained research assistant from Rice University or from the Biomedical&#xD;
           Engineering Department at Malawi Polytechnic will observe all procedures and will notify&#xD;
           the nurse of any observed errors so they may be corrected. They will also be able to&#xD;
           answer any technical questions from the nurse. If there is any concern for the comfort&#xD;
           or skin of the infant, only one device may be placed on at a time (NTM, Bempu,&#xD;
           ThermoSpot).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The trained study nurse will attach the temperature probe from the commercial gold&#xD;
           standard as well as provide any other care needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A research assistant will use a laptop to collect data from the continuous temperature&#xD;
           monitors (NTM and gold standard). The nurse will record the temperature readings every&#xD;
           hour from all monitors on paper forms along with the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each time an alarm sounds from any device (Bempu and the commercial gold standard have&#xD;
           audible alarms), the nurse will record all temperature values including a reading taken&#xD;
           with the standard of care method. If the subject is found to be hyper/hypothermic, the&#xD;
           nurse will respond with the appropriate standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Temperature monitoring will continue for up to 3 days. The research assistant may ask&#xD;
           the nurse to remove and reapply the temperature probes during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to confirm the accuracy of these temperature monitors. Target&#xD;
      accuracy for NTM device is +/- 0.5 C. In order to confirm this temperature accuracy in the&#xD;
      settings of both the neonatal ward and the KMC ward, 75 subjects are needed in each setting.&#xD;
      The international standards for clinical thermometers, standard number 80601-2-56, requires&#xD;
      that 75 subjects from each patient population be tested to demonstrate the clinical accuracy&#xD;
      of the thermometer. The clinical accuracy is reported using a measure of bias as well as the&#xD;
      limits of agreement.&#xD;
