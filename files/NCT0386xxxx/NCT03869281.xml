  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at greater risk of fracture than non-diabetic&#xD;
      subjects. Although the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in T1D are not completely&#xD;
      understood, insulin deficiency seems to play a key role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no information is available on the effect of diabetes remission after pancreatic&#xD;
      transplantation alone (PTA) on the risk of fractures in T1D individuals with preserved kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effect of T1D&#xD;
      remission after PTA on fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the difference in fracture incidence (any fracture) between the&#xD;
      PTA group and the control group. For the PTA group, the incidence of fractures after&#xD;
      transplantation will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from patients who underwent PTA at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital from January 2, 2005 to&#xD;
      December 31, 2017 will be compared with age-, gender- and disease duration-matched controls&#xD;
      from the pool of outpatients with T1D attending the Endocrinology Unit at the same&#xD;
      Institution. Anthropometric, anamnestic, laboratory data and data on the history of fractures&#xD;
      and past/current therapies will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, for the first time we will be able to obtain information on the effects of&#xD;
      diabetes remission on the risk of fracture. We expect that the remission of diabetes will&#xD;
      result in a beneficial effect on the fracture risk.&#xD;
