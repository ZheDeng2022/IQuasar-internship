    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, phase IIa study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of oral LAT8881 in neuropathic pain. After a one week&#xD;
      baseline period, subjects entered into the study will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (LAT8881 or placebo) twice daily for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first treatment period will be followed by a washout period of two weeks and then a&#xD;
      second baseline period of one week. Subjects will not take any IMP over these three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second baseline period, subjects will cross over to receive the second treatment&#xD;
      (either LAT8881 or placebo, whichever treatment was not received in the first treatment&#xD;
      period) twice daily for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LAT8881 will be investigated in 15 subjects (PK subjects) at&#xD;
      selected Australian sites.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is the first study with LAT8881 in subjects with neuropathic pain. As such, it has been designed to evaluate, in a well-defined patient group, the concept that LAT8881 is safe and effective in this indication.&#xD;
Subjects enrolled into this study have been diagnosed with Post Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) or Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), both conditions being well accepted examples of neuropathic pain. Because the pain is chronic, without a period effect, and treatment is symptomatic rather than curative, a crossover study is considered appropriate. Studies with other agents have successfully demonstrated analgesic effects in PHN and DPN with a crossover study design</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Functioning as Assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on functioning when measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (BPI). The BPI assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. Patients are asked to assess the level of interference experienced across seven items; general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life, with a &quot;0&quot; meaning &quot;no interference, and a &quot;10&quot;, at the top end of the scale, meaning &quot;complete interference&quot;. The result is the mean of the score of the seven items. A reduction in mean score indicates a decrease in interference.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Characteristics and Intensity, as Assessed by the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on pain symptoms in subjects with neuropathic pain, when measured by the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2). The SF-MPQ-2 contains 22 descriptors of pain and related symptoms, each scored from &quot;0&quot; (none) to &quot;10&quot; (worst possible). The scores for each descriptor at each visit are averaged to give a mean score from 0 to 10. A larger negative number represents a greater reduction in pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neuropathic Pain Symptoms, as Assessed by Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) contains ten items related to different pain descriptors (e.g. burning, squeezing, electric-shock, stabbing, tingling), allowing the assessment of the different dimensions of neuropathic pain, and two items related to the frequency and duration of pain. Each pain descriptor is rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Total pain intensity score is calculated by the sum of the 10 descriptors and can range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a higher pain intensity. A larger negative number represents a greater reduction in pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotional Functioning, as Assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on emotional functioning when measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II consists of 21 items; each item is a list of four statements arranged in order of increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. Each statement is scored from 0 to 3. Each of the 21 items is summed to give a single score for the BDI-II. Scores can range from 0 (no depression) to 63 (severe depression). An increase from baseline to the end of treatment indicates a deterioration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) is a a single-item rating by subjects of their improvement with treatment during a clinical trial. It asks the subject to rate their improvement with therapy on a 7-point scale, ranging from substantially worse (&quot;0&quot;) to substantially improved (&quot;7&quot;), with no change (&quot;4&quot;) as the mid-point. A score above 4 indicates an improvement.</description>

          <title>PainDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) scores</title>
          <description>The painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is used to assist in identifying patients with neuropathic pain. It consists of seven pain sensory symptom items which are scored from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;very strongly&quot; plus one pain course pattern item scored from -1 to 2 and and one pain radiation item scored as 2 or 0. From this questionnaire, a PD-Q total score, ranging from -1 to 38 is calculated. A total score ≥19 indicates a neuropathic component is likely, ≤12 indicates a neuropathic component is unlikely and scores 13-18 are considered uncertain.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the effects of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on functioning when measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (BPI). The BPI assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. Patients are asked to assess the level of interference experienced across seven items; general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life, with a &quot;0&quot; meaning &quot;no interference, and a &quot;10&quot;, at the top end of the scale, meaning &quot;complete interference&quot;. The result is the mean of the score of the seven items. A reduction in mean score indicates a decrease in interference.</description>

        <description>The Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) contains ten items related to different pain descriptors (e.g. burning, squeezing, electric-shock, stabbing, tingling), allowing the assessment of the different dimensions of neuropathic pain, and two items related to the frequency and duration of pain. Each pain descriptor is rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Total pain intensity score is calculated by the sum of the 10 descriptors and can range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a higher pain intensity. A larger negative number represents a greater reduction in pain.</description>
