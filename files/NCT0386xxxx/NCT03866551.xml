    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study (EFS) designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and device performance of The Reprieve System in the management of patients admitted&#xD;
      with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of&#xD;
      volume overload. Subjects will be referred by their physician if he/she feels that the&#xD;
      subject could benefit from observed diuresis in a hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device being utilized is called The Reprieve System (The System). By default, The System&#xD;
      infuses a volume of hydration fluid equal to the volume of urine output. This is known as&#xD;
      matched hydration. In addition, the clinician has the ability to adjust the matched setting&#xD;
      such that RenalGuard can infuse hydration fluid to achieve a positive fluid balance (e.g.&#xD;
      +100 ml/hr.) or a negative fluid balance (e.g. -100 ml/hr.). The purpose of this balanced&#xD;
      fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension and vital organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, or fluid overload that may lead to shortness of breath in subjects in whom high&#xD;
      urine output is desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with The Reprieve System for up to 72-hours, at the&#xD;
      investigators discretion. They will be followed for 30 days post discharge. The protocol will&#xD;
      enroll up to 40 subjects to develop the clinical algorithm required to optimally and safely&#xD;
      perform removal of volume. The study will be conducted in up to 5 sites in the United States.&#xD;
