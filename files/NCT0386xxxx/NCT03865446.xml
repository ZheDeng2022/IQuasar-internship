  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post approval requirement to study the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, parallel group study to investigate the effect of severe&#xD;
      hepatic impairment on the plasma PK, safety and tolerability after a single oral 30 mg dose&#xD;
      of dacomitinib under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18 participants will be enrolled into the study to ensure at least 6 PK&#xD;
      evaluable (having data for estimating primary PK parameters for dacomitinib) participants in&#xD;
      each cohort.&#xD;

A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period (Up to Day 35) that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state.</description>

          1. Male and/or female participants of non childbearing potential must be 18 to 75 years&#xD;
             of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 40 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;

             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICD and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or IP administration or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;

             will be eligible to participate if their urine drug test is positive with a drug for a&#xD;
             prescribed condition that is not expected to interfere with the PK of dacomitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Vital Sign Parameters Meeting Criteria of Potential Clinical Concern</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were evaluated for examination of vital signs. Criteria for potential concern in absolute values of vital sign: pulse rate: &lt;40 beats per minute (bpm), &gt;120 beats per minute; supine diastolic blood pressure: &lt;50 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg); supine systolic blood pressure: &lt;90 mm Hg. Criteria for potential concern in change from baseline in vital sign values: supine diastolic blood pressure: greater than or equal to &gt;= 30 mm Hg increase or decrease from baseline; supine diastolic blood pressure: &gt;=20 mm Hg increase or decrease from baseline. Only participants with vital sign parameters meeting criteria of potential clinical concern are reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period (Up to Day 35) that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state.</description>
