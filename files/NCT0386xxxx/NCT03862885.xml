&#xD;
          1. Patient is ≥ 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic GIST&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is not eligible for an ongoing study of avapritinib or cannot access an&#xD;
             ongoing study of avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has received 3 or more TKI therapies including imatinib, or the patient has&#xD;
             GIST that carries a mutation in exon 18 of the PDGFRA gene (such as D842V).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has adequate vital organ function, including heart, lungs, liver, kidneys,&#xD;
             bone marrow and endocrine, and is expected to tolerate therapy with a TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient or legal guardian, if permitted by local regulatory authorities, provides&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have poor organ function as defined by one or more of the following&#xD;
             laboratory parameters;&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN; or &gt; 3 × ULN in the presence of Gilbert's Disease;&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient requires therapy with a concomitant medication that is a strong inhibitor or&#xD;
             strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has had a major surgical procedure (minor surgical procedures such as central&#xD;
             venous catheter placement, tumor needle biopsy, and feeding tube placement are not&#xD;
             considered major surgical procedures) within 14 days of the first dose of avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has a history of a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attacks&#xD;
             within 1 year prior to the first dose of program drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a known risk of intracranial bleeding, such as a brain aneurysm or history&#xD;
             of subdural or subarachnoid bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women who are unwilling, if not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, to abstain from&#xD;
             sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception from the time of&#xD;
             randomization and for at least 30 days after the last dose of avapritinib. Men who are&#xD;
             unwilling, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ&#xD;
             highly effective contraception from the time of first dose and for at least 90 days&#xD;

             (β-hCG) pregnancy test consistent with pregnancy, obtained within 7 days before the&#xD;
             randomization. Females with β-hCG values that are within the range for pregnancy but&#xD;
             are not pregnant (false-positives) may be enrolled with written consent of the&#xD;
             Sponsor, after pregnancy has been ruled out. Females of non- childbearing potential&#xD;
             (postmenopausal for more than 1 year; bilateral tubal ligation; bilateral&#xD;
