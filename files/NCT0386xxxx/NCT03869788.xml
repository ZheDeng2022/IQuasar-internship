  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WHO considers foodborne trematodes as neglected tropical diseases. Fascioliasis is the most&#xD;
      widely distributed trematode reported from over 81 countries around the world it imposes its&#xD;
      highest burden in developing countries&#xD;

      liver flukes are disease affecting herbivorous animals and caused by Fasciola hepatica and&#xD;
      Fasciola gigantica In Egypt, donkeys and camels as well, are hosts for Fasciola gigantica.&#xD;
      Fascioliasis also affects man . number of humans infected with Fasciola spp. has been&#xD;
      estimated at 2.6 million . Globally, fascioliasis due to both fluke species is conservatively&#xD;
      thought to cause production losses of over US$3 billion per annum .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These infection sources include foods, water and combinations of both. Ingestion of&#xD;
      freshwater wild plants is the main source, with watercress and secondarily other vegetables&#xD;
      involved. . Drinking of contaminated water, beverages and juices, ingestion of dishes and&#xD;
      soups and washing of vegetables, fruits, tubercles and kitchen utensils with contaminated&#xD;
      water are increasingly involved .&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Two clinical stages are recognized in humam fascioliasis: An acute stage coincides with the&#xD;
      larval migration and worm maturation in the hepatic tissue, and a chronic stage coincides&#xD;
      with the persistence of Fasciola worms in the bile ducts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the acute phase of fascioliasis is characterized by fever, abdominal pain,&#xD;
           hepatosplenomegaly, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin rashes, high leukocyte count,&#xD;
           eosinophilia, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); abnormal liver&#xD;
           function tests have also been reported .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The latent phase is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, including vague&#xD;
           gastrointestinal disturbances, and intermittent eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chronic phase is characterized by regular and constant biliary obstruction; symptoms&#xD;
           include biliary colic pain, intermittent jaundice, eosinophilia, and right&#xD;
           upper-quadrant abdominal tenderness. However, the percentage of asymptomatic infections&#xD;
           is high .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is a benzimidazole derivative and is the current drug of choice for&#xD;
      treating fascioliasis. What sets TCBZ aside from the other available fasciolicides is its&#xD;
      ability to target flukes from as early as 3 days old right through to the fully mature stages&#xD;
      ,. Due to the high prevalence of TCBZ resistance (TCBZ-R), effective management of drug&#xD;
      resistance is now critical for sustainable livestock production Wich highlights the&#xD;
      importance of plant essential oils as novel anti-parasitic agents; Some plant oils have&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effects that could modify host- parasite immunobiology In addition, the&#xD;
      safety and use of plant essential oils in drug resistant cases are considered the most&#xD;
      advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allium sativum commonly called garlic belongs to the family Alliaceae. It has been used for&#xD;
      centuries to fight infections as an antioxidant ,antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal ,&#xD;
      anti-parasitic , antihypertensive , anthelmintic, and anti- diabetic agent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately, the anthelmintic effect of garlic has been a matter of interest of researchers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's Potentially Active Chemical Constituents are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sulfur compounds: aliin, allicin, ajoene, allylpropyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, s-&#xD;
           allylcysteine, vinyldithiines, S-allylmercaptocystein, and others .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzymes: allinase, peroxidases, myrosinase, and others .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amino acids and their glycosides: arginine and others .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selenium, germanium, tellurium and other trace minerals . Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum)&#xD;
           Are the dried flower buds of an aromatic tree that is used as a spice. It mainly&#xD;
           contains volatile oil, i.e. eugenol 81.1%, caryophyllin, tannins and gum.Clove oil has&#xD;
           been used as analgesic, antibacterial, anticonvulsant, anticoagulant, antifungal,&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiseptic, antitumor, antiviral, disinfectant, immune&#xD;
           stimulant as well as insecticidal .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanotechnology has a wide range of action in sciences like medicine, electronics, food and&#xD;
      agriculture. Its application has strengthen systems to control diseases in animals, water&#xD;
      disinfection, safety in systems of food supply, energy conversion, plague localization&#xD;
      technology, advances in fast detection of morphological changes in the physicochemical&#xD;
      properties of food, increment in nutrient value, quality control, food security, development&#xD;
      of novel products and packing design .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the current trend in research field, using small size of materials with wide range of&#xD;
      application . In nanotechnology there is treatment of atom, molecules or compounds to produce&#xD;
      nanoparticle with different properties .The size and structure of nanoparticle is similar to&#xD;
      most biological molecules, therefore nano particle can be useful for in research .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many types of nanoparticles: organic, inorganic, nanocrystals, nanotubes, polymeric&#xD;
      structures such as dendrimers, etc. They are used primarily in research and drug delivery&#xD;
      systems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that research garlic and cloves will be used in vitro to detect their fasciolicidal&#xD;
      effects on adult Worm obtained from locally slaughtered animals .&#xD;
