  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brånemark System® dental implant osseointegration was introduced in 1965 as a novel approach&#xD;
      to the replacement of missing teeth. Although this implant's machined, screw-shaped surface&#xD;
      had excellent, well-documented, short- and long-term clinical success (Adell, R. 1987;&#xD;
      Albrektsson, T., et al., 1981; Albrektsson, T., et al., 1986; Brånemark, P-I. , 1983;&#xD;
      Brånemark P-I. 1987), newer implant designs were introduced that could enhance fusion of the&#xD;
      implant to jaw bones, and better resist functional forces. One such implant, Screw-Vent®, has&#xD;
      a fixture macro structure very similar to that of the Brånemark® implant. However, its&#xD;
      fixture surface was acid etched (1-3µm) which could enhance osseointegration, and it has a&#xD;
      longer, narrower machined internal-hex, friction-fit collar that could better resist&#xD;
      functional forces.These characteristics should lead to less bone loss (Niznick, G. A., 1989).&#xD;
      However, one clinical study (De Bruyen, et al., 1992) reported greater short-term bone loss&#xD;
      with this implant compared to the Brånemark® implant, possibly due to its longer machined&#xD;
      collar, and advocated long-term clinical studies. Therefore, this prospective within-subject&#xD;
      clinical trial was undertaken in 1993 to first compare the Brånemark® implant with another&#xD;
      implant, Swede-Vent®, a copy of the Brånemark® macro structure except for its fixture surface&#xD;
      that was identically micro textured as that of Screw-Vent® by the same manufacturer. The&#xD;
      effect on bone healing could then be compared between Brånemark®'s machined and Swede-Vent®'s&#xD;
      micro textured fixture surfaces in the short- and long-terms. Since Screw-Vent®'s fixture&#xD;
      surface was identically micro textured as that of Swede-Vent®, the investigators could then&#xD;
      evaluate and compare the effects on bone healing of Screw-Vent®'s longer, narrower,&#xD;
      internal-connection machined collar to the identical shorter, wider, external-connection&#xD;
      machined collars of the Swede-Vent® and Brånemark® implants. All three two-part,&#xD;
      platform-matched, parallel-wall implants were made of commercially pure titanium, had a very&#xD;
      similar fixture macro design, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (USA) and&#xD;
      Health and Welfare Canada, and were commercially available in North America. Brånemark® and&#xD;
      Screw-Vent® implants are still available, but the Swede-Vent® implant is not.&#xD;

      Therefore, between 1993 and 1996, 58 of 60 eligible participants had been recruited into a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized clinical trial. This trial had been peer reviewed, had received&#xD;
      ethical approval, and had taken place at the Université de Montréal's Faculty of Dental&#xD;
      Medicine and its affiliated hospital dental department. Follow-up documentation occurred at&#xD;
      one year, two years, and 15 to 20 years following prostheses attachment (ClinicalTrials&#xD;
      Identification Number NCT01641198), and the results were published (Camarda, et al., 2018).&#xD;
      The present study reports on data collected at the 25-year (24.6 ± 0.19 years, mean ± SE)&#xD;
      follow-up (ClinicalTrials Identification Number NCT03862482), focusing specifically on the&#xD;
      evaluation and comparison of the effects on peri-implant healing and functional&#xD;
      osseointegration of the two different machined collar designs. That is to say, the identical&#xD;
      shorter, wider, external-connection Brånemark® and Swede-Vent® collars versus the longer,&#xD;
      narrower, internal-connection Screw-Vent® collar. Twenty-two of the original participants&#xD;
      (41.5%, age 71.1 ± 1.2 years, 11 women, 110 implants) were enrolled into this study. All&#xD;
      study procedures were performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and its later&#xD;
      amendments, and all participants signed informed consent documents prior to inclusion into&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>For the initial study, a statistician had prepared a sampling design that included three configuration diagrams. Each diagram identified five implants of the three types, and showed how one of each type was to be placed in a cyclical, side-by-side, rotating fashion at five sites between mental foramena. Allocation concealment by the project coordinator then allowed 20 participants to receive Configuration 1, 19 had Configuration 2, and 19 had Configuration 3. Configuration diagram (but not number) was stored inside each chart, and only shown to the operating team at the time of surgery.&#xD;
The present study is a continuation of this clinical trial, including data collected at the 25-year (24.6 ± 0.19 years, mean ± SE) follow-up. Twenty-two of the original participants (41.5%, age 71.1 ± 1.2 years, 11 women, 110 implants) were enrolled in this study. Eight participants (40 implants) received Configuration 1, 8 (40 implants) had Configuration 2, and 6 (30 implants) had Configuration 3.</masking_description>

    <measure>Comparison of Two Measurement Systems Used to Evaluate Peri-implant Bone Healing After 25 Years of Function</measure>
    <time_frame>After 25 years (24.6 ± 0.19 years, mean ± SE) of function</time_frame>
    <description>Conventional peri-apical radiology and phosphor-plate digital technology (Digora System™, Digora OptimeTM, Sporedex Dental Co., Tuusula, Finland) were used with the standardized equipment to take peri-apical radiographs on 95 implant/abutment units (Camarda, et al., 2018; Bhaskaran, et al., 2005). Following calibration, the distance between the first-bone-to-implant-contact-point and the crestal-microgap (fBIC-MG) was measured (mm) at the mesial and distal aspects of each implant/abutment unit after 25 years of function. Values (Mean ± SE) fBIC-MG were recorded for each of the two measurement systems. ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, two-way, mixed effect model) and Bland-Altman Limits of agreement (Bland &amp; Altman, 1986) were used to evaluate the level of agreement between the two systems</description>

        <description>Distance between first bone-to-implant contact point (fBIC) and microgap (MG) at the crest was measured (mm) at mesial and distal sides of each implant/abutment complex on conventional peri-apical radiographs using a standardized equipment and measurement protocol (Camarda, et al., 2018) after 25 years of function. Values fBIC-MG (Mean ± SE) (&quot;-&quot; for bone loss) were calculated, recorded and compared between all B and all SW, between all B and all SC and between all SW and all SC dental implant units in all three Configurations</description>

        <title>Comparison of Two Measurement Systems Used to Evaluate Peri-implant Bone Healing After 25 Years of Function</title>
        <description>Conventional peri-apical radiology and phosphor-plate digital technology (Digora System™, Digora OptimeTM, Sporedex Dental Co., Tuusula, Finland) were used with the standardized equipment to take peri-apical radiographs on 95 implant/abutment units (Camarda, et al., 2018; Bhaskaran, et al., 2005). Following calibration, the distance between the first-bone-to-implant-contact-point and the crestal-microgap (fBIC-MG) was measured (mm) at the mesial and distal aspects of each implant/abutment unit after 25 years of function. Values (Mean ± SE) fBIC-MG were recorded for each of the two measurement systems. ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, two-way, mixed effect model) and Bland-Altman Limits of agreement (Bland &amp; Altman, 1986) were used to evaluate the level of agreement between the two systems</description>
        <time_frame>After 25 years (24.6 ± 0.19 years, mean ± SE) of function</time_frame>
        <population>Each of the 22 participants contributed five implants for a total of 110 B=36, SW=38, SC=36) for all three configurations. However, only 95 implants (19 participants) were analyzed (B=32, SW=32, SC=31) for all three configurations in order to compare the two measurement systems. One implant (SW, Configuration 1) was fractured. Two implants (one B and one SW, both Configuration 2) had technical issues with radiographs. Twelve implants could not be measured due to participant refusal</population>
