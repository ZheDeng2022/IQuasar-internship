  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University Hospital Essen is sponsoring the Multicenter human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections Prevention Network Study (STIPnet) which is funded&#xD;
      by Janssen, Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STIPnet study is a prospective observational cohort study aiming to determine the incidence&#xD;
      and point prevalence of HIV infection and the most common sexually transmitted infections&#xD;
      (STIs) in individuals with sexual risk behavior. In addition, the University Hospital Essen&#xD;
      will examine whether individuals at risk for HIV and STI infections would retain in such a&#xD;
      study (retention rate) and would be willing to participate in potential HIV and STI&#xD;
      prevention trials (willingness to participate).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To develop and test novel prevention methods or interventions against sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections (STIs), knowledge is required on whether there are increased rates of transmission&#xD;
      in a given population. In order for trials testing new prevention methods to be feasible and&#xD;
      affordable, the goal is to define a group at risk where there will be at least an annual 3%&#xD;
      incidence of new infections of the respective STI. The group definitions will be based on&#xD;
      factors such as gender, age, sexual behavior, economic status and others. However, defining&#xD;
      such groups is labor-intensive and costly and often not do-able for vaccine developers and&#xD;
      developers of novel prevention/diagnostic methods. Thus, as identification and testing of the&#xD;
      most at-risk groups to study these medicinal products is too costly, only a limited number of&#xD;
      novel prevention methods are brought into clinical trials. Here the investigators plan to&#xD;
      define factors such as behavioral or co-infections associated with individual STIs for&#xD;
      potential future prevention trials. Given the increased susceptibility of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency (HIV) infection with STI infections, early diagnosis and treatment of STI is&#xD;
      substantial to reduce risk factor of HIV acquisition and to inform individuals about their&#xD;
      risk of becoming HIV infected. As STIs are a crucial factor in the scope of an incidence&#xD;
      analysis of HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM) and are often underdiagnosed, extensive&#xD;
      screening measures are implemented within this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the STIPnet study is building up a platform for effective recruitment, retention and&#xD;
      assess important epidemiological patterns and thus, designed as a vaccine preparedness study,&#xD;
      to gather information on the most common STIs and prepare sites for potential future vaccine&#xD;
      trials. Indeed, several potential HIV&amp;STI vaccines are currently in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At-risk volunteers are screened every three months for HIV and other STIs, thereby&#xD;
      establishing disease prevalence and incidence in communities that might someday support&#xD;
      future vaccine trials. Behavioural data are also collected and participants complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire that assesses the willingness to participate in future vaccine studies.&#xD;
