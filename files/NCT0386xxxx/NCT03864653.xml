    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, non-randomized pilot study. Eligible participants are newly&#xD;
      enrolled participants in an outpatient methamphetamine treatment program, and study&#xD;
      activities will take place contemporaneously with participation in the service program.&#xD;
      During the first two weeks of the treatment program, participants will be offered the chance&#xD;
      to enroll in a low-intensity, internet-based depression intervention called MoodGym.&#xD;
      Participants that agree to enroll will be offered the chance to attend up to seven MoodGym&#xD;
      sessions at the same time they undergo outpatient methamphetamine treatment. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that sexual risk outcomes, as well as medication adherence (e.g., PrEP/PEP; ART)&#xD;
      outcomes will be optimized for participants who enroll to receive the MoodGym intervention&#xD;
      content.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited from the Getting Off service program at Friends Community&#xD;
      Center. Program participants will be invited to participate in the study at the time that&#xD;
      they enroll in the program, and may enroll in the study at any time during their first or&#xD;
      second week of program participation. Getting Off program staff will inform new participants&#xD;
      about the research study. If the potential participant is interested in learning more about&#xD;
      the study he will be directed to meet with the Study Counselor. Both the program staff and&#xD;
      the SC will emphasize that participation in this study is voluntary and that participation in&#xD;
      the program is not dependent on participation in this study. Interested participants will&#xD;
      meet with the in a private room, then read the consent form, have questions answered by the,&#xD;
      and sign the consent form if they wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in-person contact (recruitment, screening, consenting, MoodGym sessions, and&#xD;
      administration of follow-up interviews) with participants will take place in a private room&#xD;
      with a closed door at Friends Community Center. Any telephone calls made to participants&#xD;
      during the course of the study will be made from a private office with a closed door, so the&#xD;
      phone conversation cannot be heard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MoodGym is an Internet-based CBT program that uses fun, engaging, interactive content,&#xD;
      alongside character-driven narratives, to help alleviate symptoms of depression and comorbid&#xD;
      anxiety. The program also aims to improve the individual's functioning by promoting the&#xD;
      development of skills and strategies to manage depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MoodGym consists of an introduction module, five structured intervention modules, and a&#xD;
      workbook of assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Getting Started&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. An introduction to MoodGym, including CBT, the different characters and structure of&#xD;
           the intervention content, and baseline mental health quizzes (e.g., depression, anxiety)&#xD;
           that are scored in real time to help the participant understand their current level of&#xD;
           mental health symptoms. This will be done during the first MoodGym session, given its&#xD;
           brevity and relationship to the first module.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feelings Module&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Understanding emotions, mood, and physical reactions of depression and anxiety, as&#xD;
           well as the impact of your perspective on your personal feelings. Demonstrates links&#xD;
           between events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thoughts Module&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Addresses unwelcome, unhealthy, or intrusive thoughts, and demonstrates how some&#xD;
           thoughts can help you overcome mental health symptoms. Discusses how to improve&#xD;
           self-esteem by changing thought patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unwarping Module&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Introduces the idea of &quot;warpy&quot; thoughts, including false impressions that one must be&#xD;
           perfect, that one can control all things, or that one is worthless if they are&#xD;
           criticized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Destressing Module&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Discusses means and strategies to reduce stress, which can have important impacts&#xD;
                on depression and anxiety symptoms, and mental health more generally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Relationships Module&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Discusses how relationships can both benefit or worsen one's mental health, and how&#xD;
           to monitor and maintain healthy relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Workbook a. Contains all quizzes and tests the participant encounters during each of the&#xD;
           above sessions. If a participant would like to retest themselves on some dimension&#xD;
           (e.g., depression, anxiety, warpy thoughts), they can revisit the assessment in the&#xD;
           Workbook section, and receive an updated score in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each MoodGym session will last up to one hour and will begin with the brief CESD-R&#xD;
      assessment, administered by the Study Counselor via the same computer as the MoodGym&#xD;
      intervention, followed by one of the five online modules, which are self-contained and guide&#xD;
      the participant through all intervention content. Online modules include quizzes, videos,&#xD;
      characters, interactive activities, informational content, personal stories, workbook&#xD;
      activities, and content summaries. Sessions can also include interactions with the Study&#xD;
      Counselor, as much or as little as the participant chooses to initiate, including supportive&#xD;
      feedback, guidance, help, and encouragement on activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SC will monitor participant attendance and conduct a phone call to any participant who&#xD;
      does not attend a session for two consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed one final time, receiving both the ART and PrEP Uptake and&#xD;
      Adherence form and the CESD-R, at 90 days post-enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>Depression symptoms are measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Revised; CESD-R) to begin each MoodGym session. The CESD-R consists of 20 items, each of which is a statement that participants are asked to endorse on a five-point scale from &quot;not at all or less than one day in the last week&quot; to &quot;nearly every day for two weeks.&quot; Scores range from 0 thru 80, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptomology. The outcome measure described below indicates the average change in CESD-R scores for each MoodGym session attended.</description>

    <description>A participant's self-reported adherence to ART (HIV-positive participants) or PrEP (HIV-negative participants) will be assessed via a short questionnaire. HIV-positive participants are asked if they are on an antiretroviral regimen (i.e., ART), and if so, when they began the regimen and their recent adherence patterns. HIV-negative participants are asked if they know what pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is, whether they are on PrEP, and if so, when they began the regimen.</description>

        <title>Depression Symptoms Over Time</title>
        <description>Depression symptoms are measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Revised; CESD-R) to begin each MoodGym session. The CESD-R consists of 20 items, each of which is a statement that participants are asked to endorse on a five-point scale from &quot;not at all or less than one day in the last week&quot; to &quot;nearly every day for two weeks.&quot; Scores range from 0 thru 80, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptomology. The outcome measure described below indicates the average change in CESD-R scores for each MoodGym session attended.</description>
