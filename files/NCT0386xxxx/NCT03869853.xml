  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over one-third of rural Ghanaians live below the poverty line and women and children living&#xD;
      in poverty are at the highest risk of poor nutrition and health. Sustained integrated&#xD;
      approaches that increase agricultural productivity and value addition, diversify incomes, and&#xD;
      enhance knowledge and skills among all stakeholders are required to improve the well-being of&#xD;
      rural communities. There exists a unique opportunity, building on the results of the&#xD;
      Nutrition Links (NL) project, to test sustainable district-level approaches that support&#xD;
      women agripreneurs and address existing gender inequities in rural Ghana. This project will&#xD;
      test different approaches to enhance the sustainability of activities that will (i) increase&#xD;
      access to resources and services for agricultural production and, where relevant, value&#xD;
      addition for women, (ii) facilitate access to markets that will enhance women's&#xD;
      entrepreneurship, and (iii) help district partners integrate targets and activities to meet a&#xD;
      common goal. The 3-y project will include quantitative and qualitative data collection to&#xD;
      implement a trial to test a sustainable approach for engaging female agripreneurs in farmers'&#xD;
      associations and improving their business successes, with different approaches to integrate&#xD;
      new activities in district institutions' programs. The project will be guided by the team of&#xD;
      institutions working together with district stakeholders to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      rural Ghanaian women agripreneurs and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project includes quantitative cross-sectional surveys, qualitative data collection, and&#xD;
      a randomized behavioural trial. The description of the study is shown below by specific&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objective 1. Identify (i) individual, (ii) organizational, and (iii)&#xD;
      social/community/institutional factors that facilitate or impede women's participation in&#xD;
      farming entrepreneur associations, and that can be modified through intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative hypothesis Women's enrolment and active participation in women farmer&#xD;
      entrepreneur associations is associated with individual characteristics (e.g.,&#xD;
      self-confidence) as well as organizational (e.g., having a functional association) and&#xD;
      social/community/institutional factors (e.g., having community leadership support to join)&#xD;
      that may be modifiable through interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research questions (i) What gender inequalities exist within the context of the&#xD;
      local organizations (e.g., meetings held in locations and times that are inconvenient for&#xD;
      women) and community/institutions (e.g., norms that prevent women from doing business in the&#xD;
      community) that have implications for the entrepreneurial activities and well-being of women&#xD;
      farmers? (ii) What organizational and community/institutional factors contributing to gender&#xD;
      inequalities are modifiable through interventions to improve women's entrepreneurial&#xD;
      activities and well-being?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1.1. Cross-sectional survey in contiguous districts. Data collection will be carried&#xD;
      out in the two districts contiguous to Upper Manya Krobo District (UMKD) to collect data&#xD;
      among members of four associations identified (20-30 women/group, total of approximately 100&#xD;
      women) as well as from their matched non-member neighbours (approximately 100 women of&#xD;
      similar non-modifiable characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific questions on facilitators and barriers about joining a farmers' association and&#xD;
      specific questions about perceived gender differences in access to resources and services&#xD;
      will be included. The results will identify modifiable factors that can then influence how&#xD;
      district-level service providers interact with women farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data. The analysis will test for the cluster effect of the association.&#xD;
      Unadjusted bivariate analyses will test the relationship between the outcome and possible&#xD;
      covariates using independent Student's t-test for continuous variables and Pearson's&#xD;
      Goodness-of-fit chi-squared for categorical variables and those with a p&lt;0.20 will be&#xD;
      included initially in the model. The investigators will use a logistic regression model with&#xD;
      standard errors corrected for clustering, using a backward elimination stepwise variable&#xD;
      selection procedure. Variables with a p-value of &lt; 0.10 will remain in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1.2. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Qualitative methods will be&#xD;
      used to examine gender inequalities at the institutional level. Of interest is the programs&#xD;
      and services that institutions provide and their influence on the lives and work of women&#xD;
      agripreneurs as well as institutional staff. The number of interviews and focus groups will&#xD;
      depend on reaching saturation; however, the investigators expect to conduct at least 6&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with institutional staff (both men and women) in each of the three&#xD;
      districts. The staff will be key informants selected based on their role or personal&#xD;
      knowledge about the existing associations and institutional responsibilities. The women will&#xD;
      be selected from the association membership and survey lists to represent different levels of&#xD;
      entrepreneurship. The focus group discussion and interviews will focus on (1) identifying&#xD;
      gender gaps in services and access to resources; (2) analyzing existing programs and how they&#xD;
      address the different needs of women and men; and (3) discussing policies and resource&#xD;
      allocation decisions and whether they support gender equality. The study interest is in the&#xD;
      perception of the staff on how their role with the programs and services for women is&#xD;
      assessed and valued within the institution and the barriers they face in supporting women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be followed up with four focus groups (~10 /group) with women farmer&#xD;
      entrepreneurs (two in UMKD and two in the two surrounding districts; total = 40 women) to&#xD;
      examine the gender institutional inequalities from the viewpoint of women agripreneurs. In&#xD;
      addition, women's perception of the role of their own empowerment (how they define&#xD;
      empowerment, understand its importance for their participation and entrepreneurial success,&#xD;
      view limitations to their or others' empowerment) and how this perception is linked to their&#xD;
      interactions with the institutions is of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data. The transcripts (about 28 hours of data) will be translated, coded and&#xD;
      analyzed using a content analysis approach with a priori and emerging themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective 2. Develop approaches that enhance both the improved outcomes of women&#xD;
      agripreneurs (knowledge, skills, and empowerment; entrepreneurial success; nutrition/health)&#xD;
      as well as improved outcomes for the institutional stakeholders (program&#xD;
      participation/clientele reached, effective/efficient service provided, staff knowledge and&#xD;
      skills, job satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2.1. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Qualitative methods will be&#xD;
      used to discuss with women and staff the value of incentives and their importance for&#xD;
      participation in associations. The selection of participants and the number of interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups have been described above in Study 1.2. The discussion for these questions with&#xD;
      both women and staff will focus on different types of incentives, their value to women, and&#xD;
      their value compared to the cost of participation at association meetings. With only staff,&#xD;
      the investigators will discuss different types of incentives that encourage staff to support&#xD;
      meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data. The analysis will be carried out as described under Study 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2.2. The project will develop approaches to support the training of women farmers&#xD;
      and facilitate continued education training of district staff to strengthen associations and&#xD;
      to enhance staff knowledge and skills to address local challenges that members face. The&#xD;
      investigators will carry out a formative assessment with interviews with staff and&#xD;
      administration on local training needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that some of the approaches may include activities to address the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) How can the district staff be incentivized to work with the women's association and&#xD;
      create demand for their services?; (2) How can the institution empower private sector&#xD;
      value-chain entrepreneurs to provide high quality information to women agripreneurs?; (4) How&#xD;
      can the bank better reach women agripreneurs?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will focus highly on the process evaluation to document what happens in each&#xD;
      tested approach, perceptions of what works/does not work, and the perception of&#xD;
      sustainability of the specific activity. The method of evaluation will depend on the specific&#xD;
      approach. Whenever possible, indicators that are regularly collected by the institution will&#xD;
      be used to assess the results (e.g., number of women agripreneurs assisted by the district&#xD;
      veterinarian). Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected, as is appropriate.&#xD;
      The specific approaches will be determined after the cross-sectional survey is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2.3. Two-arm randomized trial. The focus is to test an intervention that is feasible&#xD;
      within the context of permanent institutions, thus the package must be self-sustaining. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes of interest are (i) participation in the association, (ii) small business&#xD;
      economic outcomes, and (iii) women's well-being. The study includes women who are members of&#xD;
      women farmer associations in the three designated districts. The intervention will use&#xD;
      Heifer's Passing-on-the-Gift approach that could be replicated in the future without project&#xD;
      intervention. Women's groups will be randomly assigned to treatment (intervention, control)&#xD;
      and to a group cycle (1, 2). The weekly project activities (starting with Group 1) are&#xD;
      repeated over 4 months. At the end of the cycle of 4 months, Group 2 initiates the&#xD;
      intervention, using resources from the first group's &quot;passing on the gift®&quot; for the financial&#xD;
      base. The two groups alternate cycles so that over a 16-month period, group 1 and group 2&#xD;
      both receive the intervention package for 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the quantitative analysis, a case study approach will be used to examine women&#xD;
      agripreneurs and the role that the association had in their success. The first goal is to&#xD;
      develop a consensus on what is &quot;success&quot;. This will be obtained through focus group&#xD;
      discussions, examining the question: &quot;What would one expect to see in the life of a woman who&#xD;
      is doing well in her poultry business?&quot; The investigators will direct the discussion to&#xD;
      include women's empowerment, financial stability, and maternal and child well-being. Based on&#xD;
      the criteria developed on &quot;success&quot;, as well as the project's own criteria, the investigators&#xD;
      will identify among the association members the ten most successful and the ten &quot;less&#xD;
      successful&quot; entrepreneurs. The researchers will carry out in-depth interviews with the 20&#xD;
      women on life histories, experience with the association, and perceived successes, failures,&#xD;
      and obstacles. Additional interviews will be carried out with two household members and three&#xD;
      business colleagues per case to examine further the woman's experiences to have a complete&#xD;
      picture. Direct observation (~ 2 hr/visit) of each case at home and at her business location&#xD;
      will be carried out to have a full picture of the woman's activities, environment, and social&#xD;
      interactions in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, there is interest in understanding the pathways by which the outcomes of interest&#xD;
      are attained for women participating in associations. The project includes repeated surveys&#xD;
      (baseline, 8 months, 16 months) to analyze changes that occur with participation in&#xD;
      associations and allow us to estimate the means by which the associations influence lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data. The outcomes of interest from the randomized trial will all be continuous.&#xD;
      The data will come from a cluster-randomized trial. Unadjusted bivariate analyses will test&#xD;
      the relationship between the outcomes and possible covariates using independent Student's&#xD;
      t-test for continuous variables and Pearson's Goodness-of-fit chi-squared for categorical&#xD;
      variables and those with a p&lt;0.20 will be included initially in the model. The analysis will&#xD;
      use a multiple linear regression model with standard errors corrected for clustering, using a&#xD;
      backward elimination stepwise variable selection. Variables with a p-value of &lt; 0.10 will&#xD;
      remain in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the case studies will follow the process used by the team previously. The&#xD;
      focus groups and interviews will be translated and transcribed. There will be a systematic&#xD;
      review of the focus groups (and confirmed with the individual interviews) to identify&#xD;
      individual characteristics and factors that are associated with success. The next step is to&#xD;
      generate theoretical explanations of how success is achieved or not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content analysis of transcripts and observations will be employed to generate themes around&#xD;
      experiences that will be grouped into generalizations about successful women. While the focus&#xD;
      is on 'successful' women, data from the 'less successful' women will be used as a&#xD;
      counterfactual to cross-examine the data. The case studies will provide a rich understanding&#xD;
      of the factors that are needed to support women at different times of developing their small&#xD;
      businesses as well as the consequences for the woman and the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the repeated surveys on pathways will use repeated measures analysis. The&#xD;
      approach will be similar to that described above for the randomized trial outcome analysis.&#xD;
