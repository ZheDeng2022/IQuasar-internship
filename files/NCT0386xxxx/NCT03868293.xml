      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to investigate patient tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      moderate term, repeated exposure of Pulsed Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (PLIFUS) in&#xD;
      patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We hypothesize that the treatments will&#xD;
      be well-tolerated, subjects' EEGs will show improvement (fewer epileptiform discharges), and&#xD;
      that subjects will experience a reduction in seizure frequency as a result of the treatment&#xD;
      without adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of options for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, investigations into&#xD;
      alternative noninvasive treatments are warranted. PLIFUS has been shown to safely modulate&#xD;
      neuronal tissue, and is non-invasive and painless. Several human studies have shown that the&#xD;
      use of PLIFUS can suppress somatosensory evoked potentials and induce functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject is enrolled in the study, the subject will be scheduled for a standard brain&#xD;
      MRI scan at BWH if they have not had one in the last 3 months. The subject will be asked to&#xD;
      keep track of their seizure events in the Daily Seizure Log Diary from the screening visit&#xD;
      until 2 months after the last treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period will include 8 treatment sessions total. These will occur 2 days per&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks, each lasting approximately 1-2 hours, starting 1 month after seizure&#xD;
      logging begins.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of the proposed pilot study is to investigate patient efficacy of moderate term, repeated exposure of Pulsed Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (PLIFUS) in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy .We hypothesize that PLIFUS stimulation will result in mechanical disruption of the target tissue (here, the epileptogenic focus), preserving the integrity of the tissue but rendering it unable (or less able) to mount seizure activity for a period of time.&#xD;
We, therefore, will assess improvement in subjects' seizure frequency by evaluating seizure frequency during and 30 days after the treatment period relative to a 30 day pre-treatment baseline period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects at least eighteen (18) years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy whose seizures involve altered&#xD;
             awareness (ie failed at least two trials of antiepileptic drugs for seizures), as&#xD;
             determined by one of the BWH epilepsy neurologists based on clinical seizure semiology&#xD;
             and/or EEG findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who experience at least 1-2 seizures per month on average, are aware of or&#xD;
             have reliable caregivers who are aware of when seizures occur and can reliably log&#xD;
             seizure frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have the cognitive ability to read and understand the consent form,&#xD;
             describe any potential symptoms experienced during or after treatments.&#xD;
