        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either (1) a diagnosis of NB as defined by international&#xD;
             criteria,i.e.,histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM&#xD;
             metastases plus high urine catecholamine levels, or (2) high grade osteosarcoma&#xD;
             verified by histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology), or (3)&#xD;
             other GD2-expressing solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For tumors other than NB and osteosarcoma, only tumors known to be GD2 positive are&#xD;
             eligible: melanoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, retinoblastoma,&#xD;
             medulloblastoma, and soft tissue sarcomas including liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma,&#xD;
             malignant fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, and spindle cell sarcoma. Patients&#xD;
             with medulloblastoma are eligible only if they have metastatic disease outside the CNS&#xD;
             (e.g. in the bone marrow)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NB patients must have chemorefractory (e.g. refractory to standard induction&#xD;
             chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cisplatin, etoposide) or&#xD;
             relapsed high-risk (HR) neuroblastoma. HR NB is defined as MYCN-amplified stage 3/4/4S&#xD;
             of any age, or MYCNnonamplified stage 4 in patients &gt; 18 months of age at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteosarcoma patients must have relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma after receiving&#xD;
             standard systemic chemotherapy (e.g. combination methotrexate, doxorubicin, and&#xD;
             cisplatin [MAP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For non-NB and non-osteosarcoma tumors known to be GD2(+), patients must have relapsed&#xD;
             or refractory disease that is resistant to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NB patients must have chemo refractory or relapsed HR NB. HR NB is defined as&#xD;
             MYCNamplified stage 3/4/4S of any age, or MYCN-nonamplified stage 4 in patients &gt; 18&#xD;
             months of age at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of NB must be defined by international criteria i.e., histopathology&#xD;
             (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM metastases plus high urine&#xD;
             catecholamine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of high grade osteosarcoma defined by histopathology&#xD;
             (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma after receiving standard&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy (e.g. combination methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin&#xD;
             [MAP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All criteria below are common to both phase I and phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For NB patients, patients must have measurable or evaluable disease (e.g. abnormal&#xD;
             findings in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan, or positron emission tomography (PET)) OR&#xD;
             morphologic evidence of disease in bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For osteosarcoma or other GD2(+) solid tumor patients, patients must have measurable&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

             titer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematopoietic function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥500/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥25,000/ul&#xD;

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must be willing to practice an effective method of&#xD;
             birth control while on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this&#xD;
             program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are in complete remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing severe major organ dysfunction. i.e. renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic,&#xD;
             pulmonary, or gastrointestinal toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for hearing loss, alopecia,&#xD;
             anorexia, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia or hypomagnesemia from TPN, which may be Grade 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematologic and active CNS malignancies including CNS metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active life-threatening infection.&#xD;

             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or immunotherapy within three weeks prior to study enrollment. T-cell&#xD;
             based immunotherapies (e.g. CAR-modified T cells, checkpoint inhibitors) should have&#xD;
