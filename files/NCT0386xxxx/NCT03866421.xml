    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in&#xD;
      developed countries affecting approximately 30 % of the general adult population. It&#xD;
      represents an important pathogenic factor in the development of type 2-diabetes and is&#xD;
      associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Previous studies of patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) have demonstrated an increased risk for NAFLD and the presence&#xD;
      of both CKD and NAFLD is likely to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol describes a study of the prevalence and etiology of NAFLD among patients&#xD;
      scheduled for kidney transplantation and the possible effect of kidney transplantation on&#xD;
      NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a prospective cohort study. The effect of kidney transplantation in patients&#xD;
      with prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance compared to healthy controls will be examined&#xD;
      regarding development and progression of fat accumulation in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat accumulation in the liver will be determined by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and&#xD;
      the prevalence of NAFLD in the two groups will be investigated. A continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) for four days, Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning, fibro&#xD;
      scanning of the liver, bile acid analysis, metabolomic and lipidomic analysis will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an intra venous glucose infusion (IIGI) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in&#xD;
      developed countries affecting approximately 30 % of the general adult population. The disease&#xD;
      is defined by an increased fat accumulation in the liver cells (&gt;5 %), not caused by&#xD;
      excessive alcohol intake (a threshold of 20 g per day for women and 30 g per day for men),&#xD;
      autoimmunity, drugs or viral hepatitis. The histological spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple&#xD;
      steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis defined as steatosis&#xD;
      without injury of the hepatocytes in form of ballooning and NASH defined as the presence of&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis and inflammation with ballooned hepatocytes with or without fibrosis. The&#xD;
      degree of fibrosis is an important prognostic factor and is related to liver related&#xD;
      complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Furthermore,&#xD;
      more than 25 % of patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) have&#xD;
      pre-diabetic characteristics such as impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.&#xD;
      NAFLD represents an important pathogenic factor in the development of type 2-diabetes and is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of patients with CKD with/without diabetes demonstrated, with less sensitive&#xD;
      ultrasonic methods than what the investigators plan to use in the present project, a high&#xD;
      prevalence of NAFLD. Furthermore, the presence of both NAFLD and CKD is likely to increase&#xD;
      the risk for cardiovascular diseases and mortality, particular among overweight patients.&#xD;
      NAFLD is present in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with ESRD. The co-existence of&#xD;
      CKD, NAFLD and gluco-metabolic disturbances, including diabetes, is a research topic with&#xD;
      increasing focus on. Co-morbidities in CKD such as impaired insulin sensitivity, diabetes,&#xD;
      impaired calcium-phosphate metabolism, hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia constitute risk&#xD;
      factors for NAFLD. Unfortunately, several treatments of CKD, including kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, have been shown to impair lipid metabolism and increase insulin resistance&#xD;
      especially in the liver. Importantly, lifestyle changes and medical treatment modalities have&#xD;
      been shown to have only minor impact on reducing the prevalence of these disturbances in&#xD;
      patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with NAFLD, either due to metabolic stress (obesity) or toxic substances&#xD;
      (immunosuppressive treatment), liver damage and the impact on insulin resistance is reflected&#xD;
      in characteristic modifications of metabolites and lipids in liver tissue, as well as in&#xD;
      circulating blood, which may help to identify and interpret the pathogenesis of liver damage&#xD;
      in the setting of CKD and transplantation. One recent hypothesis for linking liver damage and&#xD;
      CKD involves a change in gut microbiota due to impaired renal function, leading to a leaky&#xD;
      gut with damage of the gut-blood barrier. This transfers gut microbiota metabolites to the&#xD;
      blood, leading to a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, reflected in changes in lipidomic&#xD;
      and metabolomic profile in the blood. Such changes have in other conditions been associated&#xD;
      with insulin resistance and have been linked to liver damage leading to NAFLD and later&#xD;
      potentially fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of bile acids and entero-endocrinology (including the incretin hormones glucagon&#xD;
      like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)) in the&#xD;
      development of NAFLD in CKD patients remains unknown. There are also clear limitations of the&#xD;
      current knowledge of NAFLD and its potential role in gluco-metabolic changes and new-onset&#xD;
      diabetes often seen after kidney transplantation. Delineation of these issues may provide new&#xD;
      treatment targets for the benefit of patients. Risk factors for NAFLD among patients with CKD&#xD;
      have only been investigated in small-scale studies with often inadequate methods. No studies&#xD;
      have investigated the impact of fat lipid content measured by MR spectroscopy in kidney&#xD;
      transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New therapeutic strategies for the diagnosis and management of NAFLD in patients with CKD and&#xD;
      kidney transplanted patients with prediabetes are needed and important challenges in the&#xD;
      elucidation of the etiology, pathogenesis and prevalence of NAFLD in CKD and transplanted&#xD;
      patients exist. Thus, this project will bring new knowledge among a group of patients with&#xD;
      high morbidity and an increased risk of mortality - a knowledge that may provide new&#xD;
      guidelines for prevention and treatment of NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to investigate the effect of kidney transplantation&#xD;
      compared to healthy control persons, on the development and progression of the fat&#xD;
      accumulation by MR spectroscopy and the monitoring of the glucometabolic, enteroendocrine,&#xD;
      lipidomic and metabolomic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplanted patients with previous prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance will be&#xD;
      examined. The fat accumulation in the liver will be measured by MR spectroscopy and the&#xD;
      prevalence of NAFLD will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, secondary objectives are to investigate changes in lipodomic and metabolomic&#xD;
      related profiles, insulin secretion and sensitivity, secretion and content of bile acids,&#xD;
      GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and amino acids before transplantation compared to after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in relative liver fat values before and&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation. The alternative hypothesis is that there is an increase by 50%&#xD;
      in relative liver fat values measured by MR spectroscopy after kidney transplantation&#xD;
      compared to pre-transplant values. In the literature a prevalence of NAFLD of 60-70% in type&#xD;
      2- diabetic patients defined by a liver fat content above 6% is known. With an estimated&#xD;
      standard deviation of 15% a two-sided t-test with α=0.05 and power of 80%, a sample size of&#xD;
      16 patients in a paired design is needed to demonstrate a difference between the time points&#xD;
      of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study and data completion the results are analysed according to&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints. Results are reported as mean values with confidence interval&#xD;
      or median and range. Data are analysed with parametric (normally distributed data) or&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics (non-normal distributed data). A 95 % confidence interval is&#xD;
      accepted as statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be pseudo anonymised.&#xD;
