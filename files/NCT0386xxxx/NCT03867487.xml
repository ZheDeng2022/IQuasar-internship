    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specifically designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the preliminary feasibility, initial efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors for&#xD;
      treating NAFLD in adolescents with obesity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and obtain a preliminary&#xD;
      estimate of efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in adolescents with&#xD;
      obesity (BMI-percentile ≥95th) who have MRI-confirmed NAFLD (hepatic fat fraction ≥ 5.5%) and&#xD;
      have normal fasting glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take empagliflozin, once daily, in the morning, with or without food, in&#xD;
      addition to receiving lifestyle/behavioral counseling throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected throughout the course of the study: Physical exam with&#xD;
      tanner staging, safety and fasting labs, fasting blood draw (biomarkers), urine sample, stool&#xD;
      sample, OGTT, CGM sensor placement and removal, MRI scan (MRS-Liver), BMI/anthropometrics,&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test for female participants, iDXA scan (body fat and bone density), arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and blood pressure.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy as Measured by Change in Hepatic Fat Fraction (HFF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HFF is measured by MRI via 1H- magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). HFF will be measured with single-voxel 1H-MRS on a 3.0 T Trio whole body MRI scanner, using the software package provided by the vendor. The MR elastography measurement will consist of a phase-contrast 2D GRE scan (TR/TE = 50/25 ms, matrix 256 x 90, GRAPPA R=3, slice thickness 7mm) with motion encoding in the z-direction, and acoustic excitation at 60 Hz. Four axial slices will be acquired, each with a single breath-hold. Manual ROIs covering the liver will be drawn on the stiffness maps (in kPa units) generated by the system software. Fibrosis staging will be determined following previously published guidelines.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Measurements: Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Height and weight will be measured using a calibrated, wall-mounted stadiometer and an electronic scale, respectively. Three consecutive height and weight measurements will be obtained and averaged. BMI will be calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters, squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Measurements: Body Fat %</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total percent body fat mass and lean muscle mass will be determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Healthcare). Body fat percentage is calculated by body fat mass divided by the sum of fat and lean masses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Measurements: Visceral Fat %</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total body fat mass and visceral fat mass will be determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Healthcare). Visceral fat percentage of total body mass is calculated by visceral fat mass divided by the sum of total fat and lean masses. Visceral fat percentage of total fat mass is calculated by visceral fat mass divided by total fat mass.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Biomarkers of NAFLD: Alanine transaminase (ALT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting (≥12 hours) blood will be collected for the measurement of ALT at Fairview Diagnostics Laboratories, Fairview-University Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN - a Center for Disease Control and Prevention certified laboratory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Biomarkers of NAFLD: Cytokeratin (CK)-18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting plasma samples will be used to measure CK-18 via Luminex Multiplex platform (Millipore, St. Louis, MO).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure measurements will be obtained manually on the same arm using the same cuff size and equipment. Standardized procedures will be employed as described in previously published standards. Individual cuff size will be determined by measuring the arm circumference midway between the acromial process and the bony olecranon. Sitting blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the participant has been resting quietly without legs crossed for 10 minutes. Measurements will be made three consecutive times (3-minute intervals). The final two of three independent measurements will be averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Arterial Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid- and femoral artery augmentation index and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be measured by the SphygmoCor® MM3 system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Augmentation index is a measure of the relative magnitude of the reflected (or retrograde) pulse wave early in the cardiac cycle. Higher values of augmentation index represent increased arterial stiffening. PWV will be calculated as distance divided by transit time. Since pulse wave transit time decreases in stiffer arterial segments, higher values of pulse wave velocity represent increased arterial stiffness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glycemic Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After fasting measures are completed, we will perform a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with fasting (-15 and 0-min) and serial postprandial (15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, 90-, and 120-minutes) plasma concentrations of glucose (glucose oxidase, YSI INC., Yellow Sprigs, OH) and insulin (ELISA, ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, NH) measured after administration of a 75g glucose challenge. Samples will be batched and a stored for analysis at the completion of the study. Insulin sensitivity will be estimated by the whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) using plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) from MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A proton density fat fraction (PDFF) image will be acquired using LiverLab's &quot;qdixon&quot; imaging acquisition (3D gradient echo, TR=9ms, flip angle=4°, TE=1.15, 2.46, 3.69, 4.92, 6.15, 7.38 ms, 2x2x3.5mm resolution, one 17s breath-hold). The MRS measurement of HFF will be used as the primary metric. As a secondary endpoint we will use PDFF which has shown promise as a measure of fibrosis staging compared to liver biopsy in children.</description>
