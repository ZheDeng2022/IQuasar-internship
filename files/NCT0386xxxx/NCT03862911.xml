  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a modern RT technique that delivers high doses&#xD;
      of radiation to small tumor targets using highly conformal techniques. SABR is non-invasive&#xD;
      and delivered on an outpatient basis. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of&#xD;
      SABR, relative to standard of care (SOC) alone, on overall survival, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, toxicity, and quality of life. An integrated economic evaluation will determine the&#xD;
      cost per quality of life year gained using SABR (vs. SOC) and a translational component will&#xD;
      enable identification of predictive/prognostic biomarkers of the oligometastatic state.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Standard Arm (Arm 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy for patients in the standard arm should follow the principles of palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy as per the individual institution, with the goal of alleviating symptoms or&#xD;
      preventing imminent complications. Patients in this arm should not receive stereotactic doses&#xD;
      or radiotherapy boosts. Recommended dose fractionations in this arm will include 8 Gy in 1&#xD;
      fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and 30 Gy in 10 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic therapy will be pre-specified based on the standard of care approach for that&#xD;
      patient, and it may include systemic therapy (cytotoxic, targeted, hormonal, or&#xD;
      immunotherapy) or observation. See section 6.3 for the timing of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Experimental Arm (Arm 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose/Fractionation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment recommendations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung: Tumors 5 cm or less surrounded by lung parenchyma: 48 Gy in 4 fractions (12 Gy/#), 54&#xD;
      Gy in 3 fractions (18 Gy/#), daily or every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung: Within 2 cm of mediastinum or brachial plexus 60 Gy in 8 fractions (7.5 Gy/#) daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone: Any bone 35 Gy in 5 fractions (7 Gy/#), 24 Gy in 2 fractions (12 Gy/#), daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain: Stereotactic lesions (no whole brain RT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;2cm 20-24 Gy in 1 fraction (20-24 Gy/#) Once&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 cm 18 Gy in 1 fraction (18 Gy/#) Once&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-4cm 15 Gy in 1 fraction (15 Gy/#) Once&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastases only: 35Gy 5 7 Gy to PTV Daily, Whole brain + Mets: 35Gy to metastases 5 7 Gy to&#xD;
      PTV Daily, 20 Gy whole brain 4 Gy WBRT Daily,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver: 54 Gy in 3 fractions (18 Gy/#), every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenal: 40 Gy in 5 fractions (8 Gy/#), daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph Node: 40 Gy in 5 fractions (8 Gy/#), daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.1 Immobilization Treatment will be setup using reproducible positioning and verified&#xD;
      using an on-line protocol for all patients in this study. Immobilization may include a custom&#xD;
      immobilization device, such as thermoplastic shell or vacuum bag, as per individual&#xD;
      institutional practice when delivering SABR. Some centers do not use immobilization devices&#xD;
      and have demonstrated high degrees of accuracy; this is acceptable in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.2 Imaging/Localization/Registration All patients in Arm 2 will undergo planning CT&#xD;
      simulation. 4-dimensional CT will be used for tumors in the lungs, liver, or adrenals. Axial&#xD;
      CT images will be obtained throughout the region of interest. For centres using stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery platforms, real-time tumor tracking and orthogonal imaging systems are&#xD;
      permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.3 4D-CT Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients undergoing 4D-CT, physics will review the 4D-CT images and will perform the&#xD;
      following quality assurance procedures indicated on the 4D-CT template designed specifically&#xD;
      for SABR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Ensure all end inspiration (0%) tags exist and are in the right place. This ensures image&#xD;
      integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) If the quality of the 4D-CT images is not sufficient (determined by Physics), then&#xD;
      standard 3D-CT will be performed on the fast helical CT or Untagged Average CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Motion measurements in all 3 directions are performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the motion is less than or equal to 7 mm and the good quality images exist, then&#xD;
           treatment planning may be performed on the Untagged Average CT with the 50% or 60% phase&#xD;
           (End Expiration) and the 0% phase being fused to it. This will define the IGTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the motion is greater than 7 mm in any one direction, then respiratory-gated&#xD;
           radiotherapy can be considered. In this case, treatment planning will be performed on a&#xD;
           subset average CT dataset (usually labeled either 30%-60% Avg CT or 40%-70% Avg CT)&#xD;
           generated by Physics. This is an average CT over the intended gated interval. Therefore,&#xD;
           the GTV that is delineated on this scan will incorporate residual motion in the intended&#xD;
           gated interval. The 0% phase will also be fused to this dataset. The PTV for planning&#xD;
           will include the GTV delineated on the subset average CT plus margins for microscopic&#xD;
           extension (Physician's discretion) and setup uncertainty. The GTV_0% should also be&#xD;
           delineated and combined with the GTV delineated on the subset average CT to define an&#xD;
           additional volume labeled IGTV_CBCT. This contour may be used for image registration&#xD;
           with CBCT only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.4 Volume Definitions (Arm 2) For all lesions, the gross tumor volume (GTV) will be&#xD;
      defined as the visible tumor on CT and/or MRI imaging +/- PET. No additional margin will be&#xD;
      added for microscopic spread of disease (i.e. Clinical Target Volume [CTV]=GTV). For bone&#xD;
      lesions, CTV of 3-5mm will be allowed. For vertebral lesions, anatomic approach will be taken&#xD;
      as per International Spinal consortium guideline (Cox 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anatomic approach is taken to the CTV based on where the disease within the spinal segment&#xD;
      is located. The rules for CTV are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the vertebral body is involved with GTV then the entire vertebral body is taken as&#xD;
           CTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the ipsilateral pedicle and/or transverse process has GTV then the entire ipsilateral&#xD;
           posterior segment (pedicle, lamina and transverse process) ±the spinous process is taken&#xD;
           into the CTV. The inclusion of the spinous process is per the discretion of the&#xD;
           radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the ipsilateral pedicle, lamina, and/or transverse process has GTV, then the entire&#xD;
           ipsilateral posterior segment (pedicle, lamina, and transverse process) plus the spinous&#xD;
           process is taken into the CTV&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If bilateral involvement of the pedicle and/or transverse process with GTV, then the&#xD;
           posterior segment anatomy ± the spinous process is taken into the CTV. The inclusion of&#xD;
           the spinous process is per the discretion of the radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If bilateral involvement of the pedicles and lamina, and/or transverse process with GTV,&#xD;
           then the entire posterior segment anatomy is taken into the CTV, including the spinous&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the spinous process is involved with GTV alone then the bilateral lamina ± pedicles&#xD;
           are to be taken into the CTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Spinal Consortium Guideline is a reference for CTV delineation (Cox 2012)&#xD;
      and can be adhered to as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of epidural disease, a 5 mm anatomic margin (excluding the spinal cord) beyond&#xD;
      the GTV may be used within the epidural compartment including in the cranio-caudal direction.&#xD;
      A circumferential CTV as per a donut based CTV is allowed and encouraged in the case of&#xD;
      epidural disease at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. If paraspinal&#xD;
      disease present, a minimum 5 mm CTV margin may be applied beyond the GTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin of 2-5 mm will be added depending on site of disease,&#xD;
      immobilization, and institutional set-up accuracy: 2-3 mm margins should be used for spinal&#xD;
      stereotactic treatments, 0-2 mm for brain tumors, and 5 mm for other sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targets should be named based on the organ involved, and numbered from cranially to caudally.&#xD;
      For example, in a patient with 3 lung lesions, there would be: GTV_lung_1, GTV_lung_2, and&#xD;
      GTV_lung_3, and corresponding PTV_lung_1, PTV_lung_2_, and PTV_lung_3, representing the&#xD;
      lesions from superior to inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For spinal lesions, a pre-treatment MRI is required to assess the extent of disease and&#xD;
      position of the cord. This must be fused with the planning CT scan. A Planning Organ at Risk&#xD;
      Volume (PRV) expansion of 2 mm will be added to the spinal cord, and dose constraints for the&#xD;
      spinal cord apply to this PRV. Alternatively, the thecal sac may be used as the PRV. For&#xD;
      radiosurgery platforms, a PRV margin of 1 mm is permitted for the spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ At Risk (OAR) Doses OAR doses are listed in Appendix 1 of protocol. OAR doses may not&#xD;
      be exceeded except in the case of chestwall / ribs. In cases where the PTV coverage cannot be&#xD;
      achieved without exceeding OAR doses, the PTV coverage is to be compromised. All serial&#xD;
      organised OARs within 5 cm of the PTV must be contoured (partial organ contours allowed); for&#xD;
      parallel organised organs (liver, lung, etc.) within 5cm of PTV, the whole organs need to be&#xD;
      contoured. This should be tested for each PTV by creating a 5 cm expansion to examine which&#xD;
      OARs lie within that expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Planning Treatment can be delivered using static beams (either 3D-conformal&#xD;
      radiotherapy or intensity-modulated) or rotational therapy (volumetric modulated arc therapy,&#xD;
      or tomotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose constraints may not be exceeded (except chestwall/ribs). If a dose constraint cannot be&#xD;
      achieved due to overlap of the target with an organ at risk, the fractionation can be&#xD;
      increased or the target coverage compromised in order to meet the constraint. In cases where&#xD;
      the target coverage or dose must be reduced, the priority for dose coverage is the GTV (e.g.&#xD;
      attempt to cover as much of the GTV as possible with the prescription dose). All such cases&#xD;
      of dose reduction or target coverage compromise must be approved by the local PI prior to&#xD;
      treatment. For vertebral tumors, note that the spinal cord constraints apply to the PRV (see&#xD;
      section 6.2.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all targets, doses should be prescribed to 60-90% isodose line surrounding the PTV, and&#xD;
      all hotspots should fall within the GTV. 95% of the PTV should be covered by the prescription&#xD;
      dose, and 99% of the PTV should be covered by 90% of the prescription dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses must be corrected for tissue inhomogeneities. Several non-overlapping 6/10 MV beams (on&#xD;
      the order of 7-11 beams) or 1-2 VMAT arcs combined possibly with a few non-coplanar beams&#xD;
      should be utilized. Non-coplanar beams can be used to reduce 50% isodose volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of isocentres is at the discretion of the treating physician, physicists, and&#xD;
      dosimetrists. Generally, metastases can be treated with separate isocenters if they are&#xD;
      well-separated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scheduling and sequence of treating each metastasis is at the discretion of individual&#xD;
      physicians, but in general should begin with the brain, due to risks associated with&#xD;
      progression. All SABR must be completed within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.5 Quality Assurance (Arm 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure patient safety and effective treatment delivery, a robust quality&#xD;
      assurance protocol is incorporated. The following requirements must be completed for each&#xD;
      patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to treatment, each patient must be discussed at quality assurance (QA) rounds or&#xD;
           be peer reviewed by a radiation oncologist with SABR expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All radiotherapy plans must meet target dose levels for organs at risk (except&#xD;
           chestwall/ribs) (Appendix 1). Prior to plan approval, the dose to each organ at risk&#xD;
           must be verified by the physicist or treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All dose delivery for intensity-modulated plans (including arc-based treatments) will be&#xD;
           confirmed before treatment by physics staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.6 Systemic Therapy Patients treated with prior systemic therapy are eligible for this&#xD;
      study, however, no chemotherapy agents (cytotoxic, or molecularly targeted agents) are&#xD;
      allowed within the period of time commencing 2 weeks prior to radiation lasting until 1 week&#xD;
      after the last fraction. Hormonal therapy is allowed. Use of chemotherapy schemes containing&#xD;
      potent enhancers of radiation damage (e.g. gemcitabine, doxorubicin, bevacizumab, adriamycin)&#xD;
      are discouraged within the first month after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.7 Further radiotherapy for progressive disease at new metastatic sites Patients in Arm&#xD;
      1 who develop new, untreated metastatic deposits should be treated with standard-of-care&#xD;
      approaches. SABR to those sites is not permitted, except for unique scenarios where it would&#xD;
      be considered standard of care (e.g. all disease controlled on systemic therapy with a newly&#xD;
      developed brain metastasis). Apart from brain metastases, treatment of 'oligo-progression'&#xD;
      with SABR is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm 2 who develop new, untreated metastatic deposits should be considered for&#xD;
      SABR at those sites, if such deposits can be treated safely with SABR, and if the treating&#xD;
      institution offers SABR for that body site. If SABR is not possible, then palliative RT can&#xD;
      be delivered if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2.8 Quality Assurance for Centres Joining Study Prior to opening the study, each&#xD;
      participating research centre will be required to send to one of the Principal Investigators&#xD;
      a mock treatment plan for the anatomic sites that will be treated (e.g. Lung, brain, liver,&#xD;
      adrenal), to ensure that the treatment plans are designed in compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
      The principal investigators will provide pertinent CT datasets. Each participating research&#xD;
      centre can choose which tumor sites will be treated at their individual centre (i.e. some&#xD;
      centres may only choose to treat a subset of the eligible metastatic sites). Sites that have&#xD;
      prior accreditation for SABR through a clinical trial (e.g. SABR-COMET, or organ-specific&#xD;
      SABR trials) are exempt from this requirement for the organ sites that have been accredited&#xD;
      in those trials.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history and physical exam, including ECOG performance status, performed within 6&#xD;
             weeks prior to trial enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has had a CT chest, abdomen and pelvis or PET-CT within 8 weeks of enrollment,&#xD;
             and with 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             with 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If solitary lung nodule for which biopsy is unsuccessful or not possible, patient has&#xD;
             had an FDG PET scan or CT (chest, abdomen, pelvis) and bone scan within 8 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment, and with 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If colorectal primary with rising CEA, but equivocal imaging, patient has had an FDG&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is judged able to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maintain a stable position during therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test for Women of Child-Bearing potential (WOCB) within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             RT start date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete Blood Count (CBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaires, and other&#xD;
             assessments that are a part of this study, using REDCap and therefore has provided&#xD;
             their email address on the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous SABR to the lesion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion in femoral bone requiring surgical fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy agents (cytotoxic, or molecularly targeted agents) will be used within&#xD;
             the period of time commencing 2 weeks prior to radiation, lasting until 1 week after&#xD;
             the last fraction for patients randomized to SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy. These include interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease in patients requiring thoracic radiation, Crohn's disease in patients where&#xD;
             the GI tract will receive radiotherapy, and connective tissue disorders such as lupus&#xD;
             or scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial overlap with a previously treated radiation volume. Prior radiotherapy in&#xD;
             general is allowed, as long as the composite plan meets dose constraints herein. For&#xD;
             patients treated with conventional radiation previously, biological effective dose&#xD;
             calculations should be used to equate previous doses to the tolerance doses listed&#xD;
             below. All such cases should be discussed with one of the study PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of poor lung function (if treating near lung)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of poor liver function (if treating near liver)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to treat all sites of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum size of 6 cm for lesions outside the brain, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone metastases over 6 cm may be included, if in the opinion of the local PI it&#xD;
                  can be treated safely (e.g. rib, scapula, pelvis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any brain metastasis &gt;3 cm in size or a total volume of brain metastases greater&#xD;
                  than 30 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or radiologic evidence of spinal cord compression, or epidural tumor within&#xD;
             &lt;2 mm of the spinal cord. Patients can be eligible if surgical resection has been&#xD;
             performed, but the surgical site counts toward the total of up to 3 metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dominant brain metastasis requiring surgical decompression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women&#xD;
