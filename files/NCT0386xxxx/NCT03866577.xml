    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of M254 after administration of a single ascending dose and repeat doses in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. The pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of the drug will be measured as platelet response in patients with ITP.&#xD;
