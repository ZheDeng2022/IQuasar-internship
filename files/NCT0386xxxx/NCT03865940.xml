  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) identified an association between a loss of&#xD;
      function variant in the human alpha 2B adrenergic receptor gene and trigeminal nerve&#xD;
      disorders. Guanfacine is the oldest alpha-2 adrenergic agonist in clinical use and is&#xD;
      approved for hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      guanfacine will be an effective adjunct to lidocaine for the treatment of neuropathic pain by&#xD;
      enhancing and prolonging pain relief due to its activation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
      The objectives of the study will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guanfacine in&#xD;
      combination with lidocaine for trigeminal nerve block procedures for pain management in&#xD;
      trigeminal neuralgia patients. This study will evaluate the efficacy of guanfacine in&#xD;
      reducing acute pain and extending duration of pain relief when delivered in combination with&#xD;
      lidocaine as a trigeminal nerve block, measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) data collected&#xD;
      at specific time points after each injection.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health version 1.2 [health-related quality of life] includes 10 questions and measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. All items, except for the rating of pain, use a 1-5 rating, with higher ratings corresponding with better outcomes. The pain item will be recoded from a 1-10 scale to convert to a 1-5 scale, with higher ratings corresponding to better outcomes. The remaining two items (general health and social roles) are not used to calculate summary scores; these two questions use a 1-5 rating, with higher ratings corresponding with better outcomes. The raw scores for Physical Health and Mental Health will comprise a sum of the numerical responses for the four questions in each group. T scores will be calculated, with higher T scores corresponding with better outcomes.</description>
