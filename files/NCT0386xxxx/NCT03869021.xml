      Objectives: Distraction Osteogenesis is an integral part in management of mandibular defects&#xD;
      associated with Hemifacial Microsomia (HFM) and post-ankylotic mandibular defects. The most&#xD;
      difficult part in distraction osteogenesis is the prediction of distraction vector and risk&#xD;
      of injury to vital structures as inferior alveolar. The current study aimed to present&#xD;
      Three-Dimensionally Constructed Computer Guided Splints in Distraction Osteogenesis to get an&#xD;
      ideal vector and minimal risk of vital structures injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study presents computer-guided distraction osteogenesis surgery using&#xD;
      prefabricated splints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study was performed on a case control trial of patients complaining of hemifacial&#xD;
      microsomia.. The research was reviewed by the ethical committee of the authors institute&#xD;
      (approval number: 392, date: 30/12/2015). Written informed consent for the case to be&#xD;
      published (incl. images, case history and data) was obtained from the patients for&#xD;
      publication of this case report, including accompanying images In order to accurately analyse&#xD;
      the patients' condition and formulate an optimal treatment plan, a pre-operative CBCT scan&#xD;
      was performed using i-CAT CBCT scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, PA, U.S.A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient was positioned in the machine and imaged at the same manner according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of CBCT manufacturer. The Frankfurt plane was positioned parallel to the&#xD;
      horizontal plane and the midsagittal plane was perpendicular to the horizontal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBCT scan was required to fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Showing the full bony facial structures, extending from at least the inferior border of&#xD;
           the mandible to the supraorbital ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT scan should be free from any motion artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient biting on cotton rolls in order to free the occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan of optimum quality and resolution. (0.25 mm voxel size) IV. Virtual Treatment&#xD;
           Planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data from the CBCT scan were exported from the i-CAT Vision software in DICOM&#xD;
           format, which was in turn imported into Mimics Medical 19.0 software (Materialise NV,&#xD;
           Technologielaan 15, 3001 Leuven, Belgium) for virtual treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the &quot;Thresholding&quot; tool, the range of gray value sets is chosen to highlight the&#xD;
           mineralized structures and separate them from the rest of soft tissue structures in the&#xD;
           scan creating a new mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the &quot;Calculate 3D&quot; tool on the new mask, a 3D rendering of the facial mineralized&#xD;
           structures is created and is then refined using the &quot;Smoothing&quot; and &quot;Wrap&quot; tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to properly orient the patient's head position, analyze the deficiencies, and&#xD;
           standardize the planning process, the Frankfort Horizontal plane and the Midsagittal&#xD;
           plan were constructed. Frankfort Horizontal Plane was defined by marking the right and&#xD;
           left Orbitale, and the Porion of the non-affected side. The Midsagittal plane was&#xD;
           defined by marking the Sella, the Nasion, and the Anterior Nasal Spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the &quot;Multiple Slice Edit&quot; and &quot;Region Growing&quot; tools when needed, the jaws are&#xD;
           separated and the mandible and maxilla are segmented separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the &quot;Distraction Wizard&quot;, an appropriate distraction type is selected. A&#xD;
           distractor is selected and placed on the proposed site for distraction. The osteotomy&#xD;
           and vector are visualized and the distractor is activated. This process is repeated&#xD;
           until the final outcome is satisfactory. The ideal final outcome is when the canted&#xD;
           occlusal plane is corrected and the mandibular midline is coincident with the facial&#xD;
           midline simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the &quot;Cylinder&quot; tool in the &quot;Medcad&quot; menu, virtual distractor pins and osteotomy&#xD;
           disk are drawn to match our selected custom-made distractor. The number of pins, their&#xD;
           size, and orientation differed according to the vital structures in each distraction&#xD;
           site. Hence, custom-made distractors were used. Guide fixation screws are also added to&#xD;
           provide further retention for the guide when needed. The fixation screws, osteotomy and&#xD;
           distractor pins are placed so as to avoid injury to any vital structures as the Inferior&#xD;
           Alveolar Nerve, tooth buds, and dental roots .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using different Boolean operation, the body of the final guide is designed to fit over&#xD;
           the bones and teeth and incorporate the different distractor components. It is then&#xD;
           exported into STL format.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The exported STL file is printed with Formlabs Form 2 stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer&#xD;
           (Formlabs Inc. Somerville, MA 02143 USA) using Clear Photopolymer resin (FLGPCL02). The&#xD;
           finished printed model is then checked for fit with the distractor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to surgery, the guide is submerged in a basin containing 2.4% activated&#xD;
           glutaraldehyde solution (Cidex) for 20 minutes for high level disinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient was placed in supine position. General anesthesia was administered through&#xD;
           Naso-Tracheal intubation. A cannula was inserted in a peripheral vein (18G) and normal&#xD;
           saline infusion was started at a rate of 6 ml/kg along with Ringer's solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia was induced with IV propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1.3 Î¼/kg and succinyl&#xD;
           choline 1mg/kg to facilitate nasotracheal intubation using armored tube. Anesthesia was&#xD;
           maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and atracurium in a dose of 0.3-0.6 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgical sites were prepared with povidone iodine and then draped according to the&#xD;
           standard oral and maxillofacial surgery operating room procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Antibiotic dose of 1 gm Cefotaxime vial was administered followed by Dexamethasone&#xD;
           phosphate (as sodium salt) 4 mg vial through peripheral IV route at the beginning of the&#xD;
           procedure. A local anesthetic solution of Articaine 4% containing Epinephrine&#xD;
           (1:200,000) was infiltrated along the proposed operative field for hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A three-line pyramidal incision was performed. The distal incision was carried buccally&#xD;
           across the external oblique ridge, and then joined to a gingival incision running&#xD;
           buccally around the necks of the teeth on which the guide rests. The releasing incision&#xD;
           is carried in a curved manner inferiorly and anteriorly, keeping in mind not to extend&#xD;
           to the area of the mental foramen. Reflection of the flap was done with a periosteal&#xD;
           elevator beginning from under the periosteum of the anterior buccal incision, working&#xD;
           parallel to the gingival margin to detach the papillae and push distally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the field of interest was exposed, the guide was introduced onto the bone and&#xD;
           teeth, and moved until a tight fit was achieved throughout its fitting surface. When&#xD;
           needed, the guide was secured to the underlying bones by 2.0 miniscrews placed through&#xD;
           their preplanned guiding tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Via a small stab incision through the skin, a transbuccal trochar is introduced, through&#xD;
           which the self-drilling extraoral distractor pins are passed. The pins are inserted into&#xD;
           the mandible at their designated points of entry through the guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a piezotome, the osteotomy line is marked and the osteotomy is initiated guided by&#xD;
           the osteotomy slit in the guide. The fixating screws and the guide are then removed. The&#xD;
           use of piezotome allowed the planning of the osteotomies through the path of the&#xD;
           inferior alveolar nerve without fear of nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After guide removal, the osteotomy is completed. The distractor is connected to the&#xD;
           extraoral distractor pins and is then activated to insure free mobility of the distal&#xD;
           segment. Once confirmed, the distractor is returned to its zero position. The flap was&#xD;
           then repositioned and closed using 4-0 Braided Polyglycolic Acid sutures.&#xD;
