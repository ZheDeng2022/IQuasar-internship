  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication safety issues in Veteran organ transplant recipients, including side effects and&#xD;
      errors, are a major issue leading to graft failure and death. The causes of these events are&#xD;
      complicated and involve fragmented care, communication breakdowns between the Veterans,&#xD;
      providers and the different health care systems. This grant proposal seeks to improve&#xD;
      medication safety within these high-risk Veterans, using two innovative components; the&#xD;
      application of technology to leverage the massive amount of data contained within the&#xD;
      electronic medical record in identifying Veterans with potential medication safety issues,&#xD;
      coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention to improve the management and coordination of&#xD;
      immunosuppression therapy. The completion of this prospective, multicenter, cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial will provide evidence that these interventions can&#xD;
      improve medication safety, clinical outcomes and costs and will be used to justify the&#xD;
      dissemination of these interventions to all VAs caring for Veteran transplant recipients&#xD;
      across the U.S.&#xD;

      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: The first three essential strategies listed&#xD;
      within the VA's Blueprint for Excellence encompass plans to improve care to vulnerable&#xD;
      Veterans, deliver high quality care through achieving the &quot;Triple Aim&quot; and leverage the use&#xD;
      of technology to improve the efficiency of care delivery. The intervention this grant&#xD;
      proposes focuses on improving medication safety and care coordination within a high risk&#xD;
      vulnerable Veteran population, leverages the use of informatics and analytics to support this&#xD;
      intervention, and aims to demonstrate improved care at reduced costs through the pharmacist&#xD;
      intervention; thus, perfectly aligning with these three essential components of the&#xD;
      Blueprint. The overarching goal of this study is to develop a feasibly deployable,&#xD;
      technology-enabled intervention that will demonstrate substantial improvements in&#xD;
      immunosuppressant medication safety, clinical outcomes and health care costs in Veteran organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients; demonstrating this through a randomized controlled trial will provide&#xD;
      sufficient evidence to further develop a VA-specific pharmacist learning collaborative aimed&#xD;
      at improving care and reducing costs for Veteran organ transplant recipients across the&#xD;
      entire VA system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Organ transplant is the gold-standard treatment for patients with end organ&#xD;
      diseases of the kidney, liver, heart and lungs, as it substantially improves survival and&#xD;
      quality of life. Over the past 20 years, the use of contemporary immunosuppression has&#xD;
      reduced the risk of acute rejection rates by upwards of 80%; yet long-term allograft survival&#xD;
      remains suboptimal. Studies have demonstrated that causes of late graft loss is predominantly&#xD;
      driven by immunosuppression adverse events and late allograft rejection episodes from&#xD;
      medication errors and non-adherence, which encompass issues directly related to medication&#xD;
      safety. The investigators' research demonstrates that medication errors occur in nearly&#xD;
      two-thirds of transplant recipients, leading to hospitalization in 1 in 8 recipients.&#xD;
      Recipients that develop significant medication errors are at considerably higher risk of&#xD;
      graft loss, leading to higher costs and mortality. Thus, in order to improve medication&#xD;
      safety and long-term outcomes in transplant recipients, enhancements in immunosuppressant&#xD;
      therapy management is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The central hypothesis for the ISTEP study (Improving Transplant Medication&#xD;
      Safety through a TEchnology and Pharmacist Intervention) is that pharmacist-led&#xD;
      immunosuppressant therapy management, facilitated through the use of innovative technology,&#xD;
      will significantly improve immunosuppressant safety and clinical outcomes in Veteran&#xD;
      transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a 24-month, prospective, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial at 10&#xD;
      sites, randomizing 5 sites to standard clinical care and 5 to standard care and the&#xD;
      technology-enabled pharmacist intervention. The technology component of this intervention&#xD;
      consists of the use of an expanded dashboard system that has already demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving immunosuppression monitoring. The dashboard performs&#xD;
      population-level surveillance of transplant recipients and identifies those with potential&#xD;
      drug-related problems, including non-adherence, drug interactions, missing and worrisome&#xD;
      trends in labs; then providing a real-time alert to the pharmacist, who will determine its&#xD;
      relevance and intervene in an appropriate protocol-guided manner. Effectiveness will be&#xD;
      determined by comparing the rates of hospitalizations and ER visits between groups, while&#xD;
      adjusting for baseline patient, provider and facility characteristics. Secondary measures&#xD;
      include comparing healthcare costs and determining dashboard functionality, dashboard&#xD;
      actionability and pharmacist intervention types and acceptance rates. The investigators will&#xD;
      also assess the overall incidence and severity of drug-related problems and graft and patient&#xD;
      survival rates and compare these between the intervention and control sites.&#xD;
