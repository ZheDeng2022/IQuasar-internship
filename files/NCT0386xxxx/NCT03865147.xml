    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa open, randomised, single and parallel group, therapy controlled, single&#xD;
      centre study, which has been divided into 3 sequential phases, which are designed to study&#xD;
      respectively, (a) the time taken to achieve surface anaesthesia, (b) the extent of&#xD;
      post-operative pain relief and (c) the depth and quality of anaesthesia during a leg ulcer&#xD;
      surgical debridement procedure&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the study, patients with leg ulcers (venous, arterial, mixed aetiology or&#xD;
      lymphoedema) requiring surgical debridement will attend 4 visits to the study centre (Day 0,&#xD;
      Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14). After informed consent and screening for inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria patients will be managed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (N=10 patients): This is a pilot (non-comparative) phase designed to assess safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and achievement of clinically acceptable levels of surface analgesia for&#xD;
      Tri-Solfen in the intended patient population, prior to surgical wound debridement. Prior to&#xD;
      surgical debridement all patients will have a single application of the Tri-Solfen product&#xD;
      2mL/10cm2 wound area) administered. The product will be allowed to remain in contact with the&#xD;
      wound bed for 1 minute and surface anaesthesia will then be tested by needle-stick for up to&#xD;
      30 minutes after application (at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes, i.e. testing will stop when&#xD;
      the needle stick can no longer be felt). In parallel serial blood draws of 10mL will be taken&#xD;
      at 2min, 30min, 1 hr, 2hrs and 6hrs after application to determine systemic absorption of&#xD;
      lidocaine and bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical debridement will proceed after a needle stick can no longer be felt and will cease&#xD;
      when either the wound bed is deemed to be clean and free from necrotic tissue in the presence&#xD;
      of punctate bleeding or where pain increases to an unacceptable level as defined by the&#xD;
      patient. Pain assessments will be carried out during the procedure and at 2 min, 30 min, 1&#xD;
      hour, 6 hrs and 24 hours after the procedure is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (N=40 patients; 20 per group): This is a comparative phase of Tri-Solfen vs standard&#xD;
      of care in the management of post-operative analgesia. All patients will receive standard of&#xD;
      care (i.e. 60 mins of EMLA Cream) to anaesthetise the leg ulcer and will undergo surgical&#xD;
      debridement after a needle stick can no longer be felt and will cease when either the wound&#xD;
      bed is deemed to be clean and free from necrotic tissue in the presence of punctate bleeding&#xD;
      or where pain increases to an unacceptable level as defined by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of surgical debridement, patients will be randomised to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: a single application of Tri-Solfen (2mL/10cm2) with standard of care&#xD;
           post-surgical analgesia (e.g. paracetamol, NSAID or opiate) provided as required (N=20),&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: standard of care post-surgical analgesia (e.g. paracetamol, NSAID or opiate) as&#xD;
           required only (N=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood draws of 10mL from the Tri-Solfen group will be taken at 2min, 30min, 1 hr, 2hrs&#xD;
      and 6hrs after application of Tri-Solfen to determine systemic absorption of lidocaine and&#xD;
      bupivacaine. Pain assessments and extent of analgesia required will also be carried out at 2&#xD;
      min, 30 min, 1 hour, 6 hrs and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (N=40 patients; 20 per group). Since debridement of the wound may result in removal&#xD;
      of surface anaesthesia, this phase is intended to compare the quality of anaesthesia from&#xD;
      standard of care (single application of EMLA cream from administration over 60 minutes) with&#xD;
      one application of Tri-Solfen administered pre-surgical debridement, and one application on&#xD;
      completion of surgery. Safety and quality of anaesthesia / analgesia in the intended patient&#xD;
      population before, during and after the surgical debridement procedure will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to debridement, patients will be randomised to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Tri-Solfen (2mL/10cm2) administered once prior to wound debridement and once on&#xD;
           completion of surgical debridement (N=20)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: EMLA cream (1-2g /10cm2). administered to the wound for 60 minutes under an&#xD;
           occlusive dressing (N=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, the time taken to achieve clinically acceptable surface anaesthesia required&#xD;
      to perform the surgical procedure will be assessed using a needle-stick at the wound site. In&#xD;
      patients receiving Tri-Solfen, this will be performed at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after&#xD;
      application of the Tri-Solfen - assessments will stop when the needle can no longer be&#xD;
      detected by the patient. Needle stick testing will also be undertaken immediately following&#xD;
      removal of EMLA cream after 60 minutes in EMLA-treated patients to provide a baseline&#xD;
      comparator of pre-operative anaesthetic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical debridement will proceed only after a needle stick can no longer be felt and will&#xD;
      cease when either the wound bed is deemed to be clean and free from necrotic tissue in the&#xD;
      presence of punctate bleeding or where pain increases to an unacceptable level as defined by&#xD;
      the patient. Pain assessments will be carried out during the procedure and at 2 min, 30 min,&#xD;
      1 hour, 6 hrs and 24 hours after the procedure is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood draws of 10mL from the Tri-Solfen group will be taken at 2min, 30min, 1 hr, 2hrs&#xD;
      and 6hrs after application of the first dose of Tri-Solfen to determine systemic absorption&#xD;
      of lidocaine and bupivacaine from multiple dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Phases Patients will be followed up for two weeks to confirm that the use of the&#xD;
      Tri-Solfen (or EMLA) product do not adversely affect wound healing and to assess the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events, including wound infections&#xD;
