  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out whether wound closure (the process of closing the&#xD;
      surgical wound after the procedure is complete) with Dermabond PRINEO Skin Closure System&#xD;
      (PRINEO) will be faster and improve wound healing compared to standard closing methods after&#xD;
      total shoulder replacement. The PRINEO system involves using running stitches to close the&#xD;
      wound, and then taping over the sutures with a sticky film that holds the wound closed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the Total Cost of Wound Closure When Using Dermabond PRINEO Versus the Surgeon's Control.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Closure cost was calculated by evaluating the cost of wound closure products ($) per patient, plus the cost of the operating room ($) per minute, multiplied by the closure time (minutes) per centimeter of incision length, then multiplied by the average incision length (cm) per patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparing Patient Satisfaction Ratings Between D.PRINEO and Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction ratings were on a scale from 0-10, where 0 = very dissatisfied and 10 = very satisfied.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Closure Time Per Centimeter of Incision</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate/at time of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This closure time was measured from the first stitch for closure to the application of the wound dressing. The incision length was measured immediately after closure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Overall Opinion Score Reported by Operating Surgeon</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Opinion was on a scale 1 - 10, where lower scores are viewed more favorably with 1=normal skin and 10=very different compared to adjacent skin, which was evaluated by the operating physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Wound Inflammation Score (AIRE) Reported by Operating Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Images of the healing wound will be assessed according to the Acute Inflammatory Response Evaluation score (0 to 3, 0 being the lowest amount of inflammation and 3 represents the highest amount of inflammation) by the operating physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Scar Assessment (POSAS) by Operating Surgeon</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Images of the healing wound will be assessed according to the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS, where there are six components each ranging between 1-10 with 10 representing the worst outcome, and each of those six components were summed for these results, having a final range of 6-60) by the operating surgeon.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Cosmesis (MHCS) Score by Operating Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the wound after surgery will be assessed according to the Modified Hollander Cosmesis Scale (0 to 6, with 0 being ideal) by the operating physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences Between Patient and Surgeon Total POSAS Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>POSAS scores can range from 1-10, where 1 is like normal skin, and 10 is worst scar imaginable, and has six components. Each component (range of 1-10) was summed up to get a final score (range of 6-60) for each participant. Differences were calculated as the participant's Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) score minus the physician POSAS score, with a negative difference signifying that the patients thought more highly of the scars than the physicians since lower POSAS scores are more favorable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Overall Opinion Score Reported by Plastic Surgeons</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Opinion was on a scale 1 - 10, where lower scores are viewed more favorably with 1=normal skin and 10=very different compared to adjacent skin, which was evaluated by an independent plastic surgeon.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Scar Assessment (POSAS) by Plastic Surgeon</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Images of the healing wound will be assessed according to the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS, includes six measurements ranging from 0 to 10, 10 being ideal, where the total of the six measurements is what is reported) by an independent plastic surgeon. This POSAS total score would then range from 6-60.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Cosmesis (MHCS) Score by Plastic Surgeon</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post surgery</time_frame>

Differences were calculated as the participant's Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) score minus the physician POSAS score, with a negative difference signifying that the patients thought more highly of the scars than the physicians since lower POSAS scores are more favorable.</description>

          <description>POSAS scores can range from 1-10, where 1 is like normal skin, and 10 is worst scar imaginable, and has six components. Each component (range of 1-10) was summed up to get a final score (range of 6-60) for each participant. Differences were calculated as the participant's Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) score minus the physician POSAS score, with a negative difference signifying that the patients thought more highly of the scars than the physicians since lower POSAS scores are more favorable.</description>
          <population>Arms were regrouped to reflect the patient and surgeon scores for each intervention. Participants who had adverse events before the conclusion of the study were excluded from this analysis, because outcome measures could not be collected.</population>
