  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this R21 study is to explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRxs) in improving engagement in healthy behaviors&#xD;
      and other outcomes in middle-aged AAs and to gain feedback on future implementation of the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pre-post experimental design will be used, in which 150 AA participants aged 50-65 will&#xD;
      complete a baseline assessment of cognitive testing and data-driven assessment of&#xD;
      deficiencies across five CogRx domains (physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep,&#xD;
      social activity). Participants will be randomized to either: psychoeducation + CogRx,&#xD;
      psychoeducation only, or no contact control. The psychoeducation and CogRx groups will&#xD;
      receive general psychoeducation on dementia prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors, while&#xD;
      the CogRx group will also receive personalized information on their risk factor profile and&#xD;
      develop a tailored 3-month intervention plan, which will consist of simple evidence-based&#xD;
      strategies to implement at home. Motivational reminders as well as adherence and&#xD;
      self-efficacy questions will be administered via text-messaging over the 3-months.&#xD;
      Participants will return for 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Specific Aim 1 (proximal&#xD;
      outcomes) is to determine whether the CogRx condition is superior to psychoeducation alone in&#xD;
      improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Specific Aim 2 (distal outcomes) is to&#xD;
      compare the three conditions on a brief battery of cognitive and psychological measures. The&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim is to gather feedback for future implementation of this program, including&#xD;
      cultural considerations, barriers and facilitators to engagement, and likelihood of&#xD;
      continuing the program.&#xD;

    <description>Physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep, and social activity are the primary outcome, as the goal of the intervention is to improve behaviors the participant is determined to have deficiencies in at baseline. Since the intervention is tailored, outcomes are unique (e.g., one persons intervention might consist of improving physical activity and diet, whereas another might focus on cognitive activity and sleep). The following self-reported questionnaires will be used: Physical activity (the International Physical Activity Questionnaire), Diet (the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) questionnaire), Social Activity (the Duke Social Support Inventory), Sleep (the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), Cognitive Activity (a modified Florida Cognitive Activities Scale). Cutoffs will be used to create dichotomies for each domain such that 1=optimal and 0=suboptimal, which will be summed to create a Health Behavior composite (scores ranging from 0-5).</description>
