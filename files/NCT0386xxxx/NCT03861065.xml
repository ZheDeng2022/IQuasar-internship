      The purpose of this research study is to determine if closing a surgical wound differently is&#xD;
      better than the procedure that is currently used. The wound will be closed with what is&#xD;
      considered &quot;tertiary intent.&quot; This means, rather than leaving the wound open, the wound will&#xD;
      be partially closed after surgery, and then completely closed 4-7 days after surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators also want to see how this new wound closure process affects your quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the percentage of patients whose wound remained closed on postoperative day #30&#xD;
      after tertiary closure compared to historical controls who underwent secondary would closure.&#xD;
      We are primarily looking at time to wound closure. We will be able to abstract this&#xD;
      information from the postoperative clinic visit notes from patients in the &quot;historical&#xD;
      control&quot; cohort. We will identify 20 patients with characteristics described in the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of this study who underwent laparotomy with secondary would closure during the&#xD;
      calendar year 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the proportion of acute and chronic wound infection in wounds closed with a&#xD;
      tertiary closure technique to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the length of stay of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure to historical&#xD;
      controls receiving a secondary wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the number of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure that return within 30&#xD;
      days of surgery as compared to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the quality of life in patients receiving a tertiary wound closure.&#xD;

    <description>The quality of life in patients receiving a tertiary wound closure. The scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>In the alternative tertiary wound closure, the wound will be partially closed rather than being left open. Sutures in the skin will be placed but not closed. A vacuum assisted closure device will be placed over the wound to help healing. After 4-7 days, the vacuum device will be removed, and the participant's doctor will close the wound.</description>
