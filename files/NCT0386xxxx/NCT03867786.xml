  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug and rates of hazardous use, and cannabis use&#xD;
      disorders (CUDs), have continued to rise in recent years. The highest rates of use and CUDs&#xD;
      are seen in young adults (20 - 24 years old) with more than 50% of young adults reporting&#xD;
      lifetime use of cannabis, 35% report use in the past year, and 20% report use in the past&#xD;
      month. Increased exposure produces higher risk for detrimental psychological and behavioral&#xD;
      effects of cannabis use. Given this increased prevalence of cannabis use and associated&#xD;
      risks, identifying effective behavioral strategies that reduce cannabis craving, negative&#xD;
      psychological effects, and alter neurobiological mechanisms underlying problematic cannabis&#xD;
      use are an avenue of needed research. Exercise, particularly resistance exercise, is a&#xD;
      behavioral intervention with considerable potential as an adjunctive treatment for CUD.&#xD;

      behavioral intervention with considerable potential as an adjunctive treatment for CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proposal seek to address these issues by implementing acute resistance&#xD;
      exercise protocol in men and women who have cannabis use disorder. This proposal will: 1&#xD;
      examine the effect of an acute resistance exercise protocol on affect, stress, and compulsive&#xD;
      urge to use in non-treatment seeking young adults with CUD 2.examine whether an acute&#xD;
      resistance exercise session in individuals with CUD is associated with induced alterations in&#xD;
      the appetitive/ reward hormone ghrelin These findings will inform the further development for&#xD;
      exercise interventions for cannabis use disorder that can be used with the aim of supporting&#xD;
      individuals with CUD reduce use and decrease the negative effects of withdrawal.&#xD;

    <description>Craving Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ) The 45-item MCQ is a multi-dimensional questionnaire that assesses marijuana craving. It is based on the the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire and uses items that touch on four specific constructs characterizing craving for marijuana: (1) compulsivity, an inability to control marijuana use; (2) emotionality, use of marijuana in anticipation of relief from withdrawal or negative mood; (3) expectancy, anticipation of positive outcomes from smoking marijuana; and (4) purposefulness, intention and planning to use marijuana for positive outcomes. Each item is rated on a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;strongly agree to strongly disagree&quot;</description>
