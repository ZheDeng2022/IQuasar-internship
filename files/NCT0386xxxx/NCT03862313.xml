  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis (ON) is an acute inflammatory, demyelinating attack of the optic nerve that&#xD;
      triggers neurodegeneration in the entire visual pathway; translating into visual dysfunction.&#xD;
      Currently, no neuroprotective therapy with satisfying evidence can be offered to patients.&#xD;
      Repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) is a methodology applied to&#xD;
      electrically stimulate the retina and the optic nerve and is considered having&#xD;
      neuroprotective- and restorative potential. The goal of this pilot study is to assess safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of rtACS as a treatment to improve visual functional as&#xD;
      well as structural retinal outcomes in patients with a first-ever episode of autoimmune acute&#xD;
      ON.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Primarily due to insufficient recruitment (n = 2 instead of n = 30), the study was prematurely&#xD;
    discontinued for feasibility reasons. Neither any meaningful results on safety nor on efficacy&#xD;
    can be reported.&#xD;

             episode of unilateral acute autoimmune, inflammatory, demyelinating ON, including&#xD;
             idiopathic ON and ON suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) (typical clinically&#xD;
             isolated syndrome, or with an established diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;

             and consequences of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or have the intention to become pregnant during the course of&#xD;
             the study (For women who can get pregnant, pregnancy will be omitted using a pregnancy&#xD;

             fixation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent eye surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known anti-aquaporin-4- or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein- antibody&#xD;
             seropositivity&#xD;

             implanted electronic devices, metallic artefacts in the head (excluding dentition),&#xD;
             epilepsy, brain cancer, pregnancy, breastfeeding, increased intraocular pressure&#xD;
             without appropriate treatment, arterial hypertension without appropriate treatment,&#xD;
             skin irritations at intended positions of electrodes, cognitive deficits (unable to&#xD;
             provide written informed consent or follow the instructions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems,&#xD;
             psychological disorders, dementia, etc. of the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another study with investigational drug/device within the 30 days&#xD;
             preceding and during the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous enrolment into the current study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees and other dependent&#xD;
             persons&#xD;

    <gender>All</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>In principle 18-50 year old female and male patients may be recruited. However, since the randomization of patients will be controlled for gender, and participants will be enrolled continuously in an unbiased fashion, gender might become relevant in an advanced phase of the study (e.g. if the female block has already been fully recruited and only males might still be enrolled). As female preponderance is a well-known fact in multiple sclerosis, the investigators anticipate that approximately 2/3 of the patients will be females.</gender_description>
