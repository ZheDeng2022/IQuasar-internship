    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is collect tissue and blood samples from patients who are&#xD;
      having surgery and use those samples in lab studies to see if there are any markers in blood&#xD;
      and tissue that can help predict how cancer will react to different treatment. Participants&#xD;
      in this study will have a blood sample and tissue samples collected for research. The blood&#xD;
      and tissue collected will be tested in the laboratory. The tissue collected will be left over&#xD;
      tissue from the standard of care surgery.&#xD;

      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is the sixth most common neoplasm in the&#xD;
      world and despite advances in treatment, the 5-year survival remains approximately 50%.&#xD;
      Because of the need for new therapies, the possibility of immunotherapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      HNSCC patients has gained interest. Interest in this has continued as more than half of the&#xD;
      subjects enrolled to an ongoing clinical trial in patients with with oral squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (OCSCC) have responded to neoadjuvant presurgical Nivolumab therapy. Additionally,&#xD;
      unlike other solid tumors it appears responders have higher proportions of CD4+&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) whereas non-responders have an increase in CD8+ TILs&#xD;
      population. Furthermore, the investigator's data suggests that response to PD-1 blockade is&#xD;
      associated with an increase in CD45RA- CD62L+ population or central memory phenotype within&#xD;
      TIL whereas progression of disease correlates with an increase in the CD45RA- CD62L-&#xD;
      population or effector memory phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously demonstrated in several other tumor types the magnitude of response to&#xD;
      immunotherapy directly correlates to presence of antigen specific T cells within the tumor&#xD;
      and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to identify&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of immune response from either TILs or tumor cells from patients with&#xD;
      head and neck squamous carcinoma. To achieve this goal the overall objective of the current&#xD;
      study is to develop a pre-clinical murine models in an effort to more completely evaluate the&#xD;
      memory phenotype of TILs before and after PD-1 inhibition and to subsequently to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of TIL therapy in this mouse model of oral cancer. This project will test a&#xD;
      central hypothesis that TILs derived from responders to neoadjuvant pre-surgical PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition in both a patient derived xenograft mouse model of oral cancer.&#xD;
