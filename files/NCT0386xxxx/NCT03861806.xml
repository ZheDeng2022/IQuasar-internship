  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a non-invasive stimulation method which is known to&#xD;
      modulate corticospinal excitability through mechanisms related to long-term potentiation and&#xD;
      long-term depression. The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability of individual&#xD;
      subject's response (i.e., change in corticospinal excitability) to PAS in patients with&#xD;
      chronic stroke (&gt;6 months) with upper limb motor deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the assumptions in stroke rehabilitation is that motor training will lead to motor&#xD;
      re-learning and persistent improvements through mechanisms involving neuroplasticity, defined&#xD;
      as the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injury,&#xD;
      activity, or change in environment. A way to measure a patient's capacity for neuroplasticity&#xD;
      may be useful in guiding selection of patients for rehabilitative interventions, or to assess&#xD;
      the effect of pharmacological agents on neuroplasticity which may aid in augmenting motor&#xD;
      recovery. One method to assess neuroplasticity non-invasively in humans through the use of&#xD;
      paired associative stimulation (PAS). PAS is a form of non-invasive stimulation that&#xD;
      modulates corticospinal excitability through mechanisms related to long-term potentiation&#xD;
      (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In PAS, repetitive pairing of peripheral nerve&#xD;
      stimulation with a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse over the contralateral motor&#xD;
      cortex will increase or decrease corticospinal excitability, depending on the timing between&#xD;
      the two stimuli. In healthy subjects and patients with stroke, PAS has successfully been used&#xD;
      to facilitate corticospinal excitability as a means to enhance motor performance. In this&#xD;
      study, we plan to use PAS as an assay of corticospinal plasticity rather than as a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention in patients with chronic motor deficits (&gt;6 months) due to ischemic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is large interindividual variability in individuals' responses to PAS, which may be&#xD;
      useful in examining its relationship to motor learning, but the reliability of the measure&#xD;
      will need to be assessed prior to using this measure to make inferences about a subject's&#xD;
      general capacity to learn motor tasks. The reliability of the response to PAS and its&#xD;
      relationship to clinical factors such as stroke severity, has not been well studied in&#xD;
      patients with stroke. Results from a preliminary experiment suggest that stroke patients who&#xD;
      have a robust response to facilitatory PAS on their unaffected hemisphere have more severe&#xD;
      motor deficits than those who do not have a significant response to PAS.&#xD;
