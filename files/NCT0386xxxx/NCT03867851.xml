  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open, randomized, active comparator-controlled multi center study in&#xD;
      patients with severe type-1 diabetes. This is a two-armed study where patients are randomized&#xD;
      in a 2:1 ratio between IBsolvMIR and heparin. Eighteen patients are planned to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of up to 8 visits; screening, transplantation surgery with bolus&#xD;
      administration of study drug or active comparator, IBsolvMIR doses on day 1, 3 and 6 after&#xD;
      surgery, follow up visits on day 7 and 14, and follow-up phone call on day 44.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to study AEs up to 44 days following study drug administration. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints are to evaluate changes in TAT, C-peptide, C3a and HGF at baseline and&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours after study drug administration, as well as evaluate a change in&#xD;
      levels of C-peptide-glucose-creatinine ratio on day 14 compared to baseline.&#xD;
