  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa, dose-escalation study, involving a single&#xD;
      injection of Temferon, an investigational advanced therapy consisting of autologous&#xD;
      CD34+-enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exposed to transduction with a&#xD;
      lentiviral vector driving myeloid specific interferon-alpha2 expression, which will be&#xD;
      administered to up to 21 patients affected by GBM who have an unmethylated MGMT promoter.&#xD;
      Part A will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 escalating doses of Temferon and 2&#xD;
      different conditioning regimens in up to 15 patients, following first line treatment. In Part&#xD;
      B, a further 6 patients will receive a single dose of Temferon, as identiifed from Part A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, multicenter, phase I/IIa, therapeutic-exploratory, dose&#xD;
      escalation, prospective study, involving a single injection of Temferon, an investigational&#xD;
      ATMP consisting of autologous CD34+-enriched HSPCs exposed to transduction with a 3rd&#xD;
      generation lentiviral vector driving myeloid-specific IFN-alpha2 expression, which will be&#xD;
      administered to up to 21 patients affected by GBM who have an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The&#xD;
      study will recruit and follow-up patients at a specialist neurosurgical and neuro-oncology&#xD;
      units in Italy. Administration of Temferon and hematological follow up will take place at&#xD;
      specialist hematology and bone marrow transplantation units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will be identified immediately after surgical resection of GBM&#xD;
      once the MGMT promoter methylator status is known. Once written, informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, and screening procedures have been completed, harvesting of HSPCs will occur. A&#xD;
      standard of care regimen lasting approximately 6 weeks, will then take place . During this&#xD;
      time, Temferon manufacturing will occur. Following completion of radiotherapy, patients will&#xD;
      be admitted for receipt of a conditioning regimen consisting of BCNU and thiotepa (Cohorts&#xD;
      1-4) or busulfan and thiotepa (Cohort 5). This will be followed by administration of&#xD;
      Temferon. In-patient monitoring will occur until hematological recovery occurs. Thereafter,&#xD;
      regular follow-up of patients will occur up to 2 years (+720 days) with the majority of&#xD;
      assessments and procedures. At the +720 day visit, patients will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      a long term follow-up study which will last for an additional 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, 5 cohorts of 3 patients will receive 3 escalating doses of Temferon.&#xD;
      On completion of Part A, a conditioning regimen and single dose of Temferon will be selected&#xD;
      to be studied in up to a further 6 patients in Part B. Criteria for study eligibility are the&#xD;
      same for both Part A and Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that GBM disease progression occurs, patients will be managed with second line&#xD;
      therapies including second surgery, TMZ, BCNU, fotemustine or any other approved therapy for&#xD;
      GBM.&#xD;

    <description>Autologous CD34+-enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells exposed in vitro to specific lentiviral vector encoding for the human interferon-alpha 2 gene. Its expression is tightly controlled by the human TIE2 enhancer/promoter sequence and by a post-transcriptional regulation layer represented by target miRNA sequences. This enables suppression of interferon-alpha2 expression in HSPCs, thereby further increasing the specificity of the delivery strategy for their Tie2 expressing myeloid cell progeny.</description>
