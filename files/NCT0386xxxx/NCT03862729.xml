  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: the first part is to conduct a multicenter retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of more than 1000 acute ICH patients treated by conservative observation from 33&#xD;
      centers in China to create a predictive model of intracerebral hemorrhage growth based on&#xD;
      clinical, blood, genetic, imaging, and pharmacological factors; the second part is to&#xD;
      validate the efficacy of the minimally invasive surgery, including stereotactic thrombolysis&#xD;
      and endoscopic surgery, in 300 eligible patients with high risk of hemorrhage growth&#xD;
      according to the first part results in a prospective multicenter cohort study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 2 million strokes worldwide per year&#xD;
      and is the deadliest subtype of stroke with a 1-year mortality rate up to 50%. Given the high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of this disease process, surgical options have been repeatedly&#xD;
      evaluated in large multicenter randomized controlled trials that unfortunately have not&#xD;
      demonstrated improved outcomes. Time to treatment is a factor that has been shown to carry&#xD;
      enormous weight in the treatment of ischemic stroke but has not yet been demonstrated to play&#xD;
      a role in hemorrhagic stroke. On the other hand, Intracerebral hemorrhage growth in&#xD;
      early-stage is associated with the poor clinical outcome. Thus, investigators assume that&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery in early-stage ICH patients with high risk of hemorrhage growth&#xD;
      may improve the long-term outcomes. In the first part, the investigators will review more&#xD;
      than 1000 early-stage ICH patients from 33 centers within the last 5 years in China to create&#xD;
      a predictive model of intracerebral hemorrhage growth based on clinical, blood, genetic,&#xD;
      imaging, and pharmacological factors. The &quot;early-stage&quot; means 24 hours from symptom onset to&#xD;
      baseline imaging. The &quot;hemorrhage growth&quot; is defined as an increase in intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage volume between baseline and repeat imaging of more than 6 mL or more than 33%. The&#xD;
      second part is to validate the efficacy of the minimally invasive surgery in patients with&#xD;
      high risk of hemorrhage growth according to the first part results in a prospective&#xD;
      multicenter cohort study. Endoscopic surgery and stereotactic thrombolysis (150 patients)&#xD;
      will be compared with conventional treatment (150 patients), including medical treatment and&#xD;
      conventional craniotomy. Clinical data and laboratory data will be collected by electric case&#xD;
      report form (CRF) and uploaded online by each neurosurgery center to form the prospective&#xD;
      clinical database in First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. This cohort&#xD;
      follow-up study will be across a 3-year period with a 2 years interval of enrollment and 1&#xD;
      year follow up for each patient.&#xD;

                  information or lab results was not enough to determine the growth of the hematoma&#xD;
                  or to perform statistical analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients had accepted acute treatment that might have reduced intracerebral&#xD;
                  hemorrhage volume (ie, surgical evacuation, external ventricular drainage, lumbar&#xD;
