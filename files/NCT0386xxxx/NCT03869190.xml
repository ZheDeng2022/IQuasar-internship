  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study in participants with&#xD;
      cisplatin-ineligible MIBC and in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Urothelial&#xD;
      Carcinoma (UC) who have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. The&#xD;
      study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become&#xD;
      available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or modify the participant population (e.g., with regard to prior&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatment or biomarker status). Participants in the mUC Cohort who experience&#xD;
      loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue&#xD;
      treatment with a different treatment regimen for Stage 2.&#xD;
