      A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of D-0316 in&#xD;
      Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has&#xD;
      Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy&#xD;
      and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of D-0316&#xD;
      (Firstly, D-0316 was orally given 75mg for a cycle(21 days), if tolerated, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 100mg. Otherwise, the dose will be maintained at 75mg.) in patients with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation&#xD;
      positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth&#xD;
      Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy of D-0316 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according&#xD;
      to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.&#xD;
