  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial to test GKT137831 in ambulatory patients&#xD;
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This drug is an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) isoforms. The investigators hypothesize the drug&#xD;
      will decrease pulmonary injury due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOX enzymes,&#xD;
      which are believed to play an important role in the development of IPF. Treatment with&#xD;
      GKT137831 could result in significant benefit for a lung disease that has, until now, been&#xD;
      almost invariably inexorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial represents the bedside application of a series of NOX translational and&#xD;
      basic studies and discoveries, over several years, from the laboratory of Dr. Victor&#xD;
      Thannickal.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Following screening assessments, IPF patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments in a ratio of 1:1:&#xD;
• Arm A (n=30) - GKT137831 Treatment:&#xD;
GKT137831 will be administered orally, at a dose of 400 mg bid, for a total of 24 weeks.&#xD;
• Arm B (n=30) - Placebo Treatment:&#xD;
Arm B subjects will receive matching placebo for the same duration.&#xD;
Participants will be followed in face-to-face visits with trial personnel every 6 weeks for 24 weeks to assess drug effects and monitor safety during their treatments, and by phone surveillances one month thereafter.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 40-85 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A diagnosis of IPF that fulfills current American Thoracic Society (ATS) Consensus&#xD;
             Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. IPF duration &lt;5 years, based on the date of definitive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability and willingness to give informed consent and adhere to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &gt;70%&#xD;
             of predicted values&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of major comorbidities expected to interfere with study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of malignancy, excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer and low-risk&#xD;
             prostate cancer, the latter defined as stage T1 or T2a, with prostate specific antigen&#xD;
             &lt;10 ng/dl. NOX inhibition is not known to promote cancer, and these criteria are&#xD;
             within current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The occurrence of any acute infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment for &gt;14 days within the preceding month with &gt;20 mg. prednisone (or&#xD;
             equivalent) or any treatment during the last month with a cellular immunosuppressant&#xD;
             (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors, etc.), given increased&#xD;
             risks of opportunistic infections.&#xD;

          6. Fertile women who do not agree to contraception or abstinence, or who are breast&#xD;
             feeding. IPF is a disease of older adults, and male predominant, so this will not be a&#xD;
             frequent consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to GKT137831 or its excipients (e.g. capsule&#xD;
             &quot;bulking&quot; agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A history of bone marrow disorder including aplastic anemia, or marked anemia defined&#xD;
             as hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL (or 6.2 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Severe cardiovascular disease, defined as any of the following within the preceding 12&#xD;
             weeks: acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, a coronary revascularization&#xD;
             procedure, congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), or stroke, including a&#xD;
             transient ischemic attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Evidence of cardiac conducting abnormalities, defined as second or third degree&#xD;
             atrial-ventricular (AV) block not successfully treated with a pacemaker, or a personal&#xD;
             or family history of long QT syndrome (QTc interval &gt;450 msec for males or 470 msec&#xD;
             for females).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. End-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Undergoing transplantation evaluation, or listed with the United Network for Organ&#xD;
             Sharing (UNOS) as a lung transplantation candidate at the time of enrollment in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin)&#xD;
             &gt;3x upper limit of normal values&#xD;
