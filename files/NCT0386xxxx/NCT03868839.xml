      This study is a 4-week pilot study for subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective&#xD;
      Disorder who have not experienced a significant relief of symptoms from current&#xD;
      anti-psychotic medication. The Investigators hypothesize that 4 weeks of telmisartan at 80mg&#xD;
      daily will alter glutamate and GABA in the brain as measured with 1H-Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS) after 4 weeks treatment.&#xD;

             Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al 1987) total score ≥ 70 with&#xD;

             disease state that may, in the opinion of the investigator, confound the results of&#xD;

             substance use disorder (excluding nicotine and caffeine) as established by the&#xD;
             clinical assessment (MINI) at the screening visit will be excluded.&#xD;
