  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustained ambulation is a challenge for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) as walking&#xD;
      economy is frequently compromised. There are also various disease-related skeletal muscle&#xD;
      alterations that may contribute to performance fatigability during ambulation. Concomitantly,&#xD;
      individuals with PD experience substantial difficulty maintaining sustained forward&#xD;
      progression at push-off during the gait cycle due to diminished force production. Exercise is&#xD;
      commonly prescribed for these individuals, though traditional exercise approaches to PD have&#xD;
      often applied a &quot;one impairment-one modality&quot; paradigm that addresses each impairment&#xD;
      separately. Interventions to optimize movement should facilitate an individual's response to&#xD;
      the challenge of responding to a complex interplay of constraints that are also specific to a&#xD;
      task and its environmental context. Thus, there are multiple concurrent targets for exercise&#xD;
      interventions that may not fit easily within a &quot;one impairment-one modality&quot; model. A&#xD;
      multimodal intervention is designed to address an array of constraining impairments&#xD;
      concurrently. However, the evidence-base for multimodal exercise approaches is still&#xD;
      developing and far from conclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that multimodal overground locomotion training&#xD;
      (OLT) can promote walking economy during sustained overground ambulation in individuals with&#xD;
      PD, and produce concurrent secondary effects that decrease performance fatigability and&#xD;
      increase propulsion. The aims of this study are to 1) Evaluate walking economy during&#xD;
      sustained overground walking after 12 weeks of multimodal OLT, 2) Evaluate secondary effects&#xD;
      of OLT.&#xD;

      Protocol Overview: Subjects will be recruited from the greater Washington D.C. metro area.&#xD;
      Individuals interested in participating as subjects will complete initial verbal screening to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for inclusion. Those subjects who volunteer to participate will then be&#xD;
      consented and enrolled for participation if exclusion and inclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: (~120 minutes) Subjects will fill out a medical history form. Height and weight&#xD;
      measurements will then be taken. The Hoehn and Yahr, Mini-Mental State Exam, Fatigue Severity&#xD;
      Scale (FSS), Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), and Physical Activity Scale&#xD;
      in the Elderly (PASE) will then be administered. Subjects will first perform the 10-meter&#xD;
      walk test. Subjects will be asked by researchers to walk 10 meters across a pressure&#xD;
      sensitive walkway, 5 times at both comfortable speed and fast speed. After the 10-meter walk&#xD;
      test, subjects will be given a 10-20 minute resting period before the second test. Subjects&#xD;
      performing the 10-minute walk test will be fitted with a portable metabolic unit consisting&#xD;
      of a face mask and torso apparatus. Wearable sensors will be secured to both arms, trunk, and&#xD;
      legs. Before the test, subjects will stand in a resting position for at least 3 minutes to&#xD;
      gain resting metabolic data. The subjects will then be asked to walk as far as they (the&#xD;
      subjects) can in 10 minutes. Following the 10-minute walking period, subjects will again&#xD;
      stand in a resting position to obtain recovery data. Subjects will then be given a 10-20&#xD;
      minute resting period during the transition to the third test. For the third test, subjects&#xD;
      will be fitted with reflective markers at pre-specified anatomical landmarks used in a&#xD;
      standardized gait marker set, for example medial and lateral knee and ankle joints.&#xD;
      Electromyography (EMG) sensors will be placed on lower limb muscles. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      asked to walk at both their preferred and fast walking speed over a 6 meter platform with&#xD;
      embedded force plates. Subjects will be asked to perform as many trials as necessary to&#xD;
      collect sufficient force plate data. After this test, subjects will be given the opportunity&#xD;
      for a rest period if required before ending the testing day. For those subjects who start&#xD;
      with the gait propulsion test, the testing order will include the same procedures yet in the&#xD;
      reversed order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: (~90 minutes) Researchers will measure adipose tissue thickness over the calf muscle&#xD;
      on the more affected leg (as indicated by the subject) using standard calipers. Subjects will&#xD;
      then undergo a vascular occlusion test while resting in a semi-recumbent position. To perform&#xD;
      this test investigators will place a large blood pressure cuff on the thigh and will place a&#xD;
      NIRS optode on the calf muscle. Investigators will then inflate the cuff to 220mmHg to&#xD;
      occlude blood flow to the lower leg. After a 5 minute period of occlusion the cuff pressure&#xD;
      will be released and recovery NIRS data will be obtained. Subjects will then perform the CWRT&#xD;
      Subjects will be fitted with 12-lead ECG and ICG sensors, will wear a face mask to collect&#xD;
      metabolic data, and will be asked to perform the CWRT. Before the CWRT, subjects will rest&#xD;
      for a minimum of 2 minutes in a standing position on a treadmill. During the CWRT subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to walk at a constant speed for 6 minutes and 30 minutes with an 8 minute rest&#xD;
      period between bouts. After the CWRT subjects will be asked to rest in a standing position to&#xD;
      obtain recovery data. After this test, subjects will be given the opportunity to rest for a&#xD;
      period if required before ending the testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3-26: (~1 hour each) For these visits, subjects will perform an overground multimodal&#xD;
      locomotor training protocol. Subjects will train individually with 1-2 trained instructors.&#xD;
      Subjects will wear a Polar chest strap and a research grade pedometer during each session to&#xD;
      enable instructors to modify training within the session to maintain a target intensity zone.&#xD;
      The training protocol covers 12 weeks with two sessions per week for a total of 24 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 27 (~90 minutes): Subjects will repeat the same testing procedures as they did in visit&#xD;
      1 in the same order as they did, determined by the initial randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 28 (~90 minutes): Subjects will repeat the same testing procedures as they did in visit&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10-Meter Walk Test: The purpose of this test is to measure spatiotemporal variables related&#xD;
      to walking at different speeds. Subjects will complete 10 repetitions of an over-ground&#xD;
      10-meter walk test on an instrumented pressure sensitive walkway. 5 repetitions will be&#xD;
      performed at both comfortable and fast walking speeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT): The purpose of this test is to provide a method of perturbation&#xD;
      for measuring both performance and perceived fatigability. Subjects will wear a fitted face&#xD;
      mask and a torso unit as part of a portable metabolic unit. Wearable sensors will be secured&#xD;
      on the torso, upper and lower limbs to measure gait characteristics. Subjects will rest in a&#xD;
      standing position for at least 3 minutes prior to beginning this test to collect baseline&#xD;
      data. Subjects will then walk as far as they can over a 10-minute interval or until they have&#xD;
      to stop walking. Distance covered will be recorded at at 2.5-minute intervals throughout the&#xD;
      test and at the end of the time walked if not the full 10 minutes. Velocity will be computed&#xD;
      from the distances covered at the time intervals (meters/sec). The 10-minute walk test will&#xD;
      be performed during the pre-intervention testing visit and post-intervention testing visit.&#xD;
      Following the 10-minute walk period (or total time if ended early) subjects will rest in the&#xD;
      standing position to obtain recovery data for at least 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait Propulsion Testing: Subjects will be outfitted with reflective markers comprised of a&#xD;
      standardized full-body marker set for motion capture analysis. EMG sensors will be placed on&#xD;
      muscle bellies of lower limb muscles. To establish the maximum voluntary contraction,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to contract muscles against resistance. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      stand for system calibration for less than one minute and may be asked to move various limbs&#xD;
      through a range of motion to ensure accuracy of the system prior to starting the test.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be asked to walk across a 6-meter platform with embedded force plates&#xD;
      enclosed by safety rails at their preferred and fast walking speed. Subjects will perform&#xD;
      approximately 20-30 passes to ensure sufficient data collection by the force plates as&#xD;
      appropriate contact with the force plate must be made for valid measurement. Once sufficient&#xD;
      data has been collected, markers and sensors will be removed and the subject will be offered&#xD;
      a seated rest period if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Occlusion Test: During occlusion testing subjects will be seated in a semi-recumbent&#xD;
      position on a plinth. A large blood pressure cuff will be fitted around the upper thigh with&#xD;
      velcro straps to secure it in place. The cuff will be rapidly inflated in less than 5 seconds&#xD;
      to above 220mmHg to restrict arterial and venous blood flow. The leg will be occluded for 5&#xD;
      minutes. The cuff pressure will then be released in less than 5 seconds and recovery&#xD;
      variables will be recorded for an additional minimum of 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant Work Rate Treadmill Test (CWRT): During the CWRT subjects will be fitted with NIRS,&#xD;
      Physioflow, and cardiopulmonary gas exchange devices to capture the cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      measures. First, subjects will rest in a standing position for a minimum of 2 minutes.&#xD;
      Second, treadmill will transition to the subjects' comfortable walking speed (average speed&#xD;
      from the 10-meter walk test at comfortable speed). Third, after 6 minutes of continuous the&#xD;
      treadmill will stop and subjects will rest for 8-minutes in a standing position. Fourth,&#xD;
      after 8-minutes rest, the treadmill will transition to the subjects' comfortable walking&#xD;
      speed and subjects will walk for a maximum of 30-minutes or until volitional exhaustion.&#xD;
      Finally, subjects will recover for 10 minutes in a standing position. The speed used in the&#xD;
      pre-test will be the same during the post-test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal Exercise Intervention: The intent of the multimodal training intervention is to&#xD;
      encompass cardiovascular adaptations and locomotor improvements. To promote cardiovascular&#xD;
      adaptation, training sessions will be adjusted in real-time to achieve a pre-determined&#xD;
      target heart rate (HR) zone for each subject. HR will be monitored continuously during each&#xD;
      training session. The target HR intensity during training sessions will be 60% of the&#xD;
      subjects predicted maximal HR. The target HR zone will be 60% of predicated maximal HR +/-&#xD;
      5%. The subjects predicted maximal HR will be calculated using the formula: 220-age. Training&#xD;
      procedures will include drills based on gait initiation and termination, agility, muscular&#xD;
      power, and steady state actions. Drills will be conducted with an emphasis on direction&#xD;
      change beyond usual forward progression. As subjects become familiar with the various drills,&#xD;
      instructors will gradually increase the complexity, speed, and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propulsion Measures: For this study, propulsion will be defined by anterior peak positive&#xD;
      ground reaction force (GRF) during overground walking. The force plates measure the GRF in&#xD;
      response to the force placed upon it by the subject. In conjunction with motion capture&#xD;
      analysis, the propulsive phase of gait can be determined and within that phase the anterior&#xD;
      peak vector will be calculated. Peak propulsive force will be determined as the maxima (one&#xD;
      point) of the anterior GRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance Fatigability Test Scoring: Performance fatigability is the rate or extent to&#xD;
      which tissue, organ, system or total body function (fatigue) declines in response to a given&#xD;
      task. After a 10-minute period of quiet rest in the sitting position, subjects will complete&#xD;
      the 10-minute walk test. Distance covered will be recorded at the 2.5-minute interval of the&#xD;
      test and for the total test. Velocities for the entire test (total distance walked / total&#xD;
      minutes of test) and the first 2.5 minutes of the test (distance covered in the first 2.5&#xD;
      minutes / 2.5 minutes) will be calculated. The fractional change in velocity will then be&#xD;
      computed as the quotient of total test velocity / 2.5 minute velocity. For example if the&#xD;
      total test velocity and the 2.5-minute velocity were both 82 meters/minute, the total test&#xD;
      velocity would be 100% of the velocity at 2.5 minutes. However, if the total test velocity&#xD;
      were 80 meters/min and the velocity at 2.5 minutes were 82 meters/minute, then the total test&#xD;
      velocity would be only .98 of the 2.5-minute velocity. To calculate the performance&#xD;
      fatigability score, the fractional change in velocity will be divided by the distance&#xD;
      covered. Thus any 2 subjects could have similar change in velocity scores (for example 0.5)&#xD;
      but different total distances (100 versus 200 meters). In this case the performance&#xD;
      fatigability score for the first subject would be 0.5/100 = 0.005 versus .5/200 = 0.0025.&#xD;
      Scores are multiplied by 1000 to facilitate reporting. A small score indicates lower&#xD;
      fatigability. Thus, even though the fractional change in velocity was similar for the 2&#xD;
      hypothetical subjects above, fatigability was less in the second subject as demonstrated by a&#xD;
      lower performance fatigability score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Fatigability Test Scoring: Perceived fatigability is the rate or magnitude of&#xD;
      change in feelings of tiredness or weariness (symptoms of fatigue or perceived fatigue) in&#xD;
      response to a given task. After the initial 10-minute sitting rest period, subjects will rate&#xD;
      their perception of fatigue or vigor using the left side of the Fatigue and Fatigability&#xD;
      Scale. Following the 10-minute walk test, subjects will be asked &quot;compared to when you (the&#xD;
      subject) started, how would you (the subject) rate your (the subject's) level of tiredness&#xD;
      now&quot; using the right side of the scale. The left side is considered a measure of fatigue&#xD;
      because a change in fatigue was not assessed. The right side is considered to be a rating of&#xD;
      fatigability because it assesses the change in tiredness. The score for the change in&#xD;
      tiredness is then normalized to the total distance covered to calculate the perceived&#xD;
      fatigability score: perceived fatigability = (change in tiredness / total distance walked) x&#xD;
      100 (multiplied by 100 to facilitate reporting and comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Gas Exchange Analyses: Gas exchange during the 10MWT will be collected using&#xD;
      a wearable metabolic unit. The unit is calibrated prior to each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory Response to Treadmill Walking: Cardiorespiratory response during treadmill&#xD;
      walking will be measured using NIRS, ICG, ECG, and pulmonary gas exchange devices. All&#xD;
      measures are calibrated prior to each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Reported Exertion During Treadmill Walking: During the CWRT subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      rate their level of exertion using a Borg Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Skeletal Muscle Oxygenation and Hemodynamics: NIRS measurements of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation and hemodynamics will be recorded during the vascular occlusion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion capture system: Infrared cameras will capture movements of reflective markers worn by&#xD;
      subjects within the volume. Reflective markers will be placed about the subject according to&#xD;
      a predetermined full body gait marker model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG sensors for measurement of muscle activity: EMG Electrodes are secured to the subject's&#xD;
      skin over the muscle belly of interest. The sensor and electrode are covered with tape to&#xD;
      minimize movement artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force plates for GRF measurement: 4 force-plates are embedded in a 6 meter walkway. The&#xD;
      force-plates measure x, y and z axes of the force and moment components, with the output&#xD;
      signal fed into an amplifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable sensors for measurement of gait characteristics: Wearable sensors contain&#xD;
      accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Measurements are collected on the x, y, and z&#xD;
      axes at a sample rate of 128 Hz. These sensors are attached to the preselected locations on&#xD;
      the subject's body. This data is either wirelessly streamed via an access point and/or logged&#xD;
      and stored in the sensor. Participants will also wear a step counter during each training&#xD;
      sessions to record the total number of steps taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History Form: Subjects will fill out the medical history form on visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing/Forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hoehn and Yahr: The Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) is a widely used clinical rating scale, which&#xD;
      defines broad categories of motor function in Parkinson's disease. This test will be&#xD;
      administered by the researchers on visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Mini-mental State Exam: This test will be administered by researchers on visit 1&#xD;
      and is a 12-point questionnaire that addresses cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS): This test will be administered by researchers on visit 1 and is&#xD;
      a 9-item scale that measures the impact of fatigue on a person's activities and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q): This test will be administered by&#xD;
      researchers on visit 1 and is a brief survey designed to screen individuals for potential&#xD;
      contraindications for exercise participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly (PASE): This test will be administered by researchers&#xD;
      on visit 1 and is a brief survey designed to assess physical activity in older individuals.&#xD;

    <description>Locomotor training sessions use various movement drills emphasizing power, stability, and stepping in a specific direction: forward, backward, lateral, rotational. Sessions also have an additional focus on gait initiation or steady-state walking. After circuit-style warm up exercises, participants perform overground movement drills that are specific to the emphasis of the individual training session, culminating in practicing everyday overground walking. Participants wear a heart rate monitor to ensure that the majority of the training session is performed at an aerobic intensity greater than 60% age predicted heart rate maximum (220-age +/- 5 bpm).</description>
