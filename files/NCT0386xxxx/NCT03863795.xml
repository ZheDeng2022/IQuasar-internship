    <textblock>
      This trial uses an online survey to study smoking attitudes and behaviors among current&#xD;
      smokers. An online survey consisting of questions about general demographics, smoking&#xD;
      history, smoking attitudes, smoking behaviors, smoking intentions, health and qualities of&#xD;
      daily life may help researchers understand the differences in smoking attitudes and behaviors&#xD;
      among current smokers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine if self-affirmation attenuates the effects of cigarette smoking stigmatization&#xD;
      on smoking risk perceptions, pro-smoking beliefs, and intentions to change smoking behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited and pre-screened via an online crowdsourcing program called Amazon&#xD;
      Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants then respond to a one-time research survey over 20&#xD;
      minutes on SurveyGizmo, an on-line survey software platform.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quit Intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Single item assessed intentions to quit smoking, 'Are you considering quitting smoking during the next 6 months?' from the 2014-2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (1=yes, plan to stop within the next 30 days; 2=yes, plan to stop within the next 6 months, but not within 30 days; 3=no, not thinking of quitting in the next 6 months; U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Response options were reverse scored so that higher scores indicated greater intentions to quit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to Switch Completely to E-cigarettes</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;How likely are you to switch completely from using regular cigarettes to electronic cigarettes in the next 6 months?' 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to Seek Cessation Counseling</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>How likely is it that in the next 6 months you will seek counseling/support to help you quit smoking? Response options were 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to Reduce Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>How likely is it that in the next 6 months that you will reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke in a day? Response options were 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (extremely likely).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-exempting Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Deterministic beliefs regarding smoking behaviors were evaluated using the 18-item self-exempting beliefs scale (Oakes et al., 2004).Response options were 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were averaged to create a composite measure of self-exempting beliefs with excellent interitem reliability, α = .91.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Cognitions About Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of survey response within approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Five items assessed positive cognitions about smoking (Fotuhi et al., 2013). Response options were 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were averaged to create a composite measure of self-exempting beliefs with excellent interitem reliability, α = .91.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Respondents were directed to complete a 15-20 min online survey on smoking attitudes and behaviors. Participants provided electronic informed consent and then answered two questions to confirm their current smoking status. Current established smokers (smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoke every day or some days) were eligible. Eligible participants completed survey items assessing smoking characteristics and smoking self-concept.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Smoking self-concept was assessed at baseline using the Smoking Self-Concept Scale (Shadel &amp; Mermelstein, 1996), consisting of five items measuring smokers' agreement with statements representing a smoker self-schema. An example item is, 'Smoking is part of my personality.' Response options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were averaged so that higher scores indicated a stronger smoking self-concept.</description>
