  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to compare QOL and hip specific outcome measures in patients with a single or&#xD;
      recurrent episode(s) of THA dislocation and patients with a THA without any dislocation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge about the patient's own perception of both general health and more hip-related&#xD;
      issues after experiencing a hip dislocation is lacking (19). Hip surgeons need this&#xD;
      information in order to incorporate it with other objective aspects, when advising patients&#xD;
      with their first hip dislocation. Due to the large study population, this study will provide&#xD;
      solid information of what to expect after a hip dislocation and be the largest study ever&#xD;
      conducted within this topic. Depending on the results, this study may change the path we&#xD;
      choose to advise for our patients after single or recurrent dislocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A matched case-control study involving the share of THA patients with at least 1 episode of&#xD;
      hip dislocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients had undergone primary surgery in the 5-year period from 01.01.2010 - 31.12.2014&#xD;
      and subsequent dislocation was evaluated in a 2-year follow-up period. Given a 3-5%&#xD;
      approximated incidence of dislocation, 1100-1800 cases will have been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are subdivided in groups depending on the number of dislocations and one group&#xD;
      containing THA revisions. In order to be included, a time frame of at least 0,5 year since&#xD;
      the last episode of dislocation or surgery must have passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A matched control group of patients with primary THA without any event of dislocation are&#xD;
      located from the original 5-year period of primary surgery. They will be matched with the&#xD;
      group of patients with dislocation, regarding to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age (+/- 5 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Date of surgery and hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of&#xD;
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 01.01.2019, all patients included will be receiving 3 questionnaires (a generic -&#xD;
      EQ-5D, a hip-specific - HOOS, and an activity scale - UCLA) by e-boks (a mandatory secure&#xD;
      email system couplet to the patient's CPR number). Some elderly are exempt and will instead&#xD;
      receive the questionnaires by regular mail and a pre-labeled return envelope is attached.&#xD;
      Reminders are sent after 2 months.&#xD;
