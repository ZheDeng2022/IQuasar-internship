  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has appeared a new non-invasive antidepressant&#xD;
      method, which implies non-convulsive focal stimulation of the prefrontal cortex of the brain&#xD;
      through a time varying magnetic field. The method is associated with minimal side effects&#xD;
      limited to local discomfort and especially no impact on cognitive function. The method has&#xD;
      been approved for the treatment of depression in Canada, USA and a couple of European&#xD;
      countries. The department for Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital has used rTMS&#xD;
      as add-on to conventional antidepressant treatment in the outpatient clinic since 2015. A&#xD;
      single treatment course covers 20 sessions given on 20 consecutive days. The demand for daily&#xD;
      treatment and attendance for 20 days is resource demanding for both the patient and the&#xD;
      clinic. In consequence the investigators want to examine the antidepressant effect of an&#xD;
      accelerated stimulus model comparing the outcome of the standard model ( 20 days) with a&#xD;
      treatment model covering the same number of stimuli given within one week.&#xD;

      rTMS has appeared a potential new non-invasive antidepressant method, which implies&#xD;
      nonconvulsive focal stimulation of the brain through a time varying magnetic field. RTMS is&#xD;
      based on the principle of electromagnetism. An electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp&#xD;
      produces a time-varying magnetic field that penetrates the scalp and skull unattenuated and&#xD;
      gives rise to a current in the proximity of the cerebral cortex as well as functionally&#xD;
      connected parts of the brain. Research on rTMS reports of minimal side effects of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research indicates that the antidepressant effect of rTMS is associated with&#xD;
      specific stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The stimulus frequency has shown&#xD;
      to play a key role in the mechanisms of action of rTMS. Previous animal studies have shown&#xD;
      that low frequency rTMS is associated with long term inhibition of neuronal activity (long&#xD;
      term depression), while high frequency stimulation is followed by prolonged activation (long&#xD;
      term potentiation). The majority of clinically controlled studies have used high frequency&#xD;
      stimulation of the left frontal cortex, which has been approved by the USA and later in the&#xD;
      European Union for the treatment of depression. Fewer studies have used right prefrontal low&#xD;
      frequency rTMS, which has less side effects, such as local discomfort and a lower risk of&#xD;
      releasing epileptic seizures, than high frequency stimulation. Randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      and meta-analysis have shown that both stimulus models have a clinically, significant&#xD;
      antidepressant effect at the same level as antidepressant drugs, and recent research clearly&#xD;
      indicates that low frequency rTMS of the right prefrontal cortex is associated with an&#xD;
      antidepressant effect at the same level as the high frequency model. The issue indicates that&#xD;
      low frequency due to the more advantageous side effect profile should be the stimulus model&#xD;
      of choice in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department for Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital has taken part in rTMS&#xD;
      research since 1999, and the outpatient clinic has used low frequency rTMS as add-on to&#xD;
      conventional antidepressant treatment since 2015. A single treatment course covers 20&#xD;
      treatment sessions given on 20 consecutive days. The demand for daily treatment and&#xD;
      attendance in the outpatient clinic for 20 days is resource demanding both for the patient&#xD;
      and the clinic. In consequence the investigators want to examine the antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      an accelerated stimulus model comparing the antidepressant efficacy of conventional treatment&#xD;
      (20 days) with a treatment model covering the same number of stimuli given within one&#xD;
      week.The study is lightening the significance of the association between the number of&#xD;
      stimulus pulses, the length of the total treatment period and the antidepressant effect.&#xD;
      Patients suffering for depression may benefit from the outcome of the study by obtaining an&#xD;
      accelerated antidepressant effect from a less time consuming stimulus model. The outcome of&#xD;
      the study may be implemented in clinical practice from day one.&#xD;

    <description>A semistructured interview. On the basis of a systematic registration of well defined depressive symptoms through the preceding 3 days a total 17 item score and af 6-item subscale score expressing the degree of depression is calculated. The score is positively correlated to the degree af depression, Remission is defined as a total score after termination of treatment of &gt;= 8, response is defined by &gt;= 50% decrease in the total 17 item score during the treatment period</description>
