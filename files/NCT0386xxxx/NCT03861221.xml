  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to recruit about 800 volunteers with 400 malignant cases and 400 benign&#xD;
      cases (negative results included). The information acquired from those cases mainly includes:&#xD;
      image acquirement parameters, physical examination data of patients, scanning positions,&#xD;
      radiological images and diagnosis reports of CBBCT, mammography, breast ultrasound, MRI (if&#xD;
      any), pathologic reports, follow-up reports and the like. The image quality comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation and multi-observer, multi-case diagnostic comparing experiment will be processed.&#xD;
      With the pathologic report as gold standard, diagnostic comparing experiment between CBBCT&#xD;
      and mammography, breast ultrasound, MRI will be designed to determine the differences between&#xD;
      various lesions' presentation on CBBCT and on other approaches with diverse breast conditions&#xD;
      (size, density).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problems to be solved in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standardize the scanning positons, equipment parameter settings and other technical&#xD;
           essentials based on the comprehensive analysis of image data acquisition, image quality&#xD;
           and diverse patients' conditions, so as to guarantee image quality stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Summarize the breast anatomic features, typical and atypical lesions' characteristics on&#xD;
           CBBCT image based on the analysis of 3D-CBBCT data and pathologic results as well as the&#xD;
           comparing of CBBCT with other approaches, so as to establish the radiological diagnostic&#xD;
           standard of CBBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standardize the application consensus of CBBCT based on the image features, data&#xD;
           acquisition process and patients' conditions.&#xD;
