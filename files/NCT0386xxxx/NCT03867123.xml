      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 2-OHOA added to&#xD;
      first-line treatment for subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), and to determine&#xD;
      the highest safe dose of 2-OHOA administered orally when added to the concurrent phase of&#xD;
      treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) or when added to the maintenance&#xD;
      phase of treatment with TMZ (once TMZ 200 g/m2/day is started).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IB, open-label, dose-finding study. A de-escalation process has been selected&#xD;
      for the study with a 3+3 design to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of 3 subjects (within each arm), where all 3 subjects may be started at the&#xD;
      same time, will receive 2-OHOA at the starting dose of 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 0-1&#xD;
      Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the first 3 patients, then a new cohort with 3 more&#xD;
      patients is started at 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 2 or more patients out of 3 or 6 patients&#xD;
      experience DLT(s) the dose is deescalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-escalation doses are from 12 g/day (4 g tid) to 8 g/day (4 g bid) and from 8 g/day (4 g&#xD;
      bid) to 4 g/day (4 g od). This procedure must be applied to the two arms of the study&#xD;
      described below. Both arms will be independent, and will run in parallel, therefore none of&#xD;
      the patients from Arm 1 may enter Arm 2.&#xD;

             tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects in Arm 1 must have had no previous treatment except surgery (ie, no previous&#xD;
             RT, local CT, or systemic therapy). Subjects must meet certain other eligibility&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects in Arm 2 must have completed a standard first line regimen of concurrent TMZ&#xD;
             and RT for newly diagnosed GBM patients, followed by a rest phase, and have not had&#xD;
             any other previous CT except surgery (including any other regimens of RT and local or&#xD;
             systemic CT). Progression and/or pseudoprogression should have been ruled out before&#xD;
             starting Arm 2 as per usual clinical practice, with correct laboratory results&#xD;
             (absolute neutrophile count ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L,&#xD;
             non-haematological toxicity grade ≤ 2) at screening. Subjects must meet certain other&#xD;
             eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be able to undergo serial MRIs (computerized tomography may not be a&#xD;
             substitute for magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male or female ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70% and the ability to swallow oral&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must have no other diagnosis of cancer malignancy (except surgically excised&#xD;
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or treated early stage&#xD;
             prostate cancer, or a malignancy diagnosed ≥ 5 years previously with no current&#xD;
             evidence of disease and no therapy within two years prior to enrolment on this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Contraception: All female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential&#xD;
             unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea, in the&#xD;
             appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause), or have been&#xD;
             sterilized surgically. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use two&#xD;
             forms of highly effective contraception methods (a primary and a secondary method)&#xD;
             during the study and for a period of 6 months following the last administration of the&#xD;
             study drug. Male patients and their female partners, who are of childbearing potential&#xD;
             and are not practicing total abstinence, must agree to use two forms of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods (a primary and a secondary method) during the study&#xD;
             and for a period of 6 months following the last administration of the study drug These&#xD;
             contraception methods include oral, transdermal, systemic or implant contraception&#xD;
             birth control, intra-uterine devices (IUD), abstinence and double barrier method such&#xD;
             as diaphragm with spermicidal gel or other recommended double barrier methods&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Written informed consent form signed before any study test or procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             treatment of brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have progressed on TMZ are not eligible (pseudoprogression ruled out as&#xD;

             MRI. Subjects with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctate hemorrhage, or hemosiderin&#xD;
             may enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has serious intercurrent illness such as: hypertension despite optimal&#xD;
             treatment, or significant cardiac arrhythmias; or a recent history of serious disease&#xD;
             such as symptomatic congestive heart failure, or abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal&#xD;
             (GI) perforation within 6 months, prior to starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has had major surgery within 28 days prior to starting study treatment (except&#xD;

             previous surgery, or has unhealed wounds from previous surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subject has a previously-identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of&#xD;
