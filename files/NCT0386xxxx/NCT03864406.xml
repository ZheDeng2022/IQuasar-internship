      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are blood thinners. People with HIV may need to take them to treat&#xD;
      or prevent blood clots. The anti-HIV drug darunavir (DRV) can increase the amount of these&#xD;
      blood thinners in the body. This can cause bleeding or other health problems. The drug&#xD;
      cobicistat (COBI) is used to help anti-HIV drugs work better. Researchers want to give&#xD;
      healthy people DRV combined with COBI to learn how it affects rivaroxaban or apixaban blood&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test blood levels of rivaroxaban or apixaban when taken with COBI and DRV/COBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      various thromboembolic disorders. Predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      properties, coupled with a few drug drug and food-drug interactions, distinguishes DOACs from&#xD;
      a traditionally used anticoagulant, warfarin, allowing fixed dosing without routine&#xD;
      coagulation monitoring. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living as long&#xD;
      as their HIV negative counterparts due to safe and efficacious antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
      Persons with HIV are at higher risk for thromboembolic events and DOACs are a feasible option&#xD;
      for anticoagulation in this population. However, there is a lack of drug interaction and&#xD;
      safety data currently on the co-administration cobicistat (COBI)-boosted antiretroviral (ARV)&#xD;
      regimens with rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4&#xD;
      and its absorption is modulated by permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), both of which are&#xD;
      inhibited by the PK booster COBI. It is therefore possible that plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      rivaroxaban may be significantly increased when co-administered together with COBI. This is&#xD;
      of clinical concern as increased anticoagulant exposure may result in bleeding without the&#xD;
      security of routine clinical monitoring. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effects of steady state concentrations of COBI and darunavir (DRV)/COBI on the PK and PD of&#xD;
      single oral doses of rivaroxaban.&#xD;
