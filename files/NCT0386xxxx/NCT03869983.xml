  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the bioavailability of the test Product(CE-Iohexol&#xD;
      Injection) and the reference product Iohexol Injection (Omnipaque™) following intravenous&#xD;
      injection in normal healthy volunteers. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatments administered. Captisol® is present to improve stability and to&#xD;
      potentially reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury(CI-AKI) associated with&#xD;
      iohexol administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, 2-period, crossover study. A total of 24&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the study; subjects will be dosed as 2 groups of 12 subjects&#xD;
      each. Additional subjects may be enrolled into the study to obtain the statistical power of&#xD;
      90%. Subjects will attend a screening visit within 28 days prior to Period 1, and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will then return to the clinic on the evening prior to Day -1. On Day 1, prior to&#xD;
      dosing, subjects will be randomized to receive either CE-Iohexol Injection or the reference&#xD;
      product during the first treatment period and the alternate product during the second&#xD;
      treatment period. In each period, the study drug will be administered after a fasting period&#xD;
      ≥8 hours. Each dose of intravenous iohexol will be separated by a minimum of a 7-day washout&#xD;
      period. The test or reference product (iohexol 350 mg Iodine/mL, 80 mL) will be infused at a&#xD;
      high flow rate of 4 mL/second for a dose of 400 mgI/kg for 70 kg subject. The test or&#xD;
      reference product will be administered using a power injector. Plasma samples for&#xD;
      determination of iohexol concentrations will be obtained from arm #2 (the arm not used for&#xD;
      dosing) at 0 (pre-dose), 30 seconds, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,&#xD;
      12, 24, and 48 hours after infusion start; the 30-second sample obtained at the end of&#xD;
      infusion. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Day 3 following collection of the&#xD;
      48-hour blood sample.&#xD;
