  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of ultrafiltration (UF) and fluid status in peritoneal dialysis has been&#xD;
      increasingly aware of over the last two decades. There is growing body of observational&#xD;
      evidence showing that low UF is related to unfavorable outcome especially in anuric patients.&#xD;
      The other side of the problem of UF is excessive fluid removal could volume deplete patients&#xD;
      and result in loss of residual renal function and overexposing the membrane to glucose&#xD;
      unnecessarily. UF is a double-edged sword. The correct measure of UF is the bottom line of&#xD;
      talking about target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring UF is supposed to be simple and straight forward. The most common way of measuring&#xD;
      UF in clinical practice was to weight the effluent bag and minus the manufacture announced&#xD;
      fill volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until about 10 years ago, the society first aware that the measurement error in such way is&#xD;
      not acceptable. Overfil (the actual volume of dialysate fill in the bag is more than&#xD;
      announced) problem was raised from then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are several other problems around this issue. Firstly, when the product has&#xD;
      just been produced overfill is different between manufactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the overfill volume does change over transportation and storage. But it is not&#xD;
      clear how big the change is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, most of the clinics weight the dialysate effluent rather than measure the volume in&#xD;
      CAPD, although the specific gravity of dialysate is clearly not going to be 1g/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the fact measuring weight is much easier than measuring volume in CAPD, the question&#xD;
      behind is to understand how big the difference is and consequently whether it is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in the study would be asked to collect all dialysate effluent of&#xD;
      the day of their routine peritoneal dialysis adequacy study and bring to the hospital. The&#xD;
      exact weight of the bag for PET test (2.5% glucose concentration and dwell time of 4 hour)&#xD;
      before and after the dwell and volume measured of the effluent. The dialysate electrolyte,&#xD;
      glucose, protein and creatinine level would also be measured.&#xD;
