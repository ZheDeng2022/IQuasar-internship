  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib works in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in treating patients with rare genitourinary (GU) tumors that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with genitourinary tumors that have no treatment options&#xD;
      compared to giving cabozantinib, nivolumab, or ipilimumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib) combined with nivolumab&#xD;
      and ipilimumab in the first or second-line (and beyond) setting for patients within each of&#xD;
      the rare genitourinary (GU) variant histology group of interest, as measured by objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with cabozantinib&#xD;
      combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab within each rare variant histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) for patients treated with cabozantinib combined&#xD;
      with nivolumab and ipilimumab within each rare variant histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response [CR] or partial&#xD;
      response [PR] or stable disease [SD]) for patients treated with cabozantinib combined with&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab within each rare variant histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the safety of treating patients with rare variant histologies with cabozantinib&#xD;
      combined with nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To support tissue banking and collection of clinical follow-up data for GU tract rare&#xD;
      histological variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess effects of treatment in patients with bone-only disease by bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4 and on&#xD;
      days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Patients then&#xD;
      receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for cycles 1-4 and every 28 days for subsequent cycles for 2 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 5 years.&#xD;

                  menopause is defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months. Note: women who have&#xD;
                  been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens,&#xD;
                  ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women may not participate in this study because with cabozantinib, nivolumab,&#xD;
             and ipilimumab have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with cabozantinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received no cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 2&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient has received no radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received no prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor&#xD;
             within 14 days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is&#xD;
             longer, before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has received no prior treatment with hormonal therapy within 14 days or&#xD;
             five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer, before the&#xD;

             study treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain&#xD;
             biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.&#xD;
             Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to&#xD;
             confirm eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concomitant treatment with warfarin. Aspirin (up to 325 mg/day), thrombin or factor&#xD;

             John's wort) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference&#xD;
                  may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
                  procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
                  agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient&#xD;
                  is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has not experienced any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

                       treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula&#xD;
                       (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms within 28 days before randomization. Note: if initial QTcF&#xD;
                       is found to be &gt; 500 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated&#xD;
                       by at least 3 minutes should be performed. If the average of these three&#xD;
                       consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in&#xD;
