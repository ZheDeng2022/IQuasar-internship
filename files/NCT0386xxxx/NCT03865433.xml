  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine whether systematic&#xD;
      sub-threshold exercise is effective in improving recovery time in athletes after sport&#xD;
      related concussion (SRC) compared to those who participate in a placebo/stretching protocol.&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into either an Exercise group or a Placebo/stretching group.&#xD;
      subjects in the Exercise group will participate in an individualized exercise program&#xD;
      supervised by their athletic trainer while the Placebo/stretching group will engage in a&#xD;
      standardized stretching routine supervised by their athletic trainer throughout the duration&#xD;
      of their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: subjects in the aerobic Exercise group will require fewer days to recover from&#xD;
      SRC than those who follow a placebo/stretching protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: heart rate threshold (HRt) achieved on the graded treadmill test will be&#xD;
      associated with days to recovery (i.e., the lower the HRt, the longer the time to recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Vestibular Ocular Motor Screen (VOMS) performance will be indicative of time to&#xD;
      clinical recovery from concussion as evidenced by a strong correlation between VOMS score and&#xD;
      days to clinical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Sub-threshold aerobic exercise will facilitate improvement in VOMS&#xD;
      post-concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: subjects in the aerobic exercise group will demonstrate greater dynamic&#xD;
      stability as evidenced by greater reach in each of the 3 primary directions (anterior,&#xD;
      posterior medial and posterior lateral) for their right and left lower extremity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this randomized controlled trial, a random number generator will be used to randomly&#xD;
      assign subjects to either the Placebo/Stretching group or the Exercise group. Study&#xD;
      physicians will be blinded to group assignment. Each subject will be given a subject ID&#xD;
      number and will complete a brief medical history. They will then be escorted by a designated&#xD;
      health care professional who is either the site-coordinator or another health care provider&#xD;
      trained in the administration of the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) to the&#xD;
      treadmill. There, they will be fitted with an ActiGraph activity monitor to be worn&#xD;
      throughout their recovery period. The ActiGraph is a small, non-invasive unit that measures&#xD;
      human rest and activity cycles. It will be worn similarly to a wrist watch and secured in&#xD;
      place with a disposable wristband. Resting heart rate variability (HRV) will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Elite HRV app for smartphone. Trained research personnel will assist the subject&#xD;
      with fitting the Polar H7 heart rate sensor and finding a comfortable seated position. The&#xD;
      heart rate sensor will then connect with the Elite HRV app for smart phone. Once connected,&#xD;
      it will take approximately 2 minutes to record the data. Subjects will complete the BCTT in&#xD;
      the clinic at the first available testing session no earlier than 48 hours following injury.&#xD;
      VOMS and Y-Balance test will also be administered and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretching/Placebo Group Subjects assigned to the Stretching/Placebo group will be given a&#xD;
      stretching protocol and instructions to report to their athletic trainer on a daily basis as&#xD;
      soon as possible. Prior to the beginning of each intervention session, subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed using standard of care protocols which include verbal feedback, symptom scale, and&#xD;
      visual-analog scale (VAS). Subjects with a self-reported VAS of ≥7 will not stretch that day.&#xD;
      Subjects with a score of ≤ 6 will then complete a 15-25 minute stretching program under&#xD;
      supervision by the athletic trainer or other designated research personnel. Following&#xD;
      completion of the stretching program for that day, the athletic trainer will record exercise&#xD;
      duration and heart rate (HR) (as monitored by the Polar H7 Heart Rate Sensor). The stretching&#xD;
      protocol will be progressive and will change weekly as subjects continue their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Group Subjects in the exercise group will be prescribed exercise at a target heart&#xD;
      rate (THR) of approximately 80% of the achieved heart rate during the BCTT. They will be&#xD;
      given this prescription in writing to provide to their athletic trainer. Prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of each intervention session, subjects will be assessed using standard of care&#xD;
      protocols which include verbal feedback, symptom scale, and visual-analog scale. Subjects&#xD;
      with a self-reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of ≥ 7 will not exercise that day. Subjects&#xD;
      with a score of ≤ 6 will then complete 30 minutes of daily exercise (including 5 minutes of&#xD;
      warm up and 5 minutes of cool down) on an exercise bike or walking and supervised by an&#xD;
      athletic trainer. Subjects will be instructed to terminate exercise at the first sign of&#xD;
      symptom exacerbation or after 30 minutes, whichever occurs first. Athletic trainers will&#xD;
      instruct subjects to cease exercise if additional symptoms appear or if symptoms worsen. This&#xD;
      program may be modified by increasing heart rate threshold 5-10 beats per minute per week by&#xD;
      the athletic trainer as the heart rate for symptom exacerbation increases. The supervising&#xD;
      athletic trainer will record exercise duration and THR (as monitored by the Polar H7 Heart&#xD;
      Rate Sensor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to medical ethics, subjects will undergo any other individualized rehabilitation&#xD;
      recommendations made by the physician or treating physical therapist throughout their&#xD;
      individual treatment period. Common rehabilitation interventions include vestibular,&#xD;
      oculomotor, cervicogenic, and balance exercises. Subjects may undergo one or all of these&#xD;
      depending on their individual needs. Therefore, the exercise protocol identified in this&#xD;
      application is a supplement to their standard care provided by medical personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Subjects All subjects will complete the Symptom Form daily for the duration of their&#xD;
      symptom presentation. In addition to reporting to their athletic trainer, subjects will be&#xD;
      provided with a link to a secured website on which they will be asked to enter their symptoms&#xD;
      at approximately the same time each evening. An option will be to provide the surveys and&#xD;
      envelopes to complete these in hard copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When symptoms are no longer reported to the athletic trainer by the subject, the athletic&#xD;
      trainer will complete the clinical battery associated with their respective concussion&#xD;
      protocol prior to the subject's appointment with the study physician to seek clearance for&#xD;
      return to play. The study physician will conduct a standardized physical exam and determine&#xD;
      if the subject has met the following criteria for clinical recovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. normal or baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. normal neurological exam; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. can complete the BCTT without symptom exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. VOMS and Y-Balance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the clearance BCTT, subjects will have Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measured using&#xD;
      the Elite HRV app for smart phone. Trained research personnel will assist the subject with&#xD;
      fitting the Polar H7 heart rate sensor and finding a comfortable seated position. The heart&#xD;
      rate sensor will then connect with the Elite HRV app for smartphone. Once connected, it will&#xD;
      take approximately 2 minutes to record the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then begin at Stage 3 of the stepwise return to sport (RTS) strategy as&#xD;
      outlined in the Berlin guidelines and full RTS will be allowed when the subject has completed&#xD;
      each step of the stepwise RTS criteria without symptom exacerbation. Number of days from date&#xD;
      of injury to full RTS (including days in the Berlin RTS) will be recorded, analyzed, and&#xD;
      compared for the Placebo/Stretching group and the Exercise group.&#xD;
