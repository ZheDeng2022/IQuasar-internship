      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are likely to develop progressive&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency, leading to noninvasive ventilation during the night and, later,&#xD;
      during night and day. Ventilation via a mouthpiece (MPV) is an elegant option to offer&#xD;
      daytime ventilation. The patient preference regarding the ideal material for daytime MPV is&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine which ventilator, tubing support and mouthpiece&#xD;
      was most effective and preferred by patients with NMDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate MPV equipment sets were compared in 20 patients with NMDs in a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over study. The first set consisted in a non-dedicated ventilator for MPV (PB560,&#xD;
      Covidien) combined with a customized tubing support on the shoulders and a plastic angled&#xD;
      mouthpiece. The second set included an MPV-dedicated ventilator (Trilogy 100, Philips&#xD;
      Respironics) without back-up rate and kiss trigger combined with a commercially available&#xD;
      tubing support and a silicone straw mouthpiece. The Borg dyspnea score, the free time without&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation, the transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      tension (TcCO2) were recorded without and with MPV. A 17-items list assessing the patient&#xD;
      perception about MPV sets was completed.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study was to compare blood gas measurements, dyspnea score and general&#xD;
      perception between the two sets for MPV. The second aim of the study was to determine the&#xD;
      preference of patients on MPV equipment according to their free time. We also aimed at&#xD;
      collecting individual comments of patients regarding their experience with the two&#xD;
      ventilators, arm supports and mouthpieces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals affected by NMDs attending our Centre for Home Mechanical Ventilation between&#xD;
      2015 and 2018 who required daytime MPV as an extension of nocturnal NIV were considered for&#xD;
      study inclusion. Our criterion for implementing daytime ventilation was the combined presence&#xD;
      of increasing dyspnea and increasing workload on inspiratory muscles during the daytime (C)&#xD;
      or, ultimately, daytime hypercapnia in the evening when patients lay in bed before starting&#xD;
      nocturnal NIV and sleeping (M). All patients used Volume-Assisted Pressure Control mode&#xD;
      (VAPC) at night via a Covidien Puritan Bennett PB560 ventilator (Covidien, Mansfield, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria comprised patients with ineffective NIV during sleep as assessed by the&#xD;
      measurement of TcCO2&gt;49mmHg (S), patients with uncontrollable oral leaks with MPV or episode&#xD;
      of acute respiratory infection during the trials. The current study was approved by the local&#xD;
      ethics committee and registered (NÂ° registered study. Clinical trial.org follows). The&#xD;
      patients gave their written informed consent before study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design consisted in a randomized cross-over study. Patients served as their own&#xD;
      control. Measurements were made during a 48-hour hospitalization that is scheduled every 6&#xD;
      months in patients attending our Centre for Home Mechanical Ventilation. Hospitalization&#xD;
      systematically included nocturnal recordings of transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (TcCO2)&#xD;
      and pulse oximetry (SpO2). Randomized trials were decided by toss and tested during a 1-hour&#xD;
      session of assisted breathing via MPV on two separate days. Patients were seated in their&#xD;
      wheelchair and trials started with connecting patients to transcutaneous TcCO2 and SpO2&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment for MPV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different MPV equipment sets were compared (figure 1). Each set included separate&#xD;
      ventilators, tubing supports and mouthpieces. Both ventilators used volume assisted control&#xD;
      mode (VAC) according to the patient preference reported in a previous study (Q).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set consisted in a non-dedicated (NON-DED) ventilator for MPV (PB560) using a&#xD;
      single active tubing with an exhalation valve. The trigger was set on high sensitivity.&#xD;
      Solutions to avoid nuisance from disconnection alarms were used according to a report from&#xD;
      Boitano and colleagues (O). The PB560 was combined with a local custom-made tubing support in&#xD;
      thermo-formable plastic U-piece placed on the patient shoulders (figure 1 A) described in a&#xD;
      previous report (M). The mouthpiece consisted in a 22mm white angled hard plastic mouthpiece&#xD;
      (Philips Respironics; Murrysville, USA). Despite being a non MPV-dedicated set, the NON-DED&#xD;
      set was previously reported as safe and an effective (M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second set included an MPV-dedicated (DED) ventilator (Trilogy 100, Philips Respironics;&#xD;
      Murrysville, USA) with an MPV dedicated software with disconnection alarms switched off. This&#xD;
      set included a single passive tubing without exhalation valve. A back-up rate set at zero&#xD;
      cycle per minute was associated with a kiss trigger. The kiss trigger consisted in a&#xD;
      sensitive flow detection system allowing on-demand ventilation via a constant airflow&#xD;
      produced by the ventilator. When this constant flow was disrupted by the engagement and&#xD;
      disengagement of the patient's lips from the mouthpiece, a single inspiratory cycle was&#xD;
      triggered. Finally, the DED equipment included a smart flexible tube support system attached&#xD;
      via a wedge on the patient's wheelchair (figure 1 B). The tubing ended with a silicone made&#xD;
      mouthpiece designed as a straw. The backup rate in de DED equipment was copied from nighttime&#xD;
      values. Similar VAC mode, tidal volumes and inspiratory times were used in both equipment's&#xD;
      to facilitate further comparison. Trials were a succession of intermittent&#xD;
      disconnections-reconnections to the mouthpiece. All patients were encouraged to manage leaks&#xD;
      around the mouthpiece according to their breathing comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressures (MEP) were&#xD;
      measured on the first day in seated position as per ATS/ERS guidelines (T) via a heated&#xD;
      Fleisch no. 2 pneumotachometer (Metabo, Lausanne, Switzerland). The Borg dyspnea scale on 10&#xD;
      points reflecting the degree of comfortable breathing was also recorded on the first day (C).&#xD;
      Other daytime baseline measurements such as transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide tension (TcCO2) were recorded without daytime ventilation via an ear clip&#xD;
      connected to a Sentec monitoring (SenTec AG, Therwil, Swizerland). This technique was&#xD;
      validated for continuous monitoring of PaCO2 during sleep in this group of patients (U). The&#xD;
      participants were asked to determine their free time defined as the time of comfortable&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing without NIV. Finally, the maximal active mouth opening (space between&#xD;
      upper and lower teeth) was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal TcCO2 and minimal SpO2 values obtained during the trials were measured. As in day&#xD;
      1, the Borg dyspnea score was recorded to evaluate the breathing comfort during MPV trials. A&#xD;
      17-items list assessing the patient perception with a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 (0:&#xD;
      maximal dissatisfaction, 5: maximal satisfaction) was completed during the trials.&#xD;
