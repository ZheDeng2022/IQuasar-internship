      The study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to observe a population particularly exposed by the past to brain trauma and concussion:&#xD;
           Motorsport Pilots who are retired from a professional practice of motor sport;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to report results of their neuro-cognitive evaluations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if specific profiles emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate potential consequences of these traumas' history at a cerebral, physical and&#xD;
           psychological level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the contribution of the various examinations performed as part of a&#xD;
           concussion assessment in routine care (eye-tracking, brain imaging, Neuropsychological&#xD;
           Assessment).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Memory Center of the Rainier III Center and The Department of Nuclear Medicine of the&#xD;
      Princess Grace Hospital are particularly aware of evaluation, management and monitoring of&#xD;
      patients who have suffered brain trauma, or concussions, and the study of possible long-term&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They regularly receive patients, referred by neurologists or spontaneously coming for&#xD;
      consultation, for whom the carrying out of a complete in-depth evaluation is recommended,&#xD;
      because of their medical history and their personal history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with the &quot;Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile&quot; (FIA) and the &quot;Automobile&#xD;
      Club of Monaco&quot; (ACM), the Princess Grace Hospital team hopes ultimately to set up a&#xD;
      screening campaign for traumatic brain injuries among a particularly exposed population:&#xD;
      motorsports people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, inspired by the work carried out by the Cambridge University team (the&#xD;
      Rescue Racer Study) and the FIA recommendations, the Sponsor wishes to carry out an&#xD;
      observational study with retired motor sportspeople.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to study a population particularly exposed by the past to brain trauma and&#xD;
      concussion (who is retired from a professional practice of motor sport), to report results of&#xD;
      their neuro-cognitive evaluations, and to determine if specific profiles emerge, to evaluate&#xD;
      potential consequences of these traumas' history at a cerebral, physical and psychological&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
