  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of an insulin self-titration education&#xD;
      program on glycemic control, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The quasi-experimental design was adapted. A convenient sample of 120 patients with&#xD;
      insulin-treated type 2 diabetes was recruited from a general hospital in Taiwan. Among them,&#xD;
      60 were in the insulin self-titration group, and 60 were in the comparison group. Data on&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), self-efficacy, and self-care behavior were collected at&#xD;
      baseline, three-month, and six-month follow-up. The study instruments included the Insulin&#xD;
      Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and Diabetes Self-Care questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes were recruited as the intervention&#xD;
      participants and enrolled in the insulin self-titration program. Sixty propensity&#xD;
      score-matched patients treated with traditional insulin therapy without self-titration were&#xD;
      recruited as the control participants. Data on HbA1C and hypoglycemia were collected at&#xD;
      baseline and during follow-ups at three and six months. Data on self-efficacy and self-care&#xD;
      were collected at the six-month follow-up using self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were recruited: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes;&#xD;
      (3) treatment with insulin injection for &gt; six months; (4) HbA1C &gt; 7.5% in the last three&#xD;
      months; and (5) ability to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insulin self-titration education program includes a 60-min small-group lesson, a 20-min&#xD;
      individual instruction. Patients in the comparison group received usual care at the Diabetes&#xD;
      Health Education Center. During a 15-min individual education, these patients were taught how&#xD;
      to self-inject insulin and test and record their before-breakfast and before-dinner blood&#xD;
      glucose levels daily at home Data on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and the number of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia were collected at baseline, three-month, and six-month follow-up. Data on&#xD;
      self-efficacy and self-care were collected at the six-month follow-up, using the&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the&#xD;
      hospital where the data were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed by using the SPSS 21.0 software. Descriptive analyses were used to&#xD;
      describe the research variables. Chi-Square and independent t-test were used to analyze the&#xD;
      baseline equilibriums between the two groups. Independent t-tests were used to analyze&#xD;
      between-group differences in HbA1C at each time point. A generalized estimating equation&#xD;
      (GEE) was used to analyze between-group differences in HbA1C change over time. The&#xD;
      independent t-test was used to analyze the difference between the two groups of participants&#xD;
      in the post-testing diabetes self-efficacy and self-care.&#xD;

    <description>The Chinese version of the Insulin Management Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale (IMDSES) was used to assess a participant's degree of confidence in the ability of self-controlled diabetes. The 28-item scale includes six subscales: general self-efficacy, dietary self-efficacy, insulin self-efficacy, blood glucose monitoring self-efficacy, exercise self-efficacy, and foot self-efficacy. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (completely unsure) to 100 (very sure). The average score of all items represents the scale sore, with a possible range of 0 to 100. The higher the score the better the self-efficacy. In this study, the Cronbach's α of this scale was 0.89, and the Cronbach's α value of each sub-scale was between 0.69 and 0.95.</description>

    <description>The Chinese version of the revised Diabetes Self-Care Scale (DSC) was used to measure a participant's self-care behavior. The 28-item scale includes six subscales: general self-care, self-care for diet, self-care for insulin adjustment, self-care for blood glucose monitoring, self-care for exercise, and self-care for the feet. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (not done at all) to 100 (completely done). The average score of all items represents the scale score, with a possible range of 0 to 100. The higher the score the better the self-care behavior. In this study, the Cronbach's α of this scale was 0.89, and the Cronbach's α value of each subscale was between 0.69 and 0.86.</description>
