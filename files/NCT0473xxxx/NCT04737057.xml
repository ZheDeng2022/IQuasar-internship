    <textblock>
      This study will compare two non- invasive treatment options: Hall technique and 38% Silver&#xD;
      diamine fluoride. Both are methods used to create a more favorable environment without&#xD;
      removal of caries leading to the arrest of the progression of demineralization process and&#xD;
      restoring the function of the diseased molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, it can occur in primary teeth in early childhood,&#xD;
      is formed through interaction between acid-producing bacteria and carbohydrate. The caries&#xD;
      develops in both the crowns and roots of teeth. Progress of caries depended on the lifestyle&#xD;
      of the child (as high numbers of cariogenic bacteria, inadequate salivary flow, insufficient&#xD;
      fluoride exposure and poor oral hygiene). To avoid this disease should follow the proper oral&#xD;
      hygiene and improve lifestyle . A lot of methods found to treatment the decayed tooth - like;&#xD;
      Hall technique and Silver diamine fluoride The first report on the Hall Technique published&#xD;
      in 2007 by a general dental practitioner from Aberdeen/Scotland, Dr. Norna Hall. Dr. Hall&#xD;
      used PMCs to restore carious primary molars rather than using the standard technique, placed&#xD;
      them using a simplified method2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have recommended that Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution would exert a&#xD;
      preventive result in managing early childhood caries ECC. However, no well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trials have yet been performed to study the effect of SDF on caries prevention. the objective&#xD;
      is useful in arresting early childhood caries (ECC)&#xD;

    <description>The Hall Technique is a non-invasive treatment for decayed molar teeth. Decay is sealed under preformed (stainless steel) crowns, avoiding injections and drilling. It is one of a number of biologically orientated strategies for managing dental decay</description>

    <description>this technique is performed through :1) Orthodontic separator being stretched between two pieces of floss, then placed between the contact points of primary molars (for five days.) 2)The correct size of crown will not impinge on the teeth on either side, and a slight 'spring back' will be felt when the PMC is gently pushed up to (but not through) the contact points and the PMC has been filled with a Riva self-cure capsule cement, extruded cement is quickly wiped away and the child is asked to keep biting on the crown for two minutes, until the cement is set, to prevent 'spring back' of the PMC from the fully seated position</description>
