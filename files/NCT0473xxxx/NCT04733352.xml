      the distal-acupoint treatment group infer pain relief and blood-flow improvement. The scores&#xD;
      of the Visual Analog Scale were decreased, and the passive and active range of knee motions&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, commonly used Omics techniques, including genomics, proteomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics, have been applied in the studies on the mechanism of acupuncture effect. In the&#xD;
      previous study, &quot;Immediate effects of proximal and distal acupoints on the Radial Pressure&#xD;
      Pulse-wave in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial&quot;, significant&#xD;
      changes in the spectral-energy of the pulse wave in the proximal-acupoint treatment group and&#xD;
      the distal-acupoint treatment group infer pain relief and blood-flow improvement. The scores&#xD;
      of the Visual Analog Scale were decreased, and the passive and active range of knee motions&#xD;
      were increased. Both of the proximal and distant acupoints could be used for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis treatment. To advance the previous work by becoming one treatment, this study&#xD;
      will explore if there is any Omics difference resulting from the two acupoints, thus&#xD;
      examining the mechanism of curative effect of acupuncture. Additionally, Chinese medical&#xD;
      emphasizes the relationship between body constitution and diseases and the dynamic change of&#xD;
      pulses and meridians during the disease development. These significances are in agreement&#xD;
      with Omics features about organism integrity, dynamic, and complexity. The current study will&#xD;
      adopt a Chinese medical body constitution survey, the spectral-energy (SE) changes of the&#xD;
      pressure wave from the radial artery, and the pulse energy analysis of Ryodoraku to identify&#xD;
      the differences in specific genes, protein, and metabolites of various body constitutions,&#xD;
      pulses, changes of the pressure wave, aiming to set up the objectification of Chinese medical&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 60 participants, which will be recruited when they meet the Clinical&#xD;
      Classification Criteria for KOA, that is knee pain and three out of six symptoms can be found&#xD;
      in clinical practices, as recommended by the American College of Rheumatology:(a) any gender&#xD;
      aged 50 years or above;(b) have less than 30 minutes of morning stiffness; (c) crepitus on&#xD;
      active motion; and (d) bony tenderness;(e) bony enlargement; and (f) no palpable warmth. They&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two groups: the distal-acupoint treatment group (DG) (LI11, HT3&#xD;
      and TE10 and the proximal-acupoint treatment group (PG) (GB34, SP9 and EX-LE2). The study&#xD;
      will last for five weeks. Each week has two sessions, as a total of ten sessions. The&#xD;
      participants will have blood tests in the following times: before the first acupuncture,&#xD;
      after the fifth acupuncture and the tenth acupuncture, three weeks after the end of&#xD;
      treatment. The study design is random and single-blind. The participants The primary outcome&#xD;
      will come from the assessment: comparing the expressed differences of the genes, proteins,&#xD;
      and metabolites of the two acupoints. The secondary outcome will be from the connection among&#xD;
      1) the expressed differences of the specific genes, proteins, 2) the survey of Chinese&#xD;
      medical body constitution, 3) the spectral-energy (SE) changes of the pressure wave from the&#xD;
      radial artery, and 4) the Ryodoraku pulse energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the principle and techniques of Omics to explore the mechanism of the&#xD;
      curative effect caused by acupuncture on different acupoints. It is expected to serve as a&#xD;
      bridge to connect between contemporary medical and traditional medical.&#xD;
