  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation aims to investigate the effect of high intensity laser therapy on&#xD;
      radicular symptoms, neuropathic pain, cervical range of motion and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with cervical radiculopathy compared to cervical therapeutic exercises.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most cases of cervical radiculopathy are due to cervical spondylosis or disc herniation. As&#xD;
      the age progresses, disintegration of the disc causes a decrease in disc height and foraminal&#xD;
      narrowing. The decreased disc height then results in hypertrophy due to vertebral loading in&#xD;
      the intervertebral joints of Luschka. This leads to foraminal stenosis and cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy.If cervical radiculopathy is due to disc herniation, its mechanism is explained&#xD;
      by the impact of the nerve root with the disc material and causing nerve damage by both&#xD;
      mechanical and chemical effects.Non-operative treatment of cervical radiculopathy consists of&#xD;
      a number of different modalities including immobilization, physical therapy, traction,&#xD;
      manipulation,drug therapy, cervical steroid injection and laser therapy.The physiological&#xD;
      effects of high intensity laser therapy(HILT) reduce the release of histamine and bradykinin&#xD;
      from inflammatory tissue and increase the pain threshold. In addition, laser light reduces&#xD;
      the secretion of substance P from peripheral nociceptors, thereby reducing the perception of&#xD;
      pain and preventing the development of hyperalgesia. The laser analgesic effect is due to the&#xD;
      increased secretion of endogenous opioids such as β-endorphins, where pain is centrally&#xD;
      inhibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation was designed double-blind prospective sham controlled randomized study.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized into 3 groups: HILT + therapeutic exercise, sham HILT +&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise, and only therapeutic exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As evaluation parameters, cervical range of motion, Visual Pain Scale (VAS) Neck, Visual Pain&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) Arm, SF (Short form) -36 Quality of Life Scale, Pain Detect Pain questionnaire,&#xD;
      Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale ) will be evaluated with.It was planned that the&#xD;
      evaluations were made and recorded by a blinded physician to the groups at the beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment, at the end of the treatment and at the 3rd month controls.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale for pain (0-10 mm; 0 means no pain, 10 means severe pain) which is used to measure musculoskeletal pain with very good reliability and validity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline quality of life (short form 36 (SF-36)) at 4th and 12th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-administered scale, which is widely used to measure the quality of life. It was developed to measure the quality of life in patients who have physical illnesses; however, it can also be successfully used in healthy individuals and patients who have psychiatric diseases. SF-36 includes 36 items and surveys eight domains of health, such as physical functionality, physical role limitations, pain, general health, vitality, social functionality, emotional role limitations, and mental health. Total score was between 0 ( disability) and 100 (no disability). Every subgroup of the questionnaire has a score scale between 0 and 100. Every increase in the subgroup of SF-36 questionnaire, which is a positive scoring system, indicates increase in quality of life related to health.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is designed to measure neck-specific disability. The questionnaire has 10 items concerning pain and activities of daily living including personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work status, driving, sleeping and recreation. Each question measures from 0 to 5, the total score out of 100 is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale(CRIS) at 4th and 12th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale (CRIS) is developed a self-report questionnaire which covers the measurement of symptoms and limitations in patients with cervical radiculopathy due to irradiating pain, tingling sensations and sensory loss in the arm in combination with neck disability. It is divided into 3 subgroups as symptoms, energy&amp;posture and activities &amp;actions consist of 21 items. Every subgroup of the questionnaire has a score scale between 0 and 100 Each question measures from 0 to 5 is calculated. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Pain detect questionnaire (PD-Q) at 4th and 12th weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>It's used to detect neuropathic pain components in chronic neck pain. It contains 2 items related to the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pain pattern and 7 sensory descriptive items. Minimum 0 and maximum of 38 points can be obtained. Higher scores mean worse outcome. PD-Q cut-off scores are ≤ 12 (a neuropathic component is unlikely) and ≥ 19 (a neuropathic component is likely).</description>
