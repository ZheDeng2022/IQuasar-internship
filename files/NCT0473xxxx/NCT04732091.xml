  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies have demonstrated that high mechanical index (MI) impulses from a&#xD;
      diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) transducer during an intravenous microbubble infusion&#xD;
      (sonothrombolysis) can restore epicardial and microvascular flow in acute ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The investigators propose to demonstrate the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of sonothrombolysis in multiple centers and in a wide scenario of&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial safety and feasibility human studies demonstrated that intermittent high MI aimed at&#xD;
      the myocardial microcirculation could improve capillary blood flow within the risk area and&#xD;
      epicardial recanalization rates. In light of this, the investigators published the first&#xD;
      prospective randomized human study showing the added value of sonothrombolysis to&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Sonothrombolysis improved recanalization rates and&#xD;
      reduced infarct size, leading to sustained improvements in systolic function after STEMI.&#xD;
      Since both diagnostic ultrasound and intravenous infusions of microbubbles are Class I&#xD;
      indication to assess regional and global left ventricular function and risk area in patients&#xD;
      with STEMI, the purpose of this study is to 1) demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      sonothrombolysis in multiple centers and in a wide scenario of acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      including pre-hospital care setting; and 2) develop a portable non-imaging ultrasound device&#xD;
      prototype, simple-to-handle and capable of generating intermittent ultrasound pulses for&#xD;
      sonothrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 540 subjects will be included in this study. Subjects will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive DUS guided high MI impulses within and outside the risk area during a continuous&#xD;
      infusion of intravenous 3% Definity® or placebo. Comparisons between the two groups will be&#xD;
      made on door to dilation times, survival, angiographic recanalization rates at initial&#xD;
      angiography and reduction in microvascular obstruction and in infarct size determined by the&#xD;
      salvageability index at cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) post-STEMI and using&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging. The effect of high-energy ultrasound therapy and microbubbles&#xD;
      on the outcome of sympathetic hyperactivation and autonomic imbalance after MI will be also&#xD;
      evaluated. Cardiac remodeling assessed by left atrial and ventricular volumes indexes and&#xD;
      myocardial strain imaging will also be measured. Overall survival defined as the time from&#xD;
      the start of treatment to death from any cause as well as new MIs events will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 6 subprojects: subproject 1 (n=70 in each group) - safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound and microbubbles in&#xD;
      the recanalization of acute STEMI treated with primary PCI. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the effect of sonothrombolysis on autonomic function, cardiac function and&#xD;
      intracellular signaling. All patients will receive conventional PCI approach, including&#xD;
      aspirin 325 milligram, clopidogrel 600 milligrams and heparin bolus (5000 units), followed by&#xD;
      primary PCI using glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitors as anti-thrombotic agents using established&#xD;
      protocols. Besides angiographic recanalization rates at the time of presentation to the&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory, participants will have a fully echocardiography study including&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging and strain imaging, serum microRNAS for detecting endothelial&#xD;
      cells shear-stress and autonomic control assessment (heart rate and systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      variability) at the baseline, 72-96 hours, 30 days and 6 months of follow up. A iodine-123&#xD;
      meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy will be carried out at 30 days and 6&#xD;
      months follow up, and exercise echocardiogram at 6 months. Subproject 2 (n=70 in each group)&#xD;
      - safety and efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound and&#xD;
      microbubbles in the recanalization of acute STEMI in patients initially treated in a primary&#xD;
      hospital with fibrinolytic therapy within 12 hours. Angiographic recanalization rates at&#xD;
      initial angiography and in infarct size determined by the salvageability index at cardiac MRI&#xD;
      post-STEMI, and cardiac death and a new MI episode are the main objectives. Participants will&#xD;
      receive STEMI/PCI treatment as per current guidelines using standard protocols similar to&#xD;
      subproject 1. In addition, both groups will undergo elective PCI after fibrinolytic therapy.&#xD;
      Besides angiographic recanalization rates at the time of presentation to the catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory, a comprehensive echocardiography study including myocardial perfusion and strain&#xD;
      imaging, MRI and exercise echocardiogram will be performed at the time of presentation and&#xD;
      during 72-96 hours, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months of follow up. Subproject 3 (n=70 in each&#xD;
      group) - safety and efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound&#xD;
      and microbubbles in the recanalization of acute myocardial infarction without segment&#xD;
      elevation or with high-risk unstable angina (NSTEMI). Subjects presenting without persistent&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes undergoing early invasive strategy within 24&#xD;
      hours will be randomized to either receive diagnostic ultrasound guided high MI impulses&#xD;
      during a continuous infusion of intravenous 3% Definity® or placebo. Participants will&#xD;
      receive conventional medical treatment, including aspirin 325 milligram, clopidogrel 600&#xD;
      milligrams and unfractionated heparin weight-adjusted iv. bolus or in combination with&#xD;
      glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitors followed by primary PCI using established protocols as per&#xD;
      current guidelines. A comprehensive echocardiography study including myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      echocardiography and exercise echocardiogram will be carried out at the baseline, 72-96&#xD;
      hours, 30 days- and 6 months of follow up. Subproject 4 (n=30 in each group): safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound and microbubbles in&#xD;
      reducing microvascular obstruction and myocardial infarction size after primary PCI in&#xD;
      patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Participants will receive STEMI/PCI&#xD;
      approach as per guidelines likewise subprojects 1 and 2. In order to assess microvascular&#xD;
      obstruction and no reflow phenomenon, a comprehensive echocardiography study, including&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging and myocardial strain will be performed at baseline, 2 months&#xD;
      and 6 months of follow up. MRI will be performed at 3 days and 3 months of follow up.&#xD;
      Subproject 5: this subproject will be dedicated to the development of an automated hands-free&#xD;
      portable prototype emitting ultrasound waves of intermittent high-energy capable of promoting&#xD;
      sonothrombolysis. Subproject 6 (n=30 in each group): a pilot study on the therapeutic use of&#xD;
      intermittent high-energy ultrasound and microbubbles in the recanalization of acute STEMI in&#xD;
      the pre-hospital setting (ambulances). Subjects with acute STEMI will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive diagnostic ultrasound guided high MI impulses during a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      intravenous 3% Definity® or placebo while routing from the ambulance to the emergency&#xD;
      department. At the admission hospital, all patients will receive conventional PCI approach,&#xD;
      including aspirin 325 milligram, clopidogrel 600 milligrams and heparin bolus (5000 units),&#xD;
      followed by primary PCI using glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitors as anti-thrombotic agents using&#xD;
      established protocols as per aforementioned subprojects. A complete echocardiography study&#xD;
      including myocardial perfusion and strain, and exercise echocardiogram will be carried out at&#xD;
      baseline, 72-96 hours, 30 days- and 6 months of follow up.&#xD;
