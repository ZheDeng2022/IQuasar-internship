  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the UK is on the rise. Within 20 years of&#xD;
      diabetes diagnosis, nearly all people with type 1 and almost two thirds of people with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (60%) have some degree of DR. NHS guidelines mandate annual DR screening in all&#xD;
      patients aged 12 and above to prevent complications of DR. Screening for DR in England&#xD;
      involves labour-intensive manual grading of retinal images through the teleophthalmology&#xD;
      platform. Automated retinal image analysis systems with the use of artificial intelligence&#xD;
      (AI) may offer an alternative to manual grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a portable, hand-held fundus&#xD;
      camera with integrated artificial intelligence for diabetic retinopathy screening by&#xD;
      comparing it against the current standard i.e diagnosis provided by trained human graders&#xD;
      evaluating the standard photographs/ophthalmologists.&#xD;

      Study will enroll diabetic patients (new and established) meeting the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      who would provide an informed consent to participate in the study. This would include&#xD;
      subjects who visit the endocrinology clinic and had either their retina evaluated by a&#xD;
      teleophthalmology consult or visited the ophthalmology clinic for an indirect ophthalmoscopic&#xD;
      fundus evaluation in the past 3 months. Subjects whose fundus has been recently evaluated in&#xD;
      the past 3 months will also be re-called to the endocrinology clinic to get a fundus image&#xD;
      captured on the Remidio NM FOP-10 device. Images will be captured by an operator who will be&#xD;
      provided training in using the device prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-mydriatic fundus images are captured using a pre-defined imaging protocol. One disc&#xD;
      centered and one macula centred 45 deg image is taken for each eye. The images are then&#xD;
      submitted to an AI system for analysis that runs locally on the Remidio FOP. An initial image&#xD;
      quality assessment is performed by the AI. If the image is of sufficient quality then the AI&#xD;
      will give an output of either 'signs of DR detected' (that would include moderate NPDR,&#xD;
      severe NPDR, PDR and/or DME present) or no signs of diabetic retinopathy detected (that would&#xD;
      include no DR, mild DR, absence of DME). If the image is of insufficient quality, then the&#xD;
      operator makes 2 more attempts using the same imaging protocol. The images that are output as&#xD;
      insufficient quality will be noted. All subjects who have provided consent for dilation are&#xD;
      then instilled with a single drop of 1% tropicamide solution. After 20 mins, mydriatic 2&#xD;
      field (one disc centered and one macula centered) fundus images are captured and submitted to&#xD;
      the AI for analysis along the same lines of non-mydriatic imaging. If the image is of&#xD;
      insufficient quality then the operator makes 2 more attempts using the same imaging protocol.&#xD;
      The images that are output as insufficient quality will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified patient data including age, gender, ethnicity and lens status (Cataract grade,&#xD;
      pseudophakia, aphakia) along with the final diagnosis made by a certified&#xD;
      grader/ophthalmologist during clinical examination/teleophthalmology are retrieved from the&#xD;
      NHS database. This DR diagnosis will act as a reference standard against which the AI output&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry of subjects will be performed by approved trained Site Personnel. The&#xD;
      de-identified data is stored onto an electronic data capture system (EDC). Approved Site&#xD;
      Personnel will have a user specific log-in name and password to access the electronic data&#xD;
      capture (EDC) system in order to enter study data. The principal investigator will ensure&#xD;
      that all aspects of the study are complied with. The study will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with applicable regulatory requirements and established rules for Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (GCP).&#xD;
