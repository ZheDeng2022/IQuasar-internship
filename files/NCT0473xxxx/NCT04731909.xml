    <measure>Overall Survival(OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time interval from randomization to death. If the patient continues to survive or his life or death is unknown, the date of death will be reviewed using the latest point in time when the patient is still alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate(ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the number of cases achieving CR, or PR, as a percentage of patients with evaluable efficacy. Disease remission and progress will be evaluated based on RECIST standards.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate(DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of cases that achieved remission (PR+CR) and stable disease (SD) after treatment accounted for the number of evaluable cases. In short, DCR=CR+PR+SD. And the RECIST standard is to maintain at least 4 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progress Free Survival(PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the time interval from randomization of patients to disease progression or death, whichever comes first. There was no progress or the time of disease progression was not recorded when the trial was withdrawn, and the date of the last examination was used as the end date.</description>
