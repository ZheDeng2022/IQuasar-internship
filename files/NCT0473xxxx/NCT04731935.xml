  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether tAN via the tragus (vagal) and&#xD;
      auriculotemporal (trigeminal) nerve pathways results in a clinically meaningful reduction in&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a pilot, single-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, clinical&#xD;
      trial in which subjects will be consented, receive a baseline assessment, and receive tAN&#xD;
      treatment and assessment every day during their 3 to 5-day detox treatment. Use of&#xD;
      opioid-based medication assisted therapy (MAT) will not be permitted at any point during the&#xD;
      study. Use of non-opioid-based MATs (i.e. comfort or rescue medications) will not be&#xD;
      permitted until after the subject has completed the 60 minute COWS assessment to ensure&#xD;
      changes in COWS score at 60 minutes are only the result of tAN therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percent change in clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) score from baseline to 60 minutes after start of tAN therapy. The COWS is an 11-item scale with a score range between 0 and 48. Total score is the sum of all the items and a higher score indicates more severe withdrawal symptoms. Scores between 5 and 12 indicate mild withdrawal, scores between 13 and 24 indicate moderate withdrawal, scores between 25 and 36 indicate moderately severe withdrawal and scores greater than 36 indicate severe withdrawal. A COWS score reduction of 15% or greater for a given individual is considered clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in depression symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) total score from baseline to Day 5. The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. Each of the nine items is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. A total score is calculated by summing the nine items. Scores range from 0 to 27 and higher scores indicate a higher degree of depression.</description>

    <measure>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in PTSD symptoms measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) total symptom severity score from baseline to Day 5. The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Each of the 20 items is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) scale. A total symptom severity score is calculated by summing the 20 items. Scores range from 0 and 80 and higher scores indicating a higher degree of PTSD symptomology. Evidence suggests that a10-20 point reduction in score represents a clinically significant change in PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in WHOQOL-BREF domain scores (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, environment, and overall QoL/general health) from baseline to Day 5. The World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) is a 26-item, self-report questionnaire which assesses 4 quality of life domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. In addition, there are 2 items that measure overall quality of life and general health. Subjects rate how much they have experienced each item in the preceding 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely). Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction with higher scores denoting higher quality of life. Raw domain scores will be converted to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>
