  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study aims to investigate whether dietary registration can be performed with greater&#xD;
      precision using digital registration units (mobile devices), rather than conventional paper&#xD;
      based dietary registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention is based in the M3 rehabilitation unit, as part of Hobro hospital. The&#xD;
      intervention will proceed until 6 full-day dietary registrations have been collected per&#xD;
      patient (40 patients total), 3 for each registration method. The estimated time requirement&#xD;
      is 30 days.&#xD;

      Study aims to investigate whether dietary registration can be performed with greater&#xD;
      precision using digital registration units (mobile devices), rather than conventional paper&#xD;
      based dietary registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These mobile devices have been equipped with a dietary registration app, developed by the&#xD;
      company Movesca ApS, specializing in digital healthcare solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses, and other relevant staff members at the M3 rehabilitation unit at Hobro hospital,&#xD;
      will be testing this alternative registration method, as they engage in their day-to-day&#xD;
      dietary registration for in-house patients. The data collection requires 6 full-day dietary&#xD;
      registrations from each individual patient (40 patients in total). Of these 6 registrations,&#xD;
      3 will be gathered using mobile devices and 3 using conventional paper based registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primary endpoint is precision. The golden standard is dietary recall. The two&#xD;
      methods will be assessed in accordance with their uniformity to the dietary recalls, which&#xD;
      will be performed by the investigators following the meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a preemptive measure, an internal retrospective audit was performed, with dietary&#xD;
      registration as the objective. This audit was completed to retrieve baseline data on dietary&#xD;
      registration, and determine whether the rehabilitation unit conforms to the regulations set&#xD;
      by the region.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Modified crossover study model, containing two similar patient groups, exposed to identical diet registration methods, but in opposite sequence.&#xD;
Group 1: 3 days of digital dietary registration using mobile devices, followed by 3 days of conventional paper based dietary registration.&#xD;
Group 2: 3 days of conventional paper based dietary registration, followed by 3 days of digital dietary registration, using mobile devices.&#xD;
Each individual patient acts as his/her own control, with regards to the primary endpoint; precision. However patients are divided into two groups, in order to accommodate the study secondary endpoint; progression of nutritional condition, which is evaluated with regards to the registration method used. This requires two arms, where each arm experiences opposite registration method sequences</intervention_model_description>
