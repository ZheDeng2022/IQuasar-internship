  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic recurrent systemic inflammatory disease. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      meat, dairy products, fiber and vitamin D may affect the risk of Crohn's disease. The&#xD;
      relationship between other dietary components and disease activity or recurrence in Chron's&#xD;
      disease has not been fully studied. Although the patient's diet will affect the degree of&#xD;
      disease activity, there is still no recognized daily diet model for CD patients. At present,&#xD;
      the change of intestinal microbiome is considered to be one of the causes of IBD, and this&#xD;
      change provides a theoretical basis for diet to reduce the inflammatory response in CD&#xD;
      patients through the regulation of microbiome. Food driven inflammation may affect the&#xD;
      activity of the disease. Brain-gut axis interaction may play an important role in CD and may&#xD;
      have an effect on the cerebrovascular system. The investigators aim to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) based dietary suggestions on disease&#xD;
      activity and cerebrovascular function as well as changes of intestinal flora and its&#xD;
      metabolites amongst Chron's disease participants of all ages.&#xD;

      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic recurrent systemic inflammatory disease, mainly affecting&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract, accompanied by extra-intestinal complications and immune&#xD;
      dysfunction. The relationship between other dietary components and disease activity or&#xD;
      recurrence has not been fully studied and there is still no recognized daily diet model for&#xD;
      CD. At present, the change of intestinal microbiome is considered to be one of the causes of&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), and this change provides a theoretical basis for diet to&#xD;
      reduce the inflammatory response those with CD through the regulation of microbiome. In&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, the potential inflammation of food may affect the activity of the&#xD;
      disease. Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) is a dietary inflammation index based&#xD;
      on food group. 18 food groups were selected to evaluate the levels of inflammatory factors in&#xD;
      human body which have already been verified by two independent female and male cohorts. The&#xD;
      construction and validation of the scoring model revealed a strong correlation between EDIP&#xD;
      and three plasma inflammatory markers: IL-6, CRP and TNFaR2, as well as other markers, such&#xD;
      as adiponectin and the overall inflammatory marker score. Therefore, EDIP can be derived in a&#xD;
      standardized way in different populations and be used to examine association with diseases&#xD;
      whose pathogenesis is mainly attributed to chronic inflammation. Dietary inflammation index&#xD;
      (DII) is a previously developed inflammation index based on nutrients. Compared to DII,&#xD;
      dietary patterns based on food groups, such as EDIP, are more valuable for the establishment&#xD;
      of dietary guidelines for health promotion and disease prevention. In addition, the brain-gut&#xD;
      axis is the kink between the central nervous system and intestinal function but has not been&#xD;
      extensively studied. In view of the fact that autoimmune diseases, and brain-gut axis&#xD;
      interaction may play an important role in CD, we speculate that cerebrovascular function may&#xD;
      also change during the occurrence and development of CD, especially during the EDIP&#xD;
      score-based diet. The investigators plan to carry out a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      systematically study the effects of EDIP score-based dietary suggestions on disease activity&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular function of CD patients, as well as the changes of intestinal flora and&#xD;
      its metabolites. The primary aim of this study is to systematically study the effects of EDIP&#xD;
      based dietary recommendations on disease activity and cerebrovascular function of CD patients&#xD;
      and establish a diet model suitable for CD patients. The secondary aims are to explore the&#xD;
      possible changes of intestinal flora and its metabolites, and evaluate the changes of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular function and the possible mechanism of their actions on CD.&#xD;
