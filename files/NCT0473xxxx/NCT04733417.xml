  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of SHR6390 combined with&#xD;
      famitinib in the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer that progress in 1-2 line&#xD;
      endocrine therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, Simon's two-stage design, phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR6390 combined&#xD;
      with famitinib in the treatment of HR+/HER2 advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients who&#xD;
      have progressed during or after 1-2 line endocrine therapy. Subjects will be treated until&#xD;
      disease progression, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and&#xD;
      investigators determine that medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
