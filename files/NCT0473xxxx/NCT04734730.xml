    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of talazoparib with androgen deprivation therapy and&#xD;
      abiraterone in treating castration sensitive prostate cancer patients. Talazoparib is an&#xD;
      inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes&#xD;
      damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing&#xD;
      them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Androgen can cause the growth of&#xD;
      prostate tumor cells. Degarelix, leuprolide acetate, bicalutamide, goserelin acetate, and&#xD;
      abiraterone lowers the amount of androgen made by the body. This may help stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells that need androgen to grow. Giving talazoparib with androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      and abiraterone may improve cancer control for patients with castration sensitive prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Increase the efficacy of first-line therapy for men with metastatic castration-sensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer by adding the PARP inhibitor talazoparib to standard therapy with androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) + abiraterone acetate (abiraterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study the efficacy of abiraterone and talazoparib in an ethnically diverse population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate whether androgen receptor genetic variation may identify a subpopulation of&#xD;
      patients who benefit, even in the absence of homologous repair deficiency mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD), abiraterone acetate PO QD, and&#xD;
      prednisone PO QD on days 1-28. Patients also receive androgen deprivation therapy consisting&#xD;
      of degarelix subcutaneously (SC) on day 1; leuprolide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1&#xD;
      and bicalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and then leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles; leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 and bicalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and then leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of cycles 2, 5, 8, and 11; or goserelin&#xD;
      acetate SC monthly or every 3 months. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

                  metastatic prostate cancer prior to registration. The start date of medical&#xD;
