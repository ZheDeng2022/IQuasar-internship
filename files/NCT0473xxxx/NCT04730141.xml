  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of early mobilization protocol on patients'&#xD;
      mobilization status and patient care outcomes in patients who undergo major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. This study is a prospective non-randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample consisted of 42 patients, 21 of whom were the control group and 21 were the&#xD;
      intervention group, who had undergone major abdominal open surgery between May and September&#xD;
      2019. The routine mobilization follow-up approach of the intensive care unit was applied to&#xD;
      the patients in the control group, and the early mobilization protocol developed by using&#xD;
      up-to-date guidelines and expert opinions were applied to the patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group. In the study, the data of the control group were firstly collected, then the early&#xD;
      mobilization protocol was introduced to the patients through the training brochure prepared&#xD;
      and then data of the intervention group were collected. In the study, the characteristics of&#xD;
      the patients in both groups belonging to the preoperative period, the distance they walked in&#xD;
      the 6-minute walking test and the results of the postoperative period were recorded.&#xD;

    <description>Pedometer programs are easy-to-use mobile applications where features such as the number of steps taken at a given time and walking distance can be recorded. Pedometer application is downloaded to the phone, the number of steps and walking distance are recorded by carrying it in a pocket or bag. In this study, Developer: ITO Technologies Inc, category: health and fitness, version 1.1.10 pedometer program was used.</description>
