  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious vertebral osteomyelitis are infectious diseases of the vertebral bone,&#xD;
      intervertebral disc and/ or adjacent tissue. Most of cases are due to hematogenous&#xD;
      dissemination of pathogen but direct inoculation is an aetiology after surgery. Majority of&#xD;
      cases concern adults after 50 years and the annual incidence ranging between 0.5 and 2.4&#xD;
      cases per 100 000 habitants in Europe but seems to increase during last 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infectious spondylodiscitis is an important source of morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      treatment is based on pathogen adapted antimicrobial therapy, which may be associated with&#xD;
      bedrest. Surgical act is necessary when neurological complication occurs or when vertebral&#xD;
      column instability is too important. The immobilization in bed is use to limit pain and&#xD;
      neurological complications. However, the immobilization is based on few literature data and&#xD;
      causes important complications especially in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The of immobilization in Nancy universitity hospital changed in 2019 after institutional&#xD;
      recommendations based on expert opinion which recommend an early verticalization of&#xD;
      uncomplicated spondylodiscitis. The investigators aimed to evaluate the consequences of this&#xD;
      practice change on the hospitalization duration and complication rates due to&#xD;
      spondylodiscitis and immobilization.&#xD;
