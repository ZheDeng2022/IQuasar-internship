      in patients with Class I Cavities, will the use of Zenit Nano Ceramic Composite restorations&#xD;
      have similar clinical performance to conventional Ceram-X Nano Ceramic Composite&#xD;
      restorations, evaluation of restorations will be done at baseline, six, and twelve months&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in the clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University; the operator in charge samah mohamed bahig, The subjects&#xD;
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria of the trial will be selected from the regular attendees&#xD;
      at the clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
      Patient examination will be done including medical history, dental history, extra-oral&#xD;
      examination and intraoral examination. A periapical radiograph will be taken prior to&#xD;
      restorative procedures to assess the degree of approximation of caries to pulp, intactness of&#xD;
      lamina dura and/or presence of any periapical radiolucency to exclude the case. The field of&#xD;
      operation will be isolated with the application of a rubber dam if possible. Otherwise,&#xD;
      cotton rolls and the saliva ejector will be used for moisture control. For cavity&#xD;
      preparation, local anesthetic (MepecaineL, Alexandria Company, Egypt) solution will be&#xD;
      administrated to control patient discomfort during the procedure. The cavities will be&#xD;
      prepared by using cylindrical #314 (Komet®, Germany) in a high speed handpiece (Sirona,&#xD;
      Germany) rotating at high speed with copious coolant. Remaining soft caries&#xD;
&#xD;
      -if present- will be removed using sharp excavator (Maillefer, Dentsuply, Switzerland).After&#xD;
      the cavity preparation is finished, it will be thoroughly air-water cleaned. The bonding&#xD;
      system; the Prime and Bond universal adhesive (Dentsply De Trey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) will&#xD;
      be applied according to the following instructions recommended by the manufacturer and rubbed&#xD;
      for 20 seconds then blown with a gentle air blow for 5 seconds to evaporate the solvent and&#xD;
      then light curing for 10 seconds using LED light curing unit (&gt;700 mW/cm2).The prepared&#xD;
      cavities will be restored with Zenit Nano Ceramic Composite (PRESIDENT DENTAL, GmbH, Munich,&#xD;
      Germany) will be applied with incremental placement technique (maximum: 2-mm layer).&#xD;
      Increments will be light curing for 40 seconds according to manufacturer's instructions. and&#xD;
      for the control group cavities will be restored withCeram•X (Dentsply De Trey GmbH, Konstanz,&#xD;
      Germany) with incremental placement technique (maximum: 2-mm layer). Increments will be light&#xD;
      cured for 20 seconds according to manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;

    <description>Zenit Nano Ceramic Composite (PRESIDENT DENTAL, GmbH, Munich, Germany) is the ideal choice for single-tooth restorations, both in the anterior and the posterior region. It has an ultrafine, radiopaque porcelain filler for use in adhesive filling treatment. It can be polished to a high lustrer due to the ultra- fine particle filler, extremely homogeneous restorations can be placed which are easily polished to a high luster. The mechanical properties of a light-cured dental composite material are particularly dependent on its filler content, the type of incorporated fillers and the efficiency of the filler-resin coupling, so high Vickers hardness, compressive strength and flexural strength are recorded refereed to Zenit filler content 83% by weight (70% by volume) and size 0.7 microns</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ceram•X (Dentsply De Trey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>contains organically modified ceramic nanoparticles (2 to 3 nm) and nano-fillers (10 nm) that are combined with conventional glass fillers (mean particle size: 1.1 to 1.5 μm). Nanoparticles and nano-fillers comprise a polysiloxane backbone and have methacrylate groups available for polymerization. According to the manufacturer's data, filler concentration is 76% by weight and 57% by volume. Furthermore, most of the conventional resin matrix is replaced by a matrix full of highly dispersed methacrylate modified polysiloxane particles (2- 3 nm).These nano-ceramic particles are inorganic-organic hybrid particles. Both, nano-ceramic particles and nano- fillers have methacrylate groups available for polymerization. CeramX does not contain triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as it was found mutagenic and cytotoxic in vitro</description>
