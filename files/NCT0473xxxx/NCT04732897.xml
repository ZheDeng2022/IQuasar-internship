  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hallux Valgus (HV) is a lateral deviation of the big toe. HV is a deformity of the forefoot&#xD;
      centered on the 1st radius (1st metatarsal and big toe). This deformation is characterized&#xD;
      by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a big toe (hallux) deviated outwards (valgus greater than 12 °)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a first metatarsal moved medially (varus) (angle M1 / M2&gt; 10 °). We also note the&#xD;
           existence of an exostosis formed by the apex of the angle between the 1st metatarsal&#xD;
           deviated inwards and the big toe deported outwards. This exostosis corresponds to the&#xD;
           head of the 1st metatarsal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the pain and the unaesthetic nature induced by this deviation, the&#xD;
      modifications of the skeletal axes of the foot cause disorders of its function but also of&#xD;
      the joints of the lower limb during standing, walking and running. Axis defects of the lower&#xD;
      limbs in varum or valgum also cause deformities in the rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no non-surgical curative treatment for this deformity. Different conservative&#xD;
      treatment options have been offered for first-line treatment, including different types of&#xD;
      physiotherapy, wearing rigid insoles or splints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing rigid insoles is indicated to &quot;counter&quot; the valgic pressure, thereby reducing pain&#xD;
      and high plantar pressure, in patients with HV. Their hardness, expressed in SHORE units,&#xD;
      must be greater than 65. By countering the valgic pressure (rearfoot and midfoot), the rigid&#xD;
      soles make it possible to contain the development of deformation and stabilize the axis of&#xD;
      the first spoke. The speed of hallux deformation is therefore greatly reduced if the soles&#xD;
      are worn diligently. But there is little or no impact on the correction of the deformity, but&#xD;
      it is stabilized as it is without rapid and major worsening. Indeed, soles with a hardness&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 65 SHORE make it possible to avoid the valgum of the hindfoot and&#xD;
      midfoot under load and when walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing a dynamic splint was studied in a recently published prospective randomized study&#xD;
      conducted between 2011 and 2013. This study, concluding that the dynamic splint is not&#xD;
      effective in reducing the angle of deformation of the HV, nevertheless shows the reduction in&#xD;
      pain during walking and running. The limits of the study lie in the pace of wearing the&#xD;
      splint, left to the discretion of patients, during their rest period, and in the duration of&#xD;
      the operation, which is not precisely described.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that a dynamic joint dressing, associated with a rigid&#xD;
      orthopedic insole, would make it possible to &quot;reverse&quot; the deformation and re-focus the&#xD;
      angles of deformation of the first ray in patients with a HV and already stabilized, i.e.&#xD;
      wearer of made-to-measure soles with SHORE greater than or equal to 65 for at least 2 months.&#xD;
