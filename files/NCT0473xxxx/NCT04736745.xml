    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol, is to assess the safety and efficacy profile of IPN59011&#xD;
      compared to a placebo. IPN59011 is expected to work longer than product already marketed in&#xD;
      the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe facial wrinkles.&#xD;

             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of any other condition (e.g. neuromuscular disorder or other disorder&#xD;
             that could interfere with neuromuscular function), laboratory finding or circumstance&#xD;
             that, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to the subject or&#xD;
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
