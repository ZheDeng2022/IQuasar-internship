  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial identifies the best dose of seclidemstat when given together with&#xD;
      azacitidine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia. Seclidemstat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Azacitidine may help block the formation of growths that may become&#xD;
      cancer. Giving seclidemstat and azacytidine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of seclidemstat in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall response rate (ORR) to seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), relapse-free survival (RFS),&#xD;
      and leukemia-free survival (LFS) and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlative studies including correlation of response with disease subtypes, genomic&#xD;
      profile and in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of seclidemstat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on&#xD;
      days 1-7. Patients also receive seclidemstat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1 of cycle 1&#xD;
      and PO twice daily (BID) on days 2-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of all subsequent cycles.&#xD;
      There are 6 possbile dose levels for seclidemstat: 300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg, 1200 mg&#xD;
      and 1500 mg. Successive cohorts of eligible patients will be treated with azacitidine until&#xD;
      the phase 2 recommended dose or maximum tolerated dose is determined. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter&#xD;
