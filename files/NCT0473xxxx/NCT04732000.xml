  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain, functional impairment and slow rates of recovery are key issues for patients&#xD;
      after surgery and trauma. No preventative strategy in current use unequivocally modifies&#xD;
      these rates, and few novel approaches have been tested. Furthermore, persistent postsurgical&#xD;
      pain is a major route to chronic opioid use, opioid use disorder and, regrettably, opioid&#xD;
      overdose. Most strategies designed to limit chronic pain or enhance functional recovery after&#xD;
      surgery are directed at modulating peripheral and central nervous system activity and do not&#xD;
      strongly modify the underlying tissue pathophysiology or fundamental systemic responses.&#xD;
      Strategies limiting oxidative stress in the perioperative period, on the other hand, might&#xD;
      limit tissue damage, organ dysfunction and immune system activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant well-studied in the perioperative period; it is&#xD;
      very safe, relatively inexpensive and widely available. The central hypothesis is, therefore,&#xD;
      that perioperative administration of NAC will reduce perioperative oxidative stress, limit&#xD;
      immune system activation and improve key indices of surgical recovery. Although the planned&#xD;
      work will not comprehensively address this hypothesis, it will identify the most useful tools&#xD;
      and help the researchers estimate the required sample sizes for more definitive externally&#xD;
      funded efforts.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled interventional pilot study in 20&#xD;
      patients undergoing first-time total hip arthroplasty (THA) for chronic osteoarthritis at&#xD;
      Stanford Medicine. The researchers will screen, enroll and collect biologic and behavioral&#xD;
      data from 20 participants as outlined in previous observational and interventional clinical&#xD;
      studies undertaken in close collaboration with the Department of Orthopedic Surgery. In&#xD;
      particular, standard operating procedures for screening, recruiting, laboratory assessments,&#xD;
      and clinical data collection are in place including eligibility screening via EPIC (EHR)&#xD;
      ahead of patients' preoperative visit, coordinated recruitment and consenting during the&#xD;
      pre-surgery visit including study- related laboratory work, further preoperative assessments&#xD;
      after the visit (e.g. remote completion of questionnaires and direct import of results into&#xD;
      REDCap), and real-time tracking of the data collection and storage process (e.g. including&#xD;
      phone/email reminders if data are missing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated assessments of pain, physical function, and analgesic medication will be made before&#xD;
      surgery, daily on postoperative days 1-3, and then twice a week in post-op weeks 1 - 6.&#xD;
      Delirium will be measured days 1-3 while in-hospital. Additional data will include&#xD;
      demographics (age, BMI, sex, race, and ethnicity), surgical/anesthesia data (e.g. duration),&#xD;
      and medical/medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected before surgery and 1hr and 24hr after surgery&#xD;
      based on our prior study showing that monocyte activation (including STAT3, CREB and NFkB&#xD;
      signaling responses in CD14+CD16- monocytes) early after surgery strongly correlates with&#xD;
      delayed pain resolution and functional impairment. Exhaled breath samples will be collected&#xD;
      intraoperatively prior to incision and at wound closure as well as at 1 and 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcysteine infusion: A loading dose of 50 mg/kg will be started as a 1-hour infusion&#xD;
      before surgical incision, and will be followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg administered&#xD;
      over 4 hours. This is a standard dosing paradigm that is safe when used intraoperatively and&#xD;
      rarely causes significant adverse effects (mainly allergic reactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery and anesthesia: Participants will undergo unilateral hip arthroplasty performed by&#xD;
      three surgeons using the same approach. The anesthetic and perioperative management of&#xD;
      patients is standardized and follows ERAS-based recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Well-validated instruments will be used to assess pain, pain interference and&#xD;
      function of the affected and operated joint including the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) adapted for patients undergoing lower extremity&#xD;
      joint surgery, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Surgical Recovery Scale (SRS). Opioid&#xD;
      consumption will be quantified as intravenous hydromorphone equivalents (milligram/day) using&#xD;
      widely accepted opioid conversion tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis: Blood and plasma will be collected and processed for analysis with mass&#xD;
      cytometry as previously described. A 39-parameter human CyTOF antibody panel will be applied&#xD;
      that will allow the simultaneous analysis of 1) all major immune cell phenotypes 2)&#xD;
      endogenous intracellular signaling responses (including the pSTAT3, pCREB and pNF-kB signal)&#xD;
      and 3) intracellular markers of reactive aldehydes (i.e. 4-HNE and MDA signal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples will be analyzed for aldehydes including formaldehyde, crotenaldehyde, and&#xD;
      benzaldehyde using mass spectroscopy in the laboratory of Dr. Gross.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be analyzed for free MDA and 4- HNE in baseline, 1 and 24-hour plasma&#xD;
      samples in the laboratory of Dr. Clark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and modeling of outcome data: Self-reported outcomes will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      validated models associated with each outcome to extract a quantified and normalized number&#xD;
      associated with recovery. The 60Htz actigraphy data will first be mined for patterns&#xD;
      associated with daily activities (e.g. step counts) and intensity levels. Next, a baseline&#xD;
      will be established using the data collected during and prior to surgery, for each variable.&#xD;
      All variables will be normalized to this baseline to account for patient-specific effects.&#xD;
      Finally, a multivariate linear model (with days passed since surgery as the response&#xD;
      variable) will be used to model the entire actigraphy dataset. The area under the respective&#xD;
      recovery curve of each patient according to this model will be used as an objective recovery&#xD;
      outcome. In our preliminary studies (data not shown) this outcome has been found to be&#xD;
      correlated with several aspects of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and modeling of CyTOF data: The large number of data points (millions of cells per&#xD;
      patient) and measured variables (tens of signaling pathways in hundreds of cell types) pose&#xD;
      unique computational challenges that cannot be addressed using traditional bioinformatics&#xD;
      tools. The researchers will develop a Bayesian framework that will combine a priori knowledge&#xD;
      of the immune system with state-of-the-art mass cytometry profiling to build a predictive&#xD;
      model of innate and adaptive immune cell signaling responses for each of the recovery&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
