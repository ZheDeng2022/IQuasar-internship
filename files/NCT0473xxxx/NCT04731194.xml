  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become the leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in China. Rural NCDs patients are more likely to suffer from poverty.&#xD;
      Nantong city has established a reimbursement plan covering 50% of hypertension and diabetes&#xD;
      medication costs, however, various barriers prevent patients from taking advantage of this&#xD;
      policy. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on saving medical costs&#xD;
      and promoting health in rural populations. Study design: a cluster-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Study population: village doctors and health insurance officials at township hospitals&#xD;
      are implementors of the intervention. Patients in the basic public health service system are&#xD;
      the target populations of the intervention. Randomization: 31 villages are included in the&#xD;
      study. 1 village is randomly dropped, and the rest of the villages will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the intervention and control group stratified by township with an allocation ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
      Intervention and follow-up: village doctors will promote policy awareness and support&#xD;
      patients registration. They will follow-up patients on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th month and&#xD;
      receive financial incentives based on their performance of supporting patients registration&#xD;
      and encouraging patients to buy medications in designated medical institutions to be&#xD;
      reimbursed. Control: The control group would serve as a natural baseline and do not receive&#xD;
      any intervention. Outcomes: Patients' registration rate, medical costs saved, medication&#xD;
      compliance rate, and improvements on health indicators will be evaluated based on real-world&#xD;
      medical examination, prescription, and insurance data. Sample size: an estimated sample of&#xD;
      5000 patients from 30 clusters will be registered in the policy.&#xD;
