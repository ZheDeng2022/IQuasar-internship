  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the adequacy of a set of clinical and laboratory investigations for&#xD;
      identifying the osteosarcopenia status in patients undergoing a hip replacement for a&#xD;
      fragility fracture of the femoral neck. The control group will consist of patients undergoing&#xD;
      a hip replacement for osteoarthritis, as the decrease in muscle function and bone quality is&#xD;
      less severe in this condition than in osteoporosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic hip fractures (fragility fractures) are common in older adults, and the risk of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes and mortality is higher in patients affected by osteosarcopenia, a geriatric&#xD;
      syndrome in which the low bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture deterioration&#xD;
      (osteopenia/osteoporosis) are combined with a decline in mass, strength, and functional&#xD;
      capacity of skeletal muscle (sarcopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic workup currently recommended to establish the severity of osteosarcopenia is&#xD;
      hard to implement in individuals who arrive at the orthopedic emergency department with a&#xD;
      fragility fracture. On the one hand, the evaluation of motility and physical performance is&#xD;
      impracticable in bedridden patients; on the other hand, the surgical treatment priority does&#xD;
      not allow performing all the instrumental investigations required for a proper diagnosis. In&#xD;
      this context, reliable osteosarcopenia biomarkers could help identify most frail patients and&#xD;
      plan for them personalized therapeutic interventions to promote postoperative recovery and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the new knowledge on the pathophysiology of osteosarcopenia, the investigators&#xD;
      designed a small-scale study that aims to preliminarily verify the adequacy of a set of&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory parameters that could be easily applied in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      undergoing hip replacement for a fragility fracture. In particular, the investigators planned&#xD;
      to assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscle performance by SARC-F questionnaire (acronym deriving from five domains&#xD;
           considered in the questionnaire, i.e., strength, assistance with walking, rising from a&#xD;
           chair, climbing stairs, and falls);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dietary habits through a questionnaire on the intake frequency of food categories;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  histological features of osteoporosis and sarcopenia in tissue samples taken from the&#xD;
           surgical site;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the serum levels of markers associated with muscle-bone cross-talk (Myostatin,&#xD;
           Insulin-like growth factor 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the composition of the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two groups of patients undergoing hip replacement, the first for a&#xD;
      fragility fracture of the femoral neck (n = 10, cases) and the second for hip osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (n = 10, controls). As the decrease in muscle function and bone quality is more severe in&#xD;
      fragility fractures than in osteoarthritis, the investigators expect to find differences in&#xD;
      laboratory and clinical parameters between the groups.&#xD;

The SARC-F is positive and indicates potential sarcopenia if the score point is = or &gt; 4.
