      Standard medical and dental forms from all subjects (i.e., adults ≥18 years old in need of a&#xD;
      dental implant) who have been treated for CS Tiger Ultra Implant TCC RP dental implant&#xD;
      treatment at the participating Clinics will be reviewed and clinical data will be obtained,&#xD;
      only upon the receipt of Ethical Committee's approval and upon subject's signature of the&#xD;
      corresponding Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All raw study data will be de-identified and corresponding subject information recorded in&#xD;
      the data accrual system (e-CRF Smart Trial). Information recorded by the researcher shall not&#xD;
      identify the subject and no individually identifiable data elements shall be recorded. The&#xD;
      researcher shall receive a link to log in to e CRF system. The researcher will be asked to&#xD;
      create an account and every log-in attempt into the system shall be controlled by an unique&#xD;
      code. Radiographic measurements of marginal bone level mesial and distal to the implant (at&#xD;
      time of surgery, implant loading and 12-months follow-up post-loading) carried out according&#xD;
      to the standard practice of the clinic will be collected for the assessment of the marginal&#xD;
      bone levels changes. Data will be anonymized before the x-ray collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent radiologist shall be responsible for the evaluation of the radiographic data.&#xD;
      The Sponsor shall send to the radiologist all corresponding radiographic files entitled by&#xD;
      study code, clinic and patient number, implant position and implant characteristics (diameter&#xD;
      and/or length - where available) together with an Excel sheet where the Radiologist can&#xD;
      accurately track the corresponding bone level measurements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective observational multi-center study. It will include data from 70&#xD;
      up to 100 subjects, treated with the N1 Concept System. The study will be conducted in up to&#xD;
      six European centers (Appendix I - Participating Institutions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect clinical and radiographic data related to the surgery and up to&#xD;
      12-months after loading (a time window of ± 3-months is accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be consecutively included provided they meet all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating subjects must have signed the Informed Consent Form together with a&#xD;
      separate Consent Form regarding personal data processing (if not waived by the corresponding&#xD;
      Ethical Committee). Retrospective data collection will only start after signatures have been&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will check subjects' medical and dental chart and assign a study ID number&#xD;
      to each subject. The corresponding study required information will be de-identified and&#xD;
      entered into the electronic study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All x-ray images, from the area of treatment, that were made up until 12-months after implant&#xD;
      loading will be de-identified before uploaded to the study database or otherwise sent to the&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No personal/confidential information (e.g.: full name or initials, date of birth, social&#xD;
      security number, etc.) that could reveal subject's identity will be recorded in the study&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is to evaluate the marginal bone level change of the N1&#xD;
      Concept System from loading to 12-months post loading. Patients with matched readable&#xD;
      radiographs are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant survival and success rates at 12-months after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft tissue healing parameters (i.e. bleeding index, plaque index, etc.) at 12-months&#xD;
           after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety recorded by AE, SAE, ADE, SADE, USADE, and DD.&#xD;
