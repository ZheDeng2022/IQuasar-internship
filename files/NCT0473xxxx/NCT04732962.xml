    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of arthritis, affects more than 32.5 million adults&#xD;
      in the United States. It is also among the most expensive condition to treat when joint&#xD;
      replacement surgery is required. Although biomechanics plays an important role in OA disease,&#xD;
      the non-surgical treatment options addressing biomechanics are scarce with limited effect.&#xD;
      AposHealth is the fist biomechanical treatment that was shown to have a significant&#xD;
      short-term effect on patients with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess AposHealth, a non-invasive home-based biomechanical treatment, as an&#xD;
           alternative treatment for patients who are eligible for Total Knee Replacement (TKR).&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of arthritis, affects more than 32.5 million adults&#xD;
      in the United States. It is also among the most expensive condition to treat when joint&#xD;
      replacement surgery is required. Future projections of the prevalence of OA predict an&#xD;
      increase in prevalence, mainly due to the aging of the population and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is the end-stage solution for patients with knee OA. The total&#xD;
      annual cost of arthritis in the U.S. in 2013 reached over $300 billion. Expenditure is&#xD;
      expected to grow significantly in response to the increase in prevalence and the projected&#xD;
      number of TKRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful and beneficial non-invasive treatment options for knee OA are limited. More&#xD;
      specifically, although biomechanics plays an important role in OA disease, the non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment options addressing biomechanics are scarce with limited effect. AposHealth is the&#xD;
      fist biomechanical treatment that was shown to have a significant short-term effect on&#xD;
      patients with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess AposHealth, a non-invasive home-based biomechanical treatment, as an&#xD;
           alternative treatment for patients who are eligible for TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess AposHealth as a new post-operative rehabilitation tool for patients post TKR.&#xD;

    <description>A computerized mat is used to measure spatiotemporal gait parameters (ProtoKinetics Zeno™ Walkway Gait Analysis System). The gait mat detects pressure data during gait, during balance, and additional movement protocols. During the gait test, all patients are asked to walk barefoot at a self-selected speed. Patients walk 3 meters before and after the walkway mat to allow sufficient acceleration and deceleration time outside the measurement area. Each gait test included 6 walks and the mean value of the 6 walks is calculated for step length (in centimeters).</description>

Patients walk 3 meters before and after the walkway mat to allow sufficient acceleration and deceleration time outside the measurement area. Each gait test included 6 walks and the mean value of the 6 walks is calculated. A single gait cycle is defined from heel strike of one limb to the next heel strike (of the mane limb). A gait cycle is comprised of 2 phases: Stance (limb on the ground) and swing (limb swings forward). The stance phase is divided into SLS (one limb is on the ground while the other limb swings forward) and double limb support (both feet are on the ground). The absolute time of SLS will be converted to percent of gait cycle for standardization purposes.</description>

Temporal distance (T-D) symmetry is used to calculate Symmetry Index (SI) for step length using the formula: (involved-uninvolved)/[(involved+uninvolved)/2)] x 100. SI value of zero represents perfect symmetry and up to 5% difference between limbs is considered normal.</description>

    <description>Following the initial consultation and calibration of the Apos device in the clinic, the patients will receive from his therapist a home-based treatment plan. This usually includes wearing the device for about 20 minutes with about 20% of weight-bearing (patient is instructed to wear the Apos and just be with the device and go about his/her daily routine). A gradual increase in usage time is prescribed reaching up to 60 min wear time with about 40% weight-bearing.&#xD;
Patients are requested to return to follow-up (FU) appointments after 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. In addition, patients will have a remote FU after 1-week to confirm they use AposHealth as advised. During the follow-up appointment, re-assessment of clinical outcomes and gait patterns are performed and the calibration of the Apos device is adjusted as needed. The treatment plan is adjusted, and patients are encouraged to continue to wear the device regularly at home.</description>

AposHealth will start six weeks post-op and will continue for 12 months. Patients will receive AposHealth similar to the non-invasive group, i.e., will have an initial evaluation (IE) and calibration of the Apos device, have a remote FU after one week from IE and in-clinic FUs at 1, 3 6, 9 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>AposHealth is comprised of a unique footwear (Apos device) and uses two convex pods called &quot;Pertupods&quot;, which are screwed into the plantar surface of the sole so that a person walks on these pods. A trained Apos therapist calibrates the devices. The location of the pods is adjusted according to the treatment methodology, depending on the needed effect on unloading the knee and with the purpose of potentially alleviating pain immediately.</description>

    <description>A total knee replacement occurs when a diseased or damaged knee joint is totally replaced with an artificial joint called an implant. The implant consists of high-grade metal and plastic components that fuse to the resurfaced bone. It is designed to move like a healthy human joint.</description>
