  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects 11% of children and leads to adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Medications, while often effective in reducing certain ADHD symptoms, have many&#xD;
      disadvantages, including misuse and side effects. Behavioral interventions do not have these&#xD;
      adverse effects, but they are not as effective. Mindfulness is a candidate intervention for&#xD;
      ADHD in elementary school children, but has not been systematically and rigorously studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness-Based ADHD&#xD;
      Treatment for Children (MBAT-C). MBAT-C is designed for children at precisely the age when&#xD;
      ADHD-relevant neurocognitive systems are developing and clinical symptoms begin to appear.&#xD;
      Forty-five children from the New Haven, CT area, ages 7-13, will be recruited to participate&#xD;
      in this randomized-controlled feasibility trial that will compare MBAT-C, medication, and a&#xD;
      combined intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects 11% of American children. ADHD is a&#xD;
      source of considerable psychosocial, educational, and neurocognitive impairment. It is&#xD;
      co-morbid with multiple psychiatric disorders and poses an economic burden. Pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      is often the first-line treatment for children with ADHD, but such medications are associated&#xD;
      with adverse effects, including insomnia, loss of appetite, headaches, stomachaches, tics,&#xD;
      moodiness, and irritability. Further, concerns about substance misuse and diversion, as well&#xD;
      as parental preference, can limit the use and utility of medications. These limitations&#xD;
      underscore the urgency of developing behavioral interventions that do not pose such concerns.&#xD;
      At this time, however, behavioral treatments for ADHD are generally less effective than&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, emphasizing the need for better non-pharmacologic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-defined here as nonjudgmentally paying attention to the present moment-is a&#xD;
      promising behavioral approach to ADHD treatment, as evidence suggests that mindfulness&#xD;
      improves attention in both healthy adults, and those with ADHD. Mindfulness also improves&#xD;
      neurocognitive outcomes in children and adolescents, including executive function and&#xD;
      attention, suggesting that mindfulness may be an effective treatment for ADHD in young&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study of a novel intervention: Mindfulness-Based ADHD Treatment for&#xD;
      Children (MBAT-C). MBAT-C is derived from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a&#xD;
      well-known and extensively-studied mindfulness intervention. Unlike all other&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions, however, MBAT-C is tailored to the needs, abilities, and&#xD;
      vulnerabilities of children with ADHD through the use of age-appropriate class length,&#xD;
      homework assignments, contemplative practices, and discussion topics. Specifically, MBAT-C&#xD;
      includes 16 twice-weekly 30-minute sessions over 8 weeks. Each session includes two brief&#xD;
      meditations, discussion, an exercise, and homework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 45 children ages 7-13 with ADHD will be randomized into one of three treatment&#xD;
      groups: MBAT-C, medication (MED), or a combined intervention (COM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate feasibility of MBAT-C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Measure within-group change from pre- to post-treatment on ADHD-relevant outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive gold-standard, non-experimental medication. This treatment arm relies on a step-by-step approach that is designed to mimic pharmacologic treatment-as-usual in the community. The treatment algorithm is as follows:&#xD;
All participants will start with Concerta; Ritalin may be started if the effect of Concerta wears off mid-day;&#xD;
If Concerta +/- Ritalin is ineffective or not tolerated, participants will progress to Vyvanse; Adderall may be started if the effect of Vyvanse wears off mid-day;&#xD;
If Vyvanse +/- Adderall is also ineffective or not tolerated, participants will progress to Kapvay;&#xD;
If Kapvay is ineffective or not tolerated, participants will progress to Intuniv.&#xD;
Alternative combinations of the above medications will be considered if the above combinations are ineffective or otherwise not tolerated.</description>
