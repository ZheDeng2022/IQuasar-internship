  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 64</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) AEs for which participants will be specifically questioned and which will be noted by participants in their diary for 7 days post first vaccination. Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema, induration/swelling, itching at the vaccination site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Systematic Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 64</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Participants will be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis for 7 days post-vaccination (Day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) for solicited systemic AEs. Solicited systemic events will include fever, headache, fatigue/malaise, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia and chills.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 225</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Number of participants with SAEs will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unsolicited Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 225</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Unsolicited AEs are events which will be reported by the participant voluntarily or obtained by means of interviewing the participant in a non-directed manner at study visits.</description>
