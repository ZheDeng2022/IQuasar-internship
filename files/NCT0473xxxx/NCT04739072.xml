  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other tumor-related&#xD;
      molecules/chemicals released in the blood can help doctors predict if colorectal cancer may&#xD;
      come back or spread. Tumors shed DNA and other cancer related chemicals into the blood that&#xD;
      can be identified and studied further to provide information about the cancer. Information&#xD;
      gathered from this study may help researchers better understand if ctDNA found in the blood&#xD;
      can predict whether colorectal cancer may come back or spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate ability to monitor cancer-specific deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (RNA), and proteomic alterations from plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Improve detection of recurrences post completion of curative therapies through monitoring&#xD;
      of plasma cancer-specific DNA, RNA and proteomic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Qualitative and quantitative changes in cancer-specific plasma alterations during&#xD;
      neoadjuvant, adjuvant therapies and surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Disease free survival (DFS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma&#xD;
      alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Overall survival (OS) of patients with detectable cancer-specific plasma alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Optimal combination of cancer-specific plasma DNA, RNA and / or proteomic alterations for&#xD;
      early detection of recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of&#xD;
      cancer-specific plasma alterations in detecting recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlation between cancer-specific alterations in plasma and tissue and either with&#xD;
      outcomes including DFS &amp; OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Nature and frequency of detection of incidental non-colorectal cancer related DNA, RNA&#xD;
      and / or proteomic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline, during each neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      treatment, prior to surgical resection, and up to 4 times per year for up to 5 years.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo collection of tissue sample at time of surgical resection. Patients'&#xD;
      medical records may also be reviewed.&#xD;
