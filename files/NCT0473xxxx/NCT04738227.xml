  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are multiple treatment modalities for head and neck cancer. They include radiation&#xD;
      therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. Radiation therapy aims to control the tumor with minimum&#xD;
      damage to adjacent tissues. Surgery is the preferred treatment for accessible cancers.&#xD;
      Radiation and/or chemotherapy is used as an adjunct to surgery, in inaccessible tumors, post&#xD;
      surgery sterilization and palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major complication of RT is that adjacent normal tissues are variably affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Oropharyngeal cancer, major and minor salivary glands are damaged by RT since they fall&#xD;
      in the radiation pathway. Atrophy and acinar degeneration are features most commonly found&#xD;
      histologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia is defined as dry mouth resulting from reduced or absent saliva flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia is not a disease, but may be a symptom of various medical conditions, a side&#xD;
      effect of a wide variety of medications and a side effect of a radiation to the head and&#xD;
      neck.The flow rate of normal unstimulated saliva is 0.3-0.5 ml/min. If it decreases to less&#xD;
      than 0.1-0.2 ml/min, one would experience xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to researchers, the decrease in saliva and xerostomia that results from&#xD;
      radiotherapy plays an important role in worsening Quality of Life(QoL) among patients who&#xD;
      undergo radiotherapy for head and neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser Therapy(LLLT) uses light energy in the form of photons to produce cellular&#xD;
      responses in the cell. Light photons are absorbed by cytochromes and porphyrins in the&#xD;
      mitochondria of the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to prove that Low level laser therapy will improve salivary flow rate, pH and&#xD;
      the quality of life in patients who have undergone Radiation therapy for oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are multiple treatment modalities the cancers of the head and neck. The main three&#xD;
      major treatment options are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT) is used to control the growth of the tumor with limiting the damage to adjacent tissues.&#xD;
      Surgery is the main treatment for oropharyngeal cancers, but if the cancer remains, radiation&#xD;
      and chemotherapy is used in adjunct to surgery. Radiation therapy is a common treatment&#xD;
      options for initial to mid stage malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major complication of RT is that non neoplastic tissues of the head and neck are variably&#xD;
      affected. The exact amount of damage to healthy tissues depends on factors such as fraction&#xD;
      of radiation dose, the total amount of the radiation dose administered, volume of irradiated&#xD;
      tissue, and how the dose is distributed in the tissue. The effect on the tissues may appear&#xD;
      either during the treatment (acute) or once the treatment is complete (late).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Oropharyngeal cancer, major and minor salivary glands are mostly affected by RT due to&#xD;
      the fact that salivary glands fall in the radiation pathway. The mechanisms by which the&#xD;
      tissues and cells are damaged due to radiation are still not very clear, but the features&#xD;
      most commonly found histologically are atrophy of the tissues and degeneration of the acini.&#xD;
      According to researchers, &quot;the decrease in saliva and xerostomia that results from&#xD;
      radiotherapy plays an important role in worsening Quality of Life (QoL) among patients who&#xD;
      undergo radiotherapy for head and neck cancers&quot;. The normal flow rate of unstimulated saliva&#xD;
      is 0.3-0.5 ml/min. If it decreases to less than 0.1-0.2 ml/min, it is then that one would&#xD;
      experience xerostomia Xerostomia Inventory (XI) which was formulated by Thomson is a&#xD;
      validated tool which will also be used to determine the amount of dryness based on the XI&#xD;
      score. A higher score will be suggestive of worsening xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly recommended treatment for xerostomia currently is intraoral topical agents.&#xD;
      These include salivary stimulants, chewing gums, topical sprays containing malic acid. Also&#xD;
      used for xerostomia are medicines such has pilocarpine and cevimeline but both medicines are&#xD;
      parasympathomimetic and need to be administered with extreme caution. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      there medicines is short lived and only provide symptomatic relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the mechanism by which Low level laser Therapy(LLLT) works is that photons are&#xD;
      generated through the light energy and these photons produce cellular responses in the cell.&#xD;
      The photons of light are readily absorbed by the cytochromes and the porphyrins present in&#xD;
      the mitochondria of the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser therapy has many diverse effects on the tissues and cells of the body.&#xD;
      Previous experimental animal studies highlight a positive effect on the salivary glands when&#xD;
      low level laser therapy was applied. Mitotic activity was seen to be stimulated by LLLT to&#xD;
      quite an extent in the epithelial tissue of salivary glands of murine test subjects. As a&#xD;
      result, the salivary flow rate (SFR) increased, the enzymatic activity increased in saliva&#xD;
      significantly as there was a decrease in the activity of peroxidase and catalase enzymes and&#xD;
      it was shown to alter the protein concentration in saliva [14,15]. Once the cells receive the&#xD;
      LLLT, are more acidic because of the lowered redox state, but soon after the laser therapy&#xD;
      they become alkaline resulting in optimal function. Healthy cells are not affected by LLLT as&#xD;
      it does not increase their redox potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common side effect of radiation therapy for the oropharyngeal region is&#xD;
      Xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to a significant decrease in oral health causing mucositis,&#xD;
      dental caries, oral ulcers, periodontal infections etc. These symptoms result in a decrease&#xD;
      in the QoL of the patients treated with radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancers. The&#xD;
      conventional treatment for xerostomia is short term symptomatic relief. There is an utmost&#xD;
      need for long term treatment that saves the patients from relying on short term treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine the effect of low level laser therapy on saliva flow rate in patients&#xD;
      who have undergone Radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of low level laser therapy on pH of saliva produced in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone Radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of low level laser therapy on Quality of Life (QoL) in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone Radiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the Study Previous studies used a higher wavelength diode laser (808 and 980nm)&#xD;
      with controversial results. Some showed excellent results whereas some showed no results at&#xD;
      all. The rationale behind choosing a lower wavelength (635nm) in our study is the potentially&#xD;
      higher beneficial absorption, to functionally stimulate the damaged, residual salivary&#xD;
      glands. No study has been conducted on this particular topic in the Indo-Pak region. Hence,&#xD;
      effects of LLLT on salivary glands need to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the Study As head and neck cancers are increasing in Pakistan, the role of&#xD;
      radiation therapy has increased. The side effects of radiation to healthy tissues such as the&#xD;
      salivary glands causes severe impairment of oral health and overall quality of life. Low&#xD;
      level laser therapy is a relatively non-invasive, cost effective and a new method for&#xD;
      treating patients with xerostomia due to radiation therapy. By stimulating residual salivary&#xD;
      tissue it may provide long term or permanent (as against symptomatic) relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research would be will be conducted in Karachi, Pakistan where all the facilities of the&#xD;
      Laser are available. The procedure will also be done under the supervision of my clinical&#xD;
      supervisor, who is a Laser Safety Officer authorized to conduct laser procedures. The&#xD;
      patients will be recruited from Ziauddin Hospital where the patients were successfully&#xD;
      treated with radiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population The target population will be patients treated with radiotherapy for&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer in Karachi, Pakistan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study The duration of study will be 1 year from the date of approval from the&#xD;
      Board of advanced studies and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental time period will be 12 weeks in which the Patients will be given LLLT two&#xD;
      times a week. Each patient would be called at 9am in the morning each day and each patient&#xD;
      will have their schedule through out the week so overlapping can be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Laser therapy will be performed with a continuous wave diode laser device&#xD;
      previously calibrated by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 points that will be the skin overlying the right hand side parotid gland and 3 points on&#xD;
