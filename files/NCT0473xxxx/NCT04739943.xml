  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, interest in ways to monitor and care for patients remotely has significantly&#xD;
      increased due to concerns for infection control as well as a way to increase access to&#xD;
      regular clinic visits that may be limited for socioeconomic and geographic reasons. However,&#xD;
      remote care can be limited by a lack of objective data to help guide clinical care. With&#xD;
      respect to respiratory disease, caring for patients remotely may be enhanced by the ability&#xD;
      of patients to monitor at home such things as vital signs, lung sounds, and lung function by&#xD;
      spirometry. Enhanced methods to follow symptoms and track medication compliance may also be&#xD;
      beneficial. These enhancements could improve care and quality of life both for persons with&#xD;
      acute respiratory illnesses and those with chronic respiratory disease (such as asthma or&#xD;
      COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop and study methods for patients to monitor their&#xD;
      respiratory health at home and make that data available to medical providers to improve their&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Test is a patient self-administered tool for identifying those with poorly controlled asthma.&#xD;
Scores are on a 5-point scale (for symptoms and activities: 1=all the time to 5= not at all; for asthma control rating: 1=not controlled at all to 5=completely controlled). Sores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;19 indicates well-controlled asthma.</description>
