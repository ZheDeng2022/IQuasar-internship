      This study is a prospective, open-labelled, randomized, controlled,multi-center clincial&#xD;
      trial. The aim of this study is to verify that the remission rate of patients treated with&#xD;
      Leflunomide is not inferior to that of patients treated with Azathioprine.&#xD;

      Background The basic theme of AAV is relapse and remission. The maintenance therapy of AAV&#xD;
      aimed to reduce or prevent relapse is very challenge. Although many medications have been&#xD;
      used for the maintenance of AAV, Leflunomide (LEF) has not studied thoroughly yet. So far,&#xD;
      only one study tested the efficacy of LEF in the maintenance therapy for AAV. However, the&#xD;
      sample size of this study is small, so large size clinical study is needed to clarify the&#xD;
      role of LEF in the maintenance of AAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEF is one of the most frequently prescribed DMARDs in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in&#xD;
      China. It is cheap and widely available. Many experiences have been accumulated about its&#xD;
      efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with rheumatic diseases. But there is no study to&#xD;
      show its effectiveness in the reduction of the relapse of AAV in China. In this study, we try&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of LEF and AZA, the gold standard for maintenance therapy, in&#xD;
      the maintenance of AAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To verify that the effectiveness of LEF in reducing relapse is not inferior to AZA&#xD;
      by comparing the relapse rate of LEF and AZA during the 18 month maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      AAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, control, non-inferiority study.&#xD;
