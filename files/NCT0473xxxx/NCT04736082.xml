  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled, prospective,&#xD;
      non-inferiority intervention clinical trial is performed to assess the safety and suitability&#xD;
      of an infant formula manufactured from extensively hydrolysed protein by showing normal&#xD;
      growth of healthy term infants during the first 120 days of life with an optional follow up&#xD;
      until 180 days of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since many years the use of infant formulae manufactured from hydrolysed proteins are&#xD;
      recommended for infants at risk for developing allergies if they cannot be exclusively&#xD;
      breast-fed. Although the use of such formulae manufactured from hydrolysed protein is legally&#xD;
      authorized according to the respective legal framework since many years (currently: Directive&#xD;
      2006/141/EC), the safety of each hydrolysed protein has to be substantiated by additional&#xD;
      clinical data according to new legal requirements (Del. Regulation (EU) 2016/127). This study&#xD;
      is intended to generate clinical safety data: demonstrating adequate growth of infants fed a&#xD;
      formula manufactured from hydrolysed protein in comparison to infants fed a formula&#xD;
      manufactured from intact protein. As formula manufactured from hydrolyzed proteins is known&#xD;
      to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal comfort, it is also fed to infants not at risk&#xD;
      for developing allergies. Therefore, this study additionally investigates the impact of&#xD;
      hydrolysed protein on gastrointestinal tolerance.&#xD;
