      The aim of this study is to search the effects of electrical stimulation on clinical symptoms&#xD;
      such as pelvic floor muscle strength, stage of POP, symptoms of pelvic floor, quality of life&#xD;
      and sexual function in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP)&#xD;

      This study is planned as a prospective, sham radomized controlled study. Individuals who&#xD;
      volunteered to participate in the study, complying with the inclusion criteria and signed the&#xD;
      consent paper will be randomly allocated into ES and Sham ES groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes women aged 18-65 diagnosed with staged 1-2 POP by the physician.All&#xD;
      patients were evaluated by the same doctor who performed the POP-Q measurement, who was&#xD;
      blinded to the baseline results. The treatment of patients will be given by the same&#xD;
      therapist. Measurements will be made 3 times at baseline (before treatment), interim period&#xD;
      (4th week) and after treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The prolapse stage will be measured with Simplified POP-Q</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline prolapse stage at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed while the patient is in the dorsal lithotomy position. According to the reference point of the hymen, It is measured at a total of 4 points: cervix, posterior fornix, anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The stage of prolapse is graded.&#xD;
Stage 0: There is no prolapse. Stage 1: The most distal part of the prolapse is more than 1 cm above the prolapse.&#xD;
Stage 2: The most distal part of the prolapse, between 1 cm above and 1 cm below the prolapse Stage 3: The most distal part of the prolapse protrudes more than 1 cm below the prolapse.&#xD;
Stage 4: Complete eversion of the lower genital tract</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pelvic floor muscle strength will be measured measured with PFX Perineometer device(Cardio Design Pty Ltd, Australia)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Pelvic floor muscle strength at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Indicators of this measuring device range from 0-12 kilo Pascal (kPa). During the measurement, The patient whose perineometer sensor is placed in her vagina, will be asked to relax and then to tighten the sensor strongly. The difference between the first and last value in the perineometer is the contraction strength. This evaluation will be repeated three times and averaged and recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pelvic organ prolapse symptoms will be assessed by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score(POP-SS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline the pelvic organ prolapse symptoms at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) consists of 7 questions whose answers are scored between 0 and 5. The total score ranges from 0 to 28. The higher the score, the higher the severity of POP symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pelvic organ prolapse symptoms severity will be assessed by the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) .</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline the pelvic organ prolapse symptoms severity at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PFDI comprises three subscales: the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory-6, the ColoRectal-Anal Distress Inventory-8 and the Urinary Distress Inventory-6. The scores range from 0 to l00 for the all subscales. Higher scores signifying severe symptom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' quality of life will be assessed using the Prolapse Quality of Life Scale (P-QOL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline quality of life at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 9 fields and 20 questions. The first question is general health perception, the second question is the effect of urogenital prolapse on the quality of life, the 3rd and 4th questions are role limitations, the 5th and 6th questions are physical limitations, the 7th and 8th questions are social limitations, 9-11. questions on interpersonal relationships, 12-14. questions ask emotions, questions 15 and 16 examine sleep / energy influence, and questions 16 and 20 examine severity. The score ranges from 0-100, with a higher score indicating poor quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' sexual function will be assessed by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire-12 (PISQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline sexual function at 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey, consisting of 12 questions, includes 3 subtitles.This survey, consisting of 12 questions, includes 3 subtitles. 1-4. Questions are emotional, 5-9. questions are physical, 10-12. questions constitute subheadings containing partner dependent areas (range 0-48, with higher scores indicating better sexual functioning).</description>
