  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess and compare the levels of pain, discomfort, and functional impairments&#xD;
      between rapid and slow maxillary expansion in treating skeletal maxillary constriction in the&#xD;
      early adolescence period (i.e. between 12 and 16 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will consist of 32 patients who suffer from a skeletal posterior crossbite.&#xD;
      The sample will be allocated randomly into two groups: RME group and SME group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to fill out the attached questionnaires at three assessment times.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal maxillary constriction is a popular orthodontic malocclusion that can be seen at any&#xD;
      age. The maxillary expansion is the most important treatment choice of this skeletal problem&#xD;
      in the upper jaw. There are many types of maxillary expansion regarding the force amount and&#xD;
      the number of expansion times: slow maxillary expansion (SME) rapid maxillary expansion&#xD;
      (RME), and semi-rapid maxillary expansion (SRME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practitioners are conscious that complaints submitted by children and adolescents during the&#xD;
      active phase of expansion, such as pain, discomfort and oral ulcers are common symptoms. This&#xD;
      trial of two parallel groups will compare the pain, discomfort and functional impairments&#xD;
      accompanying the rapid and slow maxillary expansion in early adolescent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RME group: A bonded modified Hyrax palatal expander will be applied. SME group: A removable&#xD;
      palatal expansion appliance with a midline screw will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the pain, discomfort and functional impairments, patients will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires of six questions: 1) What is the degree of pain/discomfort you have&#xD;
      experienced?; 2) Do you have difficulty in mastication?; 3) Do you have difficulty in&#xD;
      swallowing?; 4) Do you have a sense of tension or pressure in soft tissue?; 5) Do you have&#xD;
      swelling in soft tissue?; and 6) How easy is the treatment procedure?.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be asked this question about their feeling of pain and discomfort (Item no 01):&#xD;
'What is the degree of pain/discomfort you have experienced?' A standardized questionnaire will be used to assess pain, discomfort and functional impairments' levels during the active phase of treatment. The patient will be asked to specify a point on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which is a 10-cm horizontal line with two focal points at its beginning and end (0: there is no pain - 10: the worst pain). The score will be determined by measuring the distance from the beginning until the point identified by the patient.</description>
