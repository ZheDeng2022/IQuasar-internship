    <textblock>
      This study mainly evaluated the clinical effect of total arthroscopic repair of the anterior&#xD;
      talofibular ligament in the treatment of chronic instability of the lateral ankle. For&#xD;
      patients with chronic instability of the lateral ankle, a randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
      used to compare the curative effect, operation time, surgical complications, postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence rate, postoperative recovery time and patients' satisfaction of the total&#xD;
      arthroscopic repair of the anterior talofibular ligament surgery and the modified BrostrÖm&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The patient receives intraspinal anesthesia or general anesthesia under supine position. Establish an anteromedial channel at the inner side of the tibial anterior tibial tendon at the level of the tibiotalar joint, and establish an anterolateral channel at the lateral angle of the talus. Exploring and clearing the ankle joint and dealing with possible combined injuries, such as talar cartilage injury, ankle impingement, and loose ankle joints. Then observe the lateral sulcus through the anterior medial channel, clean the synovium in the lateral sulcus, and explore the anterior talofibular ligament. A double-line anchor was inserted into the fibula side stop of the anterior talofibular ligament through the anterolateral channel. The anterior talofibular ligament was sutured using an outside-in technique in the anterior inferior safety zone of the distal end of the fibula. Fix the ankle joint with the suture after the dorsiflexion, neutral valgus position.</description>

    <description>The patient receives intraspinal anesthesia or general anesthesia under supine position. The first ankle arthroscopy is performed to deal with possible combined injuries, such as talar cartilage injury, ankle impingement, and loose ankle joints. Then, open surgery was performed, and an arc incision was made at the anterior edge of the lateral malleolus to the tip of the fibula. After separating the subcutaneous tissue, the anterolateral joint capsule and talofibular ligament are exposed. A double-line anchor was placed at the fibular side stop of the anterior talofibular ligament. Tighten and suture the anterior talofibular ligament, anterolateral joint capsule, and extensor support belt with an anchor band. Fix the ankle joint with the suture after the dorsiflexion, neutral valgus position.</description>
