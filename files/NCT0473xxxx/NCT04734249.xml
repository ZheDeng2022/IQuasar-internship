      This study adopt Simon's two-stage minimax designs method based on the primary endpoint of&#xD;
      objective response rates. In each arm, 15 patients were planned for the first stage. If two&#xD;
      or more responses were observed, an additional 13 patients were to be accrued for a total of&#xD;
      28 patients. If 7 or more of the 28 patients in an arm achieved an objective response, then&#xD;
      that arm was designated worthy of additional investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surufatinib will be orally administered within 1 hour after breakfast once a day (QD) ,&#xD;
      Cohort 1 :Surufatinib+mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI,Cohort 2 :Surufatinib+FOLFOXIRI for every 14-day&#xD;
      treatment cycle until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other protocol&#xD;
      specified end-of-treatment criteria is met (which comes first).&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if&#xD;
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise&#xD;
