  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single agent dose escalation and combination&#xD;
      treatment study of RP3 in adult participants with advanced solid tumors, to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of RP3 both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD1&#xD;
      therapy and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RP3.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RP3 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) that expresses exogenous&#xD;
      genes (anti-CTLA-4 antibody, CD40 ligand and h4-1BBL) designed to directly destroy tumors and&#xD;
      generate an anti-tumor immune response&#xD;
