  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the importance of physical activity for adolescent physical development, the specific&#xD;
      impact of different types of exercise training on fine motor skills and testosterone&#xD;
      concentration is unknown. A primary aim of this study was to analyze the benefits of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and coordinative exercise training on fine motor skills in an adolescent&#xD;
      population. A second aim of our study was to determine the testosterone concentration after&#xD;
      physical stress of cardiovascular and coordinative exercise training and if testosterone was&#xD;
      related to fine motor skills among adolescents following an exercise training intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We assigned 135 adolescents (68 girls, 12-15 years of age) from Lithuania. Adolescents were&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups: control group (CON) (n = 46; 23 girls), coordinative&#xD;
      exercise (CE) (n = 41; 22 girls), and cardiovascular exercise (CVE) group (n = 48; 23 girls).&#xD;
      Participants performed all necessary tests according to the study protocol one week before&#xD;
      the intervention. Adolescents were familiarized with the tests on a separate day before the&#xD;
      first assessment. A second set of tests was performed one week after the 10-week exercise&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention period was 10 weeks. Exercises were led by a Physical Education&#xD;
      teacher. Experimental groups had common physical education classes twice per week for 45&#xD;
      minutes each, and additional exercise sessions were held three times per week for 45 minutes&#xD;
      after school.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fine motor skills assessed by the Flower trail test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Flower trail test was used to assess fine motor skills. The participant has to draw a line between two solid lines as accurately as possible and without lifting a pen. A higher score in the flower trail test means more mistakes made. Change = (week 10 score - baseline score)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary testosterone concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Hormone concentration within the saliva sample was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBL, Hamburg, Germany). Change = (week 10 score - baseline score).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand-eye coordination assessed by the Hand-eye coordination test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Participant has to throw a tennis ball against a wall and catch and repeat this for 30 seconds. A number of successful catches is recorded, higher score shows better coordination. Change = (week 10 score - baseline score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>static balance assessed by the Flamingo balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Flamingo balance test is used to assess static balance. Every attempt to maintain balance for 1 minute is counted as a score. Small values (closer to 1) indicate a better balance. Change = (week 10 score - baseline score)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiorespiratory fitness assessed by the Shuttle Run Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>On this test, the participant must run back and forth between two lines (20 meters apart) with increasing intensity. Higher score means a better cardiorespiratory fitness. Change = (week 10 score - baseline score).</description>
