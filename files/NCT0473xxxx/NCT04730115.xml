      In this study it was aimed to examine the changes in mandibular bone after functional&#xD;
      treatment by using fractal dimension (FD) and cortical thickness (CT) analysis. The study&#xD;
      will perform on 42 mandibular retrognathia cases. The treatment group (T), comprised of 30&#xD;
      cases treated with functional appliance for one year in puberty. The control group (C)&#xD;
      consists of 12 patients who had insufficient oral hygiene; didn't take any orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment for one year. FD and CT analysis will evaluate for both sides. FD measurements will&#xD;
      perform on processus condylar, antigonial notch, and ramus regions in the panoramic&#xD;
      radiographs. Paired t-test will apply to analyze all between groups (before (T1) and after&#xD;
      treatment (T2), before (C1) and after (C2) control). Also, independent t-test wişll use to&#xD;
      determine whether there was any difference between the treatment group (∆T=T2-T1) and the&#xD;
      control group (∆C=C2-C1).&#xD;

        The database was taken from the archives between 2017 and 2019 in Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#xD;
        University. The study will consist of 30 cases treated with the functional appliance and 12&#xD;
        control patients who had insufficient oral hygiene were not treated for one year. After&#xD;
        providing oral care cases were treated orthodontically.&#xD;
