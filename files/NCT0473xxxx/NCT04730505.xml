    <textblock>
      NDS-MM-004 is a multi-center, randomized, pilot trial to evaluate the MyHOPE for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM) Platform in patients with MM. The MyHOPE for MM Platform is a validated&#xD;
      investigational device manufactured by Amalgam Rx, Inc. and designed to provide patients with&#xD;
      a comprehensive set of tools and resources to support the patient throughout their overall&#xD;
      experience with MM.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study faced multiple challenges and its launch was heavily impacted by COVID, which in turn has&#xD;
    significantly impacted the deployment and adoption goals for a digital technology pilot. These&#xD;
    factors led to the difficult decision to close the study.&#xD;
