  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      G-SUMIT is a pilot, phase II,randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      performing a large-scale trial in patients undergoing surgery for first-time diagnosis of&#xD;
      high grade glioma (HGG) in a surgically favorable anatomical location to answer the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does extending the margin of resection 1 cm beyond visible enhanced volume on MRI result in&#xD;
      (a) an increase in overall survival? (b) result in a similar rate of &quot;clinically-significant&quot;&#xD;
      neurological worsening during 30 days post surgery and quality of life at 6 and 12 months?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, multi-centre, pragmatic randomized controlled trial is planned to simulate all&#xD;
      aspects of a larger definitive trial comparing conventional versus supramarginal tumor&#xD;
      resection at the time of the first surgical resection of HGG in appropriately selected&#xD;
      patients. This pilot will help determine the ability to meet pre-specified criteria in&#xD;
      identification, recruitment, and patient allocation, allow for refinement of eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for optimal recruitment, confirm safety of procedure and ability to retain&#xD;
      participants for the duration of the trial. Preliminary efficacy data will inform sample size&#xD;
      calculations and estimation of resources required for the envisioned larger definitive trial.&#xD;
