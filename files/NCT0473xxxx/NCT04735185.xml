  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, comparative-effectiveness study comparing intradiscal autologous stem&#xD;
      cells (from bone marrow aspirate) to intradiscal corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      discogenic low back pain (LBP). The primary objective of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      intradiscal autologous stem cells (from bone marrow aspirate) is more effective than&#xD;
      intradiscal steroids for the treatment of chronic discogenic low back pain (LBP).&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive up to intradiscal stem cell&#xD;
      injections at 1 or 2 discs with cells harvested from a bone marrow aspirate drawn from&#xD;
      participants' iliac crest, or an equal volume (2 mL) of intradiscal steroids and local&#xD;
      anesthetic injected into the discs. In order to identify the painful disc(s), discography may&#xD;
      be used at the discretion of the provider. Both treatments are frequently used as part of&#xD;
      clinical care (i.e. there is no placebo group).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are attempting to determine if intradiscal injection of&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMC) will decrease pain and improve&#xD;
      function compared with intradiscal steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 106 patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic discogenic low back pain for greater&#xD;
      than 6 months, MRI evidence of lumbar disc degeneration limited to one or two discs with &lt;50%&#xD;
      disc height loss, and positive provocative discography (if clinically indicated) will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive intradiscal BMC or steroid and long-acting local anesthetic&#xD;
      (bupivacaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to group I will receive a 2 mL intradiscal injection of autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow aspirate of the posterior ilium, while&#xD;
      those randomized to group II will receive an intradiscal injection of the steroid&#xD;
      methylprednisolone and the local anesthetic bupivacaine. The first follow-up will occur at&#xD;
      4-weeks post-treatment at which time rescue medications may be prescribed or adjusted but no&#xD;
      other analgesic interventions should occur. The primary outcome measure will be pain relief&#xD;
      at 3 months post-treatment, while a positive categorical outcome will be a 2-point or greater&#xD;
      decrease in average LBP coupled with either a score &gt; 5/7 on the PGIC (indicating noticeable&#xD;
      improvement) or a 10-point decrease in ODI (indicating a clinically meaningful benefit). At 3&#xD;
      months, a repeat MRI will be obtained in selected patients at military treatment facilities&#xD;
      (i.e. every 5th patient). Those who fail to experience a positive categorical outcome will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study to receive alternate care, including an option for intradiscal BMC&#xD;
      in those who received corticosteroid. For those who continue to experience a positive&#xD;
      outcome, there will be 6- and 12-month follow up visits. At all follow-up visits, histories&#xD;
      and physical exams will be performed and questionnaires assessing sleep, function, and&#xD;
      anxiety and depression will be administered.&#xD;
