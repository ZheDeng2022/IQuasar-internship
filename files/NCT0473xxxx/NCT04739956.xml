      To assess the psychological impact of pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) classification&#xD;
      pending a final diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PUL is a syndrome of early pregnancy composed of a positive urine pregnancy test without the&#xD;
      visualisation of a pregnancy on trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVUS). The current method for risk&#xD;
      stratifying a PUL is via serum BhCG levels at the time of identification of PUL and after 48&#xD;
      hours, in order to ascertain the viability of the pregnancy. Patients and their partners need&#xD;
      to wait for this result before a management plan can be adopted, taking at least 2-3 hours.&#xD;
      There is a clear need for the patient care pathway to evolve in order to aid and improve the&#xD;
      management of women classified with a PUL. By using point-of-care BhCG testing, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to shorten the time to management. The investigators therefore propose&#xD;
      that shortening the time interval would reduce psychological morbidity. This is a prospective&#xD;
      cohort observational study.&#xD;

    <description>Psychological morbidity will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale on time of PUL classification, 48 hours from PUL classification and following final diagnosis and management. For both Anxiety and Depression, participants can score anywhere from 0 to 21. Score of 11 and above indicate moderate to severe anxiety and depression.</description>
