      This study consisted of a randomized controlled trial group and a long balloon observation&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized control group, 280 subjects with in-stent restenosis were planned to be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned to the test group and the control group in a 1:1 ratio; 30&#xD;
      consecutive subjects will be enrolled in the long balloon observation group, using graceful&#xD;
      molimus release coronary balloon catheter with length of 45mm; All 310 subjects were followed&#xD;
      up at baseline, surgery, discharge, 1 month after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 9 months&#xD;
      after surgery, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, and angiography was performed at 9 months&#xD;

      This study consisted of a randomized controlled trial group and a long balloon observation&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomized control group, 280 subjects with in-stent restenosis were planned to be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned to the test group and the control group in a 1:1 ratio; 30&#xD;
      consecutive subjects will be enrolled in the long balloon observation group, using graceful&#xD;
      molimus release coronary balloon catheter with length of 45mm; All 310 subjects were followed&#xD;
      up at baseline, surgery, discharge, 1 month after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 9 months&#xD;
      after surgery, 1, 2 and 3 years after surgery, and angiography was performed at 9 months&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 310 subjects. The sample size determination process is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, non-inferior clinical trial design was&#xD;
      used with the primary endpoint of intrasegonal LLL at 9 months postoperatively. Sample size&#xD;
      was calculated according to the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) According to previous clinical studies, the LLL of the segment 9 months after paclitaxel&#xD;
      release coronary catheter (Sequent Please) was 0.46±0.48mm[1] and 0.46±0.51mm[2]. 2) In this&#xD;
      study, it was estimated that the mean LLL in the lesion segment of the experimental group and&#xD;
      the control group 9 months after surgery was 0.46mm, and the standard deviation was 0.50mm.&#xD;
      3) The clinically acceptable non-infertility threshold was 0.195mm. When the significance&#xD;
      level of the statistical test was set as one-sided 2.5% and the assurance level was set as&#xD;
      80%, they were randomly divided into groups at a ratio of 1:1. 4) Considering the abscission&#xD;
      rate of 25% (at the same time considering the early withdrawal from the group caused by other&#xD;
      reasons and the random setting), 280 patients were finally enrolled, including 140 in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 140 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long balloon observation group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the maximum length of Sequent ® Please Neo in the control group was 40mm, subjects&#xD;
      suitable for 45mm long balloon could not be randomly enrolled in the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial group. Therefore, this observation group was selected with a sample size of 30 cases.&#xD;
