    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men currently, second only to lung cancer in&#xD;
      China. And in Europe and America, it has already overtaken lung and bowel cancer and become&#xD;
      the greatest threat of of men's health. After the diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients, endocrine therapy is still the main treatment. It is effective for most patients&#xD;
      who receive androgen deprivation therapy at first. However, after the remission whose median&#xD;
      time is 18 to 24 months through endocrine therapy, most patients will turn to castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The treatment of CRPC has always been a difficult point ,&#xD;
      and now it has become the emphasis of new endocrine drug development for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate tablets in combination with prednisone apply to the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration in 2011 and gotten listing license in China. Abiraterone acetate is an&#xD;
      effective irreversible inhibitor CYP17 enzyme and can be converted into abiraterone in vivo.&#xD;
      Abiraterone is an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor with a high affinity and selectivity to&#xD;
      CYP17. The inhibitory activity of abiraterone for CYP17 was 10-30 times higher than that of&#xD;
      ketoconazole. Androgen biosynthesis is inhibited by inhibiting CYP17. The results of many&#xD;
      large-scale clinical trials showed that abiraterone acetate could effectively prolong&#xD;
      survival time of the patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, Blood and plasma samples, urine and faeces samples in 72h from healthy Chinese&#xD;
      adult volunteers who have taken abiraterone acetate tablet orally on an empty stomach or&#xD;
      after meals were collected for metabolite analysis, the relationship between plasma&#xD;
      concentration and gene polymorphism, and identifying the major metabolites in metabolic&#xD;
      biological samples to reveal the pharmacokinetic characteristics of abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      tablets，demonstrate the pharmacodynamic mechanism，and explore the effect of different&#xD;
      genotypes Pharmacokinetic characteristics in healthy Chinese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result provides theoretical basis for clinical rational drug use.&#xD;
