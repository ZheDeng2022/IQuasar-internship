  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to treat vitiligo with a topical PGF2α, microneedling and&#xD;
      excimer laser. The goal is to have greater repigmentation than the standard of care (excimer)&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pilot, split study meaning the patient will receive one experimental and one&#xD;
      standard of care treatment on symmetric lesions of similar location, geometrics and size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will present biweekly to clinic on the same two days for twelve weeks. One&#xD;
      lesion will be treated with microneedling, topical PGF2α and calibrated excimer laser, while&#xD;
      the parallel lesion will be excimer laser alone. Physical exam, photographs, and a review of&#xD;
      of the subjects medical records will occur in the study. Changes in size, appearance, and&#xD;
      adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. The patient will also agree to close&#xD;
      up photographs of their lesions throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible benefit of joining this study is that the treatment received may be more&#xD;
      effective than the other study treatment or then other available treatments for vitiligo,&#xD;
      although this cannot be guaranteed.&#xD;
