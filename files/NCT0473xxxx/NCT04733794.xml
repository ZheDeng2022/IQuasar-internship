  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will facilitate a better understanding of the overall experience of our rectal&#xD;
      cancer survivors after Low Anterior Resection for rectal cancer. Studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the development of bowel and genitourinary dysfunction after this procedure is very&#xD;
      distressing to patients and can have a significant impact on overall quality of life. By&#xD;
      providing interventions that can be performed at home, investigator may alleviate these&#xD;
      symptoms in hopes of improving the experience of patients undergoing Low Anterior Resection.&#xD;
      By acknowledging these potentially debilitating symptoms in a systematic way, the&#xD;
      investigator hopes to reinforce the importance of symptom management in the survivorship&#xD;
      phase after treatment has been completed and ultimately facilitate an individual's return to&#xD;
      routine activities.&#xD;

      Subjects will be recruited from patients presenting to the surgical oncology clinic at Fox&#xD;
      Chase Cancer Center. These patients will have already undergone Low Anterior Resection with a&#xD;
      diverting stoma (colostomy or ileostomy) and will be planning on undergoing reversal of their&#xD;
      stoma in the near future. Subjects will be recruited over a period of 1 year. Such clinic&#xD;
      patients' medical records will be reviewed to determine whether they are possible candidates&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study. They will be identified based on their diagnosis of either Stage&#xD;
      II or III rectal cancer as stated in prior clinic notes, pathology reports, or radiologic&#xD;
      image reports. Participants must have previously undergone Low Anterior Resection with a&#xD;
      diverting stoma and the surgical plan must be for them to undergo ostomy reversal. They will&#xD;
      be approached during a clinic visit by either a co-investigator or a member of the surgery&#xD;
      team (fellow or surgeon) or a research coordinator delegate and asked to participate in the&#xD;
      research study. They will be given a document for informed consent that will describe the&#xD;
      study and potential risks and benefits to the patient. The investigators plan to enroll 10&#xD;
      patients at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Subjects will receive no monetary compensation&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Stage II or III rectal cancer, a history of having an LAR with diverting&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled who develop an anastomotic leak at the time of stoma reversal that&#xD;
