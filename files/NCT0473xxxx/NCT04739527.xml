      Phase I study to evaluate safety and systemic immunogenicity of the DCP-001 vaccine in&#xD;
      patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer after primary treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first phase I study in HGSOC patients with primary disease eligible for standard of&#xD;
      care treatment with either; complete or optimal primary cytoreductive surgery followed by 6&#xD;
      cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel); or 3 cycles of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by complete or optimal cytoreductive interval&#xD;
      surgery and 3 additional cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, DCP-001 vaccinations will be scheduled after standard of care&#xD;
      treatment, starting 6 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 4 vaccinations containing 25E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination followed&#xD;
      by 2 additional booster vaccinations of 10E6 cells. Each patient will be followed up for 24&#xD;
      months. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Systemic immune responses are&#xD;
      determined by standard immune assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and&#xD;
      serum collected before, during and after vaccinations. Progression of disease will be&#xD;
      monitored according to standard-of-care follow-up.&#xD;

                  chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (more NACT cycles to improve surgical&#xD;
                  outcome are allowed) followed by interval debulking surgery (complete / optimal)&#xD;
