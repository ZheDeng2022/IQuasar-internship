    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is correlated with alterations in the structure and function of the brain,&#xD;
      developed according to the phenotype of pain. Still today, the data on functional&#xD;
      connectivity (FC), on chronic back pain, in patients with failed back surgery syndrome&#xD;
      (FBSS), is limited. The selection process for the ideal candidate for spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      (SCS) is based on results from test and functional variables analysis as well as pain&#xD;
      evaluation. In addition to the difficulties in the initial selection of patients and the&#xD;
      predictive analysis of the test phase, which undoubtedly impact on the results in the middle&#xD;
      and long term, the rate of explants is one of the most important concerns, in the analysis of&#xD;
      suitability of implanted candidates. The hypothesis is that the structural and functional&#xD;
      quantitative information provided by imaging biomarkers will improve the characterization of&#xD;
      the patients compared to the characterization with the current clinical variables alone and&#xD;
      this will allow establishing a CDSS that improve the effectiveness of the SCS implantation,&#xD;
      optimizing human, economic and psychological resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, consecutive and observational, open-label, single-center study conducted at&#xD;
      the Multidisciplinary Pain Management Department of our University Hospital. A total of 69&#xD;
      subjects were initially included in the study. The population split in 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventional Group-SCS, included 35 patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)&#xD;
           who were treated with SCS implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparator group included 23 patients with patients with chronic low-back pain who were&#xD;
           treated with conventional medication (CM) for their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group included 11 subjects as health controls who volunteered to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR images were obtained in a 1.5T MR system (Ingenia, Philips, Best, The Netherlands) using&#xD;
      an 8-channel head coil.Clinical variables were evaluated at two different time points&#xD;
      baseline and 12 months after SCS implantation or conventional medication. An ad hoc database&#xD;
      was created to evaluate the different variables involved in pain , including sociodemographic&#xD;
      variables (age, gender, level of studies and marital status), clinical variables (anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, sleeping hours, resilience, NRS, the Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q)) , and the&#xD;
      images obtained from the fMRI.&#xD;

      Primary objective:To develop a predictive model integrated in a clinical decision support&#xD;
      system (CDSS) feed by neuroimaging quantitative information objectively extracted from&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, which maximizes the appropriate use and effectiveness of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation devices surgically implanted in selected patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. -Analyze functional and anatomical brain connectivity patterns in patients with chronic&#xD;
           pain , to develop a predictive model based on quantitative magnetic resonance&#xD;
           neuroimaging which maximizes the effectiveness of neurostimulation devices surgically&#xD;
           implanted in patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. -Analyze the relationship between neuroimaging biomarkers and the different clinical&#xD;
           scales and variables captured from each patient (VAS, Oswestry Disability Index, DN4,&#xD;
           Pain Detect, Moss, SF12, coping scale, optimism, resilience and HAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Device:1.5 Tesla MR system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) Boston Scientific&#xD;
      Neuromodulation (BSN) Precision Spectra™ Spinal Cord Stimulation System with Illumina 3D™&#xD;
      Software and 32 contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description: Precision Spectra™ system IPG is a multiple independent current&#xD;
      controlled pulse generator, capable of delivering current through 32 contacts. It is powered&#xD;
      by a 3D programming software that considers the anatomical position of the leads. Two models&#xD;
      of SCS leads will be provided, featuring 8 or 16 contacts with 1.3 mm diameter, 3 mm contact&#xD;
      length, and contact spacing of 1, 4 or 6 mm. The use of SCS extensions will be optional to&#xD;
      connect the IPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMR description: The MR experiment will be consistent with on-label requirements. The MR&#xD;
      procedure will be performed prior to the device implantation to avoid bias. Even more, the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend the examination of patients with this&#xD;
      kind of devices for security reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations will be performed in a 1'5 Tesla MR system (Philips Healthcare, Best, The&#xD;
      Netherlands) at the Quiron Hospital. Decision of magnetic field is based on the quality of&#xD;
      the examinations and must rely on label products and approval of company for interaction with&#xD;
      implanted system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A head coil with 8 reception channels will be used. Once the patient has been positioned in&#xD;
      the system, initial and fast localization images will be acquired in order to properly plan&#xD;
      the MR sequences of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After planning, a resting-state functional MR (rs-fMR) imaging sequence will be acquired,&#xD;
      asking to the patient to be quiet with the eyes closed and thinking in a blue sky. The&#xD;
      acquisition parameters will consist of an Echo Planar (EPI) dynamic T2* sequence, full brain&#xD;
      coverage with the following parameters: TR=2000 ms; TE=30 ms; voxel size, 1.8 × 1.8 x 3.5 mm;&#xD;
      flip angle, 90º; 40 axial slices; acquisition time 5:20 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DTI MR sequence will be acquired in order to analyze white matter microstructure and&#xD;
      connectivity by tractography techniques with the following parameters: Spin-Echo Echo Planar&#xD;
      Imaging (SE-EPI) sequence, single shot; full brain coverage; 64 gradient directions; b-value,&#xD;
      1300 s/mm2; TR=6200 ms; TE=67 ms; voxel size, 2 x 2 x 2 mm; 60 axial slices; acquisition time&#xD;
      9:40 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional anatomic sequence will allow overlying structural and functional results and,&#xD;
      in addition, obtaining the volumetry values of each brain region. The sequence parameters&#xD;
      are: T1-weighted 3D gradient echo sequence (GRE), full brain coverage; TR=11.6 ms; TE=5.69;&#xD;
      voxel size, 0.48 x 0.48 x 0.50 mm; flip angle, 8º; 280 axial slices; acquisition time 5:36&#xD;
      min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After image acquisition, all data sets will be sent to the Imaging Biomarkers Platform of the&#xD;
      Biomedical Imaging Research Group (GIBI230) of the La Fe Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fMR images will be aligned in order to correct possible small patient's head movements&#xD;
      during examination. For that, the open source SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping,&#xD;
      http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) software tool will be used. After movement correction, a&#xD;
      temporal correction will be applied optimizing the slice timing. Images will be then&#xD;
      normalized to a standardized brain template in order to allow for the study of the&#xD;
      oscillations between individuals. After such processes, data will be filtered by a3D-Gaussian&#xD;
      kernel in order to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing inter-subject&#xD;
      differences. Finally, the application of independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms will&#xD;
      allow for the extraction of brain activation maps in the subject during the acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the DTI MR data for extracting white matter tracts connectivity will be&#xD;
      performed with the open-source FSL software tool (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). An initial&#xD;
      Eddy currents correction will be applied to the images, in order to minimize slight images&#xD;
      displacements and geometry distortions. The brain will be then segmented using the BET&#xD;
      algorithm and brain data of all patients will be normalized to a common template for the&#xD;
      group-based analysis. After this process, fractional anisotropy (FA), diffusivity (D) and&#xD;
      orientation maps will be obtained .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MR images have been processed, the structural and functional connectivity properties&#xD;
      have to be extracted from the regions of interest (ROI). The positioning of these regions&#xD;
      will be obtained from the zones involved in the Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN might&#xD;
      take an important role in pain perception and shows a high correlation with the symptoms&#xD;
      described by patients, which makes this network useful for the prediction of patient response&#xD;
      after the implantation of electrical stimulation, either at a functional or at a structural&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since images will be normalized to a common template, the automated area labeling AAL-tool&#xD;
      will be used to define the regions of interest of the study, that compound the DMN and are&#xD;
      formed by the medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus and the&#xD;
      parietal cortex. After measurement the connectivity parameters in these regions, a predictive&#xD;
      model will be developed by combining clinical variables (scales and symptoms of each patient)&#xD;
      and neuroimaging information. These models will be initially adjusted with a total of 30&#xD;
      patients (training data) and later validated in a group of 30 patients (validation data),&#xD;
      obtaining thereafter results of specificity, sensitivity and models precision.&#xD;
