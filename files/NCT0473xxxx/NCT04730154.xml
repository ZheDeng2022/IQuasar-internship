  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. An important&#xD;
      portion of the breast cancer survivors will face chronic pain complaints. These pain&#xD;
      complaints do not only impact the patient's quality of life but also prevents resumption of&#xD;
      activities, leading to huge economic costs. 30% of all breast cancer survivors with pain&#xD;
      present with perceived injustice which has been conceptualized as a multidimensional&#xD;
      appraisal process characterized by a tendency to interpret one's losses as severe and&#xD;
      irreparable, to attribute blame to others for one's suffering and to experience a sense of&#xD;
      unfairness. Perceived injustice is also associated with increased opioid prescription and&#xD;
      use, urging the need for targeted interventions to diminish perceived injustice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that specific treatment plans for perceived injustice are not yet proven,&#xD;
      pain neuroscience education (PNE) is proven to reassure and encourage towards activity. In&#xD;
      order to obtain the targeted behavioural change, motivational interviewing (MI) is used as&#xD;
      the communication process throughout PNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre, parallel, two-arm, investigator-blinded study with 4-weeks intervention and&#xD;
      two years follow-up will be conducted in 156 BCS with PI and pain. These will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention or usual care group. The groups will receive 1 online session,&#xD;
      an information leaflet and 3 live sessions of education spread over 4 weeks. Pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education in combination with motivational interviewing will be given in the&#xD;
      experimental group and biomedically-focused education to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary scientific objective of the study is to examine whether perceived&#xD;
      injustice-targeted PNE is superior to biomedically-focused pain education in reducing pain&#xD;
      after 12 months in breast cancer survivors with perceived injustice and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to examine whether perceived injustice-targeted&#xD;
      PNE, compared to biomedically-focused pain education, results in improving health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, reducing perceived injustice and opioid use after 24 months in breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors with perceived injustice and pain, and to conduct a health-care cost analysis which&#xD;
      will finally result in a recommendation concerning the use of perceived injustice-targeted&#xD;
      PNE in breast cancer survivors with perceived injustice and pain.&#xD;

    <description>The 12-item Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) will be used to assess perceived injustice. Participants have to rate the frequency of 12 different pain-related statements on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The sum of all items gives the total score which ranges from 0 to 48. The cut off score of 19 is suggestive for a clinically relevant case of perceived injustice.&#xD;
This questionnaire obtains two correlated factors: severity/irreparability of loss and blame/unfairness. The Dutch version of the IEQ has good (test-retest) reliability (ICC = 0.86-0.87). The scores obtained using the IEQ are valid.</description>

    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): is a questionnaire to detect cases of insomnia and asses the insomnia severity of both night-time and daytime components of insomnia. It is based on 7 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4) which generates a total score ranging from 0 (no insomnia) to 28 (great insomnia severity). The cut-off score of 10 is optimal for detecting insomnia cases and a change score of -8.4 points is associated with a moderate improvement. ISI is a valid and reliable instrument in cancer patients and had an adequate concurrent validity of (r = 0,65).</description>

    <description>Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Dutch Language Version (Brief IPQ-DLV): measures five illness perceptions and consists nine items. Five items assess cognitive illness (consequences, personal control, treatment control and identity), two items assess emotional perceptions (concern and emotions), one item assesses illness comprehensibility and one item assesses causal perception. The first eight items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale and the ninth item is rated as an open-ended question which asks to list three most important causal factors in the illness. The Brief IPQ-DLV has acceptable psychometric properties. The Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) is 3 point for item 1 to 8.</description>

    <description>Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire (PVAQ): is designed to consider behaviour over the last 2 weeks in chronic pain patients. It consists 16-items that assesses attention to pain. The frequency of each item is rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always) with a total score ranges between 0 and 90. The higher the score, the more suggestive for a higher degree of vigilance and awareness to pain. It is highly correlated with pain-related measures such as catastrophizing, and weakly correlated with measures of unrelated constructs, such as trait anxiety. The PVAQ is a reliable and valid measurement in chronic patients.</description>

    <measure>Depression, Anxiety, Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: within the week before the randomisation and the start of the intervention; T1: immediately after completing intervention; T2: 6 months after therapy completion; T3: 12 months after therapy completion; T4: 24 months after therapy completion</time_frame>
    <description>Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 21 items (DASS-21): is an instrument that is used to assess anxiety and depression. Twenty-one items are subdivided in 3 categories: depression (7 items), anxiety (7 items) and stress (7 items). Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (most of the time). The higher the item score, the more severe symptom of psychological distress is identified. The total score, used for the interpretation, is the sum of all items multiplied by two. The DASS-21 is a valid and reliable assessment tool in cancer patients.</description>

    <time_frame>T0: within the week before the randomisation and the start of the intervention; T1: immediately after completing intervention; T2: 6 months after therapy completion; T3: 12 months after therapy completion; T4: 24 months after therapy completion</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - II (AAQ-II): is a self-reported 7-item questionnaire that assesses the amount of acceptance and experiential avoidance, or its opposite: psychological flexibility. Every item is a statement that is scored on a 7-point Likert-scale in which one can indicate to what extent these are applicable. The higher the total score, the lower the acceptance and the higher the experiential avoidance. The psychometric qualities of the Dutch translation of the AAQ-II are good with an internal reliability of 0.87 and a construct validity of -0.67 to -0.79 for oppression and psychological complaints.</description>

    <description>PNE is a cognitive behavioural intervention, including educating patients that pain is an output product of the brain resulting from input from multiple central and peripheral nervous system processes and leading to threat perception. Transferring that knowledge to patients, allows them to understand, accept and effectively cope with their pain. In order to obtain the targeted behavioural change, motivational interviewing is used as the communication process throughout PNE.</description>
