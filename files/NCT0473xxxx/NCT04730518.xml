  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A rater-blinded randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design is utilized,&#xD;
      comprised of yoga-based group therapy (YBGT) in the experimental condition, and treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) in the control condition. The participants in the experimental condition&#xD;
      participate in YBGT beside their regular psychiatric treatment (TAU). The intervention is&#xD;
      designed for in-patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. With the aim of examining the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness, self-report and blinded rater-based assessments&#xD;
      are evaluated before the YBGT (T0), and after four weeks of taking part in intervention (T1).&#xD;

      Psychiatrists and psychologists at the ward for psychotic disorders identify eligible&#xD;
      participants and invite them to participate in the study. An eligibility screening is held by&#xD;
      the study assistant at baseline, introducing the study, providing informed electronic&#xD;
      consent, as well as conducting the self-report measures and app-based assessments. A blinded&#xD;
      psychologist who works independently of the (co-) psychologist conducts the remaining&#xD;
      rater-questionnaires. Due to the psychotherapeutic nature of the study, information about the&#xD;
      treatment allocation had to be shared with the co-psychologist and the participants. Saliva&#xD;
      samples are also taken to examine stress-related biomarkers. Randomization was conducted by&#xD;
      the Random Group Generator (pubmed, 2018). The data management plan includes standard&#xD;
      procedures for data-handling such as using anonymized identification codes for patient data.&#xD;
      The participants have the right to access their data, and the right to claim an annihilation.&#xD;
      The data is being saved in an online database, only allowing researchers involved in the&#xD;
      study to access the data.&#xD;

    <description>The yoga-based group therapy (YBGT) involves a four-week intervention with weekly group therapy sessions in addition to TAU. The fifty-minute session takes place with a group size of max. 10 participants and was held once a week by a psychologist who is experienced in yoga-based therapy.&#xD;
A yoga session starts with breathing exercises (pranayama), followed by various exercises in standing, sitting and lying down (asanas), which are accompanied by mindful instructions from the psychologist. Every yoga session ends with a final relaxation (shavasana), which can take the form of a body scan, for example.</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual (TAU) at the ward consists of a variety of daily activity groups the patients can choose from. Every patient at the ward receives a daily schedule depending on individual needs for therapy. The therapies offered at the ward include occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychoeducative groups, and concentration practice of two levels, all not related to mindfulness interventions. In addition to the group activities at the ward, every patient receives individual psychotherapy sessions at least once a week, held by a certified psychiatrist or psychologist. Psychopharmacological treatment is provided by the physicians, and social workers are available in order to support patients in managing their everyday lives after the stationary treatment. Weekly group meetings at the ward, together with the treating physicians, psychotherapists, social workers and the respective patient, foster the exchange success and possible improvements of the treatment.</description>
