  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hematologic cancer frequently report significant difficulties with sleep in the&#xD;
      months after discharge from inpatient chemotherapy. Poor sleep quality can contribute to and&#xD;
      perpetuate problems with daytime fatigue, pain, and distress that are common among patients&#xD;
      with hematologic cancer. There is a need for behavioral interventions that address insomnia&#xD;
      and daytime fatigue, pain, and distress once hematologic cancer patients have returned home&#xD;
      after inpatient chemotherapy. Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI) is a new approach&#xD;
      to treating insomnia. This group-based intervention combines sleep restriction and stimulus&#xD;
      control with mindfulness principles and exercises to reduce worry and promote positive&#xD;
      responses to insomnia. To date, MBTI has not been applied to patients with hematologic&#xD;
      cancer. If MBTI is to meet the needs of hematologic cancer patients, it must be adapted in&#xD;
      several ways. First, because hematologic cancer patients are immunosuppressed, MBTI needs to&#xD;
      be adapted for one-to-one delivery. Second, because hematologic cancer patients experience&#xD;
      significant daytime fatigue, pain, and distress, MBTI needs to be adapted to include&#xD;
      systematic training in coping skills for these symptoms. The investigators propose to develop&#xD;
      and pilot test an adapted MBTI (MBTI+) protocol for hematologic cancer patients reporting&#xD;
      insomnia, fatigue, pain, and/or distress after inpatient chemotherapy. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the study team will use focus groups with hematologic&#xD;
      cancer patients and hematology-oncology providers to guide development along with user&#xD;
      testing with hematologic cancer patients reporting insomnia and daytime symptoms of fatigue,&#xD;
      pain, and/or distress. Phase II will involve a small single-arm pilot to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and examine pre- to post-intervention primary (insomnia) and&#xD;
      secondary (fatigue, pain, distress, mindfulness, self-efficacy) outcomes of the MBTI+&#xD;
      protocol. MBTI+ will consist of six, 60- to 75-minute therapy sessions delivered either&#xD;
      in-person or via videoconferencing technology. Study measures will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention.&#xD;
