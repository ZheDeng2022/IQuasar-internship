  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naval Special Warfare (NSW) operators are exposed to a variety of extreme environmental&#xD;
      conditions and intense physical demands. In addition to breathing high pressure gases at&#xD;
      depth, prolonged cold water immersion and inadequate recovery from sustained physical&#xD;
      exertion negatively impact individual and team performance. Biotechnologies that could&#xD;
      mitigate the effects of cold as well as support physical recovery represent a significant&#xD;
      unmet need for the NSW operational community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin (OT) has a wide range of actions both locally in the brain and peripherally in the&#xD;
      body including skeletal muscle. These peripheral effects can be mediated by classic&#xD;
      ligand-receptor activation given the abundant expression of the oxytocin receptor in&#xD;
      peripheral tissues, along with local expression of OT in peripheral tissues where it is&#xD;
      likely to act in an autocrine manner. Exogenous OT via intranasal administration is FDA&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND)-approved and has been demonstrated as an easy and safe method&#xD;
      to increase circulating OT concentrations that may augment actions on peripheral tissues.&#xD;

      to increase circulating OT concentrations that may augment actions on peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold water operators undergo an extensive and unique set of physical, physiological, and&#xD;
      psychological stressors during a mission. In-water transit may exceed 6 hours submerged in&#xD;
      cold water, on rebreathers, and in a confined space. During this lengthy transit, operators&#xD;
      must maintain vigilance over navigation, vehicle, and life support controls while exposed to&#xD;
      the risks of mixed gas or oxygen rebreather diving, alongside hypothermia, dehydration,&#xD;
      undernutrition, and other factors that can significantly degrade operator performance. Once&#xD;
      the team has reached target, they must be at peak cognitive and physical readiness as they&#xD;
      carry out their mission objective. When the mission objective is complete, the operators&#xD;
      undertake the lengthy return trip back to their deployed base. Optimized operator cognitive&#xD;
      and physical performance is essential throughout all phases of a cold water mission, and safe&#xD;
      and tolerable approach to optimizing warfighter performance and resilience will be key for&#xD;
      future cold water operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential thermogenic and recovery effects or intranasal OT, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      prophylactic OT administration, compared to placebo, will mitigate deficits in&#xD;
      mission-relevant performance during and after cold water exposure. For this project we will&#xD;
      utilize the ONR Cold Water Performance Task Battery, which was designed based on results from&#xD;
      a task analysis combined with input from the cold water operator community. The task battery&#xD;
      has been validated for its ability to induce changes in core and peripheral body temperature,&#xD;
      manual dexterity, cognitive performance, and physical performance following cold water&#xD;
      exposure. Our hypothesis will be tested via one specific aim enrolling N=24 18-39 y/o men by&#xD;
      using a rigorous, double-blind, placebo- controlled, within-subjects randomized cross-over&#xD;
      trial comparing 48 IU OT vs placebo (saline) in cold water performance and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To investigate the impact of intranasal OT on cold water task performance and&#xD;
      recovery using the ONR Cold Water Performance Task Battery, which includes cold water&#xD;
      exposure; cognitive performance testing via oculometric assessment and the Defense Automated&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA); and physical performance testing via a simulated ruck,&#xD;
      ladder climb, and manual dexterity testing.&#xD;
