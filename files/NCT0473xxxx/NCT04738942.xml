  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to learn if 4-weekly vedolizumab improves symptoms of Japanese&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD).&#xD;
      Vedolizumab is commercially available in Japan for 8-weekly treatment but not for 4-weekly&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctors will also monitor side effects from the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. For those who&#xD;
      can take part, participants will receive vedolizumab intravenously once every 4 weeks. After&#xD;
      3 infusions of vedolizumab (which will be 12 weeks of treatment), the study doctor will&#xD;
      assess if symptoms of the participants have improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not have improved symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment with vedolizumab&#xD;
      will stop this treatment. Then, they will visit the study clinic 16 weeks after their last&#xD;
      infusion of vedolizumab for a final check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have improved symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment with vedolizumab will&#xD;
      continue to receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Then, after their last infusion of&#xD;
      vedolizumab, the participants will visit the study clinic 16 weeks later for a final&#xD;
      check-up. Finally, the study clinic will make a phone call to each participant 6 months after&#xD;
      their last infusion to check if they have any health problems.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Response at Week 12 Based on Modified Mayo Score in UC Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction of &gt;=2 points and &gt;=25% in modified Mayo score, and a decrease of &gt;=1 point in rectal bleeding subscore or rectal bleeding subscore of =&lt;1 from baseline (Week 0). Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Modified Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and Mayo endoscopic subscore (findings on endoscopy), each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Response at Week 12 in CD Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction of =&gt;70 points in CDAI score from baseline (Week 0). CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs and symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of antidiarrheal, physical examination and laboratory findings. Total score ranges from 0 to 600 points. Higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 12 Based on Modified Mayo Score in UC Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a modified Mayo score of =&lt;2, and no individual subscore &gt;1. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Modified Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and Mayo endoscopic subscore (findings on endoscopy), each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of =&lt;1, in participants with baseline Mayo endoscopic subscore of &gt;=2. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Corticosteroid-Free Remission Based on Partial Mayo Score in UC Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Corticosteroid-free remission is defined as participants using oral corticosteroids at baseline (Week 0) who have discontinued oral corticosteroids and are in clinical remission based on partial Mayo score at Week 52. Clinical remission based on partial Mayo score is defined as a partial Mayo score of =&lt;2, and no individual subscore &gt;1. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Partial Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicates more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 12 in CD Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score of =&lt;150. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs and symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of antidiarrheal, physical examination and laboratory findings. Total score ranges from 0 to 600 points. Higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
