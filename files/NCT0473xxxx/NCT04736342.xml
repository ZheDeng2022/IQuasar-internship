  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A normal pregnancy lasts between 37+0 to 41+6 weeks. Estimated date of delivery is set&#xD;
      exactly at 40+0 weeks of gestation. Base on this estimation, professional society's&#xD;
      guidelines have recommended to start inducing the labor from 41+0 to 41+6 weeks after the&#xD;
      last menstrual period. Clinical practice during the last few decades has been moving towards&#xD;
      this trend and postponing labor induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But is 40 weeks' gestational age the optimal endpoint of human pregnancy? Recent studies,&#xD;
      however, showed different results where many of them support induction of labor at 39 weeks.&#xD;
      A large cohort retrospective study which included information from merely 5.4 million&#xD;
      non-anomalous live births in the United States from 2012 to 2016, though only modestly, the&#xD;
      authors have been able to conclude that the rates of composite neonatal and maternal adverse&#xD;
      outcomes increase from 39 through 41 weeks of gestation among low-risk parous women.&#xD;
      Stratifying by parity, it seemed that the trend is also similar among all low-risk women no&#xD;
      matter which parities they are in. When it comes to nulliparous women, results from a large&#xD;
      prospective randomized control trial (the ARRIVE trial) show that induction of labor at 39&#xD;
      weeks in low-risk nulliparous women did not lead to significant lower frequency of a&#xD;
      composite adverse perinatal outcome but it did result in a significant lower rate of cesarean&#xD;
      delivery. More recently, in a review sponsored by the Cochrane library on induction of labor&#xD;
      beyond 37 weeks' gestation has found that there is a clear reduction in perinatal death with&#xD;
      a policy of labor induction at or beyond 37 weeks compared with expectant management, though&#xD;
      absolute rates are small (0.4 versus 3 deaths per 1000). There were also lower caesarean&#xD;
      rates without increasing rates of operative vaginal births and there were fewer Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit admissions with a policy of induction. Base on these evidence, the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has suggested &quot;it's time to induce of&#xD;
      labor at 39th week of gestation&quot;. It is true that although induction of labor is familiar&#xD;
      with obstetricians, the procedure is still raising concern from patients' side. Even in the&#xD;
      United States where patients consulting has been routinely applied, the rate of patients&#xD;
      refuse to be induced at 39th week of gestation is about 50%. Review from Cochrane library&#xD;
      also suggested that &quot;Offering women tailored counselling may help them make an informed&#xD;
      choice between induction of labor for pregnancies&quot; . In some countries where the National&#xD;
      Guidelines still recommends induction of labor should be considered after 41 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation and pregnancy related decisions are driven by many identical factors such as:&#xD;
      knowledge, traditional or cultural ones, the patients' perspective on induction of labor&#xD;
      before 40 weeks of gestation is a challenge. Thus, the patients' understanding of the&#xD;
      elective induction of labor and factors contribute to decision-making process towards&#xD;
      induction of labor should be investigated in order not only to develop appropriate induction&#xD;
      policies for the future but also scientific studies/randomized clinical trials to come.&#xD;
