      Non-invasive double-blind randomised comparative study on presbyopic subjects wearing&#xD;
      progressive lenses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays many different types of progressive addition lenses are available for the correction&#xD;
      of presbyopia. Progressive addition lenses provide a more natural correction for presbyopic&#xD;
      people due to a gradual and progressive increase of lens power from far area through the&#xD;
      intermediate portion to the near area. However, some patients still experience adaptation&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the preference, adaptability and visual&#xD;
      performance of progressive lens designs (up to three designs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant is required to wear all pairs of spectacles one after another, each pair for&#xD;
      one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be required to visit the optometry clinic (at University of Milano&#xD;
      Bicocca) three times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #1: Screening based on inclusion criteria, Informed Consent Form (ICF) form signing,&#xD;
      Optometric exam and choice of the frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who will pass the inclusion/exclusion screening will be asked to sign the ICF and&#xD;
      enrolled for the optometric exam. Subjects will choose the spectacle frame and all individual&#xD;
      fitting parameters will be measured for lens' manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2: Subjects will receive three marked pairs of progressive lenses. The three spectacle&#xD;
      frames will be adjusted to fit properly on the subject' face. After 10-15 min of wearing of&#xD;
      the first pair of lenses, each subject will be asked to answer to a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #3 (last visit): questionnaires should be returned; the last comparison question will&#xD;
      be answered during this visit, and subject will choose the best pair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study each participant will be entitled to get one pair of progressive&#xD;
      lenses available in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presbyopic subjects have been already wearing any progressive additional lens (PAL) designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 +/- 2 subjects, the specified PAL design wearers and 40 +/- 2 the other PAL design wearers&#xD;
      to be enrolled and signed the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be wearing three different PAL designs. Subjects will be asked to choose&#xD;
      one pair of spectacles (design) which they like the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts a stratified permuted block randomisation to reduce an evaluation bias by&#xD;
      the wearing sequence and prescriptions. The mean of both eyes' prescriptions is set as a&#xD;
      single stratification factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frames:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will choose a model of spectacle frame. Three identical frames will be taken for&#xD;
      each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lenses will be produced in EU&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three different lens designs will be tested in the study.&#xD;
