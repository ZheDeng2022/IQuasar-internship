  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FAST Plasma Volume (PV) Technology will aid in determining the plasma and interstitial&#xD;
      volumes of end stage renal disease patients before and after dialysis therapy, providing a&#xD;
      more precise understanding of pre and post dialysis volumes and extent of volume removal&#xD;
      during the course of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single site, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and performance of the FAST plasma volume (PV) Technology in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of VFI will occur within 28 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 1 dose of VFI and 1 dose of iohexol approximately 4 hours prior to&#xD;
      undergoing dialysis followed by a second dose of visible fluorescent injectate (VFI) and&#xD;
      iohexol approximately 1 hour after completing dialysis. Patients will be discharged following&#xD;
      completion of Day 1 activities. Patients will be seen and evaluated on their next 2 dialysis&#xD;
      sessions for any adverse reaction by answering questions about their health, approximately on&#xD;
      Day 3 and Day 8. A follow-up phone call will be performed on Day 31 (± 1 day).&#xD;
