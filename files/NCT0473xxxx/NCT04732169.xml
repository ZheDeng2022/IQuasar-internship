      With this study, the investigators will address the following scientific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate the antidepressant effects of CBD in human adults with treatment refractory&#xD;
           MDD as measured by standard rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirm CBD's safety profile in human adult patients with MDD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be medically stable and historically failed to respond to one or more&#xD;
      adequate trials of commercially available antidepressant drugs during the current depressive&#xD;
      episodes. We plan to administer Epidiolex (CBD) or placebo in double blind, randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over fashion to 10 depressed adults with MDD over 16 weeks. The study will use a&#xD;
      cross-over design so that each participant serves as their own control. The dosage of CBD or&#xD;
      placebo CBD will automatically be titrated up and down during the dosing period. Participants&#xD;
      first randomized to CBD will automatically be tapered from CBD and switched to placebo CBD&#xD;
      after eight weeks. Participants first randomized to placebo CBD will automatically have an&#xD;
      equivalent reduction in placebo CBD and be switched to CBD after eight weeks. During the&#xD;
      first week after randomization, participants will receive 125mg of CBD or placebo CBD taken&#xD;
      twice daily (250mg/day). During the second week after randomization, the dosage will be&#xD;
      increased to 250mg of CBD or placebo CBD taken twice daily (500mg/day) for one week. During&#xD;
      the third week after randomization, the dosage will be increased to 500mg of CBD or placebo&#xD;
      CBD taken twice daily (1000mg/day). Participants will remain on 1000mg/day of CBD or placebo&#xD;
      CBD for four more weeks, at which point they will be stepped down to 500mg/day of CBD or&#xD;
      placebo CBD for one week, followed by 250mg/day of CBD or placebo CBD for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug and matching placebo will be prepared by the UAB Investigational Pharmacy. Sesame&#xD;
      oil will be used to create the placebo. Both the placebo and the active CBD will be flavored&#xD;
      with strawberry flavoring. Study medications will be dispensed at weekly visits and each&#xD;
      participant will be given 14 single dose syringes to be taken orally twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening participants will undergo a MINI interview, physical examination, and ECG, vital&#xD;
      signs, HDRS-17, MADRS, CSSR-S, ATRQ, SF-36 and CGI-S. Laboratory assessment including CBC&#xD;
      with differential, TSH with reflex T4, CMP, UA, and UDS will be done at screening.. At&#xD;
      screening, the investigators will also administer the following self-report questionnaires to&#xD;
      characterize reward sensitivity and other personality features relevant to anhedonia: Social&#xD;
      Anhedonia Scale, the Motivation and Energy Inventory and the Physical Anhedonia Scale. The&#xD;
      screening period will last up to one week, at which point subjects will present for a&#xD;
      baseline randomization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen on site weekly during the study. Drug effect will be measured using&#xD;
      standard rating scales including the HDRS-17, MADRS, SF36, CSSR-S, CGI-I, CGI-S, which will&#xD;
      be completed at each visit. The following scales will be completed at every other visit&#xD;
      following the screening visit: Social Anhedonia Scale, the Motivation and Energy Inventory&#xD;
      and the Physical Anhedonia Scale. At each study visit safety assessments including vital sign&#xD;
      assessment and adverse event assessment will be completed. Subjects will also undergo&#xD;
      physical examination and an ECG for safety during screening, after 8 weeks of treatment and&#xD;
      at the end of 16 weeks of treatment. Laboratory assessment including CBD with differential,&#xD;
      CMP, and UA will be done at the 8 week and 16 week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess potential changes in cognition while on the study drug/placebo, three computerized&#xD;
      tests of cognition will the administered at baseline, Week 8, and Week 16. The Relational &amp;&#xD;
      Item Specific Encoding task (RISE) will probe any potential neural abnormalities. The&#xD;
      Probabilistic Learning Task will be used to examine neural circuits related to reward&#xD;
      processing in major depression disorder. For the working memory task, participants will be&#xD;
      shown two images with objects and asked to decide whether the two images differ or not.&#xD;
