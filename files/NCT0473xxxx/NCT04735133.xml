  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial in order to determine the effect of&#xD;
      prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy for the prevention of surgical site&#xD;
      complications in high-risk colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy applied after open colorectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery to high-risk patients affects surgical wound complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      pNBYT group: The study was completed with a total of 50 patients, 24 of intervention group&#xD;
      anda 26 of the control group, who met the inclusion criteria at the surgical oncology service&#xD;
      of a university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were collected using Patient Identification Form, Surgical Procedure Form, Wound&#xD;
      Follow-up Chart and ASEPSİS Wound Scoring System. Ethics committee approval and written&#xD;
      informed consent of the individuals was taken in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were analyzed in SPSS Statistics 24.0 program using Shapiro Wilk test and Q-Q&#xD;
      graphs, Independent Sample t test, Mann Whitney U test, Chi-square, Cochran's Q and Friedman&#xD;
      test. The value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted for the statistical significance level. It was&#xD;
      determined that the groups were similar in terms of identification and surgical procedure&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of negative pressure wound treatment applied to high-risk patients after open&#xD;
      colorectal cancer surgery on four SWCs, including surgical site infections, hematoma, seroma,&#xD;
      and wound dehiscence, were studied. The study started before surgery and lasted up to one&#xD;
      month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, patients fasted for eight hours before the operation and were required to&#xD;
      take a shower with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate at night. The patients who required surgical&#xD;
      hair removal were shaved with a clipper in the operating room before the operation. Also,&#xD;
      patients received 1g of ampicillin + sulbactam/cefazolin within 60 minutes before the&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;

    <description>is a quantitative scoring method that provides a numerical value regarding the severity of the SSI by using objective criteria based on the appearance of the wound. The wound score is categorized into five stages: 0-10 points are considered satisfactory healing, 11-20 points disturbance of healing, 21-30 points minor wound infection, 31-40 points moderate wound infection, and ≥41 points severe wound infection.</description>
