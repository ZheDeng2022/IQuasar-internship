  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of whole cell fermentate on gut&#xD;
      health, including GI system function, such as supporting consistency and regularity of bowel&#xD;
      habits, as well as changes in microbiota. The role of the GI system can also be extended to&#xD;
      immune regulation because approximately 70% of the entire immune system in the body is&#xD;
      located around the gut. Thus, the health and wellbeing of the gut can have a great impact on&#xD;
      whole-body health. Therefore, this study will assess the effect on overall immune function.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with a screening visit and&#xD;
      two test periods separated by a three-week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, after subjects have provided informed consent, medical history will be reviewed&#xD;
      and clinic visit procedures will be performed, including assessments of prior/current&#xD;
      medication/supplement use, and evaluations of inclusion/exclusion criteria.Subjects will be&#xD;
      dispensed a diet record, gastrointestinal questionnaire, bowel habits diary, upper&#xD;
      respiratory symptom questionnaire, and a stool collection kit to complete prior to Visit 2&#xD;
      (week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (week 0), eligible subjects will return to the clinic. The stool samples will be&#xD;
      collected, and the diet record, gastrointestinal questionnaire, and bowel habits diary will&#xD;
      be collected. Subjects will also be administered a stress questionnaire and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire. Eligible subjects will then be randomized to one of two test groups (placebo&#xD;
      or active). Subjects will track study product intake using a daily study product log and&#xD;
      track daily cold symptoms. Subjects will also be given a gastrointestinal questionnaire,&#xD;
      bowel habits diary, upper respiratory symptom questionnaire, and a stool collection kit to&#xD;
      complete prior to Visit 3 (week 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (week 4), the stool samples will be collected, and the diet record,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal questionnaire, and bowel habits diary will be collected. Subjects will also&#xD;
      be administered a stress and quality of life questionnaire. Unused study product will be&#xD;
      collected and compliance assessed via unused study product.Subjects will also be given a&#xD;
      gastrointestinal questionnaire, bowel habits diary, and a stool collection kit to complete&#xD;
      prior to Visit 4 (week 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then enter the 3-week washout period, during which time no&#xD;
      surveys/questionnaires will be kept and will then crossover to the other study product in&#xD;
      their test sequence and repeat the Test Period I procedures (at Visit 2 and 3) during Test&#xD;
      Period II (Visits 4 [week 7] and 5 [week 11]).&#xD;
