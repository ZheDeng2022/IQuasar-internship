  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes of luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      influence the ocular physiology in both anterior and posterior segments. From the literature&#xD;
      review, there were no significant differentiation in tear physiology, anterior chamber dept,&#xD;
      lens thickness and refractive status. Some studies demonstrated then the central corneal&#xD;
      thickness was thinner in the follicular phase, but this is non-conclusive. Advance in&#xD;
      ophthalmic technologies provide few studies of posterior segment changes during the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, however, there were quite difference in methodology such as detection methods of&#xD;
      ovulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were 2 studies of posterior segment changes during the menstrual cycle. Akar et al&#xD;
      showed significant decrease of neuroretinal rim area and increase of cupt area in late luteal&#xD;
      phase. Ulas et al found that choroidal thickness was significant thicker in mid-luteal phase.&#xD;
      However, the study of retinal vascular density by optical coherence tomography angiography&#xD;
      (OCTA) during the menstrual cycle has never been published before.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be investigated by Optovue速 in follicular phase, ovulatory phase, luteal phase of menstrual cycle. The investigation will be done between 12 PM and 1 PM at each phase. Urine pregnancy testing was done at first and last visits. LH ovulation test was performed by the participants own. if the ovulation was detected by urine strip test, the participant have to underwent the Optovue速 within 48 hours.</description>
