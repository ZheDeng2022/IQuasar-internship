    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅰ, first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-102 injection&#xD;
      in subjects with CLDN18.2-positive advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Traditional '3+3' escalation design will be used. Dose escalation consists of&#xD;
      five ascending dose levels of LM-102 (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg).&#xD;
      All subjects will be administered every 3 weeks (1 cycle=21 days) with a dose of LM-102 as a&#xD;
      2 h (120±10 min) intravenous (IV) infusion until the disease progression, intolerance,&#xD;
      subject discontinuation/informed consent withdrawal, or at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      in consultation with sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all the subjects in each cohort complete the DLT assessment, the safety monitor&#xD;
      committee (SMC) will make decisions for dose escalations, exploring intermediate/higher doses&#xD;
      or terminating dose escalations according to the safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity&#xD;
      data. The SMC may also adjust the dosage, frequency of administration, PK sample collection&#xD;
      plan, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity, the MTD or OBD will be determined by&#xD;
      SMC. And the RP2D will be determined based on DLTs, MTD or OBD, and the totality of the&#xD;
      safety data throughout the study, including dose modifications and delays, PK, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity data, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (up to 28 days before the first dose);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period [28 (±3) days after end of treatment (EOT)/early withdrawal or before&#xD;
           other anti-tumor treatments (whichever occurs earlier)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity evaluation of LM-102 will be conducted&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
