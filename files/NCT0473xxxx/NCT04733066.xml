  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective longitudinal study is to compare the quality of life of short&#xD;
      bowel patients prior to and on teduglutide treatment with a non-treated patient group in a&#xD;
      matched-pair design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a malabsorptive disorder mostly caused by surgical&#xD;
      interventions, which may result in chronic intestinal failure (cIF). The incidence is&#xD;
      progressively increasing due to more aggressive surgical and medical approaches. Parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition is still the mainstay of treatment for patients with irreversible cIF. New hormonal&#xD;
      therapies hold promise by romoting mucosal growth and intestinal absorption and thereby&#xD;
      leading to a consequent reduction in parenteral support and symptoms related to large stomal&#xD;
      or faecal losses. Outside the typical primary endpoints of cost data, quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      is an important and yet underappreciated consideration of the effectiveness of targeted&#xD;
      therapies. In the clinical STEPS trial, Jeppesen et al. have previously shown a significant&#xD;
      improvement of the SBS-QoL total score after 24 week treatment with teduglutide&#xD;
      longitudinally but could not identify a statistical significance to the placebo group.&#xD;
      Accordingly, Chen and colleagues carried out a post hoc analysis of the afore mentioned&#xD;
      clinical trial data based on 86 patients and could confirm the results auf Jeppesen et al.&#xD;
      Taken together, these clinical trial data did not show a direct benefit of teduglutide&#xD;
      treatment on QoL in these patients, while real life data on QoL changes are not available&#xD;
      yet. During the release of teduglutide in Germany, the PNLiver trial (DRKS00010993) recruited&#xD;
      chronic intestinal failure patients with parenteral nutrition from 2014 till 2019 to evaluate&#xD;
      the capability of non-invasive liver function tests in cIF patients in a cross-sectional&#xD;
      (n=90) and longitudinal study (n=20. All participants underwent study visits including&#xD;
      clinical examination, dynamic liver function assessment, comprehensive blood tests,&#xD;
      nutritional status assessment and quality of life assessment (Short Form 36 [SF-36] and&#xD;
      SBS-QoL). Therefore, we have a comprehensive data set of a large monocentric cIF cohort prior&#xD;
      to teduglutide treatment. Consequently, our unique QoL data from the PNLiver trail enables a&#xD;
      followup assessment for an observation period above 24 weeks of patients who were in the&#xD;
      meantime exposed to teduglutide in a real life setting. Nevertheless, QoL also tends to&#xD;
      improve with longer duration on HPN. Therefore, we are aiming to extend the results with a&#xD;
      pairwise matched control group from non teduglutide-treated PNLiver trail patients and&#xD;
      collect follow-up data from this group accordingly.&#xD;

        A comprehensive data set of a large monocentric cIF cohort prior to teduglutide treatment&#xD;
        from the PNLiver trail already exists. Consequently, we aim to have a follow-up assessment&#xD;
        of patients who are in the meantime treated with teduglutide as a clinical routine&#xD;
        procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We aim to extent the results with a pairwise matched control group from non&#xD;
        teduglutide-treated PNLiver trail patients and collect follow-up data from this group&#xD;
        accordingly.&#xD;
