      A randomised feasibility study into the use of endoscopic visualisation of rectal anastomosis&#xD;
      vs. current practice and the effect on anastomotic leak rates in patients undergoing rectal&#xD;
      surgery for bowel cancer in a tertiary referral centre&#xD;

      Anastomotic leak is one of the biggest challenges in colorectal surgery with little still&#xD;
      known about what causes a leak. An anastomotic leak is defined as a defect of the intestinal&#xD;
      wall at the anastomotic site leading to a communication between the intra- and extra-luminal&#xD;
      compartments. Current leak rates following rectal surgery are between 8% and 17%, which is&#xD;
      significant given the numbers of resections performed in our unit, approximately 750 per&#xD;
      year. The morbidity of an anastomotic leak can be significant. Most require re-operation and&#xD;
      those that do not may require interventional radiological drainage or prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      for intra-venous antibiotics. There is also a high risk of mortality, especially for those&#xD;
      requiring a further operation where it can be up to 5.8%. The cost of a leak has been shown&#xD;
      to be significant both in monetary terms and by increasing the length of stay. In a study&#xD;
      from the USA per 1,000 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the economic burden associated&#xD;
      with anastomotic leaks--including hospitalization and re-admission--was established as 9,500&#xD;
      days in prolonged LOS and $28.6 million in additional costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform an intra-operative endoscopy for participants undergoing&#xD;
      rectal resection and anastomosis to understand what leads to an anastomotic leak and to try&#xD;
      and reduce the rates of anastomotic leakage by fixing these problems at the time of operation&#xD;
      so they do not lead to a post-operative complication. In the intervention group during the&#xD;
      procedure the investigators will visualise the anastomosis endoscopically looking for&#xD;
      defects, areas of ischaemia and congestion. Previous retrospective studies have proven the&#xD;
      safety of this technique and significant reduction of leak rates, albeit within the&#xD;
      limitations of a retrospective study; the investigators plan to take this hypothesis further&#xD;
      to using a randomised approach. The anastomosis will be graded from 1 to 3 in the endoscopic&#xD;
      group. Grade 1 is defined as circumferentially normal appearing peri-anastomotic mucosa.&#xD;
      Grade 2 is defined as ischemia or congestion involving &lt;30% of either the colon or rectal&#xD;
      mucosa. Grade 3 is defined as ischemia or congestion involving &gt;30% of the colon or rectal&#xD;
      mucosa or ischemia/congestion involving both sides of the staple line. If appearances are&#xD;
      grade 2 a suture re-inforcement or re-anastomosis will be performed; if appearances are grade&#xD;
      3 a re-anastomosis will be performed. Images will be taken during the procedure to document&#xD;
      the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This compares to current standard practice in the control group of air insufflation into the&#xD;
      rectum while the anastomosis is bathed in sterile water to look for the presence of air&#xD;
      bubbles which may have come through an anastomotic defect. If the test is positive the&#xD;
      surgeon makes a decision regarding whether suture re-inforcement, re-do of the anastomosis&#xD;
      and/or defunctioning stoma is required. There are no standardised guidelines for this&#xD;
      decision making process. This is currently standard practice in most colorectal departments&#xD;
      in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to see if this trial design is feasible within the investigators&#xD;
      department and if so to progress to a full scale trial. The secondary aim is from the&#xD;
      preliminary data to see if there is a significant difference in anastomotic leak rates&#xD;
      between participants who receive standard care and participants who receive our intervention.&#xD;
      There are no previous randomised trials into this subject and considering the significance of&#xD;
      an anastomotic leak we feel this justifies further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients an anastomotic leak can be catastrophic, both for short and long term outcomes&#xD;
      and patients who have had this complication would be very keen for any intervention that may&#xD;
      reduce the risk of this happening. It will eliminate a major source of risk for patients,&#xD;
      improve quality of life, and produce immediate cost-savings for the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to our current standard practice, which is limited as there is no direct&#xD;
      visualisation of the bowel, the investigators feel this new technique will provide&#xD;
      significantly more information to make an informed decision on an anastomosis and therefore&#xD;
      lead to a reduction in leak rates. The current practice of an air-leak test is standard&#xD;
      practice in the UK but a small number of centres have looked at endoscopic visualisation with&#xD;
      less rigorous methodology (retrospective/non-randomised studies).&#xD;

    <description>An anastomotic leak is defined as a defect of the intestinal wall at the anastomotic site leading to a communication between the intra- and extraluminal compartments. If there is clinical suspicion of an anastomotic leak (signs of peritonism on examination, rising inflammatory markers) a CT scan will be performed to confirm.</description>
