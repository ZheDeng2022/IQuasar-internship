  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of hemorrhoidal disease involves both instrumental and surgical techniques&#xD;
      (hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidopexy). In 1995, a Japanese author proposed a new treatment&#xD;
      technique for stage II (spontaneous reintegration prolapse) or III (digital reintegration&#xD;
      prolapse) disease, based on Doppler identification of low perirectal arteries followed by&#xD;
      their ligation, via a specific windowed rectoscope. Later, a further modification appeared,&#xD;
      allowing patients to be treated at more advanced stages, adding vertical mucopexy to the&#xD;
      ligatures along the main bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease is based on a vascular theory (opening of&#xD;
      arteriovenous shunts) and on a mechanical theory (distension of the supporting tissue).&#xD;
      Hemorrhoidectomy responds to the first, hemorrhoidopexy to the second. The HAL (Hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      Artery Ligation) - RAR (Recto-Anal Repair) technique seeks to treat both vascular (by&#xD;
      ligation of the nourishing arteries) and mechanical (by mucopexy of prolapsed bundles)&#xD;
      components. The technique first spread to Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, Australia and&#xD;
      England. It has been popularized in France by some authors.&#xD;

      The treatment of hemorrhoidal disease involves both instrumental and surgical techniques&#xD;
      (hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidopexy). In 1995, a Japanese author proposed a new treatment&#xD;

      allowing patients to be treated at more advanced stages, adding vertical mucopexy to the&#xD;
      ligatures along the main bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiopathological basis of HAL Doppler The pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease is based&#xD;
      on a vascular theory (opening of arteriovenous shunts) and on a mechanical theory (distension&#xD;
      of the supporting tissue). Hemorrhoidectomy responds to the first, hemorrhoidopexy to the&#xD;
      second. The HAL (Hemorrhoidal Arttery Ligation) - RAR (Recto-Anal Repair) technique seeks to&#xD;
      treat both vascular components (by ligation of the nourishing arteries) and mechanical (by&#xD;
      mucopexy of prolapsed bundles). The technique first spread to Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain,&#xD;
      Australia and England. It was popularized in France by some authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the operation The patient is operated on in the perineal first position, under&#xD;
      general anesthesia or under locoregional or even local anesthesia. Most of the time, the&#xD;
      procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, after rectal preparation with a simple&#xD;
      enema.4,5 The equipment (there are several types) for HAL comprises a transparent disposable&#xD;
      rectoscope provided near its end with a centimeter window through which the x-point ligatures&#xD;
      of slowly absorbable 2/0 thread will be made. It contains a light source facilitating the&#xD;
      exposure of the internal surface of the rectum and a Doppler transducer secured to the base&#xD;
      of the rectoscope containing the Doppler system itself. The assembly is connected to a&#xD;
      generator which will transmit the Doppler noises to the surgeon. A printer on the generator&#xD;
      allows ligatures to be mapped and the depth of linked arteries to be noted.6 The rest of the&#xD;
      equipment includes a needle holder, knot pusher, scissors and dissecting forceps to dab the&#xD;
      surgical site if necessary.2 The material for HAL with mucopexy is identical, except for the&#xD;
      disposable rectoscope which is much more indented at its end and on one side (and at the time&#xD;
      of arterial ligation, covered by a metal or opalescent jacket leaving a window), so as to be&#xD;
      able to carry out a vertical overlock in the lower rectum, above the package that the&#xD;
      operator intends to treat. It is thus possible to make one or more mucopexies depending on&#xD;
      the operative findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Two circumferential explorations are performed at&#xD;
      the level of the lower rectum, approximately 25 and 40 mm above the pectinate line. Patients&#xD;
      on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy can be operated using this technique, since there is&#xD;
      no wound. The patient leaves the same day with paracetamol on demand, without special care at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;

    <description>The patient is operated on in the first perineal position, under general anesthesia or under locoregional or even local anesthesia, after rectal preparation by simple enema. The HAL equipment included a disposable transparent rectoscope fitted near its end with a centimeter window through which wire stitch ligatures will be made. A light source facilitating the exposure of the internal face of the rectum and a Doppler transducer secured to the base of the rectoscope containing the Doppler system. Everything is connected to a generator which transmits Doppler noises to the surgeon. A printer on the generator makes it possible to map ligatures and note the depth of linked arteries. Equipment includes needle holder, knot pusher, scissors and dissecting forceps.
