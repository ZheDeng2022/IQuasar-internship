  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing nowadays. The diagnosis of AP is&#xD;
      defined according to Atlanta criteria with the presence of two of the following 3 findings;&#xD;
      a) characteristic abdominal pain b) amylase and lipase values ≥3 times c) AP diagnosis in&#xD;
      ultrasonography (USG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      imaging. While 80% of the disease has a mild course, 20% is severe and requires intensive&#xD;
      care treatment. Mortality varies between 10-25% in severe (severe) AP, while it is 1-3% in&#xD;
      mild AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring systems with clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings are used to evaluate the&#xD;
      severity of the disease. Advanced age (&gt;70yo), obesity (as body mass index (BMI, as kg/m2),&#xD;
      cigarette and alcohol usage, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥20 mg/dl, increased creatinine, C&#xD;
      reactive protein level (CRP) &gt;120mg/dl, decreased or increased Hct levels, ≥8 Balthazar score&#xD;
      on abdominal CT implies serious AP. According to the revised Atlanta criteria, three types of&#xD;
      severity are present in AP. Mild (no organ failure and no local complications), moderate&#xD;
      (local complications such as pseudocyst, abscess, necrosis, vascular thrombosis) and/or&#xD;
      transient systemic complications (less than 48h) and severe (long-lasting systemic&#xD;
      complications (&gt;48h); organ insufficiencies such as lung, heart, gastrointestinal and renal).&#xD;
      Although Atlanta scoring is considered very popular today, it still seems to be in need of&#xD;
      revision due to some deficiencies in the subjects of infected necrosis, non-pancreatic&#xD;
      infection and non-pancreatic necrosis, and the dynamic nature of organ failure. Even though&#xD;
      the presence of 30 severity scoring systems (the most accepted one is the APACHE 2 score&#xD;
      among them), none of them can definitely predict which patient will have very severe disease&#xD;
      and which patient will have a mild course has not been discovered yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, artificial intelligence (machine learning) applications are used in many subjects in&#xD;
      medicine (such as diagnosis, surgeries, drug development, personalized treatments, gene&#xD;
      editing skills). Studies on machine learning in determining the violence in AP have started&#xD;
      to appear in the literature. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI) application has a role in determining the disease severity in&#xD;
      AP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a retrospective way, 1550 patients who were followed up at the Gastroenterology Clinic of&#xD;
      Bezmialem Foundation University between October 2010 and February 2020 period and who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with AP according to Atlanta criteria were screened. After the removal of 216&#xD;
      patients with missing data, 1334 patients were included in the study for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient demographic information; [age (yo), gender (male/female), cigarette/alcohol&#xD;
           usage (as yes or no)], clinical information; [height (centimeters), weight (kilograms),&#xD;
           BMI (as kg/m2), presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension (yes or no)], etiology of&#xD;
           AP such as gallstones, alcohol, etc., and laboratory tests those taken within the first&#xD;
           24 hours of the admission; [CRP level (mg/dl, normally: 0-5), BUN level (mg/dl,&#xD;
           normally; 9,8 - 20,1), creatinine level (mg/dl, normally; 0,57 - 1,11), number of&#xD;
           leukocytes (normally 4.5 to 11.0 ×109/L) and hematocrit level (%, normally: 35,5-48%)],&#xD;
           as well as Balthazar tomographic scoring [0: normal, 1: an increase in pancreatic size,&#xD;
           2: inflammatory changes in pancreatic tissue and peripancreatic fatty tissue, 3:&#xD;
           irregularly bordered, single fluid collection, 4: irregularly bordered 2 or more fluid&#xD;
           collections, 5 to 10 different degrees of necrosis)], will be recorded in the excel&#xD;
           file.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Revised Atlanta scoring will also be recorded within a week period of hospital admission&#xD;
           as mild, moderate, and severe scores. Infected pancreatic necrosis and sepsis that&#xD;
           developed during the course of acute pancreatitis will be accepted as severe acute&#xD;
           pancreatitis due to the inadequacy of some issues in Atlanta scoring. The severity of&#xD;
           the disease will be evaluated according to the Atlanta scores. And the results of the&#xD;
           artificial intelligence study will be matched according to the results of Atlanta&#xD;
           scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complications are classified as 0; none, 2; local complications: pseudocyst, abscess,&#xD;
           necrosis, thrombosis, and mesenteric panniculitis, 3; systemic complications: lung,&#xD;
           kidney, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications, 4; mixed serious&#xD;
           complications/co-morbidity situations, 5: infectious and septic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Additionally, invasive procedure requirements such as endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS),&#xD;
           endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (as yes or no), length of hospital&#xD;
           stay (less than 10 days or more than 11 days), intensive care unit requirement (present&#xD;
           or not), number of future AP attacks (in duration after a month of hospital admission,&#xD;
           as of one attack or more than one attack), and survival (death, alive) will also be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine Learning Algorithm is used: Gradient Boosted Ensemble Trees Trees. (&quot;Greedy Function&#xD;
      Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine&quot; by Jerome H. Friedman (1999)). The dataset has&#xD;
      been partitioned with a 90%-10% ratio. 10% is for validation and 90% is for AI machine&#xD;
      learning. 90% machine learning part has also been divided into two parts as 70% for AI&#xD;
      Learning and 30% for testing the learning. For this purpose, 5-fold stratified sampling has&#xD;
      been used&#xD;

&#xD;
      In Artificial Intelligence, Decision Tree Models are widely used for supervised machine&#xD;
      learning. They may depend on the Gini index, gain ratio/entropy, chi-square, regression, and&#xD;
      so on. In AI they are preferred because they generate understandable rules for humans unlike&#xD;
      other machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector&#xD;
      Machines. On the other hand, they are considered to be weak learners. That means they are&#xD;
      highly affected by noise and outliers existing in the data set. In order to go around this&#xD;
      handicap, models like Random Forest, Ensemble Trees, Gradient Boosting have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random forest and Ensemble trees generate rules by applying a certain decision tree algorithm&#xD;
      to the portions of the data set vertically and horizontally. This technique dramatically&#xD;
      reduces the error occurring in learning. After learning processes are completed, they combine&#xD;
      weak decision trees into a strong and bigger decision tree model. Ensemble learning models&#xD;
      achieve better learning by minimizing the average value of the loss function on the training&#xD;
      set via a F ̂(x) approximation. The idea is to apply a steepest descent step to the&#xD;
      minimization problem in a greedy fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the gradient boost tree model which was proposed by Friedman has been used for&#xD;
      machine learning. This model chooses a separate optimal value for each of the tree's parts&#xD;
      rather than a single one for the whole tree. This approach can be used to minimize any&#xD;
      differentiable loss L(y, F) in conjunction with forwarding stage-wise additive modeling. It&#xD;
      is reported that the gradient boosting tree model outperforms random forest and regular&#xD;
      ensemble trees in many cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the algorithm is to find an approximation F_m (x_i) which minimizes the expected&#xD;
      L(y,F(x)) loss function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algorithm may be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inputs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A training data set: {(x_i,y_i )} i=1 to n with n dimension and a class variable A&#xD;
      differentiable loss function: L(y,F(x)) The number of iterations: M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Output:&#xD;
&#xD;
      F_m (x_i)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initialize the model with a constant value:&#xD;
&#xD;
      F_0 (x)=arg min⁡∑_(i=1)^n▒〖L(y_i,γ)〗&#xD;
&#xD;
      For m = 1 to M:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compute pseudo-residuals rim r_im=-[(∂L(y_(i,) F(x_i )))/(∂F(x_i))]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Train a base learner to pseudo-residuals, using the training set:&#xD;
&#xD;
      {(x_i,y_i )} i=1 to n Compute multiplier γ γ=arg min⁡∑_(i=1)^n▒〖L(y_i,F_(m-1) (x_i )+γh_m&#xD;
      (x_i ))〗&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update the model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      〖F_m (x_i)=F〗_(m-1) (x_i )+γ_m h_m (x_i ) Output F_m (x_i)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the analysis, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) [5] has been used in order&#xD;
      to avoid the disadvantage of class variable imbalance. SMOTE is a data augmentation technique&#xD;
      to increase data. In some cases, the class variable may not have an equal amount of values&#xD;
      from all cases. For example, there may be much more survived patients than those who lost&#xD;
      their lives. In this kind of situation, data are augmented. There was an imbalance in the&#xD;
      class variables in the data set of this study. So, SMOTE has been applied to increase the&#xD;
      minority classes for training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dataset has been partitioned with a 90%-10% ratio. 10% is for validation and 90% is for&#xD;
      AI machine learning. 90% machine learning part has also been divided into two parts as 70%&#xD;
      for AI Learning and 30% for testing the learning. For this purpose, 5-fold stratified&#xD;
      sampling has been used. KNIME analytic platform has been used for the AI machine learning.&#xD;
