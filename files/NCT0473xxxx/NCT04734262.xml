      This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, two cohorts, Simon's two-stage design,&#xD;
      phase II clinical trial in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients. Subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into two cohorts by different treatment dose of sitravatinib. Cohort A patients will&#xD;
      receive 70mg sitravatinib (QD PO) in combination with 200mg tislelizumab (Q3W IV); Cohort B&#xD;
      patients will receive 100mg sitravatinib (QD PO) in combination with 200mg tislelizumab (Q3W&#xD;
      IV). Subjects in both cohorts will be treated until disease progression, toxicity is&#xD;
      intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and investigators determine that medication must&#xD;
      be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.&#xD;
