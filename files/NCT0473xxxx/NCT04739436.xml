  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the benefit of bilateral hearing aid use compared to a unilateral&#xD;
      hearing aid. Patients with mild to moderate bilateral hearing loss who are considering the&#xD;
      purchase of a commercially available hearing aid will be considered for participation.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms: (1) a&#xD;
      bilateral hearing aid fitting group, and (2) a unilateral hearing aid fitting group.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the hearing-aid benefit of unilateral versus bilateral fittings of&#xD;
           commercially-available hearing aids that incorporate a dome coupling (open or closed&#xD;
           dome as required by degree of hearing loss, or custom coupling if clinically indicated),&#xD;
           which represents the most popular style used for mild to moderate hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare other multi-dimensional outcomes including hearing-related quality of life,&#xD;
           hearing aid satisfaction in patient-nominated goals, ecological hearing aid outcomes,&#xD;
           and hearing aid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare performance outcomes for unilateral versus bilateral hearing aid fittings&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the differences in long-term patient reported outcomes for their final&#xD;
           hearing aid configuration choice&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore patient experiences in each group (unilateral vs bilateral), and patient&#xD;
           preference in regards to their choice of final hearing aid configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted at Duke and Vanderbilt Medical Centers, with Duke functioning&#xD;
      as the main coordinating center. Study participants will pay out of pocket for the hearing&#xD;
      aid(s), but will be able to extend the hearing aid fitting trial period from 60 days&#xD;
      (standard of care) to 180 days (6 months). Participants will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      change their hearing aid configuration and/or return their hearing aid(s) for a refund after&#xD;
      3 months, and again at the end of the 6 month study period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Interested in purchasing hearing aids, but is open minded about trying one or two&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe tinnitus as the reason for seeking amplification&#xD;
