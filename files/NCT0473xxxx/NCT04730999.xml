  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive type of neuroendocrine tumor with the majority&#xD;
      of patients (about 60-70%) being diagnosed with metastatic disease and with a median survival&#xD;
      ranging from 7 to 12 months. Combination chemotherapy (CT), namely a platinum and&#xD;
      etoposide-based regimen, represents the cornerstone of treatment for extended disease (ED)&#xD;
      SCLC. Despite this the duration of response is short and nearly all patients develop disease&#xD;
      relapse or progression. The recent approval of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin&#xD;
      and etoposide as first line in patients with ED SCLC is surely a step forward in the&#xD;
      understanding the molecular landscape and treatment of this complex tumor, but new&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches need to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to assess the efficacy in terms of 1 year survival a new therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      that combines to the standard CT (carboplatin and etoposide), two drugs indicated in the&#xD;
      tratment of several types of tumors: bevacizumab and atezolizomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will start with an induction phase during which eligible patients will receive,&#xD;
      by intravenous way, a combination of the above mentioned drugs according to a specific&#xD;
      administration regimen. This phase will last about 18 weeks. Therafter the treatment will&#xD;
      proceed with a maintenence phase lasting for a maximum of 54 weeks during which the patients&#xD;
      will receive only atezolizumab and bevacizumab, by intravenous way, according to a specific&#xD;
      administration regimen. Treatment will be discontnued in case of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or loss of clinical benefit (for atezolizumab). During&#xD;
      the study period the patients will undergo to periodic visits and laboratory, radiologic&#xD;
      assessments to monitor the efficacy and the safety of the ongoing treatment.&#xD;
