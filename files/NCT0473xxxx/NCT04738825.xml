      The proposed study will be a 24-week intervention with a 12-month follow-up period to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of contingency management with stepped care to pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) adherence and support services (CoMPASS) to promote HIV prevention among individuals&#xD;
      with opioid use disorder who inject drugs. In parallel, the investigators will conduct an&#xD;
      implementation focused process evaluation to inform real-world implementation of CoMPASS. .&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consistent with a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type 1 design, this is a multi-site&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Contingency Management&#xD;
      with stepped care to PrEP Adherence and Support Services (CoMPASS) vs. treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) on HIV risk reduction among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) who inject&#xD;
      drugs. The study will be conducted in community-based settings serving individuals with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder to assess the effectiveness of CoMPASS on promoting: sustained PrEP&#xD;
      adherence (primary outcome) and HIV risk behaviors, engagement in opioid use disorder-related&#xD;
      care, opioid use (secondary outcomes); and sexually transmitted infections and HIV&#xD;
      (exploratory). Participants randomized to CoMPASS will first receive contingency management&#xD;
      and have the potential to earn prizes for making progress towards initiation of and&#xD;
      consistent adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and engagement in OUD-related&#xD;
      care. Individuals who do not demonstrate PrEP adherence (based on self-report, confirmed by&#xD;
      urine testing for tenofovir metabolites at week 12), will be &quot;stepped up&quot; to PrEP Adherence&#xD;
      and Support Services (PASS). The intervention is 24 weeks in duration. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to TAU will receive a health handout on HIV risk reduction approaches, including&#xD;
      PrEP and OUD-related care, and where to access such services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform future implementation efforts, factors relevant for scale-up in parallel (e.g.,&#xD;
      completion of study visits, attitudes regarding the intervention among front-line staff) will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
