      PYTHON is designed to establish the efficacy and safety of 18F-DCFPyL in comparison with that&#xD;
      of 18F-fluorocholine, in patients with first biochemical recurrence (BCR) after initial&#xD;
      definitive therapy (prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy) for&#xD;
      histopathologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma per original diagnosis. PET/CT scans&#xD;
      will be each interpreted by three independent masked experts who are not otherwise involved&#xD;
      in the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is the per-patient detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL in comparison with&#xD;
      18F-Fluorocholine. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the impact on patient&#xD;
      treatment management, the per-region detection rate, the sensitivity and specificity on a&#xD;
      per-patient and per-region basis, the concordance rate between both tracers, and the safety.&#xD;
      The study was initiated in July 2020, and the recruitment of the planned 217 patients has&#xD;
      been completed in October 2020. The follow-up phase is ongoing. Typically, as part of the&#xD;
      routine care practice, these patients receive appropriate treatment and follow-up. The&#xD;
      investigating sites are therefore requested for the period of 7 months after the second&#xD;
      tracer injection, to provide any results of subsequent biopsies, imaging studies, clinical&#xD;
      findings, PSA measurements, and disease management, if performed in routine practice.&#xD;
      Treatment decisions are locally made at the discretion of the referring physician based on&#xD;
      all available clinical information, including the non-masked local reports of both PET/CT and&#xD;
      any other imaging results. After completion of the study, a consensus will be obtained from a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary independent board (truth panel), based on the surrogate standard of&#xD;
      reference which will include all the above-mentioned available results. Assessments will be&#xD;
      made on a per-region and per-patient basis. The truth panel will consist in 3 independent&#xD;
      experts not otherwise involved in the trial. All above information will be sequentially&#xD;
      presented to the truth panel experts. The order of presentation of 18F-FCH PET/CT and&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyl PET/CT results will be randomized. The truth panel will have to assess the impact&#xD;
      of each PET/CT examination on disease restaging and change in treatment intent, by filling in&#xD;
      a patient management questionnaire after review of each PET/CT examination report.&#xD;
