    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of fruquintinib plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus capecitabine as maintenance&#xD;
      therapy following first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients who have&#xD;
      already achieved disease control (including CR/PR and SD), without discontinuation for&#xD;
      toxicity, and are progression free after 4-6 months of standard first-line induction&#xD;
      treatment will be assigned to 2 maintenance treatment groups by randomization in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive fruquintinib + capecitabine (Arm A) or bevacizumab + capecitabine (Arm B). The&#xD;
      study contains a safety lead-in phase in which the safety and tolerability of fruquintinib +&#xD;
      capecitabine will be assessed prior to the phase 2 portion of the study. All patients from&#xD;
      Arm A and Arm B will be treated until progressive disease, death from any cause, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or informed consent withdrawal (whichever occurs earlier).&#xD;
