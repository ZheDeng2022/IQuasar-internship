    <textblock>
      External ventricular drains (EVD) are small tubes used in neuro-critical care inserted to&#xD;
      measure pressure and treat acute build-up of fluid in the brain by draining the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, often following an event of traumatic or spontaneous bleeding.&#xD;
      While essential to the care of these patients, EVDs run the risk of introducing bacteria into&#xD;
      the brain of the patient, causing an EVD associated infection (EVDI). EVDIs are feared&#xD;
      complications that are difficult to identify and predict in an intensive care setting. In&#xD;
      order to allow for early identification of these infections, CSF is routinely sampled from&#xD;
      the EVDs and its constitution analyzed for signs of infection. However, the constitution of&#xD;
      the CSF in neuro-critical care patients are often difficult to assess as it is frequently&#xD;
      mixed with blood that often clouds clinical decision making. No fast parameter has been found&#xD;
      to yet reliably predict or identify these infections, resulting in excessive treatment with&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVDI diagnostics rely on mainly CSF analyses and cultures (growth of bacteria in the&#xD;
      laboratory). Growing bacteria in the lab may take many days and can seldom guide early&#xD;
      decision-making for these infections. Thus, EVDI diagnostics mainly rely on the analysis of&#xD;
      the CSF constitution. Many diagnostic criteria rely on the relationship between white and red&#xD;
      blood cells in the CSF, with red blood cells being introduced in the CSF following the brain&#xD;
      bleed , and white blood cells being seen as a response to infection. These criteria assume&#xD;
      that the blood is homogeneous in the CSF. However, from computed tomography (CT) imaging of&#xD;
      these patients, it is seen that blood can settle in the brain ventricles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to test the assumption that blood is homogeneously distributed in the&#xD;
      CSF by sampling from the CSF in patients. Two samples are serially drawn allocated to a&#xD;
      period between where patients are planned for a clinical repositioning, or not. We&#xD;
      hypothesise that a heterogeneous distribution of blood in the CSF (as seen on CT imaging) may&#xD;
      allow for the CSF constitution to change in serially drawn CSF samples, and that these&#xD;
      changes may be exacerbated in repositioned patients as it may disturb the blood that has&#xD;
      settled at the bottom of the ventricles as a result of gravity sedimentation. We further&#xD;
      believe that these changes may affect clinical decision making and further complicate EVDI&#xD;
      diagnostics.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      External ventricular drains (EVD) are essential tools in neuro-critical care to treat acute&#xD;
      hydrocephalus following traumatic or spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. While essential, EVDs&#xD;
      are associated with feared infections (EVDIs) that may result in long term sequelae and&#xD;
      affect long term outcome. It is therefore important to promptly identify and treat EVDIs.&#xD;
      EVDI diagnostics are based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses and CSF bacterial cultures.&#xD;
      Causal agents are commonly pathogens colonizing the skin, which makes suspected infection and&#xD;
      true infection difficult to distinguish based on the cultured bacteria alone. Additionally,&#xD;
      bacterial cultures may take days to finalize and seldom contribute to early decision making&#xD;
      or guiding of antibiotic treatment. Diagnostics are thus mainly based on CSF analyses of&#xD;
      cells, protein, lactate, and glucose. CSF cellularity, in particular, is frequently&#xD;
      confounded in this patient group as a result of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which&#xD;
      introduces both erythrocytes and leukocytes into the CSF. To account for IVH, the ratio of&#xD;
      erythrocytes and leukocytes (LE ratio) is used and is a central metric in the diagnostics of&#xD;
      EVDIs. The LE ratio is based on the assumption that as bacteria is introduced into the CSF,&#xD;
      leukocytes will increase in relationship to erythrocytes as a part of the immune response.&#xD;
      The LE ratio further assumes that blood is homogeneously distributed in the CSF. However, it&#xD;
      is clear from computed tomography (CT) imaging that blood is congregated to the bottom of the&#xD;
      ventricles as a result of gravity sedimentation, indicating a heterogeneous sample space.&#xD;
      Additionally, leukocytes and erythrocytes exhibit different properties in terms of density&#xD;
      which causes a separation during gravity sedimentation. Leukocytes, and granulocytes in&#xD;
      particular, may also exhibit upwards floatation due to density changes as they become&#xD;
      activated as part of the inflammatory response. Thus, not only is an intraventricular&#xD;
      separation of blood and CSF probable, but also a separation of individual cell types. As CSF&#xD;
      is sampled from the EVD, a heterogeneous sample space may affect the constitution of sampled&#xD;
      CSF depending on the location of the EVD in the ventricles and the location and distribution&#xD;
      of intraventricular blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that blood is heterogeneously distributed in the CSF, and as a result, may&#xD;
      introduce CSF parameter variability as the intraventricular distribution of blood and CSF may&#xD;
      vary between samples. Furthermore, we believe that routine patient care, such as&#xD;
      repositioning of the patient may be enough to cause such a variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired CSF samples are collected from patients included in the study, instead of the routine&#xD;
      single sample, bi-weekly or during workup for suspected infection. The resulting extra&#xD;
      collected CSF from paired samples will amount to approximately 1-2 mL per session. Patients&#xD;
      will be allocated to the collection of paired CSF samples around a routine patient&#xD;
      repositioning, or a 10 minute wait time between paired CSF samples as identified as the&#xD;
      average time between samples when a repositioning was performed during the burn a period.&#xD;
      Patients in a lateral side position 2-3 hours prior to CSF sampling will be sampled on either&#xD;
      side of a clinical repositioning. Open drains will be closed five minutes prior to the first&#xD;
      sample as per clinical routine. 1,5 mL of CSF is drawn and discarded prior to each individual&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information should be documented for each sample session:&#xD;
&#xD;

      Patient inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over18 years of age in treated in the NICU with inserted EVDs. Patient inclusion was based on&#xD;
      written informed consent from nearest of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-way tests such as the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Fligner-Killen test of variance&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate pair-wise differences and differences between sample groups. Mixed&#xD;
      effects regression analyses will be used to evaluate independent predictors of CSF parameter&#xD;
      change and to evaluate the correlation between change and demographic variables, such as CT&#xD;
      derived variables. Patient ID will be included as a random effect to eliminate&#xD;
      inter-individual differences.&#xD;
