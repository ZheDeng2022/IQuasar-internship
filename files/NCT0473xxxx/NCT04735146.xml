  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the WELL-DONE! Study is to co-design, using different professional figures&#xD;
      (midwives, psychologists, master's degree in motor science) but also taking into&#xD;
      consideration the pregnant women's point of view, an intervention of adapted physical&#xD;
      activity for pregnant women, included in the birth accompaniment courses and conducted by&#xD;
      midwives, and to evaluate its effectiveness in terms of quality of life, well-being, levels&#xD;
      of physical activity and satisfaction with respect to the proposed intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is the evaluation of an integrated, co-designed intervention of adapted&#xD;
      physical activity, included in the birth accompaniment courses, in order to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objective is the evaluation of the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
           intervention in terms of general satisfaction with the proposed intervention, levels of&#xD;
           physical activity practiced, physical performance, self-efficacy, sleep quality, anxiety&#xD;
           and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tertiary objective is to translate, adapt and validate in Italian a specific&#xD;
           questionnaire to measure physical activity levels in pregnant women, Pregnancy Physical&#xD;
           Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), through the use of Actigraph accelerometers (ActiLife6&#xD;
           wGT3X-BT ).&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will undergo the adapted physical activity program that will be co-designed during phase I of the study.&#xD;
The 6-week program is aimed at improving the quality of life; increase the physical activity levels according to recommended guidelines; improving body awareness through an educational component; maintain and ameliorate the previous functions (for women previously active) and build the exercise background for sedentary women; increase physical fitness and functional capacity.</description>
