      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) released from developing embryos into spent culture media&#xD;
      (SCM) can serve as a non-invasive method for performing preimplantation genetic testing for&#xD;
      aneuploidy (PGT-A). A non-selection study that compares clinical outcomes to the NI-PGT-A&#xD;
      results of the transferred embryos in a blinded fashion will characterize the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy by determination of positive and negative predictive values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process, the selection of a healthy embryo is limited&#xD;
      by the inability of the microscopic appearance to reveal the chromosomal complement. Thus, in&#xD;
      order to reliably select chromosomally normal embryos, preimplantation genetic testing for&#xD;
      aneuploidy (PGT-A) is performed. PGT-A requires biopsy of the embryo, amplification of the&#xD;
      DNA, then next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine chromosome copy number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the clinical utility of PGT-A has been demonstrated, the process has limitations, the&#xD;
      most significant of which is the requirement for embryo biopsy. Typically, 5-10 cells are&#xD;
      removed from the TE after the zona pellucida has been breached. While the procedure can be&#xD;
      safely and effectively performed by trained embryologists, the obvious concern for damage to&#xD;
      the embryo is relevant. Even if implantation successfully occurs, concern has been raised&#xD;
      that biopsy of the embryo at this stage can lead to complications such as miscarriage, or&#xD;
      issues with placental function later in pregnancy. Furthermore, because the TE is destined to&#xD;
      differentiate to placenta rather than the fetus itself, there is controversy regarding if the&#xD;
      chromosomal analysis of these cells is always representative of the chromosomal complement of&#xD;
      the fetus. For these reasons, and because TE biopsy is laborious and expensive, PGT-A has&#xD;
      still not supplanted morphological evaluation as the clinical standard for embryo selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An accurate noninvasive method for aneuploidy screening of embryos before implantation would&#xD;
      be ideal. To this end, development of noninvasive PGT-A (NI-PGT-A) methods is an area of&#xD;
      active investigation. The approach leverages the ability to isolate cell-free DNA (cfDNA)&#xD;
      that is secreted from the blastocyst into the spent culture media (SCM). SCM is routinely&#xD;
      discarded after the embryo has been removed from culture, however, minute amounts of DNA from&#xD;
      the embryo can be isolated, amplified, then sequenced for chromosomal copy number analysis.&#xD;
      The obvious advantage is that this process can occur without posing any harm to the embryo.&#xD;
      An additional putative benefit of this noninvasive approach is that the DNA is secreted from&#xD;
      both the TE and the inner cell mass (ICM), theoretically serving as a more accurate&#xD;
      representation of the fetal karyotype than the DNA isolated from just the TE biopsy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical limitations of deploying NI-PGT-A are related to the limited quantity of DNA&#xD;
      available in the SCM. Unlike other modes of genetic testing where ample amounts of genetic&#xD;
      material is readily extracted from blood, amniotic fluid, or tissue biopsy, cell-free DNA&#xD;
      secretion from blastocysts is exceptionally minute in quantity. However, laboratory protocols&#xD;
      are developing rapidly, evidenced by numerous publications which have already demonstrated a&#xD;
      high level of consistency when chromosomal copy number is analyzed by NI-PGT-A and&#xD;
      traditional PGT-A in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these studies have illustrated proof of concept and preclinical validation, the true&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy can only be assessed by evaluating the predictive value of negative&#xD;
      (euploid) and positive (aneuploid) results. Specifically, embryos found to be euploid should&#xD;
      have a greater ability for sustained implantation that proceeds to live birth, while&#xD;
      aneuploid embryos should have a dramatically lower rate of sustained implantation, or will be&#xD;
      predictive of clinical aneuploidy. Without rigorous clinical validation, using these results&#xD;
      for embryo selection could lead to misdiagnosis, causing selection of unhealthy embryos, or&#xD;
      selection against embryos that could have been potentially viable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if NI-PGT-A is clinically robust, we propose a non-selection, pilot, study,&#xD;
      whereby embryo selection is performed by routine clinical methods (ie, morphological&#xD;
      selection). However, after the clinical outcome has manifested, the SCM will be analyzed by a&#xD;
      commercially available NI-PGT-A protocols in a blinded fashion. By correlating clinical&#xD;
      outcomes to NI-PGT-A results, positive and negative predictive values can be calculated&#xD;
      without bias. Because no intervention will be performed that deviates from the clinical&#xD;
      routine, no additional risk will be posed to the embryo or parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a pilot for a possible future trials. If reasonable predictive value&#xD;
      of NI-PGT-A is demonstrated, a prospective, selection study could be justified to investigate&#xD;
      the utility of NI-PGT-A in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo IVF-ICSI per clinical indication, with plans to freeze all embryos for&#xD;
      deferred embryo transfer. Embryo culture will follow routine protocols and embryo selection&#xD;
      for transfer will be performed using standard morphological criteria. SCM from all&#xD;
      blastocysts that appear viable will be collected and shipped to a reference lab (Sequence&#xD;
      46). Specimens will be completely de-identified of patient information and labelled with an&#xD;
      accession number. NI-PGT-A analysis will be performed using a commercial kit according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations, with technicians blinded to clinical outcomes. When patients&#xD;
      return for the embryo transfer cycle, routine clinical protocol will be followed for&#xD;
      endometrial preparation. A single embryo will be selected according to routine morphological&#xD;
      grading criteria, and embryo transfer will be performed with standard techniques. Initial&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome will be documented with serum hCG testing. If hCG testing is positive,&#xD;
      early pregnancy will be confirmed with ultrasound assessment per clinical routine. After all&#xD;
      patients have completed treatment and clinical outcomes manifested (failed implantation,&#xD;
      miscarriage, or ongoing pregnancy (defined as viability beyond 13 weeks), NI-PGT-A results&#xD;
      will be released to the clinical team and correlated to clinical outcomes for calculation of&#xD;
      predictive values. All on-going pregnancies will be offered routine prenatal screening for&#xD;
      fetal aneuploidies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional details regarding laboratory protocols are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blastocyst culture Embryo culture will follow routine protocols. On day 3 post-fertilization,&#xD;
      embryos will be repeatedly pipetted through a series of culture media droplets in order to&#xD;
      lower potential for maternal cell contamination. Embryos will then be individually cultured&#xD;
      in 35µL droplets of embryo culture medium to the blastocyst stage. On day 5 or day 6,&#xD;
      blastocyst development and quality will be evaluated using standard morphological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and blastocyst vitrification Blastocyst culture medium (20µL) from selected&#xD;
      embryos will be collected and transferred to PCR tubes and stored at -20°C until whole genome&#xD;
      amplification (WGA). Blastocysts will be frozen via routine vitrification protocol and stored&#xD;
      in liquid nitrogen per routine clinical protocol. Specimens will be completely de-identified&#xD;
      of patient information and labelled with an accession number prior to shipping to reference&#xD;
      lab (Sequence46).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole genome amplification and DNA sequencing NI-PGT-A analysis will be performed upon&#xD;
      receipt, using a commercial kit according to manufacturer's recommendations, with technicians&#xD;
      blinded to clinical outcomes. DNA will be amplified by whole genome amplification (WGA) and&#xD;
      barcoded to prepare libraries. The libraries are then loaded onto an Ion Chef instrument for&#xD;
      template preparation by automated clonal amplification and then loaded onto a chip for DNA&#xD;
      sequencing on an Ion Genestudio S5 Prime system, with approximately 150,000-200,000&#xD;
      sequencing reads per sample. Data is analyzed using the Ion Reporter software (v5.10 or&#xD;
      later). Ploidy will be measured using baseline, Ion ReproSeq Low-Coverage Whole-Genome (99M)&#xD;
      Baseline. Standard quality control measures will be evaluated. Results will be released to&#xD;
      the clinical team 6 weeks post-embryo transfer and correlated to clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      calculation of predictive values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient undergoing IVF-ICSI 21 - 35 years old at the time of enrollment Elective freeze-all&#xD;
      cycle Planning for single embryo transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undergoing PGT-A, PGT-SR, PGT-M History of recurrent pregnancy loss History of recurrent&#xD;
      implantation failure Planning on transfer of more than 1 embryo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justification for the age category is to control for age-related factors other than&#xD;
      aneuploidy that may influence implantation, so variables that could compound predictive value&#xD;
      calculations are minimized. Limiting participation to patients under 35 also optimizes embryo&#xD;
      selection such that morphologically normal embryos are most likely healthy. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients in this age category have the lowest risk for clinical aneuploidies such as Down&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research samples will be identified by a unique accession number, but no patient identifying&#xD;
      information. The samples will be processed by Sequence46 with results associated with the&#xD;
      accession number. The data will be uploaded via a secure cloud service, which will be&#xD;
      accessed by the primary investigator to merge with the electronic case report form (eCRF)&#xD;
      that will be stored locally at the Olive Fertility Centre on an encrypted hard drive that&#xD;
      will be backed-up on a secondary local drive. The eCRF will contain the patients' unique&#xD;
      medical record number and age, but will not document name, birthdate, or any other&#xD;
      identifying information. Results of the NI-PGT-A analysis and clinical outcome will also be&#xD;
      stored in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be retained for 5 years after the date of publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy will be interpreted in the context of positive and negative predictive&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive result is a finding consistent with aneuploidy or mosaicism. A negative result is&#xD;
      a finding consistent with euploidy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPV = (Failed implantation + miscarriage + clinical aneuploidy)/ All Positive Results NPV =&#xD;
      Ongoing pregnancy / All Negative Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred-twenty (120) patients should suffice for this pilot study. Previous research has&#xD;
      established that in patients aged 35 or younger, the ratio of euploid:aneuploid embryos is&#xD;
      approximately 60:40. Of euploid embryos, approximately 70% will implant, of which, 85% should&#xD;
      continue to viability. Of aneuploid embryos, approximately 25% will implant, of which &gt;99%&#xD;
      will miscarry; the risk of a clinical aneuploidy is less than 0.5% in women 35 and under.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these probabilities, of the 120 patients to be enrolled, 72 euploid embryos are&#xD;
      expected of which 50 should implant and 43 will continue as ongoing, viable pregnancies. Of&#xD;
      the 48 that are expected to be aneuploid, 12 will implant, of which all should miscarry (the&#xD;
      chance for a clinical aneuploidy in this population is less than 0.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
