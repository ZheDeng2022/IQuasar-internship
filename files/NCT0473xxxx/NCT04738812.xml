  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DATURA trial is a phase III, multicenter, two-arm, open-label, randomized superiority trial&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy and the safety of an intensified tuberculosis (TB) regimen versus&#xD;
      standard TB treatment in HIV-infected adults and adolescents hospitalized for TB with CD4 ≤&#xD;
      100 cells/μL over 48 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensified TB treatment regimen: increased doses of rifampicin and isoniazid together&#xD;
           with standard-dose of pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 8 weeks in addition to prednisone&#xD;
           for 6 weeks and albendazole for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO standard TB treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuation phase of TB treatment will be identical in the two arms: 4 months of&#xD;
      rifampicin and isoniazid at standard doses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Settings: 4 African (Cameroon, Guinea, Uganda, Zambia) and 2 South-East Asian (Cambodia,&#xD;
      Vietnam) countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size : 1330 patients (665 in each arm). Follow-up : 48 weeks after entry in the trial&#xD;
      (TB treatment initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) 2 weeks after starting TB&#xD;
      treatment. In each country, the chosen ART regimen will be the same in both arms. According&#xD;
      to the first-line regimen recommended in each country, the ART combination will be&#xD;
      TDF/3TC/EFV 600 mg, or TDF/3TC + double-dose DTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to estimate the impact of an intensified initial phase of TB&#xD;
      treatment on mortality at 48 weeks among HIV-infected adults and adolescents hospitalized for&#xD;
      TB with CD4 ≤ 100 cells/μL in comparison with standard TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to estimate the impact of an intensified initial phase of TB&#xD;
      treatment, in comparison with the standard TB regimen, on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality at weeks 8 and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All grade 3 and 4 events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Selected grade 2 events of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drug-related adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AIDS-defining illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Paradoxical TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TB treatment success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TB recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ART response in terms of virological success and immunological response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to TB treatment and ART&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak plasma concentrations of rifampicin and isoniazid (and its N-acetyl-metabolite) at&#xD;
           day 3, day 7 and week 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma concentrations of efavirenz and dolutegravir at week 4 (i.e. 2 weeks after the&#xD;
           onset of ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic sub-study of rifampicin and isoniazid will be carried out in 72 voluntary&#xD;
      patients (6 patients/arm/country) at the second week of the main study.&#xD;
