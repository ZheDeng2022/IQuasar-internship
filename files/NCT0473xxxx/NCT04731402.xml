      important period that brings many physical and psychological changes with it and&#xD;
      significantly affects the disease process and the family and society. Cultural and ethnic&#xD;
      characteristics of the society are among the important factors that affect women's attitudes&#xD;
      towards menopause and the meaning of middle age for women.women seek ways to deal with&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      women prefer drug-free coping methods. Mindfulness stress reduction program, yoga and&#xD;
      laughter yoga are an alternative way to reduce menopausal symptoms.. These methods can reduce&#xD;
      the complaints and increase the quality of life. For this reason, the effect should be&#xD;
