    <textblock>
      Patient ventilator asynchrony is a common problem in mechanically ventilated patients .It is&#xD;
      associated with adverse effects including increased work of breathing, patient discomfort,&#xD;
      increased need for sedation, prolonged mechanical ventilation , weaning difficulties and&#xD;
      weaning failure. 100 mechanically ventilated COPD patients were enrolled in this prospective&#xD;
      study .Detection of patient ventilator asynchrony was done on 30-minute sessions at 12, 24,&#xD;
      36, and 48 hours following intubation by visual assessment of pressure, flow and volume&#xD;
      graphs on ventilator .&#xD;

      Patient-ventilator asynchrony is defined as a lack of organization between the patient and&#xD;
      ventilator timing of both inspiration and expiration . It is a commonly reported problem&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation. Thille et al. found that 24% of patients developed asynchrony&#xD;
      in at least ten percent of their breaths, moreover they stated that the most frequent&#xD;
      asynchronies was each of ineffective triggering and double triggering . Eighty percent of&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients experienced ineffective triggering,&#xD;
      where it is considered the most frequent asynchrony in this group of patients. Asynchrony&#xD;
      between Patient and ventilator also leads to prolonged duration of invasive ventilation, and&#xD;
      increase possibility of weaning failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both spread and intensity of asynchrony during the early phase of weaning in COPD patients&#xD;
      has never satisfactorily described. The aim of the current study was to describe the&#xD;
      patient-ventilator asynchrony and its impact on weaning outcome in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      COPD patients.&#xD;
