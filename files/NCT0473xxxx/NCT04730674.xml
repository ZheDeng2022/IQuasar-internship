      female patients with established diagnosis of post-mastectomy seroma following modified&#xD;
      radical mastectomy, were treated by local injection of tetracycline after the seroma fluid&#xD;
      was aspirated, then a crepe bandage was applied over the mastectomy area. Then after 5 days&#xD;
      the patient were examined again for seroma re-collection or the presence of complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, 18 patients with established diagnosis of post-mastectomy seroma were&#xD;
      included. All of them were females undergoing modified radical mastectomy where seroma&#xD;
      appeared after drain removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age, co-morbidities, total leukocytic count (as an indicator of infection), serum albumin&#xD;
      and tumour size and pathology for all of them were recorded. Then we interfered with our&#xD;
      tetracycline injection technique for the treatment of seroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were consented regarding this therapeutic technique explaining the expected&#xD;
      possible occurrence of some pain during and after injection, other complications like wound&#xD;
      infection or flap necrosis necessitating further intervention. Moreover, repetition of the&#xD;
      technique may be needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our technique the following was adopted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, the seroma fluid was aspirated completely using a 20 cc syringe while the patient&#xD;
           lying flat and the needle inserted in the most dependent area&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Then, 10 cc of saline containing 2 gm of tetracycline mixed with 5 ml of 2% xylocaine&#xD;
           (as a pain relieving agent) was injected at the seroma bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After completion of injection, a crepe bandage was applied over the mastectomy area&#xD;
           (flaps covering the seroma bed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Then after 5 days the patient were examined again for seroma re-collection or the&#xD;
           presence of complications as infection or flap necrosis. If there were any&#xD;
           re-collection, the tetracycline injection procedure would be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of seroma aspirated in each session in addition to the complications if present&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
