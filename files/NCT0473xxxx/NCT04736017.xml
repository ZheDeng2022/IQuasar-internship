  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the efficacy of auditory slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement in PD&#xD;
      patients with subjective excessive daytime sleepiness and patients with amnestic MCI.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to two groups: Group 1 will first be treated with auditory&#xD;
      stimulation for two weeks and then - after a washout period - switched to two weeks of sham&#xD;
      stimulation. Group 2 will first receive sham stimulation for two weeks and then - after a&#xD;
      washout period - switch to two weeks of auditory stimulation treatment. The washout period in&#xD;
      between will be 2-4 weeks.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of auditory slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement in PD patients with subjective&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness and patients with amnestic MCI. The screening phase includes&#xD;
      entry questionnaires about inclusion/exclusion criteria, sleep quality, chronotype, and&#xD;
      handedness, and 1-4 screening nights at home with the TSB Axo, to allow for stimulation&#xD;
      optimization. One of the screening nights will be extended to screen for sleep apnea and&#xD;
      periodic limb movements during sleep using an ambulatory screening device. Upon final&#xD;
      inclusion, 24 PD and 24 MCI patients will be enrolled in the study for an overall period of&#xD;
      6-8 weeks (not including screening phase). Patients will receive 2 weeks of auditory SWS&#xD;
      enhancement and 2 weeks of sham stimulation (only device application, no tones played) in a&#xD;
      counter-balanced cross-over design, with a 2-4 week washout period during cross-over. Study&#xD;
      visits will be performed immediately before and after each intervention period, i.e. before&#xD;
      and after 2 weeks of auditory stimulation or sham stimulation, respectively. Study visits&#xD;
      will include standardized clinical examinations, symptom questionnaires, biofluid sampling&#xD;
      (optional lumbar puncture [LP] after intervention, blood sampling before and after&#xD;
      intervention) and screening for adverse events by a study physician. Study visits will take&#xD;
      place at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
