  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop and prototype-test a highly accessible program&#xD;
      designed to enhance the mastery of Black American caregivers to provide care to family&#xD;
      members or friends living with a dementia illness in a time of crisis. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked a series of questions in a baseline interview, and then will be asked to partake in the&#xD;
      CaRE course during a 6 to 8-week period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Black Americans have over double the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias&#xD;
      (ADRD) compared to Whites, thus increasing the number of family members providing care for a&#xD;
      person living with dementia (PLWD) within this racial/ethnic group. Black American caregivers&#xD;
      typically deal with the complexities of caregiving through the lens of race and associated&#xD;
      health disparities. Due to the centuries-old disadvantaged social history of Black Americans,&#xD;
      a number of unique stressors, vulnerabilities, but also resources, have emerged which could&#xD;
      inform and affect Black American dementia caregivers' experiences and well-being. There is&#xD;
      overwhelming evidence that Black American caregivers and their care recipients experience&#xD;
      disparities in care, have lower rates of formal service use, and are generally under-treated.&#xD;
      Now in this seemingly worst of times with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,&#xD;
      the disparities are more apparent: Black Americans (13.4% of the population according to the&#xD;
      2019 U.S. Census Bureau), account for approximately 25% of COVID-19 related deaths and are&#xD;
      dying at a rate more than 1.5 times higher than their counterparts. The proposed CaRE Course&#xD;
      is meant to address the cultural reality of caregiving while Black - not just during the&#xD;
      pandemic, but beyond. The program seeks to develop caregiving mastery while and by&#xD;
      understanding, acknowledging, and addressing the influence of race, culture, and disparities&#xD;
      on caregivers' mental health, and their medical, spiritual, and safety needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will first establish a preliminary competency-based course curriculum&#xD;
      storyboard of 40-50 modules and draft scripts for the instructional videos that will anchor&#xD;
      the CaRE course, through iterative Design Studio sessions with Black faith and community&#xD;
      leaders, Black American caregivers, course faculty, COVID-19 specialists, dementia experts,&#xD;
      and other clinical experts and working with Emory Nursing Experience instructional designers.&#xD;
      Then, partnering with a variety of faith-based and community organizations and others, the&#xD;
      researchers will identify a sample of Black American caregivers who will be invited to enroll&#xD;
      in the CaRE Course and participate in formative and summative research related to its&#xD;
      usability, salience, and preliminary efficacy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Cultural Justification for Caregiving Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Cultural Justification for Caregiving Scale is a 10-item self-report assessing the cultural reasons for the caregivers providing care. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 4 = strongly agree. Total scores range from 10 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater cultural influences for providing care.</description>

    <measure>Change in Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES)-Depression Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The CES - Depression scale is a 20-item self-report instrument assessing how often symptoms of depression have been experienced in the last week. For this study, responses are given on a 4-point scale where 1 = rarely or none of the time and 4 = most or all of the time. Total scores range from 20 to 80 where higher scores indicate greater caregiver depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Y Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI Y Form is a 20-item self-report scale of positive and negative anxiety experiences. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much so. Total scores range from 20 to 80 where higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a14-item scale assessing the caregivers' feelings and thoughts during the past month. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 0 = never and 4 = very often. Total scores range from 0 to 40 where higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The RMBPC is a 24-item scale assessing the frequency of problems that persons with dementia often have as well as how much these behaviors bothered the caregiver. Caregiver reactions are assessed on a 5-point scale where 0 = not at all upset and 4 = extremely upset. Total scores range from 0 to 96 where higher scores indicate greater caregiver distress in reaction to problem behaviors.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Zarit Burden Interview Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview is a 22-item instrument assessing objective and subjective caregiver burden. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 0 = never and 4 = nearly always. Total scores range from 0 to 88 where higher scores indicate greater feelings of being burdened by being a caregiver.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Mastery Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10, Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Mastery instrument includes 14-items assessing feelings experienced as a result of being a caregiver to a person with dementia. The instrument includes categories of relational deprivation, caregiving competence, and management of situations. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = completely. Total scores range from 14 to 56, where higher scores indicate feeling a greater sense of mastery of caregiving.</description>
