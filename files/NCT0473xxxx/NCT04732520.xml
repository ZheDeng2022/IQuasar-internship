    <textblock>
      A prospective, two-arm, non-randomized, concurrently controlled, multi-center, open-label,&#xD;
      treat and resect study following patients to 1 year. The study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of the Aliya System for the ablation of solid tumors using pulsed&#xD;
      electric field (PEF) energy delivery. The study is intended for adult patients with suspected&#xD;
      or confirmed NSCLC 8th ed. Stage IA2, IA3 or IB (&gt;1 to ≤4 cm solitary lesion) who are&#xD;
      surgical candidates and have not received treatment for the index tumor in the last two&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and initial feasibility of Pulsed Electric Field (PEF)&#xD;
      treatment of NSCLC tumors prior to surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment may be delivered via either an endoluminal (bronchoscopic) or percutaneous approach&#xD;
      at the discretion of the clinical investigator utilizing two available device configurations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoluminal: Galvanize Aliya System with commercially available TBNA Needle (e.g.,&#xD;
           PeriView FLEX) and RF probe electrode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percutaneous: Galvanize Aliya System with compatible commercially available RF needle&#xD;
           and RF probe electrode&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll and treat up to 30 adult patients with early stage NSCLC at up to 5&#xD;
      clinical sites. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria who elect not to undergo the PEF&#xD;
      treatment will be offered the opportunity to participate in a concurrent control arm. Up to&#xD;
      10 patients will be included in the control group. A total of up to 40 patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
