  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic diseases are currently one of the most important problem in medicine. Research&#xD;
      confirms that probiotics administered during the formation of the intestinal ecosystem and&#xD;
      the maturation of the immune system can positively influence the development of antiallergic&#xD;
      mechanisms. The aim of the present randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the mixture of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0900,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0908, and Lactobacillus casei ŁOCK 0919 in children up to the&#xD;
      age 2 with atopic dermatitis and food allergy to cow's milk proteins. Children received the&#xD;
      mixture of Lactobacillus strains for 3 months every day in the daily dose of a billion&#xD;
      bacteria or a placebo (maltodextrin). Primary outcomes included the effects of probiotic&#xD;
      treatment on the severity of symptoms assessed with SCORing atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) index.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints included assessment of total IgE and selected cytokine levels. Cytokines&#xD;
      were evaluated in supernatants obtained from peripheral blood cultures of randomly selected&#xD;
      20 patients from each group. The primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at 3 time&#xD;
      points: at baseline, after the finishing the administration of probiotic/placebo, and after 9&#xD;
      months of follow up.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms assessed with the use the SCORAD index</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 3 months of intervention and 9 months of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD index consists of the interpretation of the extent of the disorder (A: according to the rule of nines; 20% of the score), the intensity composed of six items (B: erythema, oedema ⁄papules, effect of scratching, oozing ⁄crust formation, lichenification and dryness; 60% of the score; each item has four grades: 0,1, 2, 3) and subjective symptoms (C: itch, sleeplessness; 20% of the score). Both subjective items are graded on a 10-cm visual analogue scale.&#xD;
The SCORAD index formula is: A ⁄5 + 7B⁄2 + C. In this formula A is defined as the extent (0-100), B is defined as the intensity (0-18) and C is defined as the subjective symptoms (0-20). The maximum SCORAD score is 103.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in proportion of children with improvement or worsening of atopic dermatitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 3 months of intervention and 9 months of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Atopic dermatitis symptoms were assessed with the use of the SCORAD index. It was assumed that a drop &gt;30% in the SCORAD index compared with baseline was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement. A drop&lt;30% was associated with worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the level of total IgE</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 3 months of intervention and 9 months of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Total IgE level was measured using the ImmunoCap system according manufacturer's instruction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the level of selected cytokines</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 3 months of intervention and 9 months of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The level of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines (e.g. interferon-gamma, interleukin-12), regulatory cytokines (e.g. intreleukin-10) or proallergic Th2 cytokines (e.g. interleukin-5) were measured in the supernatants obtained from the peripheral blood cultures with the use of ELISA techniques.</description>
