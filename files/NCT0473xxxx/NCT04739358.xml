  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how effective the study drug (tepotinib) is at stopping the growth&#xD;
      and spread of lung cancer with central nervous system metastasis. In some patients, who have&#xD;
      developed resistance to their tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), this study will look at how&#xD;
      effective tepotinib is in combination with TKIs. This study will also measure a number of&#xD;
      other things including safety of the study drug and the side effects, how body processes the&#xD;
      study drug, or how the study drug affects your quality of life.&#xD;

                  and for 120 days after discontinuation (or longer if required by local&#xD;
                  requirements) of study therapy. The 2 methods of contraception can either be 2&#xD;
