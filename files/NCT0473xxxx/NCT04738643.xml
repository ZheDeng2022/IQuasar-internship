  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research objective is to identify a simple, pragmatic, innovative way of enhancing&#xD;
      Tobacco Use Treatment (TUT) rates within oncology. To investigate this possibility, the&#xD;
      investigators propose methods that will allow them to: 1) evaluate the impact of standing&#xD;
      orders to initiate a varenicline management protocol within outpatient cancer treatment&#xD;
      workflow, 2) assess the potential for an EHR-based intervention to affect patient TUT&#xD;
      behaviors, and 3) identify important facilitators and barriers that impact effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess whether including a standing order for prescription and&#xD;
      management of varenicline (TUT Service+VM) within the workflow for cancer patients identified&#xD;
      as current smokers will significantly increase TUT engagement rates compared to current&#xD;
      standard of care (TUT Service alone). The investigators hypothesize that observed treatment&#xD;
      engagement rates will be higher among clinicians exposed to TUT Service+VM than observed in&#xD;
      clinicians exposed to TUT Service alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To reduce all-cause and cancer-specific mortality, the 2014 Surgeon General's Report&#xD;
      emphasized the importance of effective tobacco use treatment (TUT) in cancer care.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, up to 50% of cancer patients who smoke prior to their diagnosis continue to do&#xD;
      so after diagnosis and treatment. This observation has lead the National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American Association for Cancer&#xD;
      Research to call for implementation strategies integrating TUT directly within oncology care.&#xD;
      At this time, many cancer centers and oncology practices fall short of providing consistent,&#xD;
      high-quality TUT; only half of cancer centers report that they identify tobacco use among&#xD;
      patients, and very few use systematic mechanisms to encourage TUT services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded the Cancer Center Cessation&#xD;
      Initiative (C3I) in 2017 with support from the NCI Cancer Moonshot Program. C3I's aim is to&#xD;
      help build and sustain TUT infrastructure across the nation's cancer centers, ensuring that&#xD;
      cancer patients are systematically screened for tobacco use and provided with evidence-based&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment. Abramson Cancer Center's work implementing the C3I tobacco use&#xD;
      treatment service (TUT Service) has significantly improved rates of TUT within oncology&#xD;
      practice, however the investigators have identified a number of important social-motivational&#xD;
      obstacles to reaching the target of universal TUT. For instance, it is known that simple&#xD;
      changes to treatment choice architecture in the electronic health record (EHR), i.e.&#xD;
      utilizing an &quot;opt-out&quot; rather than &quot;opt-in&quot; structure, increases TUT Service engagement in a&#xD;
      manner similar to other contexts of cancer care. Unfortunately, there remains unacceptable&#xD;
      variation in clinician engagement rates. One significant reason for this variation is the&#xD;
      individual clinician's perceptions of treatment effectiveness.( A strategy used elsewhere&#xD;
      involved utilizing opt-out orders aimed at maximizing the use of varenicline, i.e.&#xD;
      &quot;Varenicline Management&quot; (VM). VM resulted in increased clinician utilization and patient&#xD;
      cessation within a relatively controlled environment of hospital-based cardiac and pulmonary&#xD;
      care. However, it is unknown whether this type of intervention is generalizable to the&#xD;
      complex, challenging environment of outpatient oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine if the default for a varenicline order increases&#xD;
      clinician referral to TUTS and/or the treatment of tobacco use. At this point, many&#xD;
      clinicians are turning the referral order off and patients are not receiving treatment for&#xD;
      tobacco use. A default to prescribe treatment may help override barriers to both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insights gained from this project form the basis of subsequent clinical trials assessing&#xD;
      efficacy of novel implementation approaches improving uptake of evidence-based tobacco use&#xD;
      treatment. This study is significant because the model for promoting physician behavior&#xD;
      change is simple and pragmatic, yet has the potential to significantly impact cancer patient&#xD;
      survival and morbidity. The study builds on previous observations made through NCI and&#xD;
      C.U.R.E. investments, expanding the understanding of novel pharmacologic approaches to&#xD;
      tobacco cessation.&#xD;

    <description>The VM intervention builds upon the established TUT Service process. In addition to connecting the patient to TUT Service via electronic referral, it activates a medication management protocol that: 1) actively confirms no evidence of renal failure or pregnancy with oncology provider, 2) automates a referral to prescribing providers within the TUT Service team, prompting a call-back to patient within 24 hours, 3) provides written AVS instructions to contact TUT Service for initiation instructions and clinic appointment, and 4) pends a varenicline prescription to the medication list, ready for reconciliation by TUT Service prescribing clinicians. The protocol formalizes standard management principles for varenicline, including follow-up evaluation, pre-quit period duration, and side effect amelioration.</description>
