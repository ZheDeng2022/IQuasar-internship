  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a before-after, observational, prospective, multicenter cohort study. The study will&#xD;
      consist of 2 phases: an initial observational phase of a minimum of 3 months before the&#xD;
      Therapeutic Education Program (TEP) intervention, then a phase of evolution analysis of at&#xD;
      least 3 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first observational phase, the quality of life assessment will be carried out 3&#xD;
      months apart without intervention. The data obtained during this first phase will make it&#xD;
      possible to characterize the functional impact in patients, to verify the reproducibility of&#xD;
      our evaluations, and to evaluate the spontaneous evolution of the parameters over a period of&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second phase of evolution analysis, the quality of life will be assessed at 3&#xD;
      month intervals (M9, M12) after the therapeutic Education Program (M6). The comparison&#xD;
      between the evolution during the two phases, before and after the TEP will allow us to assess&#xD;
      the benefits of the TEP.&#xD;
