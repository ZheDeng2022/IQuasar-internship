      CYRON is a Prospective, Open-Label, Pilot, Multicentric Clinical Investigation to Evaluate&#xD;
      the Performance and Safety of Cerviron Ovules® in the Local Treatment of Non-Specific or&#xD;
      Endogenous, Symptomatic Vaginitis. The primary objective is to assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      performance and tolerability of Cerviron® Ovules in patients with symptomatic, non-specific,&#xD;
      non-infectious vaginitis, and endogenous symptomatic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this clinical investigation is the assessment of performance of&#xD;
      the medical device by several additionally clinical outcomes (vaginal discharge, vaginal pH,&#xD;
      microscopic characteristics of inflammatory cells and characteristics of vaginal microflora).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also evaluate the degree of satisfaction related to the use of the medical&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginitis is the general term characterizing a spectrum of disorders of the vagina caused by&#xD;
      infection, inflammation, or changes in the normal vaginal flora. Symptoms include abnormal&#xD;
      vaginal discharge, odour, pruritus, pain, dysuria and/or discomfort. Moreover, vaginitis is&#xD;
      responsible for the most common problems in clinical medicine, and it is the reason cited&#xD;
      most often for visits to obstetricians and gynecologists. In the past years, the problem of&#xD;
      vaginitis has all too often been ignored by the medical community or regarded merely as a&#xD;
      minor annoyance to women. According to Gardner, &quot;Vaginitis must cause more unhappiness on&#xD;
      earth than any other gynecologic disease. In addition to the many physical and emotional&#xD;
      problems associated with vaginitis, the economic loss involved is of astronomic proportions.&quot;&#xD;
      The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and&#xD;
      trichomoniasis. Bacterial Vaginosis is the cause in 40% to 50% of cases in which a cause is&#xD;
      identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for&#xD;
      15% to 20% of cases. The standard of care currently is based on anti-infectious therapy. With&#xD;
      the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications&#xD;
      for vaginitis, many symptomatic women seek these products before or in addition to an&#xD;
      evaluation by a medical provider. However, recurrence of vaginosis is frequent, and can&#xD;
      include four or more episodes in one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-infectious cases, including atrophic, irritant, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less&#xD;
      common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Obtaining a medical history alone has&#xD;
      been shown to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to the&#xD;
      inappropriate administration of medication. Therefore, a careful history, examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory testing to determine the etiology of vaginal symptoms are needed. Information on&#xD;
      sexual behaviors and practices, gender of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices&#xD;
      (e.g., douching), and self-treatment with medications should be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other causes of vaginitis There is no cause of vagini¬tis identified in up to 30% of women.&#xD;
      These women may have a range of conditions, includ¬ing irritant or allergic vaginitis,&#xD;
      atrophic vaginitis, or physiologic discharge. The presence of objective signs of vulvar&#xD;
      inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing suggests the&#xD;
      possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other non-infectious causes of vulvovaginal&#xD;
      signs or symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory vagi¬nitis is an uncommon condition characterized by purulent vaginal discharge,&#xD;
      burning, and dyspa¬reunia, and should be considered in patients with these symptoms if no&#xD;
      infectious cause is found. Inflammatory vaginitis is associated with low estrogen levels,&#xD;
      such as in menopausal or perimenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis is a chronic inflammatory process involving both vagina&#xD;
      and vestibule, occurring almost exclusively in white women, that responds well to topical&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy. Long-term maintenance therapy is frequently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritant/allergic vaginitis is characterized by symptoms such as burning and soreness and&#xD;
      signs such as vulvar erythema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrophic vaginitis is an uncommon condition that occurs as a consequence of estrogen&#xD;
      deficiency and is characterized by symptoms such as thin, clear discharge, vaginal dryness,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, itching. An examination of the vulva can indicate inflammation and thin and&#xD;
      friable vaginal mucosa. Risk factors contributing to atrophic vaginitis are menopause,&#xD;
      lactation, oophorectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunologic disorders, premature&#xD;
      ovarian failure, endocrine disorders, and antioestrogen medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic vaginitis is a distinct vaginal condition, requiring different clinical management&#xD;
      and with distinct clinical risks. (7) Aerobic vaginitis is defined by disruption in&#xD;
      Lactobacillus dominance but is accompanied by more extreme inflammatory changes than BV and&#xD;
      the presence of mainly aerobic enteric commensals or pathogens, including Group B&#xD;
      Streptococcus (S. agalactiae), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus.&#xD;
      Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS) vaginal pathogenicity is not uniformly&#xD;
      acknowledged throughout the literature. GBS virulence for vagina was recognized in the past,&#xD;
      as the organism has been observed to potentially cause local inflammation and discharge, as&#xD;
      well as lactobacilli rarefaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytolitytic vaginosis is another condition which has been recently described as an entity&#xD;
      distinct from either normal flora or bacterial vaginosis. This condition, also called&#xD;
      Doderlein's vaginitis, has numerous, active lactobacilli damaging epithelial cells because of&#xD;
      extreme acidity and low pH. The bare nuclei and cellular debris that are seen during&#xD;
      microscopy, should not be mistaken for leucocytes and cocci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerviron ovules® is a class IIb medical device indicated as adjuvant in the treatment of&#xD;
      acute and chronic vulvovaginitis of mechanical etiology, caused by changes of vaginal pH and&#xD;
      changes of the vaginal flora. It is also used in cervical lesions of mechanical origin as it&#xD;
      favors the healing and re-epithelialization processes and reduces the proliferation of&#xD;
      endogenous pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical investigation on human subjects with this medical device, in which&#xD;
      50 patients will be enlisted, and which will take place in two research centres in Romania.&#xD;
