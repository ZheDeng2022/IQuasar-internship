      This study was designed to investigate the relationship between upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength and endurance, functional capacity, and quality of life child and adolescent with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child and adolescent with cystic fibrosis patients were assessed for upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength and (Shoulder abductors muscle strength, Elbow flexion muscle strength, Handgrip&#xD;
      strength) muscular endurance(arm pull-up test), lung function test, and functional capacity&#xD;
      (six-minute walk test distance), and Quality Of Life (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests were evaluated with a spirometer. It is the volume of air released in the first second from the beginning of the difficult vital capacity maneuver. In general, it gives information about the restriction in major airlines. FEV1 / FVC ratio decrease shows obstruction, FEV1 shows the severity of obstruction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), subjects were asked to walk as fast as they could walk within 6 minutes along a 30-meter straight corridor. The test was performed twice within the same day at intervals of half an hour. The longer distance value for each patient from the two tests used was used for statistical analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests were evaluated with a spirometer. It is the volume of air that comes out with rapid and powerful exhalation following deep inspiratory. Healthy people can normally extract 80 percent of their lung volume in 6 seconds or less</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests were evaluated with a spirometer. It is measured by the maximum exhalation maneuver following the maximum inspiration. It gives information about obstruction in large airways.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Limb Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of peripheral muscle strength Deltoideus (shoulder abduction), Biceps Brachii (elbow flexion) muscles were evaluated with a digital dynamometer (Lafeyette manual muscle tester, U.S.A). Handgrip strength was measured by a hand dynamometer (Baseline LITE hand dynamometer, U.S.A). In each muscle test, the right and left sides were evaluated separately and repeated three times and the best values obtained were recorded in Newton (N). Arithmetic means of the right and left sides were used for statistical analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Limb muscular endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The arm pull-up test was used in the evaluation of muscular endurance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ouality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) was used to evaluate the quality of life. There are four CFQ-R questionnaires for parents of children aged 6 years and over, three different age groups [6-10, 12-13, and over). The child's version of CFQ-R consists of 35 questions in 8 parts, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, Body Image, Eating Disturbances, Treatment Burden, Respiratory symptoms, and Digestive symptoms. Its values range from 0 to 100 points and the higher the score, the better quality of life.</description>
