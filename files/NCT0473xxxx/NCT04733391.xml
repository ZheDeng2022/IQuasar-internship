      Chronic childhood diseases have sometimes strong repercussions on the everyday life of&#xD;
      patients and their families, because of strict daily treatment regimens, physical limitation&#xD;
      or effects on social life for instance In children, chronic diseases can lead to poor growth,&#xD;
      which can of itself affect the child's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal is therefore to study the effects of short stature on the quality of life of&#xD;
      children with chronic diseases treated in our multidisciplinary paediatrics department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of the patients' relatives will also be considered.&#xD;

      Chronic childhood diseases have sometimes strong repercussions on the everyday life of&#xD;
      patients and their families, because of strict daily treatment regimens, physical limitation&#xD;
      or effects on social life for instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of considering quality of life (an overarching concept covering the effects of&#xD;
      the disease on physical, metal, emotional, social and behavioural well-being) in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with chronic conditions is now well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life studies often focus on a specific chronic condition. Studies of multiple&#xD;
      chronic pathologies are rarer. However, factors such as the severity of the disease, its&#xD;
      prognosis, the constraints of the daily regimen, and the visibility of the disease can have a&#xD;
      greater impact than the type of disease itself. Studies of specific chronic diseases have&#xD;
      identified several factors affecting quality of life such as age, sex, disease severity,&#xD;
      medically unexplained symptoms, family cohesion, socio-economic status, perception of the&#xD;
      disease, the adaptation strategies used by the child or their family… It would therefore be&#xD;
      interesting to study the effects of these factors on chronic diseases in general,&#xD;
      irrespective of disease type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, chronic diseases can lead to poor growth, which can of itself affect the child's&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal is therefore to study the effects of short stature on the quality of life of&#xD;
      children with chronic diseases treated in our multidisciplinary paediatrics department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of the patients' relatives will also be considered.&#xD;
