    <textblock>
      This clinical trial examines a group-mediated cognitive behavioral resistance exercise&#xD;
      intervention in head and neck cancer patients who are undergoing chemoradiation treatment.&#xD;
      Chemoradiation is the established standard of care for locally advanced head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients. However, many head and neck cancer patients experience clinically meaningful&#xD;
      declines in muscle mass, physical function, and quality of life during and following&#xD;
      treatment. Resistance exercise has been shown to improve muscle mass, body composition, and&#xD;
      physical function when integrated with appropriate standard of care nutritional&#xD;
      counseling/supplementation. This trial may help researchers determine the important of&#xD;
      integrating exercise interventions with routine cancer care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of implementing a group-mediated cognitive behavioral (GMCB)&#xD;
      personalized resistance exercise (RE) intervention in head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemoradiation (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the effects of GMCB RE intervention upon functional limitations, body&#xD;
      composition, and quality of life (QOL) in HNCa patients undergoing CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo personalized resistance exercises over 1 hour daily. Patients receive&#xD;
      dietary counseling over 60 minutes at week 1 and then over 15-30 minutes weekly for up to 6&#xD;
      weeks. Patients also receive group-based behavioral counseling twice weekly (BIW) in weeks&#xD;
      1-8, once a week (QW) in weeks 9-12, and then twice a month in weeks 13-24.&#xD;

    <description>Anthropometric measurements are a series of quantitative measurements of the muscle, bone, and adipose tissue used to assess the composition of the body. The core elements of anthropometry are height, weight, body mass index (BMI), body circumferences (waist, hip, and limbs), and skinfold thickness. Anthropometric measurements will be taken in a consultation room to ensure the privacy of the participant.</description>
