      This study is a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing adapted, live online,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for parents and carers of children with food allergies&#xD;
      (MBCT-PCCFA) with a treatment as usual control. A battery of self-report measures will be&#xD;
      administered online at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 15) and at follow-up (week&#xD;
      23).&#xD;
