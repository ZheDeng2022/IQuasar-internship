  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed at the evaluation of a new protocol of antibiotic prophylaxis,&#xD;
      stratified according to individual infective risk calculated with the Shariff score at the&#xD;
      moment of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation.&#xD;

      Prospective, single centre, cohort study. Patients undergoing CIED surgery in a 3-years&#xD;
      period were considered for participation. In particular, patients were eligible if undergoing&#xD;
      first implantation or replacement or upgrade of pacemaker or implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), including cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrolment, before index procedure, the Shariff score was calculated for every&#xD;
      patient. According to the score, patients were stratified in two groups: low infective risk&#xD;
      (score &lt;3) and high infective risk (score ≥3). Two different protocols of antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis were administered according to risk stratification. Patients in the &quot;low risk&quot;&#xD;
      group were treated with only two doses of antibiotics, both intravenous, of whom the first&#xD;
      one hour before skin incision and the second after eight hours. Patients in the &quot;high risk&quot;&#xD;
      group were treated with intravenous prophylaxis for two full days (of whom the first&#xD;
      administration one hour before skin incision and the others every eight hours), followed by&#xD;
      other seven days of oral prophylaxis, for a total of nine days. Thereby, every patient&#xD;
      received one administration of intravenous antibiotic one hour before skin incision and a&#xD;
      second administration after eight hours, while patients in the low risk group did not receive&#xD;
      other antibiotics and patients in the high risk group continued intravenous antibiotics every&#xD;
      eight hours for two days, followed by oral antibiotics for other seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended drug for antibiotic prophylaxis was amoxicillin + clavulanic acid unless the&#xD;
      patient had a history of allergic reactions to penicillin. The dosage was dependent on renal&#xD;
      function: for intravenous amoxicillin + clavulanic acid 2.2 g in patients with creatinine&#xD;
      clearance (CrCl) &lt;30 ml/min and 1.2 g in patients with CrCl &gt;30ml/min, for oral amoxicillin +&#xD;
      clavulanic acid 1 g every 8 hours in patients with &lt;30 ml/min and 1 g every 12 hours in&#xD;
      patients with CrCl &gt;30ml/min. In case of penicillin allergy, clindamycin was chosen. The&#xD;
      intravenous dosage was 600 mg every 8 hours for CrCl &lt;30 ml/min and 600 mg every 12 hours for&#xD;
      CrCl &gt;30 ml/min, while the oral dosage was 450 mg every 8 hours for CrCl &lt;30 ml/min and 450&#xD;
      mg every 12 hours for CrCl &gt;30 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were already in antibiotic therapy at the time of index procedure (for reasons&#xD;
      other than CIED implantation) were not stratified in one of the two groups: post-operative&#xD;
      antibiotics were continued according to clinical indications and not to the study protocol.&#xD;
      This group included patients with a documented or suspected infection before surgery in whom&#xD;
      the CIED procedure was judged not deferrable.&#xD;
