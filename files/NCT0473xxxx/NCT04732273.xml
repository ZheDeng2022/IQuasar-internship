    <textblock>
      The SCCSS-FollowUp is a national, multicenter cohort study designed to investigate late&#xD;
      effects in childhood cancer survivors in a prospective and longitudinal way. The study is&#xD;
      embedded in regular follow-up care and inclusion in the study takes place in a step-wise&#xD;
      approach. The investigators collect data from clinical examinations, laboratory and&#xD;
      functional tests, and questionnaires to learn more about late effects of childhood cancer&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Survival after childhood cancer has increased substantially over the last&#xD;
      decades. In Switzerland, 10-year survival now exceeds 85%. This results in increasing numbers&#xD;
      of childhood cancer survivors - estimated 6,600 survivors currently in Switzerland. Due to&#xD;
      the cancer treatment or the cancer itself, a large part of the childhood cancer survivors&#xD;
      suffer from late effects. As survivors of childhood cancer have decades of life ahead, it is&#xD;
      of special interest to minimize potentially avoidable chronic diseases, impaired quality of&#xD;
      life, deaths, and health care costs. There is a need to assess clinical data prospectively in&#xD;
      a standardized way across clinics to study late effects on a national level. Such data are&#xD;
      currently not available in Switzerland and the SCCSS-FollowUp aims to fill this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The SCCSS-FollowUp assesses the prevalence of late effects through risk-adapted&#xD;
      medical examinations (in accordance with international guidelines and evidence), identifies&#xD;
      CCS with asymptomatic late effects through functional testing, e.g. echocardiography or lung&#xD;
      function testing, standardizes clinical follow-up examinations in CCS in Switzerland, and&#xD;
      collects follow-up data in a longitudinal way. The SCCSS-FollowUp also investigates&#xD;
      sociodemographic, treatment, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors for late effect&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The SCCSS-FollowUp recruits eligible childhood cancer survivors in a stepwise&#xD;
      approach by identifying CCS at risk because of specific treatment modalities (e.g. exposure&#xD;
      to anthracyclines or thoracic irradiation). The investigators ask eligible survivors for&#xD;
      participation. Those who consent receive before or during the next follow-up visits focused&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires are short and focus on one organ system, but participants&#xD;
      can receive different questionnaires at subsequent visits. The data generated during the&#xD;
      follow-up visits, such as clinical examination, functional and laboratory test results, and&#xD;
      the completed questionnaires are entered in the SCCSS-FollowUp database. The examinations and&#xD;
      tests are performed in a standardized way in all participating clinics and according to&#xD;
      follow-up guidelines or other evidence-based literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected within the SCCSS-FollowUp allow research on late effects on a national&#xD;
      level and based on objective clinical data obtained during routine care. The SCCSS-FollowUp&#xD;
      helps to learn more about late effects, especially subclinical damage, which are not&#xD;
      detectable by questionnaire only. Early detection of these late effects and timely treatment&#xD;
      can prevent and mitigate further deterioration. Furthermore, the SCCSS-FollowUp helps to&#xD;
      assess risk factors for late effects development which can be used to amend cancer treatment&#xD;
      in future patients. The SCCSS-FollowUp thus helps to improve the health of current and future&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivors.&#xD;
