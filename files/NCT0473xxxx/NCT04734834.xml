    <textblock>
      A novel patent-pending &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 Multi-Nutrient-Complex (MNC), a vitamin, mineral,&#xD;
      and phytonutrient encapsulated liquid formulation, was prepared using a novel proprietary&#xD;
      SK713 SLP multi-lamellar non-GMO phospholipid nutrient absorption/delivery technology in a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art multistep cGMP and NSF-certified manufacturing facility. This developmental&#xD;
      technology is biodegradable and biocompatible. Preliminary study in our laboratory&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 in Sports Nutrition. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 supplement will enhance strength, endurance, and athletic&#xD;
      performance; and improve energy output, lean-body muscle mass, increase exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      recovery, and improve anabolic parameters in healthy human subjects. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect of oral&#xD;
      supplementation of &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 on the parameters. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 supplementation will enhance all the athletic parameters and improve blood&#xD;
      chemistry parameters in healthy human subjects. Accordingly, 150 healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 or placebo in the&#xD;
      form of single dose sealed containers for 90 consecutive days and muscle strength, endurance,&#xD;
      speed, anabolic/catabolic parameters and muscle mass will be evaluated by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA), hand-grip strength test, cycle ergometer test, spirometer assessment&#xD;
      and assay of Blood chemistry and serum biomarkers will be evaluated before and after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Higher level athletic performance induces greater demands on nutrient and oxygen utilization&#xD;
      and hydration. Consistent performance-induced chronic resource depletion from demands of this&#xD;
      level can induce an increasing anaerobic, hypoxic/acidic environment, promoting anaerobic&#xD;
      metabolic events (i.e. anaerobic glycolysis). Disorders arising from this depletion include&#xD;
      chronic inflammation, cramps, and pain, and induce a defensive expenditure of alkalinizing&#xD;
      buffers in hemoglobin (i.e. histidine), to prevent a dangerous lowering of blood pH. The&#xD;
      physical demands of higher levels of athletic performance deplete biological resources&#xD;
      predisposing a greater incidence of chronic problems such as cramps, inflammation, muscle&#xD;
      injury and pain. A Phase 1 Pilot Validation Study was conducted in three healthy young&#xD;
      trained male athletes (Age: 32-39 years) over a period of 90 consecutive days, with a 2-week&#xD;
      intermediate evaluation1. Subjects consumed 30 mL (1-ounce) of &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35, a World&#xD;
      Anti-Doping Association (WADA) compliant iron-free liquid &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 vitamin, mineral&#xD;
      and phytonutrient complex (MNC) on an empty stomach before engaging in a rigorous exercise&#xD;
      regimen in the morning. They consumed another ounce of the &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 again&#xD;
      mid-afternoon of the same day. Total blood chemistry including free and bound testosterone&#xD;
      levels, as well as changes in their exercise performance activities were closely monitored&#xD;
      and recorded prior to consuming the &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35, during the intermediate 2-week&#xD;
      evaluation, and then again at the end of the study period. In the 2-week Phase 1 evaluation,&#xD;
      1 ounce of &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 taken within 30 minutes before engaging in a rigorous exercise&#xD;
      regimen, induced dramatic improvements in athletic exercise performance. Following&#xD;
      &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 supplementation, physiological health including physical strength,&#xD;
      stamina, respiratory parameters, energy level, and sleep quality increased, and blood&#xD;
      chemistry parameters were improved. Before &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 intake, one subject was&#xD;
      struggling with 270 lbs. for 4 reps on the banded reverse Hack Squat, while after&#xD;
      supplementation, subject achieved 270 lb.s for 10 reps; rested, then the very next set&#xD;
      increased to 320 lbs. for 10 reps. The set after that (the 3rd and final set of that&#xD;
      exercise), weight increased again to 360 lbs. for 8 reps. In another subject on the same&#xD;
      equipment, pre-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 supplementation, the squat result was 405 lbs. for 10 reps,&#xD;
      while post-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 supplementation, the squat increased significantly to 455 lbs.&#xD;
      for 6 reps. Pre-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 intake, one exercise in particular, the subject was able&#xD;
      to perform the banded reverse hack squat with 160 lbs for one set of 8 reps. After&#xD;
      &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 intake, the subject increased squat performance to 180 lbs. for 2 sets of&#xD;
      10 reps. On the Hammer Strength banded incline chest press, pre-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35, subject's&#xD;
      working weight sets were 160 lbs. Post-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 sets increased to 180 lbs. Another&#xD;
      increase in strength was experienced in banded Hammer Strength incline press. Pre-VMP35,&#xD;
      Subject was doing 180 lbs. for 10 reps, which was increased to 230 lbs. for 10 reps post&#xD;
      &quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35. On side lateral dumbbell raises subject's working weight increased from&#xD;
      20 lbs. Pre-&quot;Prodovite®&quot; VMP35 to 25 lbs. Post- Prodovite® VMP35 supplementation, subjects&#xD;
      were able to push a little harder and achieve extra reps with shorter rest periods. Overall,&#xD;
      a significant increase in strength was noticed in all subjects and all subjects experienced&#xD;
      shorter recovery time between sets and post-workout. Based on these encouraging data,&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct the following full-blown investigation. This pilot&#xD;
      investigation inspired our team to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      investigation in 150 volunteers (age: 18-74 years) over a period of 90 consecutive days. A&#xD;
      statistician will be involved in this project. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood chemistry, blood pressure and heart rate, body and hand grip strength,&#xD;
      speed and endurance studies including open circuit spirometry-based assessment of pulmonary&#xD;
      function will be assessed. Other parameters to be evaluated include oxygen consumption, CO2&#xD;
      production and metabolic parameters, VO2 max, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), anaerobic&#xD;
      threshold, ventilatory equivalents for oxygen (VE/V02) and exhaled carbon dioxide (VE/VC02).&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in completed maximal graded exercise tests (GXT) on a treadmill or&#xD;
      in set distance open-field sprints using open-circuit spirometry. Lower and Upper Body&#xD;
      Strength will be evaluated. E-Diary will be provided to all participants. Survey Monkey&#xD;
      program will be provided to all subjects and regularly updated by all study participants&#xD;
      daily and endorsed by the Principal Investigator and Sub-Investigators.&#xD;
