    <textblock>
      Recommendation is strong on physical activity (PA) in the prehabilitation of Enhanced&#xD;
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for various types of surgeries. The evidence is however weak&#xD;
      regarding ERAS protocols. Many studies have showed that physical exercise and PA have&#xD;
      hypoalgesic effects on healthy individuals and they have better pain tolerance too. Here the&#xD;
      investigators study changes in postoperative pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting for&#xD;
      various types of surgical patients after performing preoperative PA at moderate or vigorous&#xD;
      intensity Vs non-preoperative PA patients.&#xD;

      Despite the increasing knowledge on the mechanisms of incisional inflammation, transmission&#xD;
      of nociception signals, peripheral and central sensitization, and on top of the current&#xD;
      advancements in pharmacology, pharmaceutics, techniques and equipment, unfortunately, the US&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine revealed that 80% of patients receiving surgery have reported&#xD;
      postoperative pain with 88% of them at moderate, severe, or extreme levels. Opioids for&#xD;
      postoperative pain are commonly administered to relieve moderate to severe pain, therefore,&#xD;
      the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence will be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS is a prevalent policy that combines evidence-based perioperative care to accelerate&#xD;
      surgical recovery, Anesthesiologists are involved in many perioperative ERAS elements of&#xD;
      patients in terms of evaluation and implementation: e.g., like prehabilitation via education&#xD;
      of physical and core muscles training on the pain management clinic, perioperative&#xD;
      multi-modal pain management and multi-modal anti-emetic prophylaxis against PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of multimodal structured prehabilitation programs is to increase, for&#xD;
      instance, the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal preoperative functional reserve, leading to&#xD;
      better postoperative functional recovery and a reduced incidence of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better ischemic pain tolerance is well documented after combined moderate-and&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for healthy individuals and acute exercise also has&#xD;
      hypoalgesic effects.Unfortunately, these physical activity (PA) researchers have not&#xD;
      evaluated specifically effects on postoperative pain and PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to determine the relationship between preoperative PA on&#xD;
      postoperative pain and PONV for different types of surgery, that is, breast neoplasms,&#xD;
      thoracic, laparoscopic abdominal, abdominal laparotomy, Ears-Nose-Throat, urinary tract&#xD;
      stones and tumors, orthopedic, plastic, spinal and colorectal surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, observational retrospective (preoperative PA patients group vs&#xD;
      preoperative non-PA patients group) trial. Information on the incidence and severity of pain&#xD;
      and PONV of each patient are periodically recorded at time-points of 1, 4, 7, 10 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after various types of surgical operation. Our study was aimed to determine beneficial&#xD;
      effects on postoperative pain and PONV for patients after performing preoperative PA for 6 to&#xD;
      8 weeks vs non-PA patients. The investigators employed the recommendations of the American&#xD;
      College of Sport Medicine and the World Health Organization for adults to divide our PA&#xD;
      patients group into moderate-intensity as 30-60 min∙d-1 (≥150 min∙wk-1 ) and&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity as 20-60 min∙d-1 (≥75 min∙wk-1). The severity of postoperative pain and&#xD;
      PONV were measured at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 24 hours after the surgical operations for the PA&#xD;
      patients group and the non-PA patients group. The severity of postoperative pain were&#xD;
      recorded by using 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale and postoperative nausea and vomiting after&#xD;
      surgeries were measured by using 5 points Likert Scale (1-5) to record the severity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain and PONV after different types of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operations were performed under general anesthesia (GA) with endotracheal intubation or&#xD;
      inhalation through laryngeal mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures of GA will be discussed and decided by one of our anesthesiologists of the&#xD;
      Chia-Yi Christian Hospital together with patients/caregivers at the Pre-Anesthesia&#xD;
      Consultation Clinic. We used the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status&#xD;
      scoring system for risk stratification, the approaches of Apfel's preventive strategy of&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, perioperative multi-modal pain management in&#xD;
      addition to other appropriate elements in ERAS. PONV defined as nausea, vomiting or retching&#xD;
      within 24 h of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle investigator is responsible for the data collection of this retrospective study&#xD;
      and recorded of the severity of the postoperative pain and PONV at time-points of 1, 4, 7, 10&#xD;
      and 24 hours after various types of surgical operation via the &quot;Postanesthesia Patient&#xD;
      Interview and Record Sheet&quot; and the nursing care recorded at the ward for the PA patients&#xD;
      group and the non-PA patients group.&#xD;
