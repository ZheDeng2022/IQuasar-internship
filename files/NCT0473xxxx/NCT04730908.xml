      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate in vivo dentifrices containing different&#xD;
      active ingredients in fluoride (F) retention in saliva and dental biofilm. Material and&#xD;
      methods: The dentifrices used in the study were: G1- Daily Regenerator Dentalclean Neutral&#xD;
      (RDCN); G2- Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect (SRP); G3- Daily Regenerator Dentalclean Acid (RDCA),&#xD;
      G4- Colgate Total Daily Repairc (CTDR). A double-blind, randomized crossover clinical study&#xD;
      was conducted with eighteen residents of a city without a water fluoridation program. Biofilm&#xD;
      and saliva samples were collected 1h and 12h after the last brushing for biofilm and, 1 to 60&#xD;
      minutes and 12 hours for saliva. The concentrations of F in saliva and biofilm were analyzed&#xD;
      by specific electrode using the hexamethyldisiloxane facilitated diffusion technique (HMDS).&#xD;
      Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test (p &lt;0.05). Area&#xD;
      under the curve (AUC) was calculated for saliva data. Result: No significant difference was&#xD;
      observed between the groups regarding the retention of F in saliva. However, the largest area&#xD;
      under the curve values in saliva were found for groups G3 and G4. The highest median values&#xD;
      of F-biofilm were found in G3 for 1h and 12h collection times. Conclusion: The toothpaste&#xD;
      containing Refix (RDCA) technology presented the most promising results for fluoride&#xD;
      retention in oral exposure biomarkers.&#xD;

      A randomized, duple-blind crossover clinical trial study was performed to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioavailability of intraoral fluoride in biomarkers of exposure (biofilm and saliva) after&#xD;
      the use of dentifrice with experimental fluoride for one week, with wash-out periods between&#xD;
      them. The biofilm was collected 1 hour (h) and 12h after toothbrushing, and saliva was&#xD;
      collected 1h (T1, T15, T30, T45, T60 min) and 12h. The data was obtained by potentiometry&#xD;
      (ion selective electrode) for fluoride in these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The sample size was determined by sample calculation [25], according to&#xD;
      previous studies [26], α = 5%, β = 10%, and a dropout ratio of 10%. Eighteen individuals with&#xD;
      an average of 26 years old, including both males and females, participated in this study. The&#xD;
      eligibility criteria were people over 18 years old, without systemic commitment and living in&#xD;
      the city of João Pessoa-Paraíba, without water fluoridation (&lt; 0.1 μg/mL F). Individuals were&#xD;
      excluded if they used drugs that interfere with biofilm formation and salivary flow or&#xD;
      fluoride products (&gt; 5000 ppm) in the last 4 weeks, used orthodontic appliances, or had&#xD;
      cavity lesions, periodontal disease, and/or tooth sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Dentifrices The participants were allocated randomly to use the following&#xD;
      experimental dentifrices according to table 1. They were coded by an independent investigator&#xD;
      not involved in the trial. A simple randomization was performed taking into account a cross&#xD;
      design. The unit of randomization was &quot;dentifrice&quot;, so all dentifrices had the same chance of&#xD;
      being selected. The design of the study was created for each participant and for each new one&#xD;
      another draw was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Stage First, the participants were submitted to dental prophylaxis and scraping to&#xD;
      remove all biofilm and dental calculus. They used a placebo, dentifrice without fluoride, for&#xD;
      7 days. Then, the Whitford protocol was followed [16]. Briefly, the subjects were instructed&#xD;
      to brush their teeth three times/day for 1 min (transversal technique) and also to rinse&#xD;
      their mouths after brushing with 10 mL of water. On the seventh day, the subjects were&#xD;
      instructed to brush only the occlusal surfaces and do not use dental floss, to allow biofilm&#xD;
      accumulation. After going to bed, they abstained from eating or drinking anything except&#xD;
      water and did not brush their teeth. The next morning, after 12 hours of last brushing, and&#xD;
      fasting, the first samples of saliva and biofilm (upper and lower right hemi-arch) were&#xD;
      collected. Then, the volunteers brushed the occlusal surfaces for 1 min. Soon after, saliva&#xD;
      samples were collected in the following times: t1, t15, t30, t45, and t60 minutes. Biofilme&#xD;
      samples (left side) were collected later (1 hour after brushing). Resting saliva was&#xD;
      collected for 5 minutes. The biofilm was collected from all tooth surfaces, in both buccal&#xD;
      and lingual areas, using a 3S hollenback spatula, from which the samples were immediately&#xD;
      transferred to an eppendorff tube, centrifuged and subsequently dried at 90°C for two hours&#xD;
      and then weighed. The saliva samples were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes in order to&#xD;
      separate the saliva debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the concentration of fluoride The samples were analyzed by the&#xD;
      hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) facilitated diffusion method of Taves [20] modified by Whitford&#xD;
      [21]. The analyzes were performed with a fluoride specific electrode (model 9409; Orion&#xD;
      Research) and a potentiometer (model EA 940; Orion Research, Cambridge, MA, USA) (Model 720 A&#xD;
      Orion). Fluoride standards (1-100 nM) were used to prepare calibration curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics,&#xD;
      using the statistical program SPSS - v. 21.0 and software Graphpad. The Shapiro-Wilk test was&#xD;
      applied to test the normality of the in vivo study data (n &lt;50). Nonparametric tests were&#xD;
      performed. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by taking baseline values (12 h&#xD;
      after the last brush) up to 60 min after the last brush to indicate the effectiveness of F&#xD;
      retention in saliva over time. For the purpose of comparing the concentration of F in saliva&#xD;
      and biofilm between the groups, the ANOVA test of repeated measures was performed followed by&#xD;
      the Bonferroni post-test. The relationship between the concentrations of biofilm and salivary&#xD;
      fluoride was determined using Spearman's correlation coefficient. This study assumed a&#xD;
      significance level of 5% (p &lt;0.05).&#xD;
