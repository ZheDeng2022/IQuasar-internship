  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) to the&#xD;
      Pakistani Urdu language. The study will measure the reliability &amp; validity of DASI in the&#xD;
      Urdu version.No study has been conducted in the Pakistan region to translate DASI which&#xD;
      follows the proper cross-culture adaptation.&#xD;

      Literature suggested that Duke Activity Index (DASI) is a questionnaire originally developed&#xD;
      in English To evaluate the functionality. DASI was used primarily to assess patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial ischemia,&#xD;
      and infarction. In clinical practice, DASI can be used to know the effects of medical&#xD;
      treatments and cardiac rehabilitation and to assist clinical decisions In controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials, DASI can also be used to assess interventions and as a component for assessing the&#xD;
      costs/benefits of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies demonstrated that DASI is characterized as a questionnaire with good functional&#xD;
      ability, evidence of validity, usefulness, and great clinical and scientific applicability,&#xD;
      it seems to be a useful tool for evaluating cardiac patients. So, to be used with Brazilian&#xD;
      CVD patients it is necessary to validate DASI and verify its psychometric properties in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <description>Reliability and validity are concepts used to evaluate the quality of research. They indicate how well a method, technique or test measures something. Reliability is about the consistency of a measure, and validity is about the accuracy of a measure.</description>
