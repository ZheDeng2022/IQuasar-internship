  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The opioid epidemic is a serious public health crisis that affects all age groups. Emergency&#xD;
      departments (EDs) are on the front line of this public health crisis. Buprenorphine is an&#xD;
      Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment that reduces opioid overdose mortality by up to 70%. A&#xD;
      landmark 2015 randomized controlled trial (RCT) also demonstrated effectiveness of&#xD;
      ED-initiated buprenorphine in improving OUD treatment engagement rates in adults. As a&#xD;
      result, EDs across the nation have begun to follow these practices. This model of&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment is a paradigm shift for care delivery and ripe for adaptation to&#xD;
      special populations, such as adolescents. Adolescents with OUD need easy access to treatment&#xD;
      now more than ever: fentanyl use is on the rise, the COVID-19 pandemic has heralded historic&#xD;
      levels of social isolation in this age group, and the opioid overdose death rate is&#xD;
      increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research has examined how the ED can engage adolescents and their families in&#xD;
      effective OUD treatment. Buprenorphine is an evidence-based treatment for OUD in adolescents.&#xD;
      Three RCTs in ambulatory settings have demonstrated the efficacy of buprenorphine in reducing&#xD;
      opioid use and improving treatment retention in adolescents with OUD. Given its efficacy, the&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians offer buprenorphine to&#xD;
      adolescents with severe OUD or discuss referrals to other providers for this service. Despite&#xD;
      the immense efforts to improve access to buprenorphine, youth with OUD continue to have&#xD;
      markedly low rates of receiving this life-saving medication. A study of Medicaid-enrolled&#xD;
      adolescents with OUD found that between 2014 and 2015, only 3.3% of 13-15 year-old and 6.9%&#xD;
      of 16-17 year-old patients received OUD treatment medication within 3 months of diagnosis.&#xD;
      Treatment receipt is even lower among adolescents experiencing opioid overdose; only 0.5% of&#xD;
      13-15 year-old and 0.8% of 16-17 year-old adolescents receive pharmacotherapy within 30 days&#xD;
      of the overdose. Research is urgently needed to identify effective strategies to address the&#xD;
      enormous treatment gap for adolescents with OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED-initiated buprenorphine with brief intervention and facilitated referral to treatment has&#xD;
      been shown to be highly successful in increasing treatment engagement rates and reducing&#xD;
      opioid use among adults. It is unknown whether this intervention is similarly effective for&#xD;
      adolescents with OUD. To rigorously examine this important clinical research question, it is&#xD;
      first necessary to optimize this intervention for the adolescent population. In this R34&#xD;
      proposal, we will use the Assessment-Decision-Administration-Production-Topic&#xD;
      Experts-Integration-Training-Testing (ADAPT-ITT) framework-a systematic method for&#xD;
      intervention adaptation- to adapt (Aim 1) and test the feasibility (Aim 2) of a treatment&#xD;
      strategy for adolescents that has been shown to effectively link adults with OUD to ongoing&#xD;
      addiction treatment. We aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Optimize the intervention of ED-initiated buprenorphine with brief intervention and&#xD;
      facilitated referral to treatment for adolescents (ages 13 years old until their 18th&#xD;
      birthdays) with OUD (Year 1). Recognizing the novelty of ED-initiated treatment for OUD in&#xD;
      adolescents, and the importance of ensuring that the evidence-based intervention components&#xD;
      are relevant to the target population, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to systematically&#xD;
      refine the intervention. Focus groups and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders will&#xD;
      examine: 1) perceptions of ED-initiated buprenorphine, brief intervention and facilitated&#xD;
      referral to treatment for adolescents, 2) preferences for content and delivery of the&#xD;
      intervention, and 3) strategies to increase awareness and acceptability of the ED as an&#xD;
      access site for treatment and linkage to care for adolescents. Data will be used to adapt&#xD;
      intervention for EDs that treat adolescents and inform the development of updated&#xD;
      intervention training protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Conduct a single-arm pilot study of the intervention developed in Aim 1 to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of enrolling and collecting outcomes from adolescents (ages 13 years-old until&#xD;
      their 18th birthdays) with OUD presenting to 4 pediatric EDs (Year 2). We will conduct this&#xD;
      pilot study in 4 geographically diverse EDs within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied&#xD;
      Research Network (PECARN). PECARN is the only federally-funded pediatric emergency medicine&#xD;
      research network with the robust infrastructure to identify and efficiently enroll a&#xD;
      sufficient number of adolescents with OUD into an ED-based clinical trial. We hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: We will enroll adolescents with OUD at a recruitment rate of at least 1&#xD;
      patient/site/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: We will retain 80% of participants at 30 days, as defined by the successful&#xD;
      collection of the 30-day outcomes of treatment engagement, self-report of opioid use in the&#xD;
      previous 7 days and urine toxicology for opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The findings will inform our planned large-scale implementation trial of ED-initiated&#xD;
      treatment in adolescents which could improve outcomes and ultimately save the lives of&#xD;
      numerous U.S adolescents. The ADAPT-ITT process and feasibility study directly responds to an&#xD;
      urgent need to design and test developmentally-appropriate OUD treatment engagement&#xD;
      strategies for this age group.&#xD;
