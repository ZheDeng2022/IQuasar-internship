  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a rare autoimmune, inflammatory disorder of the orbit and&#xD;
      represents the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease (GD). Several&#xD;
      lines of evidence suggest an important role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of TED; increased levels of IL-17A have been detected in the serum and tears of patients with&#xD;
      TED and IL-17A levels correlate with clinical activity of the disease. Th17 cells (as well as&#xD;
      other cellular sources of IL-17A, e.g. Tc17 cells)have been shown to infiltrate the orbital&#xD;
      tissue of affected patients, producing IL-17A. IL-17A stimulates fibroblast activation,&#xD;
      leading to retrobulbar tissue expansion and orbital fibrosis, which causes significant&#xD;
      functional impairment. Secukinumab is a recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal&#xD;
      anti-IL-17A antibody currently approved for the treatment of 3 inflammatory/ autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis (axSpA) (ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axSpA). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg s.c. in&#xD;
      adults with active, moderate to severe TED.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of active, moderate to severe TED (not sight threatening) in the&#xD;
             study eye at Baseline associated with 2 or more of the following: Lid retraction ≥ 2&#xD;
             mm; Moderate or severe soft tissue involvement; Exophthalmos ≥ 3 mm above normal;&#xD;

             severely affected (study) eye at Screening and Baseline. Note: Proptosis is the&#xD;
             primary qualifier for selection of the study eye. In case both eyes show a similar&#xD;
             degree of proptosis, other inflammatory signs and symptoms (CAS) should be taken into&#xD;
             account by the investigator for the selection of the study eye.&#xD;

          -  Peripheral euthyroidism or mild hypo-/hyperthyroidism defined as free T3 (fT3) and&#xD;
             free T4 (fT4) &lt; 30% above/below normal limits at Screening. Every effort should be&#xD;
             made to correct the mild hypo-/hyperthyroidism promptly and to maintain the euthyroid&#xD;
             state until the end of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Orbital MRI assessment available confirming the diagnosis of TED for patients&#xD;
             initially presenting with hypo- or euthyroidism (without treatment for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring immediate surgical ophthalmological intervention or planning&#xD;
             corrective surgery/irradiation during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other ophthalmic and/or orbital disease or condition that might interfere with the&#xD;
             assessment of TED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous orbital radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous ophthalmological/orbital surgery for TED (e.g., orbital decompression).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of biological agents for the treatment of TED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of systemic, non-biologic, immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of&#xD;
             TED (e.g., mycophenolate or cyclosporine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to secukinumab or other biologic drugs directly targeting IL-17A or&#xD;
             the IL-17 receptor (e.g., ixekizumab, brodalumab).&#xD;

          -  Previous treatment with rituximab, tocilizumab or teprotumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of TED, except for oral&#xD;

             prednisone/prednisolone if the corticosteroid was discontinued at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies including but not limited to&#xD;
             anti-CD20 or investigational agents (e.g., CAMPATH, anti CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3,&#xD;
             anti-CD19).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 5 half-lives of enrollment or within 30&#xD;
             days, whichever is longer.&#xD;
