  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is likely to play an important role in the management of&#xD;
      high grade glioma. Appropriate and timely neuroimaging in the follow up period is believed to&#xD;
      be crucial in making subsequent management decisions. However, there is a paucity in the&#xD;
      literature providing evidence to support this. The aim of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      neuroimaging performed at each component of the patient pathway after initial high grade&#xD;
      glioma treatment, actually results in a real change in management (as opposed to a perceived&#xD;
      change in management). The main emphasis is on all imaging used at the time of a MDM,&#xD;
      however, we will also study specifically dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI&#xD;
      and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in the format of Mock MDMs to be compatible with real life decision making.&#xD;
      Using retrospective identical information available at the MDM i.e. compiled recent&#xD;
      correspondence, histopathological and molecular information, the MDM members (oncology nurse,&#xD;
      oncologist, neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, pathologist/molecular scientist) will&#xD;
      prospectively determine the patient management with and without the imaging.&#xD;
