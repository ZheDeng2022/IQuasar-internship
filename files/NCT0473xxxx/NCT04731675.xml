    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ROM of the joint will be assessed by qualified assessors. Measurements will be recorded in degrees. At baseline, the plane of movement with the smallest (worst) relative value will be identified; only this plane will be used for evaluating change in ROM subsequently.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Physical Function Scale will be used to assess physical function. The scale ranges from 1 ('unable to do' or 'cannot do') to 5 ('without any difficulty' or 'not at all'), where higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in Worst Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Worst Stiffness NRS is a 1-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing the &quot;worst&quot; stiffness within the last 24 hours. The NRS for this item ranges from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (stiffness as bad as you can imagine).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in Worst Pain NRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Worst Pain NRS is a component of the Brief Pain Inventory assessing the &quot;worst&quot; pain in the last 24 hours. The NRS for this item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form is a self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a subject's pain and the impact of this pain on the subject's daily functioning. The subject is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a scale from 0 to 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L Health Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a widely used quality of life instrument that includes questions in each of 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The choices include 5 levels of severity for each domain followed by a general health visual analogue scale (VAS).</description>
