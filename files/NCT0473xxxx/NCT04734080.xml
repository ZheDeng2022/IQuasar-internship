  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of perioperative dronabinol use&#xD;
      in patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With current advanced&#xD;
      regional anesthetic techniques and peripheral nerve blocks, pain is generally well controlled&#xD;
      following TKA on post operative day (POD) 1. There is a rebound pain that exists, however, on&#xD;
      post operative discharge day 2 (POD2) when these blocks are no longer effective. We aim to&#xD;
      study a potential reduction in opioid consumption on POD2 with perioperative dronabinol use&#xD;
      in TKA patients&#xD;

    <masking_description>Throughout cannabinoid research, there has been concern about potential unblinding due to the side effect profile of this class of medication. Prior meta-analyses have advocated for the use of active placebo, with concern that unblinding may misrepresent the effects of clinical trials. However, due to evidence of histamine receptor involvement in pain transmission, as well as overlap in antihistamine antiemetic use and common cannabinoid side effect profiles, we have chosen to use non-active placebo. Our hope is to elicit maximum benefit of cannabinoid dosing perioperatively without confounding variables. With use of non-active placebo, we will perform a comprehensive blinding analysis following the study period to ensure adequate blinding.</masking_description>
