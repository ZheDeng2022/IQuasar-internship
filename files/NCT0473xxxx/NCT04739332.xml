    <textblock>
      The study evaluates if the Newborn Behavioral Observation system, a relationship building&#xD;
      tool, delivered to at risk mothers will have, on one site, an effect on maternal sensitivity&#xD;
      and the other site on Childs responsiveness, measured by the Emotional Availability (EA)&#xD;
      Scales at 4 months post partum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO)&#xD;
      on one site, on maternal sensitivity and on other site on Childs responsiveness, assessed by&#xD;
      EAS at 4 months post partum. The NBO intervention serves to sensitize parents to the infant's&#xD;
      capacities and individuality and to enhance the parent-infant relationship by strengthening&#xD;
      parents 'confidence and practical skills in caring for their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a RCT design. The NBO intervention group will be compared with a control&#xD;
      group who will receive usual post partum care offered by primary health care in Reykjavik,&#xD;
      Iceland. Inclusion criteria are pregnant women with an EPDS sum score above 9 in the third&#xD;
      trimester and/or a previous history of trauma, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NBO intervention group (n=30) will receive three home visits during the 2nd to 4th week&#xD;
      after birth in addition to their usual home visits. The control group (n=30) will receive&#xD;
      regular follow-up (without NBO sessions). At 4 months all participating mothers will be&#xD;
      videotaped during daily caring, feeding or play episodes with their infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline questionnaire (T1) contained information on household income, parity, education&#xD;
      level and the number of children living in the household. Maternal depressive symptoms were&#xD;
      measured by the Icelandic version of The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 24-28&#xD;
      weeks of gestation (T0), six weeks postpartum (T5) and again at 4 months postpartum (T6). The&#xD;
      EPDS is a 10-item self-report scale that assesses current (last week) postpartum depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), yielding a total score ranging&#xD;
      from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating increased symptomatology of postpartum&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videos will be coded by use of the The Emotional Availability (EA) Scale to assess&#xD;
      maternal sensitivity and Childs responsiveness. The EA Scale consists of six dimensions of&#xD;
      emotional availability in the relationship: four for the adult (sensitivity, structuring,&#xD;
      nonintrusiveness and nonhostility) and two for the child (responsiveness to adult and&#xD;
      involvement of adult). The EA direct score for the first dimension, sensitivity for mothers&#xD;
      and responsiveness for the child, is reported. The score seven (range 1-7) is the&#xD;
      highest/best possible score on the two first catagories and three (range 1-3) is the&#xD;
      higest/best score fot the next five catargories. This seven catagories in each domain make&#xD;
      the direct score, witch can reach from 7-29 where the 29 is the higest. In addition to the 6&#xD;
      diementions the Clinical Screeners....... The EA Scale is validated in various settings and&#xD;
      cultures and will serve as the main outcome measure in the RCT.&#xD;

    <description>Maternal sensitivity is measured in the dyad of mother-infant communication; as appropriate responsiveness and ability to handle conflicts in the relationship. Scores for each subscale range from 1-7, higher scores indicating more sensitivity. Direct score range from 7-29, higher scores indicate more sensitivity. Direct score leads to Clinical-Screener score which is reated on a 100 point dimentional scale, divided into four zones; Emotional-Availability (81-100), Complicated E-A (61-80), Unavailable/Detached E-A (41-60) and Problematic/disturbed E-A (1-40).&#xD;
