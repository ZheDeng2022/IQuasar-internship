  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine is the most commonly used stimulant drug with well documented effects on cerebral&#xD;
      vascula-ture. Caffeine is known to non-specifically bind to adenosine receptors in the brain&#xD;
      and to reduce resting blood flow while improving attention and cognitive function, which&#xD;
      suggests that it may allow a more efficient dynamic blood flow regulation through&#xD;
      neurovascular coupling. This study will use standardized dose of caffeine to test its effect&#xD;
      on NVC responses in cerebral and retinal arterioles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal brain function is critically dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow to match demands of activated neurons. This process is known as neurovascular&#xD;
      coupling (NVC) and recent in vivo studies demonstrate that impairment of NVC responses is&#xD;
      associated with worse cognitive performance. Several methods are available to measure NVC&#xD;
      responses in human subjects, including transcranial Doppler (TCD), functional near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (fNIRS), and dynamic retinal vessel analysis (DVA). Although all these&#xD;
      methodologies aim to measure hemodynamic changes in the brain vasculature in response to&#xD;
      cognitive, motor, or visual stimulation, the responses are evaluated on the different levels&#xD;
      of cerebral vasculature including microvasculature (fNIRS), large cerebral vessels such as&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery (TCD), or in the arterioles and venules of the retina (DVA).&#xD;
      Currently, there are limited data available on the simultaneous assessment of NVC responses&#xD;
      using these methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caffeine is the most commonly used stimulant drug with well documented effects on cerebral&#xD;
      vasculature. Caffeine is known to non-specifically bind to adenosine receptors in the brain&#xD;
      and to reduce resting blood flow while improving attention and cognitive function, which&#xD;
      suggests that it may allow a more efficient dynamic blood flow regulation through&#xD;
      neurovascular coupling. This study will use standardized dose of caffeine to test its effect&#xD;
      on NVC responses in cerebral and retinal arterioles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to establish the direct link between reactivity in the cerebral and&#xD;
      retinal micro- and macrovasculature. To achieve this goal, a prospective, single-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo controlled, cross-over study will be employed to evaluate changes in the NVC&#xD;
      responses measured simultaneously with DVA and TCD, or DVA and fNIRS before and after&#xD;
      administration of 100mg of incapsulated caffeine or placebo pill.&#xD;

    <description>Caffeine Research Visual Analogue Scales consists of seven visual analogue scales (&quot;relaxed&quot;, &quot;alert&quot;, &quot;jittery&quot;, &quot;tired&quot;, &quot;tense&quot;, &quot;headache&quot;, overall mood&quot;) are measured from 1 to 10 and have previously been used in research to evaluate the effects of caffeine. A single &quot;mentally fatigued&quot; visual analogue scale (scored from 1 to 10) will be included, as previous research has shown it to be sensitive to a caffeine-glucose drink.</description>

    <measure>Static retinal vessel assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline measurements 1 hour after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Static analysis of retinal vasculature will be performed to evaluate averaged retinal arteriole and venule calibers. A ratio of these two measurements will be used to calculate arteriole-venule ratio.</description>

    <description>Flicker light-induced dilation of the retinal vessels (percentage increase over baseline diameter) will be measured in the right eye of each subject using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA, IMEDOS Systems, Jena, Germany). The change in retinal vessel diameters is tracked and reported as a %change from baseline.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Doppler sonography will be assessed simultaneously with the dynamic retinal vessel analysis and the blood flow velocity will be measured in the posterior cerebral artery. Change in the blood flow velocities from baseline will be measured.</description>

    <description>Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be performed during the finger tapping task or go-no-go cognitive task. fNIRS approach generates data that represent a relative change in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin measured over the cortical brain tissues. Cerebrovascular reactivity will be evaluated as a change in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin between &quot;during&quot; and &quot;before&quot; task.</description>
