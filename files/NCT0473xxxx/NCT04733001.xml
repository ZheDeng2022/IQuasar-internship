      1. Study Objective: The objective of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
           food on the pharmacokinetics of HSG4112 after oral administration in healthy male&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design and Plan: This study is a randomized, open-label, single dose, 3-way&#xD;
           crossover clinical trial. A unique randomization number will be assigned to each subject&#xD;
           deemed eligible to participate in the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A&#xD;
           total of 12 subjects will be randomized to 6 different sequence groups. Each subject&#xD;
           will receive a single dose of HSG4112 480 mg via oral administration under fasted,&#xD;
           low-fat diet, and high-fat diet conditions, with a washout period of 21 days in between&#xD;
           each dosing.&#xD;
