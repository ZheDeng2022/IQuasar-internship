      The aim of the study is to investigate the response of recognized biomarkers of vitamin B12&#xD;
      status to intervention with supplemental vitamin B12 at doses within and beyond the range of&#xD;
      typical dietary intakes in younger and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial in healthy adults aged 18 years and&#xD;
      over will be conducted. Apparently healthy individuals will be recruited from the staff and&#xD;
      student population at Ulster University, Coleraine, and the surrounding local community.&#xD;
      Those interested in the study will provide informed consent. Individuals suffering from&#xD;
      chronic conditions, those taking medications interfering with folate or vitamin B12&#xD;
      metabolism or B vitamin supplements, and women who are pregnant will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation. Potential participants will provide a non-fasting blood sample and those with&#xD;
      plasma creatinine concentration &gt; 130 µmol/L, those with hypochlorhydria (diagnosed&#xD;
      serologically by pepsinogen I to Pepsinogen II ratio &lt; 3) and those with the 677C→T&#xD;
      polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene will also be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. In addition, participants aged 60 years and over who score &lt;25 on the&#xD;
      Folstein's Mini-Mental State Examination (a cognitive function screening test) will be&#xD;
      excluded to reduce the risk of including participants with impaired cognitive function and&#xD;
      thus reduced ability to comply with the study requirements, including compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention trial and recall of food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will undergo a pre-treatment phase with 400 µg/day folic acid (FA)&#xD;
      for 11 weeks. At the end of this phase, participants will provide a non-fasting blood sample&#xD;
      (baseline sample) and will be stratified within each age category (&lt;60 years and ≥60 years)&#xD;
      according to their homocysteine concentrations and subsequently randomized from each stratum&#xD;
      (in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio) to one of the four treatments for 16 weeks: 400 µg/day FA +&#xD;
      placebo, 400 µg/day FA + 2 µg/day vitamin B12, 400 µg/day FA + 10 µg/day vitamin B12 or 400&#xD;
      µg/day FA + 50 µg/day vitamin B12. A non-fasting blood sample will be collected at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention. Biomarkers of vitamin B12 and folate will be measured in blood samples&#xD;
      collected at baseline and post-intervention. The intervention will be conducted on a&#xD;
      staggered basis and both study participants and researchers will be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      allocations. Dietary intake of participants will be assessed using a four-day food diary&#xD;
      based on 2 weekday and 2 weekend day intakes in combination with a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire particularly focused on intakes of foods fortified with vitamin B12 and FA.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the response of recognized vitamin B12 biomarkers&#xD;
      (serum total vitamin B12; serum holotranscobalamin; plasma methylmalonic acid; plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine) to intervention with supplemental vitamin B12 at doses within and beyond the&#xD;
      range of typical dietary intakes in younger and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be estimated by using typical variances from published studies on plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine responses to vitamin B12 supplementation in adults. The calculations are based&#xD;
      on changes in plasma homocysteine, as it is considered a functional indicator of vitamin B12&#xD;
      status. The typical standard deviation of change will be set at 2µmol/L (Clarke et al. 1998;&#xD;
      McKinley et al. 2002) with the minimal detectable difference being 1.5µmol/L at 80% power and&#xD;
      a significance level of 5%. Calculations determined that 40 subjects would be required for&#xD;
      each of the three treatment groups plus placebo in order to show significant differences in&#xD;
      plasma homocysteine concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by posters, advertisement, emails and organized meetings to&#xD;
      promote the study among staff and students at Ulster University, Coleraine, workplaces,&#xD;
      social and sporting clubs and sheltered accommodation for older adults in the surrounding&#xD;
      local community. Those interested in the study will receive a participant information sheet&#xD;
      and further details about the study. A signed informed consent will be obtained from all who&#xD;
      are willing to participate in the study. A screening questionnaire and a non-fasting blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken to identify those eligible to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be: history of gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, vascular or haematological diseases or&#xD;
      diabetes; those taking medications that interfere with folate or vitamin B12 metabolism (e.g.&#xD;
      methotrexate, proton pump inhibitor drugs); use of B vitamin supplements; pregnancy; plasma&#xD;
      creatinine concentration &gt; 130 µmol/L; those with hypochlorhydria (diagnosed serologically by&#xD;
      pepsinogen I to Pepsinogen II ratio &lt; 3); those individuals with the 677C→T polymorphism in&#xD;
      the MTHFR gene and those aged 60 years and over who scored &lt;25 on Folstein's Mini-Mental&#xD;
      State Examination (a cognitive function screening test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will undergo a pre-treatment phase with 400 µg/day folic acid (FA)&#xD;
      for 11 weeks; the treatment with FA will continue until the end of the trial. At the end of&#xD;
      the pre-treatment phase, participants will provide a non-fasting blood sample (baseline&#xD;
      sample) and will be stratified within each age category (&lt;60 years and ≥60 years) according&#xD;
      to their homocysteine concentrations and subsequently randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio to one of the four treatments for 16 weeks: 400 µg/day FA + placebo, 400 µg/day FA + 2&#xD;
      µg/day vitamin B12, 400 µg/day FA + 10 µg/day vitamin B12 or 400 µg/day FA + 50 µg/day&#xD;
      vitamin B12. A non-fasting blood sample will be collected at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
      Blood samples at baseline and post-intervention will be analyzed for biomarkers of folate and&#xD;
      vitamin B12 status. In order to encourage maximal compliance, participants will be contacted&#xD;
      regularly and provided with supplements in 7-day pillboxes every 4 weeks during the&#xD;
      pre-treatment phase and the intervention, and will be asked to return the used pillboxes; the&#xD;
      number of unused capsules will be recorded to monitor compliance. The intervention will be&#xD;
      conducted on a staggered basis and both study participants and researchers will be blind to&#xD;
      treatment allocations. Dietary intake of participants will be assessed using a four-day food&#xD;
      diary (based on 2 weekday and 2 weekend day intakes) and a food frequency questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding specific intake of foods fortified with vitamin B12 and FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements as height and weight for each participant will be taken by using&#xD;
      portable approved scales.&#xD;
