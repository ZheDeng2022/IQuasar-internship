  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses the feasibility of a 4-week upper extremity training program emphasizing&#xD;
      quality of movement practiced at high intensity and dosage applied during the early subacute&#xD;
      phase after stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive 120 minutes of upper extremity training X 5 days per week for 4&#xD;
      weeks in addition to their daily rehabilitative routine (total therapy time 40 hours in&#xD;
      addition to daily routine treatments of approximately 60 hours). Each session will be staffed&#xD;
      with a 1:1 PT/OT to patient ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the program is to increase the time spent on tasks using customized game-based&#xD;
      platforms that include highly immersive, challenging and rewarding virtual environments for&#xD;
      upper limb training. The focus of these game-based platforms is to reduce upper extremity&#xD;
      impairments through emphasizing the quality of movement execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one platform, the participant controls virtual dolphin movements by moving his/her paretic&#xD;
      upper limb. The game utilizes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of the video&#xD;
      recordings in real-time. In case the participant needs arm weight support, the practice will&#xD;
      perform the task with a mechanical wearable exoskeleton vest, EkssoUE (Ekso Bionics) that can&#xD;
      provide support at different weight levels. Arm weight support will be titrated as the&#xD;
      patient progresses through each session and will be reduced/removed if no significant&#xD;
      compensatory strategies were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second platform, the HandTutor system (MediTouch) consists of an ergonomic wearable glove&#xD;
      and a dedicated software with games that allow practicing active wrist movements, grip&#xD;
      control and finger individuation in a challenging and motivating environment. Participant&#xD;
      progresses through simple to difficult games while adjusting the range of motion that is&#xD;
      being practiced according to participant's abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training in both platforms will be conducted in sitting. Participant will continue with their&#xD;
      regular rehabilitative routine that includes daily physical and occupational therapy sessions&#xD;
      and speech therapy if needed as well as group work and gym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of the proposed intervention the following data/measures will be&#xD;
      documented:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence rates; Time on task (in minutes); Progression in game levels and the amount of&#xD;
      weight support; Attendance to routine rehabilitative sessions; Visual Analogue Scale will be&#xD;
      used to monitor the levels of pain; Rating perceived exertion (RPE), the revised&#xD;
      category-ratio scale (0 to 10 scale) will be used to monitor and guide exercise intensity;&#xD;
      The Pittsburgh rehabilitation participation scale (PRPS); The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory&#xD;
      (IMI) - will be assessed at the end of intervention period; Acceptability and satisfaction of&#xD;
      the intervention to participants will be assessed at the end of training period using a&#xD;
      self-designed questionnaire/rating scale; Adverse events; Problems/difficulties related to&#xD;
      intervention equipment (software, hardware, vest etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the potential effectiveness of the intervention the following data/measures will&#xD;
      be conducted at baseline (prior training), immediately post intervention and at 12 (±14) and&#xD;
      24 (±14) weeks post stroke:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer upper extremity assessment (FM-UE); Action research arm test (ARAT); Stroke Impact&#xD;
      Scale (SIS) hand domain, version 2.0; Upper extremity impairment and function will be&#xD;
      assessed using a reaching and a grasping tasks that will be recorded using multiple high&#xD;
      resolution video-cameras and analyzed using AI algorithm (OpenPose).&#xD;
