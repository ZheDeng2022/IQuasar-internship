  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of integrating exercise and&#xD;
      psychotherapy that is specifically targeted to reducing and managing pain into residential&#xD;
      drug treatment programs. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility (adherence) of&#xD;
      integrating 'assisted' rate cycling, voluntary rate cycling and psychotherapy for pain&#xD;
      (I-STOP) in participants with an opioid use disorder (OUD) and pain enrolled in residential&#xD;
      drug treatment programs. The investigators will also explore the potential effects of&#xD;
      'assisted' rate cycling, voluntary rate cycling and I-STOP on pain, cravings, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, weight and sleep.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the pilot trial (R61 Phase), the investigators will use a multi-phase optimization trial (MOST) approach to help identify which components of the exercise and psychotherapy for pain treatment program are viable and worth retaining in the planned fully powered trial (R33 Phase). In the R61 Phase/Pilot Trial, the investigators will have two intervention components: 1) exercise with 3 levels ('assisted', voluntary, none/treatment as usual (TAU); and, 2) psychotherapy for pain (I-STOP) with 2 levels (Yes/I-STOP, No/TAU). All participants will receive also receive the treatment as usual at their residential drug treatment program and any medication assisted treatment (MAT). This corresponds to a 2^1 x 3 1 full factorial with six experimental conditions.</intervention_model_description>
