  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability, feasibility and explore the possible&#xD;
      effects of an early physical therapy education intervention for breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled and longitudinal study design. We will compare two&#xD;
      groups - an intervention group and a control group - to test the effects of an early physical&#xD;
      therapy education intervention for breast cancer survivors who are candidates for breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery. Because of the nature of the intervention (patient early education with 1:1&#xD;
      discussion of educational materials) we will be unable to introduce blinding of the&#xD;
      participant as well as the staff.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Moving On After Breast Cancer - Intervention Arm</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants are randomized to the intervention arm after their breast cancer diagnosis (but before cancer surgery) and baseline measurements (T0) are taken. They are followed up again at 2 weeks after their breast cancer surgery (T1), and again at 3 months after surgery (T2). Participants are given the patient education materials (booklet, therapeutic exercise DVD, small ball, range of motion wand). The research assistant orients the participant to the education materials and summarizes each section of the booklet. The research assistant also teaches the participant how to do the therapeutic exercises in the booklet. All participants in the intervention also receive usual care.</description>

    <description>Participants are randomized to the usual care arm after their breast cancer diagnosis (but before cancer surgery) and baseline measurements (T0) are taken. They are followed up again at 2 weeks after their breast cancer surgery (T1), and again at 3 months after surgery (T2). Usual care consists of pre-operative testing, pre-operative nursing education on care of the surgical incision and pain management followed by breast cancer surgery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Moving On After Breast Cancer</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient education intervention that is evidence-based, physical therapy, patient &amp; family centered through the use of face to face instruction, a booklet, and therapeutic exercise DVD. The education materials are designed to deliver information on short term, long term, and late physical and functional effects of breast cancer treatment and given to breast cancer survivors before beginning cancer treatment. The education materials are designed to be used before, during, and after breast cancer treatment.</description>
