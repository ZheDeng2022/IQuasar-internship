  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is one of the rare subtypes of ovarian cancer, yet its&#xD;
      prognosis is extremely poor. Previous studies indicate that both bevacizumab and PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor have clinical benefits for OCCC patients. And the combination of bevacizumab and&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor has shown preliminary safety and clinical activity. Therefore, this study aims&#xD;
      to investigate the potential benefit of combination therapy for patients with OCCC.&#xD;
