  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study is a feasibility randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      mHealth (voice call and SMS) and teach-back interventions on reducing the 30 days readmission&#xD;
      rate in the patients enrolled in the Sehat Sahulat Programme (Prime Minister National Health&#xD;
      Programme(PMNHP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prime objective of this study was to generate a proof of concept for the conduct of a&#xD;
      definitive trial for the reduction in readmissions in PMNHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility randomized controlled trial study consisted of three arms i.e intervention 1&#xD;
      (telephonic contact and text messages), intervention 2 (teach-back method) and control is&#xD;
      planned in program beneficiaries of Islamabad, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is being carried out in the three hospitals of Islamabad and patients are being&#xD;
      recruited as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interventional Description of intervention(s) / exposure The study will comprise of three&#xD;
      phases Phase I = Preparation Phase II= Implementation and monitoring Phase III = Evaluation&#xD;
      Phase I (Preparation) i. Permissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical approval from Institutional review Board of Health Services Academy Islamabad&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permission from PMNHP to carry out a feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent from doctors and nurses to be enrolled in the teach-back process&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed verbal consent from all the selected patients to be enrolled in the PMNHP ii.&#xD;
           Situation analysis The cross-sectional study will be conducted at the start of study&#xD;
           prior to intervention to provide baseline data on selected variables. The baseline data&#xD;
           will include sociodemographic status, diagnosis, comorbidities, length of stay in the&#xD;
           hospital for the index admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Implementation) i) Team building This step shall include recruiting educated&#xD;
      individuals for the survey. For this purpose selected PMNHP staff will be recruited for&#xD;
      telephonic contact with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher himself will brief and orient the team on background and objectives, the&#xD;
      usefulness of the study and data recording and medication adherence scale to be used in the&#xD;
      study, in a one day workshop comprising of one session of 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Validation of the Urdu translation of Medication Adherence Questionaire (MAQ) In order to&#xD;
      address the validity and reliability of the MAQ translation and back translations of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be carried out. The questionnaire will be pretested on 10 patients by the&#xD;
      staff for adaptability in accordance with the WHO guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Developing text for SMS This shall comprise of developing easy and understandable text&#xD;
      for SMS in English and Urdu for medication adherence and timely follow up to be delivered to&#xD;
      the patients. For this purpose, Health communication experts and \ public health&#xD;
      professionals will be contacted and involved. The developed SMS will be piloted among&#xD;
      patients in a similar setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Training of Data collectors for telephonic contact Selected PMNHP staff will be trained&#xD;
      to contact the patients on their telephones and ask questions regarding their medication&#xD;
      adherence and fill up the MAQ. Training sessions will be conducted by the researcher to carry&#xD;
      out a telephonic survey and send SMS messages to the selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Training of doctors and nurses on the teach-back process Doctors and nurses from the&#xD;
      selected empanelled hospitals will be trained on the teach-back process for better discharge&#xD;
      communication with the patients. One day training session will be held in the Health Services&#xD;
      academy vi) Assigning tasks and responsibilities All team members will be provided with a&#xD;
      work-plan and agreed on responsibilities with timelines, in order to ensure timely and proper&#xD;
      implementation of the various phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii) Intervention: Intervention - 1 (mhealth through a telephonic voice call and text&#xD;
      messages) Telephonic voice calls for medication adherence using Morisky, Green and Levine&#xD;
      (MGL) 4 items validated medication adherence scale at 7, (Baseline) 14, 21 and 30 days post&#xD;
      index discharge. MGL is a validated tool for assessment of medication adherence with a&#xD;
      Cronbach alpha = 0.61 in a European setting. The instrument will be translated in Urdu&#xD;
      language and will be validated for linguistic and cultural adaptation using the following&#xD;
      procedure:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Forward translation One translator, preferably a health professional, familiar with the&#xD;
           terminology of the area covered by the instrument and with interview skills will be&#xD;
           given this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expert panel A bilingual (in English and Urdu) expert panel will be convened. The goal&#xD;
           in this step will be to identify and resolve the inadequate expressions/concepts of the&#xD;
           translation, as well as any discrepancies between the forward translation and the&#xD;
           existing or comparable previous versions of the questions if any. The result of this&#xD;
           process will produce a complete translated version of the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Back-translation Using the same approach as that outlined in the first step, the&#xD;
           instrument will then be translated back to English by an independent translator who has&#xD;
           no knowledge of the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-testing and cognitive interviewing. Pre-testing will be done on a sample of 10 - 18&#xD;
           patients and other discrepancies will be removed â€¢ Weekly Short text messages (SMS) from&#xD;
           PMNHP staff will be sent to the enrolled patients about adherence to medication and&#xD;
           follow up reminders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - 2 ( Teach-Back process) Teach-back is a simple mechanism by which a patient's&#xD;
      understanding of a concept or topic may be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Society of Hospital Medicine (US) complete teach-back module will be used to train nurses and&#xD;
      doctors of PMNHP empanelled hospitals in ICT in a one-day training session in Health Services&#xD;
      Academy. This teach-back process intervention will be utilized in in group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      viii) Monitoring the process: All steps and activities of the study will be monitored and&#xD;
      spot-checked by the researcher Patients in the study will be contacted through telephone&#xD;
      randomly in order to ensure that they are receiving teach-back, SMS and telephonic calls&#xD;
      regarding medication adherence and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Trial Acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-depth Interviews and Focused Group Discussions from stakeholders at all three levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-intervention exploration of factors influencing implementation of the Interventions&#xD;
           with identification of facilitators and barriers faced by stakeholders during the pilot&#xD;
           implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will generate evidence to support up scalability of PMNHP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ten individuals from each level through purposive sampling will be selected for&#xD;
           subjective perceptions and acceptability of the interventions&#xD;
