  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. PD is&#xD;
      characterized by motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Although balance&#xD;
      impairment is characteristic of advanced stages, it can be present with less intensity since&#xD;
      the beginning of the disease. Approximately 60% of PD patients fall once a year and 40%&#xD;
      recurrently These falls may be correlated with the inability to achieve compensatory&#xD;
      movements to regain balance when their center of gravity tends to swing outside their range&#xD;
      of stability, which is reduced in this disease. On the other hand, cognitive symptoms affect&#xD;
      up to 20% of patients with PD in early stages and can even precede the onset of motor&#xD;
      symptoms. There are cognitive requirements for balance and can be challenged when attention&#xD;
      is diverted or reduced, linking a worse balance and a higher probability of falls with a&#xD;
      slower cognitive processing speed and attentional problems. Cognitive rehabilitation of&#xD;
      attention and processing speed can lead to an improvement in postural stability in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's. The investigators present a parallel and controlled Randomized Clinical&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) to assess the impact on balance of a protocol based on cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      focused on sustained attention through the NeuronUP platform (Neuronup SI, La Rioja, España)&#xD;
      in patients with PD. This therapy opens the possibility of new rehabilitation strategies for&#xD;
      prevention of falls in PD, reducing morbidity and saving costs to the health system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. This disease&#xD;
      is characterized by motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. Non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms such as cognitive impairment, anosmia, sleep disorders, or depression are also part&#xD;
      of the disease, and although their prevalence is very high, non-motor symptomsare often&#xD;
      underdiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the cognitive characteristics in PD is the slowness in the processing of information,&#xD;
      which includes deficits in processing speed and attention, cognitive inflexibility, and&#xD;
      forgetfulness. These symptoms may appear from the initial stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60% of PD patients fall once a year and 40% do so regularly. These falls may be&#xD;
      correlated with the inability to achieve compensatory movements to regain balance when their&#xD;
      center of gravity generally oscillates outside their limits of stability (LOS), which is&#xD;
      reduced in this disease. Some authors point out that reaction times and processing speed may&#xD;
      be a marker of postural instability since a reduced speed is associated with difficulty in&#xD;
      making turns. This is in line with Pantall's findings, indicating that cognitive function and&#xD;
      postural control normally progressively worsen with disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between cognitive impairment and postural instability in PD patients may be&#xD;
      specific for tasks that assess the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its frontal-subcortical&#xD;
      connections. The main cognitive functions whose affectation would influence a worse balance&#xD;
      and gait performance would be attention and executive functions. Varalta et al specified that&#xD;
      balance is related to executive functions and attention, while functional mobility is more&#xD;
      related to cognitive impairment, verbal fluency, and attentional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors point out that within the executive functions the component with the greatest&#xD;
      weight in this relationship would be the inhibitory control. Dual-task performance has also&#xD;
      been established as a good indicator of falls in patients with early-stage PD and no previous&#xD;
      history of falls. The studies that carried out a one and a half years follow-up of the&#xD;
      participants concluded that the deterioration of executive functions acts as a predictor of&#xD;
      future falls in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive rehabilitation through neurorehabilitation platforms and neuropsychological&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson's disease has shown to be effective in improving&#xD;
      processing speed, attention, and executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the relationship between cognitive deficits and postural stability seems to be&#xD;
      demonstrated, the investigators have not found studies that, through cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation, seek a stability improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators working hypothesis is that the group that receives rehabilitation of the&#xD;
      speed of information processing and sustained attention will improve their postural stability&#xD;
      compared to the group that does not undergo any therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Stability limits test: The Biodex Stability Limits (LOS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test is a challenge for the patient when it comes to moving and exercising control over gravity supported on a base. During each test the patient must change their weight to move the cursor from the center of the target to a new point that will flash on the screen and that will change as fast as the slightest movement or deviation is noticed. This same process will be repeated until another nine objectives are achieved. The test dependent variables provided by the machine are the time (seconds) it takes for the subject to complete the test and the directional control value which is the proportion of the distance travelled by the cursor from the center to each target (based on that 100% is a straight line from the center to the intended target). This means that the greater the distance travelled by the subject, the worse their stability.</description>

    <description>The test is part of the WAIS-III. The examiner reads aloud a series of digits at a rate of one per second and the examinee must repeat this series thereafter in the same order as it was presented (direct digits) or in the reverse order (reverse digits). The test begins with a two-digit series. In each test two series of equal length are read and, if the examinee correctly repeats at least one of the two, the next test is continued in which the series has one digit more than the previous ones. The test ends when the examinee does not pass two series of the same duration. Each of the said series of digits is scored with a point. The sum of the points in each condition (direct and inverse), the sum of both scores and the maximum number of digits said in a series, will be the dependent variables.</description>

The protocol and the number of sessions has been designed by neuropsychologists following the Díez-Cirarda et al. recommendations</description>

    <description>The intervention can be carried out in the research unit or in the Parkinson's association. Each session will consist of a series of cognitive stimulation tasks aimed at improving attention, perception and processing speed. These tasks will be applied through the NeuronUp cognitive neurorehabilitation platform to achieve maximum homogeneity and objectivity in their application. The program is programmed and is identical for all patients. Performing tasks through the platform allows us to objectively record the performance of each patient in all tasks.</description>
