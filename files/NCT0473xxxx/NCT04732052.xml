  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive behaviours are highly prevalent among people with developmental disabilities, both&#xD;
      in community and inpatient or residential settings, with adverse consequences for the&#xD;
      individuals involved and others. Some predictive factors, particularly impulsivity, are&#xD;
      dynamic with neurobiological underpinnings, and as such amenable to change or neuromodulation&#xD;
      using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. With this in mind, we designed an&#xD;
      experimental protocol to determine the efficacy of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique to reduce impulsivity and aggression&#xD;
      associated with developmental disability.&#xD;

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of anodal tDCS in modulating Rapid Response&#xD;
      Impulsivity (RRI) and reducing incidents of aggression in people with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities is residential or hospital settings. Using a single blind, parallel arms,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design, adults (n=60) aged 18 to 65 with developmental&#xD;
      disabilities, who have a history of impulsivity leading to aggression, will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive either repetitive anodal or sham tDCS. Enrolled participants will receive either&#xD;
      three treatment sessions of tDCS or sham tDCS. Behavioural and impulsivity will be measured&#xD;
      before and immediately after treatment, one week, and one month after treatment end. Data&#xD;
      will be analysed in SPSS using repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: Soterix tDCS kit will be used to deliver the stimulation using two sponge electrodes soaked in a saline solution. The stimulation montage will comprise of left anodal Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation. The anodal electrode will be placed over the area corresponding to the left DLPFC (F5 of the EEG10-20 international system) and the reference (cathodal) electrode over the right supraorbital ridge. The active stimulation condition will use a constant current of 2mA, delivered via gradual increase and decrease over 10 seconds at the onset and offset of stimulation (current ramps), respectively. The duration a single tDCS session will be 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation: Soterix tDCS kit will be used to deliver the sham stimulation using two sponge electrodes soaked in a saline solution. The sham stimulation montage will comprise of left anodal Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation for 10s only. The anodal electrode will be placed over the area corresponding to the left DLPFC (F5 of the EEG10-20 international system) and the reference (cathodal) electrode over the right supraorbital ridge. The sham tDCS is identical to the active tDCS except that the current will be delivered only in the first 10 seconds, after which the stimulation will cease but with the electrodes still in place throughout the session. The duration of each sham tDCS session will be 20 minutes.</description>
