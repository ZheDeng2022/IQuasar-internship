  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of umbilical&#xD;
      cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) for the treatment of steroid-resistant acute&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (allo-HSCT), with a view to establishing an effective treatment protocol for&#xD;
      steroid-resistant aGVHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 130 patients with steroid-resistant aGVHD after allo-HSCT are enrolled in this&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomized to UC-MSC + anti-CD25&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies (mAb) group and anti-CD25 mAb group. The complete response (CR) rate&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of treatment in the two groups will be compared. Adverse events are also&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
