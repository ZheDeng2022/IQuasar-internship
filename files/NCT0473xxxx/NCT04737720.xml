      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, moves cholesterol from the artery&#xD;
           walls back to the liver. A blood enzyme known as LCAT maintains HDL levels and helps it&#xD;
           remove cholesterol from the body. Familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) is a genetic disease&#xD;
           that results in low levels or total absence of LCAT. People with FLD often have kidney&#xD;
           problems, and may develop kidney failure. Researchers think that the clinical problems&#xD;
           of FLD can be prevented or even reversed by replacing the defective enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no drugs that increase LCAT. It has to be artificially made and infused into&#xD;
           the body. The artificial LCAT is called recombinant human LCAT, or ACP-501. Researchers&#xD;
           want to see how well it works in one person with FLD and poor kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see whether ACP-501 can improve the symptoms of FLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One person (the study participant) with FLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will receive ACP-501 and remain in the hospital for 24 hours for regular&#xD;
           blood tests. The participant may stay in the hospital or return for daily clinic visits&#xD;
           until it is time for the next dose. The second dose will be given on Day 4 or Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an optimal dose has not yet been identified, a third dose will be given 7 days after&#xD;
           the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will then go home, but must return to the hospital for ACP-501 infusions&#xD;
           and blood tests every 1 or 2 weeks, as needed. Every 3 months, the participant will have&#xD;
           a full clinic visit with blood tests and other studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This primary objective of the study was to use ACP-501 (recombinant LCAT - rhLCAT) as an&#xD;
      Expanded Access Protocol in order for one named subject with Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD)&#xD;
      with the hope of slowing or preventing the progression of renal dysfunction and eliminating&#xD;
      the need for dialysis. This was a first-in-human study of ACP-501 (rhLCAT) in a subject with&#xD;
      FLD. The safety and tolerability of rhLCAT, was assessed after multiple infusions. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of rhLCAT and its effect on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of HDL-C and HDL&#xD;
      subpopulations was also be assessed. The duration of the PK and PD parameters will inform&#xD;
      future multiple dose studies with respect to dose (mg/kg) and dosing interval. The current&#xD;
      protocol completed the primary objection and has shifted to the secondary analysis of samples&#xD;
      that were collected. FLD is an extremely rare generic disorders and there are too few&#xD;
      subjects to design additional phase 1 trials and these longitudinal samples demonstrating the&#xD;
      appearance of normal HDL along with possible biomarkers will be helpful and can help guide&#xD;
      the design of a small definitive phase II/II trial.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed FLD diagnosis through genotype confirmation of a LCAT mutation, as&#xD;
             documented at screening or from previous testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
