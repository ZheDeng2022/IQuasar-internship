  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limitation of range of motion in the shoulder joints is common in stroke patients. The causes&#xD;
      are stiffness, CRPS, and frozen shoulder. The purpose of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between frozen shoulder and shoulder LOM in patients with cerebral infarction&#xD;
      using ultrasonography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound examination was performed on 50 patients with limited range of motion of the&#xD;
      shoulder joint among inpatients or outpatients in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine&#xD;
      of our hospital, who had a stroke of fewer than 2 years, and the findings suitable for&#xD;
      adhesive capsulitis, namely the thickness of the joint capsule in the axillary concave&#xD;
      Identify those with thickened findings. Their shoulder power rating, passive range of motion,&#xD;
      stiffness evaluation (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS), and the presence or absence of Reflex&#xD;
      Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) were evaluated, and the relationship with ultrasound findings was&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>
