  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of cryotherapy versus ketorolac tromethamine irrigating solutions used&#xD;
      as a final flush in single visit endodontic treatment in mandibular molars, with symptomatic&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis and apical periodontitis on the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of post-operative pain in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of expression of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) post-instrumentation using ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analgesic intake following endodontic treatment for post-operative pain relief.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main rationale of endodontic treatment is to eliminate micro-organisms from the infected&#xD;
      root canal system by adequate chemo-mechanical debridement followed by a three-dimensional&#xD;
      hermetic seal to provide a conductive environment for peri-radicular healing. However, Even&#xD;
      with the utmost care in performing root canal therapy, it has been reported that the&#xD;
      prevalence of post-operative pain after single visit endodontic treatment has been reported&#xD;
      to be between 3 to 58%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Steroids have been advocated for control&#xD;
      of post-operative pain following root canal treatment in teeth with symptomatic irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis. Ketorolac tromethamine, a potent NSAID that is over 400 times a selective inhibitor&#xD;
      for COX-1 over COX-2 as compared to other drugs. In a recent study by (Evangelin et al 2019),&#xD;
      assessing the influence of ketorolac tromethamine and dexamethasone when used as root canal&#xD;
      irrigant on the expression of substance P and IL-8; showed that dexamethasone irrigation&#xD;
      achieved the least post-operative pain and the least requirements for analgesics, whilst&#xD;
      ketorolac tromethamine had better control on the expression of substance P and IL-8 as&#xD;
      compared to dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a more recent strategy for reduction of post-operative pain is cryotherapy.&#xD;
      Such treatment modality is aimed to expose the body to very cold temperature, resulting in&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and decreased permeability thus reducing the amount of fluid leaking into&#xD;
      the peri-radicular tissues as exudate which commonly occur after chemo-mechanical&#xD;
      preparation. Analgesia is closely related to the nerve conduction velocity of the nociceptive&#xD;
      sensory nerve fibers. Thus, cooling induces analgesia by slowing the velocity of nerve&#xD;
      conduction as well as decreasing the activation threshold of tissue nociceptors resulting in&#xD;
      cold-induced neuropraxia. Thus the analgesic effect of cooling is produced by combination of&#xD;
      decreased release of chemical mediators of pain and a slower propagation of neural pain&#xD;
      signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, ketorolac tromethamine, dexamethasone and cryotherapy are supposed to be used&#xD;
      as root canal irrigants during root canal treatment to assess their effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      post-operative pain following single visit endodontic treatment in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis, as well as their efficacy in reducing the expression of IL-8.&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard of interventional trials resulting in the&#xD;
      highest level of evidence that contributes effectively in the clinical decision-making&#xD;
      process as to the best intervention for the patient's condition providing the most effective&#xD;
      clinical outcomes for the satisfaction of the patient. Thus the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      compare the effect of using cryotherapy versus ketorolac tromethamine and dexamethasone&#xD;
      irrigating solutions on the intensity of post-operative pain and reduction of expression of&#xD;
      Interleukin-8(IL-8) post-instrumentation in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.&#xD;
