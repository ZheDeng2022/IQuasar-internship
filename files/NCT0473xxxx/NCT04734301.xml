  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation (ES) is one of the techniques used in urogynecological physiotherapy,&#xD;
      which uses implanted or non-implanted electrodes. Intravaginal ES (IVES) is a conservative&#xD;
      treatment option, described more than 40 years ago. IVES is used in patients with OAB and&#xD;
      urge urinary incontinence (UUI), for detrusor inhibition. It has been suggested that IVES&#xD;
      probably targets the detrusor muscle or pelvic floor muscle (PFM) or afferent innervation in&#xD;
      UUI. According to the European Association Urology (EAU) Guidelines; in adults with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, ES may improve urinary incontinence compared to sham treatment. The IVES&#xD;
      programs lasted between 4 weeks and 6 months in women with idiopathic OAB, although generally&#xD;
      IVES was applied for 4-12 weeks. In most studies, IVES was applied 2-3 times a week, whereas&#xD;
      in fewer studies it was applied more frequently. Despite that, no randomised studies compared&#xD;
      different treatment frequencies in women with idiopathic OAB and thus, there is no evidence&#xD;
      of which frequencies of treatment are the most effective ones. It should be kept in mind that&#xD;
      different stimulation frequency may lead to different results. In addition, in the light of&#xD;
      scientific evidence and our clinical experience, we think that this issue is still open for&#xD;
      research. Better methodological quality studies are needed to obtain a higher level of&#xD;
      scientific evidence and to know the optimal treatment frequency for OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of&#xD;
      IVES with different treatment frequency in women with idiopathic OAB. In this study, we aimed&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of 2 times and 5 times in a week IVES added to BT on quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) and clinical parameters asssociated with idiopathic OAB. The results of the our study&#xD;
      will be of great benefit in deciding or preferring the treatment frequency and total&#xD;
      treatment duration of IVES for the women with idiopathic OAB and their physicians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. The trial is held at&#xD;
      Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department&#xD;
      between February 2021 and July 2021. The local ethics committee approve the study&#xD;
      (E-60116787-020-4274). All women are informed about the purpose and contents of the study and&#xD;
      all women written consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random allocation sequence was generated at 1:1 ratio. By using a random number generator,&#xD;
      women are randomized into two groups as follows: Group 1 receive BT+IVES (2 times/week),&#xD;
      Group 2 receive BT+IVES (5 times/week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women which are planned to treat during 20 sessions are included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder Training (BT) All women were informed about BT for 30 minutes in two groups. Then it&#xD;
      was given as a written brochure to be implemented as a home program. BT, consisting of four&#xD;
      stages, did not contain any PFM training programs. At the first stage, all of the women&#xD;
      visited the physician who was blinded to the study groups and at the initial visit, the women&#xD;
      were familiarized with the location of the PFM and the pelvic anatomy and pathophysiology.&#xD;
      After that information session, squeezing the PFM was shown in practice at least once to use&#xD;
      in the urgency suppression strategies via digital palpation technique. In the second stage,&#xD;
      including urgency suppression strategies, it was aimed to delay urination, to inhibit&#xD;
      detrusor contraction and to prevent urgency; by squeezing the PFM several times in a row&#xD;
      (women were encouraged to pause/stop their work, sit down if possible, relax the entire body&#xD;
      and squeeze PFM repeatedly), breathing deeply, giving their attention to another job for a&#xD;
      while and self-motivating (I can do it, I can check the urination, etc.). In the third stage,&#xD;
      timed voiding program was started. It was carried out in 2 steps: timed voiding and&#xD;
      increasing the time between urination considering the voiding diary. At the last stage, the&#xD;
      women were encouraged to continue BT. By increasing their motivation that it is an effective&#xD;
      treatment method, compliance to the treatment was increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: IVES (2 times in a week) This group included the IVES in addition to all components&#xD;
      of the BT. IVES was performed in lithotomy position via electrical stimulation device with a&#xD;
      vaginal probe. IVES sessions were performed two times in a week, for 10 weeks. Every session&#xD;
      lasted 20 minutes. The intervention comprised a 20-sessions treatment program of ES. The&#xD;
      stimulation parameters were frequency at 10 Hz, a 5-10s work-rest cycle and 100 ms pulse&#xD;
      width. The symmetric biphasic pulse wave could be delivered over a range of 0-100 milliamp&#xD;
      (mA). The intensity was controlled according to patients' discomfort level feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: IVES (5 times in a week) This group also included the IVES in addition to all&#xD;
      components of the BT as in Group 1. IVES performed in the same way as Group 1, except for&#xD;
      frequency of treatment. IVES sessions were performed five times in a week, for 4 weeks. Every&#xD;
      session lasted 20 minutes. The intervention comprised a 20-sessions treatment program of ES.&#xD;
      Stimulation parameters were the same as Group 1.&#xD;
