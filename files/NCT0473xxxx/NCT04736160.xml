  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hCG is a hormone produced very early by the pre-embryo, but not by the oocyte. It has a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the trophoblast differentiation, and embryo implantation as well as the&#xD;
      corpus luteum support. In spite of its well-known role, the literature about it is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the relation between the amount of hCG secreted by the&#xD;
      blastocyst and embryo euploidy status and morphological pre-embryo quality according to&#xD;
      morphokinetic pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyse the amount of hCG secreted by blastocyst to the culture medium thorough mass&#xD;
      spectrometry and it will be correlated with the main morphokinetic issues and the chromosomal&#xD;
      structure after NGS analysis at blastocyst stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will take the pre-embryo spent culture medium that has been discarded after embryo culture&#xD;
      without any interference on the pre-embryo neither any different deviation of standard&#xD;
      protocol of embryo manipulation. Furthermore, the evaluation by time-lapse technology will&#xD;
      let to document the main issues of embryo development, also without any deviation of the&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are waiting to find the value of hCG secreted by blastocyst as a potential marker of&#xD;
      embryo quality and ploidy status.&#xD;

      Embryo selection based on morphological and morphokinetic characteristics seems to be&#xD;
      insufficient to guarantee implantation. For this reason, in recent years, it has appeared new&#xD;
      embryo selection strategies to increase the success of assisted reproduction treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two subunits, alpha&#xD;
      and beta, non-covalently attached. It is secreted by the blastocyst trophoblastic cells and&#xD;
      because it is detectable in maternal blood shortly after embryo implantation and it can be&#xD;
      used as a pregnancy marker (Cole et al., 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, it has been believed that the only function of hCG was to stimulate the&#xD;
      secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum. Nowadays, we know that it also plays a key&#xD;
      role in the invasion, fusion of the endometrium by the blastocyst and the angiogenesis. In&#xD;
      addition, it has a paracrine role to induce trophoblast differentiation (Cole, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been proposed that its concentration would be linked to the time after&#xD;
      implantation and to the number of trophoblastic cells (Tanbo and Eskild, 2015). However, the&#xD;
      concentration of hCG shows considerable variations among embryos, and it has been postulated&#xD;
      that this could be due to differences in the implantation potential at the second week of&#xD;
      embryo development (Lopata and Oliva, 1993). Then, hCG could be a good marker in embryo&#xD;
      selection. In fact, it is already known that there is a higher secretion of hCG by those&#xD;
      blastocysts that present more adherence to the culture plate compare with those that do not&#xD;
      present it (Dokras et al., 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this hormone presents variants that change as the blastocyst grows. The early&#xD;
      embryos secreted more acidic variants than the more advanced ones (Lopata, 1997), and it has&#xD;
      recently been shown that the different isoforms correspond to different degrees of&#xD;
      glycosylation and metabolic degradation. The measurement of the concentration of these&#xD;
      isoforms can be indicate to predict embryo implantation (Butler et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all this, there are few studies published that measure the concentration of hCG in&#xD;
      the culture medium and most of them are published more than 15 years ago (Hay and Lopata,&#xD;
      1988; Lopata and Hay, 1989; Dokras et al., 1991; Lopata and Oliva 1993). This fact, together&#xD;
      with the need to optimize the embryo classification, makes us consider whether it could be a&#xD;
      good candidate as an embryo/aneuploidy selection marker.&#xD;
