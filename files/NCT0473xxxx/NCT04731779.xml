  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of 700 chemicals derived from the Cannabis sativa plant and is both&#xD;
      legal and widespread for distribution in the state of Vermont. The central hypothesis of this&#xD;
      proposal is that in apparently healthy adults, acute CBD favorably affects the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system and that this will be evident by an increase in heart rate variability. The&#xD;
      overall goal is to understand how CBD affects the autonomic and cardiovascular systems at&#xD;
      rest, and when perturbed. The investigators will study a narrow age range of adults,&#xD;
      administer varying acute doses of CBD, characterize baseline cardiovascular variables, and&#xD;
      record responses to autonomic challenge maneuvers. This will provide the framework to assess&#xD;
      potential therapies and/or risk factors of CBD, particularly as it relates to healthy&#xD;
      individuals. More information that is so widely taken, especially one that targets receptors&#xD;
      known to be involved in cardiovascular signaling pathways is imperative.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in the Exercise Physiology Laboratory in the Jeffords Science&#xD;
      Building at Castleton University. Participants will be asked to fast overnight, avoid&#xD;
      beverages or food containing caffeine, alcohol, or CBD for at least 12h, and to not perform&#xD;
      physical effort for 6h prior to each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial session, individuals will: have their height and body mass measured,&#xD;
      complete a health history questionnaire, and sign a consent form approved by Castleton&#xD;
      University's Institutional Review Board. Prior to data collection, individuals will be&#xD;
      advised of the possible risks, methods, and potential benefits of this study. They will also&#xD;
      be familiarized with the noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring equipment, which they will be&#xD;
      putting on themselves. These include an automated blood pressure (BP) cuff and a heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) chest strap monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of each experiment, participants will be given a standardized meal and asked to&#xD;
      put on the BP cuff and HR monitor. Individuals will remain seated for the length of the&#xD;
      experiment (doing nothing or reading). Baseline measurements will be taken remotely following&#xD;
      15 minutes of rest. Under supervision, participants will be asked to consume oral CBD oil&#xD;
      (0mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, or 200mg), infused in non-CBD containing MCT (medium-chain triglycerides)&#xD;
      oil to standardize dose volume of 3ml. Assessments will be measured remotely at intervals up&#xD;
      to 2.5 hours after ingestion. The study will be double-blind, thus neither the participant&#xD;
      nor researcher will be aware of the CBD dose for a particular session. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to return for 3 additional consecutive weeks, each session will be a different dose of&#xD;
      CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final experimental session (to be completed after initial analyses of dose responses),&#xD;
      participants will be given a standardized meal and asked to put on the blood pressure cuff&#xD;
      and HR monitors. Individuals will remain seated for the length of the experiment. Following&#xD;
      15 minutes of rest, participants will be asked to perform two autonomic stress tests: the&#xD;
      isometric hand grip test, and the cold face test. First, the maximum voluntary contraction&#xD;
      (MVC) for the isometric hand grip test will be assessed. Participants will be asked to press&#xD;
      a handgrip dynamometer with full strength. To perform the isometric handgrip test,&#xD;
      participants will again use the dynamometer and maintain handgrip at 30 percent MVC for 2&#xD;
      min. A recovery period of 10 minutes between each test will be observed. For the cold face&#xD;
      test, a cold compress (1-2 degrees Celcius) will be applied to the forehead and maxillary&#xD;
      region of the subjections face for 2 min. Following these baseline tests, participants will&#xD;
      be asked to consume a dose of CBD (determined following analyses of the initial 4 sessions)&#xD;
      and perform the two autonomic stress tests again 2h post ingestion.&#xD;
