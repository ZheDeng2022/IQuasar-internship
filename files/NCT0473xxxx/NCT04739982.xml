    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd edition (VABS-3) Socialization subscale of the Parent/Caregiver Comprehensive form will be administered online to the parents. Scores from the socialization domain of the VABS-III reflects one's functioning in social situations. The socialization subscale is up to 112 items depending on age and development, where raw scores are converted to IQ-type standard scores--v-scale scores (M=15, SD=3) where scores range from 1 to 24, and factor in age equivalents, growth scale values, and higher scores indicate better adaptive functioning.</description>
