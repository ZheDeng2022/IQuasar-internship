  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To pilot early community client-led ART (anti-retroviral therapy) delivery (CCLAD) in&#xD;
      Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Uganda and assess the feasibility and acceptability of this&#xD;
      intervention in this setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults accessing routine HIV testing in Nakivale Refugee Settlement will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. The study population will include adult refugees and Ugandan nationals of all&#xD;
      genders older than 18 years of age. Pregnant women will be invited but Maternal Health Clinic&#xD;
      will determine if they participate. Those that test positive for HIV will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the Early Community Client-Led ART Delivery group intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be offered research participation which will include an intake survey, an&#xD;
      HIV test, and the option to participate in early community client-led ART delivery (early&#xD;
      CCLAD) groups if diagnosed with HIV. Those interested in participating will have a consent&#xD;
      form read aloud to them by a Research Assistant before being tested for HIV. Consent forms&#xD;
      will be available in 4 languages: Runyankore, Kinyarwanda, Kiswahili and English, and will be&#xD;
      read by multi-lingual Research Assistants. These individuals will be told at the outset that&#xD;
      they can alternatively access free HIV testing at the outpatient department clinic if they&#xD;
      prefer to not participate in any aspect of the research. After consent but prior to HIV&#xD;
      testing, the investigators will conduct a baseline survey. This will include collection of&#xD;
      contact information, demographic information, physical assessment, migration patterns, HIV&#xD;
      testing history, perceived stigma, screening for mental disorders, and assessment of social&#xD;
      support. Like the consent process, the survey will be available in 4 languages: Runyankore,&#xD;
      Kinyarwanda, Kiswahili or English, and will be read aloud to participants with responses&#xD;
      entered directly into a passcode-protected electronic tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first meeting of each Early CCLAD group will include an HIV clinic clinician. The first&#xD;
      meeting is the one time in the intervention where participants will be compensated for their&#xD;
      transportation to the clinic or to the meeting site (20,000 USH will be provided for each&#xD;
      participant who attends this meeting). The HIV clinician, who will have been trained in the&#xD;
      Early CCLAD group intervention, will help individuals in the group to understand their roles&#xD;
      and responsibilities. The group will work together to plan future meeting dates and&#xD;
      locations. The participants will decide if they would like to support the person responsible&#xD;
      for picking up the ART each month (e.g. money, transportation, childcare, food). The&#xD;
      participants will specify which dates they will be responsible to attend HIV clinic and pick&#xD;
      up ART for the group. They will discern if they would like to identify a connecting activity&#xD;
      to be integrated into their group (e.g. exercise, faith, livelihood, craft). The participant&#xD;
      group will select a Team Leader to coordinate communication between the group and the&#xD;
      healthcare facility. Finally, an important part of this first meeting is that the HIV&#xD;
      clinician will conduct a standard comprehensive clinical exam and will refer each&#xD;
      person/participant for any necessary laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; meetings: The &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; intervention will require monthly group&#xD;
      meetings. This is intentionally more frequent than is suggested in the Ugandan Ministry of&#xD;
      Health guidelines (which recommends visits every 3 months) as this intervention will occur at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis rather than when a person is deemed &quot;stable&quot; in care. Before the&#xD;
      designated individual goes to clinic in any given month, they will be responsible for&#xD;
      connecting with each group member to ask about how they are feeling and to see if they have&#xD;
      any questions to ask of the HIV clinic staff. That individual will then attend HIV clinic and&#xD;
      communicate about the status of each group member. They will collect information from the&#xD;
      clinic and pre-packed ART for each group member. The &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; group will then meet at&#xD;
      their predetermined location so that the individual who attended clinic can share information&#xD;
      from the clinic and can distribute the ART to each person in the group. If a participant&#xD;
      misses a CCLAD group, they can present to the HIV clinic to pick up their ART refill if a&#xD;
      member of the group cannot arrange delivery or pickup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional clinic attendance: All participants assigned to an &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; group will be&#xD;
      expected to attend HIV clinic in person twice yearly for a clinical evaluation and a viral&#xD;
      load check. The HIV clinician will work with the team to decide if they prefer their twice&#xD;
      annual HIV clinic visits on the same day but individually, on the same day as a group, or&#xD;
      individually on different schedules from others in the group. Additionally, individuals will&#xD;
      attend clinic in person when they do not feel well, when they have any questions they prefer&#xD;
      to ask the clinicians directly, when additional laboratory testing is required, and when&#xD;
      requested by HIV clinic staff to optimize their medical care. In cases where the participants&#xD;
      are deemed clinically unstable and are in need of regular clinical follow up (e.g. develops&#xD;
      an opportunistic infection, develops other co-morbidity, has a viral load &gt; 1,000 copies/mL),&#xD;
      clients will be asked to attend the clinic monthly with the rotating group member collecting&#xD;
      group ART refill or to step in as the group member responsible for attending clinic that&#xD;
      month. Individuals &quot;Up referred&quot; by HIV clinic staff to monthly HIV clinic visits should&#xD;
      still participate in the &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; groups to receive psychosocial support and other&#xD;
      benefits of community group care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Option to stop the &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; group at any time: Participants can opt to stop Early CCLAD&#xD;
      participation at any time. If willing, they will be asked to participate in a brief exit&#xD;
      interview so the investigators can better understand what aspects of the intervention were&#xD;
      acceptable or not acceptable to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Early CCLAD&quot; groups and HIV clinic connectedness: To ensure the Early CCLAD intervention&#xD;
      participants remain well integrated into HIV clinic, the research staff will meet regularly&#xD;
      with the HIV clinic staff to update them on the intervention and to discuss specific problems&#xD;
      and specific individuals needing specialized care. Additionally, efforts will be made so that&#xD;
      participant HIV clinic files and pre-packed medications are ready for the visit of the&#xD;
      individual Early CCLAD group member each month. Finally, participants will be reminded&#xD;
      frequently that they are expected and welcome to attend clinic when they do not feel well or&#xD;
      when they have any questions or needs that are not being met through group care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data collection: Early CCLAD group participants will be given components of the&#xD;
      intake survey (i.e. to assess mental health screening, perceived stigma, and social support)&#xD;
      again 6-months after they began participation in the intervention. Some of this may occur in&#xD;
      an interview setting which is recorded and then later transcribed. Additionally, data will be&#xD;
      collected to assess retention in group care, ART medication pick-up, and HIV clinic outcomes.&#xD;
