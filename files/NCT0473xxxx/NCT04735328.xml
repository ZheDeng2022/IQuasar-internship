      The project will develop knowledge on how managers can lead the implementation of practices&#xD;
      that have proven to be effective for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in adult&#xD;
      specialized mental health services. Specifically, the project will examine the intervention&#xD;
      named the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI). This is an&#xD;
      empirically and theoretically based innovation for implementation leadership that aims to&#xD;
      support leaders in their organizational work of leading the implementation of EBPs in their&#xD;
      clinics. It is hypothesized that the implementation of LOCI will improve leaders' general&#xD;
      leadership qualifications, their implementation leadership qualifications, and the&#xD;
      implementation climate in the clinics. Further, the investigators hypothesize that training&#xD;
      in trauma screening will increase the amount of trauma screenings, moderated by the LOCI&#xD;
      implementation, and also that training in trauma treatment will increase the amount of&#xD;
      patients to be offered this kind of treatment, also moderated by the LOCI implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leadership for implementation require leadership that supports effective implementation&#xD;
      strategies at the organizational level. The Leadership and Organizational Change for&#xD;
      Implementation (LOCI) is a leadership training program focusing on enhancing general&#xD;
      leadership and implementation leadership in particular (Aarons, Ehrhart, Moullin, Torres, &amp;&#xD;
      Green, 2017). The aim of the project is to evaluate the implementation strategy used to&#xD;
      implement evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adult specialized mental health services in&#xD;
      Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) consists of several&#xD;
      components:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. 360° assessment A 360° assessment where the LOCI leaders, the therapists who report to&#xD;
      them, and the executive leader are asked to complete a web-based survey focused primarily on&#xD;
      the leadership of the LOCI leader and the implementation climate in his/her unit. Questions&#xD;
      to therapists and the executive leaders are worded so that they are reporting on the&#xD;
      appropriate LOCI leader. The LOCI leaders are asked questions about their own leadership,&#xD;
      climate in their clinic, and on the implementation citizenship of their therapists.&#xD;
      Descriptive results from the 360° assessment are presented in an individual feedback report&#xD;
      for each of the LOCI leaders in the LOCI condition. Each of the LOCI leaders will receive&#xD;
      their own feedback reports during the initial and follow-up leadership trainings, and they&#xD;
      will not be required to share it with anyone besides the research group. Feedback reports for&#xD;
      the executives will utilize data aggregated across all clinics within the respective health&#xD;
      trusts. Executives will be presented with their feedback reports at initial and follow-up&#xD;
      organizational strategy meetings (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leadership training 2.1 Training 2.1.1 Initial leadership training: The LOCI intervention&#xD;
      begins with a two-day workshop for the LOCI leaders. The workshop addresses leadership in&#xD;
      general, with a particular focus on the full-range leadership model, transactional&#xD;
      leadership, and implementation leadership. The LOCI leaders are challenged to share own&#xD;
      experiences and views on leadership, and examples of leadership styles are shared and&#xD;
      discussed. Implementation climate is also addressed, with a focus on strategies leaders can&#xD;
      use to support implementation of EBPs. Mid-way in the workshop at both day 1 and 2, the&#xD;
      feedback reports from the 360° assessment will be shared individually with each of the LOCI&#xD;
      leaders. The LOCI facilitator and the LOCI leader review the report together, identifying&#xD;
      strengths and areas they would like to further develop. In a collaborative method, the LOCI&#xD;
      facilitator and the LOCI leader draft that leader's individual leadership development plan&#xD;
      wherein goals and committed actions are detailed to facilitate enhancement in their&#xD;
      leadership and the implementation climate of their clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Booster leadership training: The leadership training is followed by a one day booster&#xD;
      session after 4 and 8 months. Before each booster session, a new 360° assessment will be&#xD;
      completed, resulting in updated feedback reports, where the data is presented in graphs so&#xD;
      that it is easy to see the development from the baseline assessment to the assessment at 4&#xD;
      and 8 months. The feedback report makes the basis for the leaders´ subsequent work with the&#xD;
      individual leadership development plan. Organizational strategies, goals, and leadership are&#xD;
      addressed through group discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.3 Graduation: At month 12, there will be a ritual to mark the completion of the program.&#xD;
      Accomplishments are celebrated, challenges are addressed, and plans for further sustainment&#xD;
      are shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Coaching calls with first-level leaders The LOCI leaders will participate in weekly brief&#xD;
      consultation calls over the phone (10-30 minutes) with their LOCI facilitator where the goals&#xD;
      are to give the leaders the opportunities to strategize methods for overcoming barriers to&#xD;
      EBP implementation; to follow up on the leadership development plan; and to update the&#xD;
      leadership development plan according to the work being done and new information. Once a&#xD;
      month the individual calls are replaced with one-hour group consultation calls with all the&#xD;
      LOCI leaders within the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Organizational strategy meetings (OSMs) LOCI leaders and executives meet with the LOCI&#xD;
      facilitator(s) for 2 hours following the first leadership training. At this meeting, the LOCI&#xD;
      leaders and executives will receive feedback from the 360° survey followed by the iterative&#xD;
      development of an implementation climate development plan in light of the results from the&#xD;
      survey. The subsequent meetings take place on a web conferencing platform at months 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The executive will participate in brief (15-30 minutes) monthly telephone coaching calls with&#xD;
      the LOCI facilitator where the focus is to follow up on the implementation climate&#xD;
      development plan in light of the results from the 360° survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based practices for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) During the project,&#xD;
      therapists will be trained in screening for and diagnosing PTSD, using evidence-based&#xD;
      assessment tools. In addition, two well-documented EBPs for PTSD will be implemented in&#xD;
      Norwegian specialized mental health services: 1) Eye Movement Desensitization and&#xD;
      Reprocessing (EMDR) is an integrative eight-phased approach which is guided by the Adaptive&#xD;
      Information Processing model (Shapiro &amp; Laliotis, 2015). 2) Cognitive Therapy for PTSD&#xD;
      (CT-PTSD) is based on a model assuming that PTSD develops if the traumatic event is processed&#xD;
      in a way that maintains the experience of serious current threat (Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel in all clinics will receive training (2-3 hours) in screening for trauma and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress symptoms. A sample of therapists will receive three days of training in&#xD;
      one of the specific practices (EMDR or CT-PTSD). The therapists will receive 10 hours of&#xD;
      group consultation divided by 2 hours once a month for 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective design will be used. All participating clinics will receive the same LOCI&#xD;
      intervention. The clinics will be allocated into groups of 6-7 clinics. Two groups will&#xD;
      receive LOCI from April 2020 till June 2021. Two groups will receive LOCI from April 2021&#xD;
      till June 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will consist of three groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First-level leaders will participate in the LOCI innovation and complete 360 degrees&#xD;
           surveys. In addition, executive leaders will participate in organizational structural&#xD;
           meetings to support first-level leaders, in addition to completing the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All therapists in the participating clinics will participate in the training of PTSD&#xD;
           screening and the surveys. A sample of therapists will be trained and supervised in PTSD&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients that are referred to the clinics as normal, report traumatic experiences and&#xD;
           fulfill the criteria for PTSD will be offered to participate in the study. They will&#xD;
           receive PTSD treatment, and complete surveys in connection with the treatment sessions.&#xD;
           The project aims at recruiting 12 mental health clinics in 2021 and 12 clinics in 2022&#xD;
           in specialized services from all over Norway. The clinics will be recruited via the four&#xD;
           regional health trust, which will receive an invitation by e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria Adult outpatient clinics in specialized health services are&#xD;
      included. All leaders and therapists in the clinics will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      surveys. Administrative personnel are excluded as most of the measures will not be applicable&#xD;
      to these staff. Staff must be employees of the participating clinics. Leaders that do not&#xD;
      agree to participate in the leadership training (LOCI) will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
      Patients (18-100 years) with PTSD will be asked to participate in the study by their&#xD;
      therapist. There are no specific exclusion criteria, as the referrals should follow standard&#xD;
      procedures within the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity Therapists will videotape (EMDR) or audiotape (CT-PTSD) all sessions in all cases.&#xD;
      Randomly chosen therapy sessions for each therapist will be checked for fidelity. Students&#xD;
      will be trained to assess five fidelity sessions per therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapists will receive written fidelity feedbacks as soon as possible after the session&#xD;
      has been video or audiotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management Data are collected from therapists, LOCI leaders, and&#xD;
      executives at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 months. The surveys are distributed by&#xD;
      e-mail. Participants are not given any compensation for their participation. The therapist&#xD;
      and LOCI leader survey takes on average 15-20 minutes to complete, whereas the executive&#xD;
      survey takes on average 10 minutes to complete. Results from some of the scales will be&#xD;
      shared with the LOCI leaders (MLQ, ILS, IC, EBPAS) and the executive leaders (IC, and EBPAS))&#xD;
      as part of the LOCI. Patients will fill out a questionnaire by iPad in connection with all&#xD;
      therapy sessions. It takes on average 30 minutes to complete. Patients can receive trauma&#xD;
      treatment even if they do not want to participate in the research. All data will be stored on&#xD;
      the University center for sensitive data. Results from some of the scales will be shared with&#xD;
      the therapist by a report function on the iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Implementation of EBP can be challenging. Leaders in the health care system have&#xD;
      the responsibility that the services provide effective treatments to a certain number of&#xD;
      patients within a given time period. In order to increase the probability that patients will&#xD;
      receive the most effective care for their symptoms, the leaders have to obtain effective&#xD;
      strategies to promote the adoption of the evidence-based treatment. The LOCI intervention&#xD;
      addresses leadership in general, implementation leadership in particular, and organizational&#xD;
      strategies in order to support the implementation of EBP and sustainment over time. Available&#xD;
      data suggest that LOCI is effective in supporting implementation of EBP through strengthening&#xD;
      leadership and a positive implementation climate (Aarons et al., 2017). This study will&#xD;
      examine the adaption of LOCI in a Norwegian mental health setting. We will examine whether&#xD;
      the LOCI will have an effect on leadership, the implementation climate at the clinics, and&#xD;
      the clinic´s ability to offer trauma-focused treatments to patients with elaborated levels of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress symptoms. The knowledge derived from this study can be used to support&#xD;
      the implementation of other EBPs within the mental health system.&#xD;
