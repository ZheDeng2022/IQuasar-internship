  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of T2DEx is to assess the feasibility, usability, acceptability, cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of a digital support service for people in North West London at high risk of&#xD;
      developing complications from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Type 2 Diabetes Exemplar Programme has been designed as a collaborative effort through&#xD;
      partners from the Discover-NOW Health Data Research Hub in North West London (NWL). The&#xD;
      remote care service is being used in primary care to demonstrate how data and technology can&#xD;
      improve health outcomes for people living with T2DM. The service has been designed via a&#xD;
      cross-industry collaboration between North West London Clinical Commissioning Groups (NWL&#xD;
      CCGs), AstraZeneca, Imperial College Health Partners and Huma. The service will be offered&#xD;
      for patients at high risk of developing complications from T2DM (such as heart attack and&#xD;
      stroke) and will combine video group consultations, remote monitoring via a smartphone app,&#xD;
      and educational content such as lifestyle and diet advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This service seeks to strengthen population health management by providing better-tailored&#xD;
      services and proactive interventions, particularly among population groups more at risk of&#xD;
      the adverse impacts of COVID-19. Mortality risk from COVID-19 is approximately 25% higher in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM and shielding has resulted in reduced primary care appointments for&#xD;
      patients with T2DM. This has created an immediate need for primary care to adapt to provide&#xD;
      care remotely to people with T2DM. Digital-first remote pathways could make care more&#xD;
      accessible while finding time and cost efficiencies. By combining video group consultations&#xD;
      and remote monitoring, we can inform the patient-clinician conversation making remote care in&#xD;
      group settings safer, efficient and more personalised.&#xD;

    <description>This study will create a matched control group using propensity score matching (PSM), a quasi-experimental method used to mimic the characteristics of a randomised control trial that has been shown to reduce biases. PSM uses statistical techniques to construct an artificial control group by matching each study participant with a non-treated participant of similar characteristics. PSM computes the probability that a person would enrol in a program based on pre-defined characteristics, giving a 'propensity score'.</description>

    <description>V. Digital remote patient monitoring using blood pressure and blood sugar devices in combination with a smartphone application ('the Huma app'). Participants are provided with home monitoring devices and download the Huma app. Participants are shown how to use the devices, how to input measurements into a smart phone and how to set personal goals. Data recorded via the Huma app is self-reported and includes activity data, diet information, blood glucose measurements, blood pressure measurements, weight, and the Diabetes Distress Scale (a self-reported questionnaire used to measure distress related to living with diabetes).</description>

    <description>Each patient is invited to attend a total of three VGCs during the 12-weeks lasting approximately one hour and 15 minutes each. Each session is facilitated by a Practice Nurse (PN) and consists of 6-10 people with T2DM. The self-reported Huma app (see below) and patient EPR data are used to populate a &quot;Discussion Dashboard&quot; which is used in each VGC to facilitate discussion. During the first VGC session, patient goals are discussed and adjusted in a group setting with topics relevant to their condition covered by the PN. Between each VGC session, patients spend time working on their goals and continuing to enter self-reported metrics into the Huma app. During the second and third VGC sessions, each patient is discussed, along with their performance against agreed goals. The PN also uses pre-prepared content to discuss topics relevant to managing diabetes (e.g., staying motivated, low carb diets).</description>
