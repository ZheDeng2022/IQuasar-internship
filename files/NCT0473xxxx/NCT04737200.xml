  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether modifying the timing of nutrition support&#xD;
      from overnight to daytime enhances sleep quality, preserves circadian rhythms, and improves&#xD;
      overall inflammation and cardiometabolic profiles in postoperative patients in the cardiac&#xD;
      surgical ICU on enteral nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) environments do not support sleep or preserve circadian rhythms of&#xD;
      postoperative critically ill patients. Among the contributing factors is the common practice&#xD;
      of administering nutrition support through feeding tubes overnight. The overall objective of&#xD;
      the study is to examine a novel dimension of clinical nutrition by determining whether&#xD;
      enhancing sleep quality and preserving robust circadian rhythms through daytime instead of&#xD;
      overnight feeds will attenuate inflammation and improve cardiometabolic profiles of&#xD;
      postoperative cardiac ICU patients on nutrition support. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      overnight nutrition support results in fragmented sleep and blunted circadian rhythms and&#xD;
      thus represent a modifiable mechanism exacerbating inflammation and cardiometabolic&#xD;
      derangements in postoperative cardiac patients. Results of this study will help in the&#xD;
      development of evidence-based, cost-efficient, and effective enteral nutrition timing&#xD;
      countermeasures against fragmented sleep, disrupted circadian rhythms, inflammation and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic derangements and potentially modify the current widespread practice of&#xD;
      overnight nutrition likely affecting 250,000 hospital admissions annually in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
