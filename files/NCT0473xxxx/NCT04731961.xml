  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine if a reduced injection site protocol (5&#xD;
      injection sites) using an equivalent amount of Botox provides comparable relief of Urgency&#xD;
      Urinary Incontinence (UUI) symptoms compared to the standard injection site protocol (15-20&#xD;
      injection sites). Our central hypothesis is that the 5-site injection protocol is&#xD;
      non-inferior in terms of relief of UUI symptoms compared to the standard injection site&#xD;
      protocol, measured by a non-inferior reduction in the number of UUI episodes per day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      English speaking women â‰¥21 years old with idiopathic refractory urgency urinary incontinence&#xD;
      who have failed first and second line treatment (life style modifications and antispasmodic&#xD;
      medications) who are undergoing a first injection of intra-detrusor Botox will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate in this study. Failure of first and second line treatment will be defined as&#xD;
      no improvement in urgency urinary incontinence episodes after trial of lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications and use of at least one antispasmodic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are planning to undergo her first intra-detrusor Botox procedure for refractory&#xD;
      idiopathic urgency urinary incontinence at the University of Virginia Pelvic Medicine and&#xD;
      Reconstructive Surgery clinic will be approached for inclusion into the study. A study&#xD;
      overview, as well as risks and benefits, will be reviewed with the patients. The patient will&#xD;
      be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. If she meets criteria and agrees to study&#xD;
      participation, she will be consented for study participation and the Botox injection&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving treatment, patients will complete a 3-day voiding diary and the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: Incontinence Impact Questionnaire short form (IIQ-7) and Urogenital Distress&#xD;
      Inventory short form (UDI-6) at the time of consent. As part of usual care, patients in both&#xD;
      arms will receive prophylactic antibiotics (oral nitrofurantoin or cephalexin) to complete&#xD;
      prior to the procedure date. On the day of treatment, patients will have a clean catch urine&#xD;
      specimen obtained and urine dip completed. Patients who have a positive urine dip will have&#xD;
      her procedure rescheduled to another day. A positive urine dip is defined as + leukocytes and&#xD;
      + blood in the presence of symptoms of urinary tract infection (dysuria, increased&#xD;
      urgency/frequency above baseline or hematuria). In this study, we will not offer patients&#xD;
      pre-procedure oral Valium as it may affect reporting of pain scores. Patients in both arms&#xD;
      will be prepared for the procedure in the same fashion: 50 cc of 1% lidocaine will be&#xD;
      instilled into the bladder at least 20 minutes prior to the procedure. Patients will then be&#xD;
      prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A 70-degree cystoscope will be inserted through&#xD;
      the urethra and into the bladder until the trigone is identified; the bladder will be&#xD;
      distended with approximately 200 mL sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 units of Botox will be mixed with 10 mL of Normal Saline for sterile injection into the&#xD;
      bladder. In the reduced protocol arm, a single row of 5 injections will be administered into&#xD;
      the detrusor muscle. In the standard protocol arm, 3 rows of 5 injections will be&#xD;
      administered into the detrusor muscle. In both arms, a final injection with 1 mL of normal&#xD;
      saline flush will be injected to remove any residual Botox from the injection needle. The&#xD;
      patient will be monitored for 20 minutes post procedure to ensure adequate ability to void&#xD;
      after treatment. Approximately 5 minutes post-procedure, patients will rate their pain&#xD;
      experienced during the procedure using a 100-point visual analog pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is unable to void post-procedure, she will be taught how to perform clean&#xD;
      intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) and provided with a log to record void and catheter&#xD;
      volumes. She will be called on a weekly basis by the study team to review&#xD;
      void/catheterization volumes and encouraged to discontinue when she has 2 successive&#xD;
      catheterization volumes of &lt;150 ml. This is in accordance with standard clinical care in our&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 weeks post procedure, patients in both treatment arms will be interviewed by phone to&#xD;
      report results of a 3-day voiding diary (Aim 1), complete the IIQ-7 and UDI-6 again, as well&#xD;
      as the OAB Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (OAB-SATq), Client Satisfaction Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CSQ-8)10, Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire and evaluate for&#xD;
      complications (Aim 2, Aim 3). The same evaluation process will be repeated at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of all questionnaires at the 4 timepoints (Pre-procedure, 2 weeks, 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months), patients will receive a $50 incentive for their time and participation.&#xD;
