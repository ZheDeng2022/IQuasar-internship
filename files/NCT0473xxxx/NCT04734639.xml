  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of iso-energetic energy deficits&#xD;
      induced by energy restriction alone or exercise + dietary restriction (Mixed deficit) on&#xD;
      energy intake and appetite feelings in adolescents with obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to an energy deficit of 500 kcal&#xD;
      induced once by dietary restriction alone and once by a mixed deficit (50% by exercise and&#xD;
      50% by dietary restriction) (compared with a control condition). 18 adolescents with obesity&#xD;
      will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control session (CON);&#xD;
      ii) one session with a dietary-induced energy deficit (Def-EI); iii) one session with a mixed&#xD;
      deficit (50% by exercise and 50% by dietary restriction) (Def-Mixed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be&#xD;
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>day 1, day 8, day 15</time_frame>
    <description>food intake will be measured ad libitum during a dinner buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software.</description>

    <description>Control condition without exercise / rest condition. The adolescents will be asked to remain quiet and at rest during the morning and will receive an ad libitum meal at dinner time.

    <description>Def-Mixed. Condition with an exercise-induced energy deficit The adolescents will received a calibrated lundh meal with a deduction of 250 kcal compared with the lunch meal of Con; and will be asked to realise an acute exercise set at 65% of their capacities (cycling) during the afternoon, inducing an energy expenditure of 250 kcal. Dinner will be served ad libitum. Their food reward will be assessed before dinner. Their appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals.</description>
