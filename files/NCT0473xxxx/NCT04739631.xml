  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the neurological efficacy of acupuncture in patients&#xD;
      with cancer who experienced peripheral neuropathy, which is induced by chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chemotherapy may lead to peripheral neuropathy up to 40% in cancer survivors,&#xD;
      especially in some types of patients with cancer. The effect of acupuncture, an ancient&#xD;
      Chinese medicine technique, was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the&#xD;
      treatment of several diseases. The postulated mechanisms associated with acupuncture in&#xD;
      analgesia or neurogenesis are still under investigation. Considering a moderate&#xD;
      recommendation for duloxetine in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      (CIPN) based on based on neuropathic pain, and a few treatment options with evidence for&#xD;
      CIPN, acupuncture might be another option. Nowadays, only small scale pilot studies provided&#xD;
      initial proof of acupuncture in CIPN, particularly in decreasing neuropathic pain and&#xD;
      improving neurotoxicity, the study aims to determine the beneficial effects of acupuncture on&#xD;
      CIPN with a large-scale, multicenter, randomized sham-controlled clinical trial. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the aim of the study will provide evidence for the clinical therapeutic guideline of CIPN in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;

    <measure>FACT-Neurotoxicity subscale(NtxS)</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be assessed before the first intervention in the first week, after the 12th intervention in the 4th week , after the 20th intervention in the 8th week, and the follow-up assessment in the end of the 12th week. Each intervention is one day.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the change FACT-Neurotoxicity subscale(NtxS) from baseline to 20 sessions at 8th weeks. The neurotoxicity subscale from the FACT/GOG-NTX-13(version 4) contains 13 items assessing numbness, tingling, and discomfort in the hands or feet, difficulty hearing, tinnitus, joint pain or muscle cramps, weakness, or trouble walking, buttoning buttons, or feeling small shapes when placed in the hand. Items are scored from 0-4 (0 = not at all; 4 = very much) and summed (total score range = 0-52). Since no published data are defining a cut-point for determining a clinically important change in the FACT/GOG Ntx score, we defined a 4 point change as a clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported CIPN-related neurotoxicity outcome . The authorized translated traditional Chinese version will be purchased in this study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of BPI-SF</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be assessed before the first intervention in the first week, after the 12th intervention in the 4th week , after the 20th intervention in the 8th week, and the follow-up assessment in the end of the 12th week. Each intervention is one day.</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome will be the change of average pain severity in BPI-SF from baseline to 20 sessions at 8th weeks. BPI-SF is an instrument used to evaluate the severity of pain, including neuropathic pain and the interference on the patients' daily functioning. Items are scored from 0 to 10 (0= no pain; 10= pain as bad as you can imagine). Since not all the patients feel pain in their daily life, we selected the participants who have average pain severity more than 4 points at baseline assessment into the final analysis. The authorized translated traditional Chinese version will be purchased in this study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The quantitative sensation of touch detection</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be assessed before the first intervention in the first week, after the 20th intervention in the 8th week, and the follow-up assessment in the end of the 12th week. Each intervention is one day.</time_frame>
    <description>The quantitative sensation of touch detection was used to test sensory levels and obtain objective data on the status of diminishing or returning sensibility. Touch detection was measured using von Frey monofilaments (Semmes-Weinstein Von Frey Aesthesiometer, Stoelting Co. 620 Wheat Lane, Wood Dale, IL, USA), with weights from 0.008 g to 300 g at 8 points. The measuring sites including the bases of the sole, tips of the big toe, palmar sides of hands, and the fingertips of the middle finger. The well-known up-down method applied to measure touch-detection thresholds.&#xD;
It will be assessed before the first intervention in the first week, after the 20th intervention in the 8th week, and the follow-up assessment in the end of the 12th week. Each intervention is one day. Each von-Frey test or questionnaire will be performed within seven days from each time point.</description>

    <description>The acupuncture group and the sham-controlled group will receive three therapeutic sessions each week for four weeks, and another two sessions each week for four weeks (a total of 20 sessions at eight weeks). Each group will be followed-up for four weeks, to evaluate the persistent efficacy of acupuncture.The needle set for the sham acupuncture group and the real acupuncture group will use the CASOON Acupuncture Needle (Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Company, limited), which needle size is 0.3 mm×30 mm. The depth of needling varied based on the patient's body sizes. After insertion, the needles were manually manipulated to obtain the De Qi sensation, which was defined as the acupuncturist feeling a tugging or grasping sensation from the needle manipulation and the patient feeling soreness, fullness, heaviness, or local distension at local needling sites.</description>
