  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explain the effect of food order/nutrient sequencing on&#xD;
      glycemic excursions over a 2 week period, utilizing a device known as a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitor (CGM), for people who have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and treated&#xD;
      with metformin. This research study is being done because recent studies demonstrate that&#xD;
      besides carbohydrate amount and type, the sequential order of macronutrient consumption&#xD;
      during a meal has a significant impact on post-meal glucose levels.&#xD;
