  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective surgical procedure for reducing knee joint pain&#xD;
      and improving the quality of life of patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. Although&#xD;
      advanced surgical techniques and prosthesis design are achieved, postoperative pain is a&#xD;
      significant factor that affects those patients who have undergone TKA with a satisfactory&#xD;
      outcome. The reasons for postoperative pain after TKA are somewhat unclear Although there are&#xD;
      studies evaluating the preoperative and postoperative conditions of the patients using pain&#xD;
      scores, these values differ greatly in patients who are suitable for the same procedure.&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that variability exists between individuals in basal pain&#xD;
      sensitivity, which is assessed using quantitative sensory testing To our knowledge, only one&#xD;
      study has investigated the pain condition using an algometer and postoperative pain and the&#xD;
      analgesic requirement on the day of surgery and during the postoperative period.Unlike the&#xD;
      above-cited study, in this study, we evaluated the effect of using a tourniquet on&#xD;
      early-stage pain and 1-year postoperative functional outcomes when patients were divided into&#xD;
      two groups according to the pain threshold.&#xD;

      This is a prospective double-blinded, randomized controlled trial diagnostic study conducted&#xD;
      at a single center from June 2018 to December 2019. Patients who underwent total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty due to end-stage knee osteoarthritis were asked to volunteer to participate in&#xD;
      this study. A prospective randomized study was conducted using a digital algometer to assess&#xD;
      the pain sensitivity for the relationship between postoperative early-stage pain score and&#xD;
      first-year functional scores in patients with or without using tourniquet who underwent&#xD;
      primary TKA. Patients were randomized to with or without tourniquet groups; a random number&#xD;
      generated by the research staff determined the group designation, independent of a senior&#xD;
      surgeon. T All participants in this study gave their written informed consent. Patients with&#xD;
      a neurological disorder, diagnosed with fibromyalgia, history of knee operation, valgus knee,&#xD;
      greater than 30Â° flexion contracture that had undergone bilateral knee arthroplasty or&#xD;
      revision knee arthroplasty, chronic analgesic users, and those with a psychiatric disease&#xD;
      were excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedure: All patients had anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the&#xD;
      bilateral knees, taken with a standard full-length weight-bearing the patients in bipedal&#xD;
      stance, the knees in maximal extension for anterior-posterior and 30-degree flexion for&#xD;
      lateral radiographs pre and postoperatively. In all patients, range of motion and&#xD;
      contractures of both knee joints were recorded. All patient's educational level was also&#xD;
      assessed. The pain threshold (PT) was evaluated using an analog algometer (Figure 1). The&#xD;
      pain sensitivity was measured on the forearm using two mechanical pain stressors, which&#xD;
      indicate which of an ascending sensory stimulus is first perceived as painful. This device is&#xD;
      a force gauge that is used to apply an increasing amount of force to the skin through a 1 cm2&#xD;
      surface area until the pain threshold is achieved. This algometer stimulates pain, described&#xD;
      as dull pressure at the pain threshold; the reliability and validity of this device have been&#xD;
      reported. The pain sensitivity of all measurement patients was taken on the day before the&#xD;
      surgery by the same author, and these values were blinded from another author who recorded&#xD;
      the repetitive postoperative VAS and knee scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation Procedure: All patients were operated on in a single-center and experiences in&#xD;
      arthroplasty practice. All the patients were operated on standard spinal anesthesia. All&#xD;
      patients underwent cruciate-retaining Genesis II knee arthroplasty (Smith and Nephew,&#xD;
      Memphis, TN, USA) with a midline incision and medial parapatellar approach with a fixed&#xD;
      bearing design. Patella resurfacing was not performed, while patellar denervation was&#xD;
      performed in all patients. Bone-cement (40 g) was used with a fourth-generation cementing&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pneumatic tourniquet was used before surgery at the proximal thigh and inflated before the&#xD;
      skin incision until skin closure in group 1 and no used in group 2. The tourniquet was&#xD;
      inflated to either 275 or 325 mmHg, depending on the patient's systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
      Peri-operative tranexamic (TXA) acid was administrated intravenously with 20 mg/kg 30 min&#xD;
      before surgery. Periarticular injection was not used for pain control in either group. An&#xD;
      adductor canal block or epidural analgesia was not applied. Intra-articular drainage was used&#xD;
      in every patient, which was removed after 24 h postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Management and Analgesic Procedure: On the day of surgery, intravenous&#xD;
      paracetamol 1 g was given at 8-h intervals, and intramuscular diclofenac sodium 75 mg and&#xD;
      intravenous tramadol 100 mg in 100 mL normal saline were given at 12-h intervals. This&#xD;
      analgesic procedure was continued at the time of discharge, and all patients were discharged&#xD;
      on the third day of surgery. Physical therapy was started on postoperative day 1 in all&#xD;
      patients. The functional assessments and range-of-motion were measured during routine&#xD;
      physical therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Assessment of Pain and Function: VAS score assessment was done at 24 h (rest),&#xD;
      36 h (post-physical therapy), and 48 h (rest) postoperatively. The Knee Society Clinical&#xD;
      Scoring System (KSS) was also used for evaluation of functional outcomes, which is a&#xD;
      condition-specific validated questionnaire widely used to evaluate the functional&#xD;
      capabilities of the knee joint before and after total knee arthroplasty. The KSS was done in&#xD;
      the first year postoperatively. The KSS consists of two parts. One part is the knee score&#xD;
      (KSS1), which includes pain (maximum 50 points), stability, total range of flexion, and other&#xD;
      items (varus, valgus, extension delay, and flexion contracture). The other part (KSS2) is the&#xD;
      function score, which has two components, walking capacity and stair-climbing ability and&#xD;
      deductions done if the patient using any assistive devices.&#xD;
