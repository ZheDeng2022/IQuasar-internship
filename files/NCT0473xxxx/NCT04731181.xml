  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a randomized clinical trial with parallel-group and allocation ratio (1:1). intervention&#xD;
      group: mobile application (little lovely dentist) control group: Tell-Show-Do technique. in&#xD;
      children aged 4-6 years who need local anesthesia for dental treatment during their first&#xD;
      dental visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Taking personal data, medical and dental history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnosis and determination of the required treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measuring preoperative anxiety using a pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate preoperative anxiety using RMS-pectorial scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Using the behavior guidance technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Allow the child to play the module simulating the required procedure.&#xD;
      Control group: tell-show-do technique is used to explain the procedure to the child 6)&#xD;
      Administration of local anesthesia with the observation of intraoperative signs of pain or&#xD;
      anxiety. 7) Measuring postoperative anxiety using the pulse oximeter. 8) Evaluate&#xD;
      postoperative anxiety using RMS-pectorial scale. 9) Evaluate postoperative pain using the&#xD;
      visual analog scale. 10) Asking the child and the parent about satisfaction. 11) Evaluation&#xD;
      of child behavior during the second dental visit using Venham's behavior rating scale and&#xD;
      Frankl behavior rating scale. outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ry: Pre and postoperative anxiety using Pulse oximeter and RMS-pectorial scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ry: Postoperative pain using Visual analog scale, Intraoperative assessment of pain and&#xD;
           anxiety by Observing the child, Child satisfaction by asking the child, Parent&#xD;
           satisfaction by asking the parent, Completion of treatment and Attitude during the&#xD;
           second dental visit using -Venham's behavior rating scale-Frankl behavior rating scale.&#xD;
           the study will be held in 2 visits.&#xD;

    <description>evaluation of child behavior during the second visit using Venham's behavior rating scale in a numerical unit using score 0-3 where, 0- Total cooperation, best working conditions, no crying, or physical protest.&#xD;
Mild, soft verbal protest or quiet crying as a signal of discomfort, but doesn't obstruct progress. Appropriate behavior for the procedure.&#xD;
Protest more prominent. Both crying and hand signals. May move head around making it hard to perform the treatment. Protest more distracting and troublesome. However, the child still complies with the request to cooperate.&#xD;
Protest presents a real problem to the dentist. Complies with demands reluctantly, requiring more effort by dentist + Body movement.</description>
