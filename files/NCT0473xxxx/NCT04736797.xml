      The aim of this longitudinal, observational study is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      gender-affirming hormone treatment in FTM (female to male) and MTF (male to female)&#xD;
      transgender (TG) people with regard to changes in brain structure and function as well as&#xD;
      psychological and behavioral consequences. Methodological problems and missing studies in&#xD;
      this area were mentioned several times with an emphasis on the need for longitudinal&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transgender (TG) is still a polarizing issue today. The lack of acceptance in society and&#xD;
      often even in one's own family, the feeling of a lack of identity and connection with one's&#xD;
      own body and the experienced discrimination all lead to a considerable degree of suffering in&#xD;
      TG and elevated levels of psychiatric symptoms as well as a reduced quality of life. Many TG&#xD;
      people seek hormonal treatment. Physical and psychological consequences of this treatment&#xD;
      still need to be revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this aim, the investigators recruit TG people (MTF and FTM) who intend to seek&#xD;
      gender-affirming hormonal treatment. Before treatment, various measures will be taken,&#xD;
      including a semi-structured interview to assess psychiatric symptoms, self-ratings,&#xD;
      behavioral experiments (to assess male/female face recognition and male/female voice&#xD;
      perception), while functional MRI scans are taken to assess respective neural correlates. In&#xD;
      addition, resting-state scans as well as anatomic images will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after having started gender-affirming hormone treatment, participants will be&#xD;
      reinvited to undergo the same study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between testing sessions, patients will perform several online surveys regarding their&#xD;
      psychological well-being.&#xD;
