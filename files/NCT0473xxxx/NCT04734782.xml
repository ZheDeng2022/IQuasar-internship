  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive transplacental immunity against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) appears to&#xD;
      mediate infant protection during the first 6 months of life (1). Observations of&#xD;
      environmental exposure in pregnant women during an RSV epidemic could influence these&#xD;
      children's susceptibility to infection by offering levels of antibodies that are transferred&#xD;
      to the fetus. However, there is no prospective study in the population at risk such as&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease, as well as the effective levels of anti-RSV&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) as protective biomarkers for RSV infection after delivery (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most serious evolution of the clinical disease of acute RSV bronchiolitis in children&#xD;
      under 6 months of age is related to lower exposure of the pregnant woman to the RSV epidemic.&#xD;
      With maternal immunization through natural exposure, it is logical to relate protection to&#xD;
      children for severe RSV disease. However, it is not proven (3).&#xD;

      A prospective cohort study of mothers with a prenatal diagnosis of a fetus with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease will be carried out. To whom titers will be measured. Anti-RSV IGG antibodies&#xD;
      result from previous exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the IGG titers in anti-RSV serum, 2 groups will be formed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective Mothers (high IGG titers) Non-protective mothers (low IGG titers) The products&#xD;
      will be followed up for 6 months after birth to correlate the maternal titers of Ac anti-RSV&#xD;
      with the presence and severity of respiratory infection by RSV (Bronchiolitis) in this&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women evaluated in the National Medical Center 20 de Noviembre, Pediatric Cardiology&#xD;
      service for the prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease in their fetuses. Newborns&#xD;
      with corroborated congenital heart disease with prenatal diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion period February 1, 2021, to October 30, 2021. Study follow-up period March 1&#xD;
      2021 to December 30 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample type: Non-randomized, for convenience, sequential and with an estimated of 30 patients&#xD;
      per group.&#xD;
