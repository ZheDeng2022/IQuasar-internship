      PK, and preliminary efficacy of LM-061 in subjects with advanced tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule includes screening visit (28 days prior to accept the investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP)), treatment visit (accept IMP for the first time to the end of&#xD;
      treatment (EOT)/early withdrawal), and follow-up visit (28 days after the EOT/early&#xD;
      withdrawal).&#xD;

             requires clinical intervention, grade Ⅱ-Ⅲ atrioventricular block, etc.;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thromboembolic events requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, or subjects with venous&#xD;
             filters;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  According to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) standards, subjects with grade&#xD;
             III~IV cardiac insufficiency;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, aortic dissection, stroke or other&#xD;
             cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events of grade 3 or above occurred within 6 months&#xD;
             before the first administration of IMP;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically uncontrollable hypertension (blood pressure cannot be controlled at&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg after standard&#xD;
             antihypertensive treatment);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or arrhythmia, such as heart&#xD;
             failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, use of any concomitant drugs that&#xD;
             are known or may prolong the QT interval (see Appendix 3 for details);&#xD;
