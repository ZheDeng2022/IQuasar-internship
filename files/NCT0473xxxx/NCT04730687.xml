    <textblock>
      In this study, 940 nm diode laser and 2780 nm erbium, chromium doped: yttrium, scandium,&#xD;
      gallium, garnet (Er, Cr: YSGG) laser were used in the non-surgical treatment of peri-implant&#xD;
      diseases in addition to mechanical treatment. And the effects of dental lasers on clinical&#xD;
      parameters and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitors of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) levels in peri-implant crevicular fluid were evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the widespread use of dental implants, there is an increase in technical and biological&#xD;
      complications. These complications are called peri-implant diseases in general terms. When&#xD;
      peri-implant diseases are not treated, a process that progresses to the loss of the affected&#xD;
      implant may develop, but there is still no accepted consensus on their treatment.When&#xD;
      performing treatment procedures, it is recommended not only to remove inflamed tissues but&#xD;
      also to decontaminate infected implant surfaces.Recently, with the development of laser&#xD;
      technologies, the use of dental lasers in implant surface detoxification has come to the&#xD;
      fore. Dental lasers attract increasing attention due to their anti-infective properties, easy&#xD;
      handling and haemostatic effects against periodontal pathogens.Diode lasers attract attention&#xD;
      with their safety when used directly on the implant surface, soft tissue penetration,&#xD;
      antibacterial and biostimulating properties. They detoxify implant surfaces by killing&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria through photothermal effects and neutralizing bacterial endotoxins.&#xD;
      Erbium lasers also show promising results in implant treatment due to their advantageous&#xD;
      properties such as soft and hard tissue ablation and decontamination. Er, Cr: YSGG lasers&#xD;
      have the ability to debride microstructured surfaces of dental implants without causing&#xD;
      mechanical damage, thanks to their ability to work with water.Today, many researchers&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of dental lasers in the treatment of peri-implant diseases, but&#xD;
      it has not yet been proven whether they have an additional contribution. It is observed that&#xD;
      studies mostly focus on clinical parameters. However, it is stated that periodontal probing&#xD;
      and radiographs, which are used as common diagnostic methods, may give erroneous results.&#xD;
      These methods refer only to pre-existing destruction rather than current disease activity. A&#xD;
      model predicting the course of peri-implant disease has not yet been defined, but biomarkers&#xD;
      may offer considerable potential for disease activity.Biomarkers are widely used in medicine&#xD;
      to objectively determine disease state or responses to a therapeutic intervention. Gingival&#xD;
      fluid (GCF) biomarkers have moderate diagnostic validity in periodontitis. It is stated that&#xD;
      biomarkers in peri-implant groove fluid (PICF) also give promising results in terms of&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognostic values. MMP-8 and MMP-9, the two main collagen degrading enzymes in&#xD;
      GCF, are secreted from neutrophils during disease activation and are responsible for&#xD;
      extracellular matrix degradation. TIMP-1, a major inhibitor of MMPs, has been reported to be&#xD;
      released at high levels in inflamed gums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature review, it has been observed that there are quite a limited number of human&#xD;
      clinical studies investigating the effect of dental lasers of different wavelengths on&#xD;
      treatment results in the treatment of peri-implant disease at the clinical and molecular&#xD;
      level. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of 940 nm diode laser and 2780 nm&#xD;
      Er, Cr: YSGG laser-assisted non-surgical mechanical treatment on clinical parameters and&#xD;
      MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels in PICF in individuals with peri-implant disease.&#xD;
