  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b/2a study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety of an investigational product called ATR-04, to reduce the&#xD;
      severity of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) associated papulopustular rash&#xD;
      on the face. This study will be performed at 10-12 clinical sites, with potentially a virtual&#xD;
      component. Approximately 60 eligible subjects will participate. A subject's participation in&#xD;
      the study will be up to a maximum of 86 days (up to 28 days for Screening, 28 days of BID&#xD;
      treatment, and a 30 day no treatment follow-up period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATR-04&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b/2a study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety of an investigational product called ATR-04 to reduce the&#xD;
      severity of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) associated papulopustular rash&#xD;
      on the face. This study will be performed at 10-12 clinical sites, with potentially a virtual&#xD;
      component. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter a screening period for up&#xD;
      to 28 days to determine eligibility prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60 eligible subjects, will be randomized to receive ATR-04 or a placebo, in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, subjects will be instructed on study medication administration technique, the first&#xD;
      application by the subject will be observed in person, via telehealth or via video connection&#xD;
      and the subject will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) for at least 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform twice daily (BID) study assigned medication applications for 28 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will have in person or virtual visits throughout the study. Subjects will return all&#xD;
      study materials (i.e. diary cards, and study medication containers, swabs) either in person&#xD;
      or via mail on Day 29 for their End of Treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 1, subjects will be assessed for safety. In addition, subjects' faces will&#xD;
      be examined and assessed utilizing the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) in person or via&#xD;
      a virtual visit. Subjects will complete the Quality of Life (QoL) tool and standardized&#xD;
      digital photographs will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's participation in the study will be up to a maximum of 86 days (up to 28 days for&#xD;
      Screening, 28 days of BID treatment, and a 30 day no treatment follow-up period).&#xD;
