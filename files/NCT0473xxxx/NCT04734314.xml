      This randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effect of Vojta method on balance and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients (male and female) complaining of chronic non -specific low back pain was&#xD;
      recruited to share in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The recruited patients were randomly recruited into two groups; group A (control group) and&#xD;
      group B (study group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: received conventional treatment of back pain which included; TENS 20 min and hot&#xD;
      packs 10 min .The total treatment session is 30 min three session per week for four weeks&#xD;
      Group B: received conventional treatment of back pain in addition to Vojta method. The total&#xD;
      treatment session is 40 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient in both groups performed 10 sessions, 3 session per week&#xD;

    <description>static and dynamic balance can assessed by using biodex balance system Each patient was instructed to maintain his/her balance for the period of the test.&#xD;
There was report gained after finishing every test includes information on medial lateral stability index(MLSI), overall stability index(OSI), and anterior posterior stability index (APSI) measurements will done twice before and after treatment for all patients in both group</description>

    <description>The Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability and quality of life. The test is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools measurements will done twice before and after treatment for all patients in both group</description>

    <description>Vojta Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is a therapy used to manage neurological and musculoskeletal conditions each patient in the study group (group B) was instructed to lie prone on an examination table with the participant's shoulders abducted, elbows flexed approximately 80-90Â°, and the forearms hanging off the edge of the table. Pressure-like stimulation of the calcaneus and ASIS were performed in the postural position named by Vojta as &quot;reflex creeping.&#xD;
Each patient received 12 sessions three session per week.</description>
