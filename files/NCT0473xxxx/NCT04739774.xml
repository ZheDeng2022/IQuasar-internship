  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposed study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics interaction&#xD;
      between CHF6001 as substrate and Itraconazole as inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 in a drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a single centre, single dose Phase I study, with a non-randomized,&#xD;
      open label, one sequence cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 healthy male and female are planned to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be dosed with CHF6001 before and during co-administration of Itraconazole&#xD;
      and will act as their own control. The study will be run with a one-sequence crossover&#xD;
      design, where all subjects will be treated with CHF6001 in the first treatment period and&#xD;
      CHF6001+Itraconazole in the second treatment period in order to avoid the need of a very long&#xD;
      washout from the CYP3A4/5 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard safety assessments will be conducted during the Study, including safety blood and&#xD;
      urine laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs and observations of any&#xD;
      adverse events. Blood samples will be also collected for PK analysis.&#xD;
