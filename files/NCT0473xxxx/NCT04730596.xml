  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Cataract surgery is commonly performed in elderly patients who are at high risk for&#xD;
           developing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Most cataract surgeries are performed&#xD;
           under peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia, however, most of the patients require&#xD;
           sedation to relieve the perioperative anxiety and induce amnesia. So, many sedative&#xD;
           agents can be used especially benzodiazepines which may increase the risk of developing&#xD;
           postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketamine can be used as a sedative and analgesic agent in a dose of 0.25 -0.5 mg/kg with&#xD;
           certain studies suggesting that it may decrease the risk of postoperative cognitive&#xD;
           dysfunction. Similarly, dexmedetomidine can be used as a sedative and analgesic agent&#xD;
           with the possibility of decreasing the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  this controlled study will compare the effect of ketamine or dexmedetomidine on the POCD&#xD;
           of patients undergoing cataract surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a common postoperative complication in elderly&#xD;
           patients. Despite the role of the risk of anesthesia and/or surgery in developing&#xD;
           postoperative cognitive dysfunction, it can be developed even with surgeries performed&#xD;
           under local or regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ageing is the most common risk factor for developing postoperative cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
           that can affect memory and speech. Also, impaired vision may be another important risk&#xD;
           factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cataract surgeries can be considered the most common surgery performed in elderly&#xD;
           patients. It is usually performed under local anesthesia (peribulbar, retrobulbar, or&#xD;
           sub-tenon blocks), however, sedation is usually required to relieve the anxiety of the&#xD;
           patients and induce amnesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  there are many sedative agents that can be used with such patients, the most commonly&#xD;
           used are benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines use may increase the incidence of&#xD;
           postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketamine, the dissociative anesthetic, acts mainly through inhibition of NMDA receptors&#xD;
           that reduce the neuronal loss of the cortex. it may attenuate the postoperative&#xD;
           cognitive dysfunction and induce neuroprotective effect through suppressing the&#xD;
           inflammatory response and minimizing cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dexmedetomidine is a sedative and analgesic agent that have the advantage of minimal&#xD;
           respiratory depression and can be used as a sedative agent in cataract surgery. Studied&#xD;
           revealed that its sedative analgesic effect is not associated with changes in memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This randomized controlled double-blinded study will be carried upon 90 elderly patients&#xD;
           undergoing cataract surgery under peribulbar anesthesia where they will be classified&#xD;
           into 3 groups: - Group I (Placebo Group). Where the patients will receive normal saline&#xD;
           as a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (Ketamine group). Where patients will receive ketamine in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in&#xD;
      physiological solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III (Dexmedetomidine group). where patients will receive dexmedetomidine in a dose of&#xD;
      0.5 ug/kg in a physiological solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary outcome will be the incidence of POCD, the secondary outcomes will be the&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes and the changes in the intraocular pressure.&#xD;
