      Single centre prospective cohort phase II study of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging in patients&#xD;
      with biochemically recurrent or high-risk prostate cancer. Safety, biodistribution, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, and diagnostic accuracy will be assessed. For diagnostic accuracy comparison will&#xD;
      be made to a contemporary (within 10 days) conventional imaging study (bone scan and CT&#xD;
      scan).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single centre prospective cohort phase II study of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging in specific&#xD;
      patient populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of radical prostatectomy for treatment of&#xD;
           prostate cancer, and a serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 0.2 µg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or&#xD;
           brachytherapy for treatment of prostate cancer, and a serum PSA progressively rising to&#xD;
           ≥ 2 µg/L (minimum two samples) OR a serum PSA doubling-time of &lt; 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with a history of biopsy-proven prostate cancer and&#xD;
           high-risk features for metastatic disease prior to treatment with radical prostatectomy,&#xD;
           radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or brachytherapy. High-risk features include a Gleason score&#xD;
           &gt; 7, serum PSA &gt; 20 µg/L, OR minimum clinical T-stage T2c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a comparison conventional imaging study performed within 10 days of&#xD;
      the investigational PET/CT scan. The conventional imaging study will include a 99mTc -MDP&#xD;
      bone scan including whole body planar imaging (top of skull to toes) as well as SPECT/CT&#xD;
      imaging of the trunk (including clavicles to pelvis). In the absence of contraindications&#xD;
      (renal failure with eGFR &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2 or history of IV contrast allergy), all scans&#xD;
      will include an IV-contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In the&#xD;
      presence of contraindications to IV contrast, a non-IV contrast enhanced CT scan of the&#xD;
      chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biodistribution of 18F-PSMA-1007 produced by the Edmonton PET Centre will be evaluated in&#xD;
      2 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  by comparing the biodistribution of tracer on the scans to an expected normal&#xD;
           distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for any identified abnormal distribution, a lesion-by-lesion comparison to the&#xD;
           conventional imaging study will be performed with lesions classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A - lesion identified on the investigational imaging study but not on the&#xD;
                conventional imaging study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  B - matching lesions on both the investigational and conventional imaging studies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C - lesion identified on the conventional imaging study but not on the&#xD;
                investigational imaging study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical efficacy of 18F-PSMA-1007 will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • a follow-up questionnaire will be sent to referring clinicians 6 months after the scan to&#xD;
      determine if the scans were of perceived clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of 18F-PSMA-1007 produced by Edmonton PET Centre will be evaluated in 3 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patients will be screened for adverse effects immediately post-injection as well as&#xD;
           after the scan (approximately 2.5 hours after injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patients will be provided an information sheet and contact information for&#xD;
           self-reporting of delayed adverse events (1-7 days post injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a 6 month follow-up questionnaire will be sent to referring clinicians to determine if&#xD;
           there were any perceived adverse events related to the injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic accuracy of 18F-PSMA-1007PET/CT produced by Edmonton PET Centre will be&#xD;
      evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All lesions categorized as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, or &quot;C&quot; will be compared with a reference standard&#xD;
           to determine sensitivity and specificity on both a per lesion and per patient level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reference standard will be defined a minimum of 1 year after completion of both&#xD;
           scans based on available clinical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesional histopathology results will be used as the reference standard when available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When pathology is unavailable, criteria for determining lesional positivity for&#xD;
           metastatic disease will be based on recently published methodology (Lawhn-Heath et al.,&#xD;
           AJR 2019;213:1-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If lesion the criteria for determining lesion positivity are not met, the lesion will be&#xD;
           considered unevaluable and will be excluded from assessment of accuracy&#xD;
