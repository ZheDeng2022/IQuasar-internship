      LIMITFOOD is a randomized clinical intervention study that investigates the effects of two&#xD;
      different intermittent fasting protocols compared to a control group on the health of normal-&#xD;
      and overweight adults. A total of 72 participants will be randomized into three equally sized&#xD;
      groups: an alternate day fasting, a time-restricted feeding and a control group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight has risen considerably all over the world in the past century.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have shown that, starting from a body mass index of 20-21 kg/m2,&#xD;
      increasing BMI levels are associated with progressively increased risks of developing&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer and other diseases. The problem is&#xD;
      pronounced by the unlimited and constant availability of food. Treatment of overweight is&#xD;
      still difficult and finding effective and more personalized strategies to manage these&#xD;
      conditions is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent fasting has been suggested as an alternative way to address these problems.&#xD;
      Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves rotating periods of eating and&#xD;
      fasting. Animal studies and previous human clinical trials have provided evidence that&#xD;
      various types of intermittent fasting lead to weight loss and improved health markers not&#xD;
      only in obese, but also in healthy, non-obese adults.There are several types of intermittent&#xD;
      fasting. The most popular version is time-restricted feeding (TRF), which allows ad libitum&#xD;
      (at one's pleasure) energy intake within a defined period of time each day (6-12h). Another&#xD;
      subtype of IF is called alternate day fasting (ADF). ADF is defined as 'feast days' on which&#xD;
      food is consumed ad libitum, which alternate with 'fast days' on which food is withheld or&#xD;
      reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the growing popularity of intermittent fasting, it is not clear which type&#xD;
      of IF is most effective and what fasting window is needed to induce beneficial effects.&#xD;
      Additionally, tools to longitudinally track personal progress of dieting are lacking.&#xD;
      Therefore, the main objective of this study is to compare the effects of each of two&#xD;
      different intermittent fasting protocols (TRF and ADF) on metabolic parameters to a control&#xD;
      group. Furthermore, a new dynamic measurement technique, using breath analysis, will allow to&#xD;
      better monitor the progress of individual participants.&#xD;
