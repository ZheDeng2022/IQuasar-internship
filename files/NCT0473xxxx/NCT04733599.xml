  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how much pain intensity is affected by high frequency&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation therapy in individuals with serious brachial plexus injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-site prospective observational cohort study will include all adults (&gt; 18 years&#xD;
      old) with brachial plexus avulsion injury who are candidates for high frequency (HF10) spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation (SCS). We plan to prospectively observe patients who undergo implantation of&#xD;
      HF10 SCS for the indication of chronic neuropathic pain of the upper limb following brachial&#xD;
      plexus avulsion injury.&#xD;
