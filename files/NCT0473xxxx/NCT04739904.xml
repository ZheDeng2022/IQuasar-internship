  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced Hypoxic Ventilatory Response (HVR) and systemic O2 saturation subsequently leading to&#xD;
      blunted aerobic capacity as well as decreased overall physical and cognitive performance are&#xD;
      the main physiological challenges faced by prematurely born individuals in hypobaric hypoxia&#xD;
      (i.e. during high altitude sojourn). While these phenomena have been described previously,&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms are currently unresolved. Given that the reduction in&#xD;
      altitude-performance and its underlying mechanisms are not well understood, it is currently&#xD;
      impossible to give evidence-based recommendation for altitude sojourns in this cohort. It is&#xD;
      also of note, that even hypobaric hypoxia exposure during long-haul flights might be&#xD;
      detrimental to well-being of pre-term born individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims to comprehensively investigate physiological responses to&#xD;
      altitude/hypoxia during rest and exercise in prematurely born, but otherwise healthy adults.&#xD;
      Specifically, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the altered resting and&#xD;
      exercise cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebral and hematological responses to hypoxia in&#xD;
      prematurely born individuals. The obtained results from this cohort will be compared to the&#xD;
      data from a control groups consisting of healthy, age and aerobic capacity-matched&#xD;
      individuals born at full-term. While acute hypoxic effects will be the focus of the project's&#xD;
      first phase, we will test the effect of prolonged terrestrial (real) or simulated (normobaric&#xD;
      hypoxia) altitude exposures in the second part. This phase will, in addition to the insight&#xD;
      into the prolonged altitude acclimatization modulation in prematurely born individuals, also&#xD;
      enable us to investigate the potential differences between the effects of normobaric&#xD;
      (simulated) and hypobaric (terrestrial) hypoxia in this cohort.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in the rate of muscular oxygen consumption (mV̇O2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before each exercise bouts.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle oxygen consumption will be assessed using a previously validated protocol. Briefly, a Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) optode will be placed on the vastus lateralis muscle. Before the protocol, an ischemic calibration will be performed to normalize the NIRS signals by inflating the blood pressure cuff to 250-300 mmHg for a maximum of 5 min. Resting mV̇O2 will be assessed from the decrease in muscle oxygenation which accompanies the arterial occlusion. Four resting measurements will be performed using 10 sec of arterial occlusion. Then, each subject will perform a voluntary knee extension exercise for 15 sec. To measure the recovery of oxygen consumption after exercise, subject will have a series of arterial occlusion as follows: 5 occlusions 5sec on-5sec off, 5 occlusions 5sec on-5sec off, and 8 occlusions 10 sec on-20 sec off.</description>

    <measure>Changes in endothelial capacity to flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after exposure to normoxia and hypobaric hypoxia.</time_frame>
    <description>A pneumatic cuff is positioned distal to the ultrasound probe in order to avoid ischemia of the artery studied. Radial artery diameter is measured at rest, during inflation of the distal cuff to suprasystolic pressure (5 min) and for the 5 min following deflation. The subsequent decrease in local blood flow in response to ischemia causes a progressive decrease in the radial artery diameter until a plateau (L-FMC). Upon cuff deflation, the increased blood flow causes radial artery dilatation. L-FMC is calculated as the percentage decrease in arterial diameter in the last 30 s of cuff occlusion as compared with resting diameter. FMD is calculated as the maximum percentage increase in arterial diameter following cuff deflation.</description>
