  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DILAPAN-S® was FDA-approved for pre-induction cervical ripening in 2015. Since that time,&#xD;
      there have been limited studies comparing its efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction to&#xD;
      other mechanical cervical ripening techniques. The purpose of this trial is to perform a&#xD;
      noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing DILAPAN-S® to the Foley catheter for&#xD;
      outpatient cervical ripening in term elective labor inductions, examining time spent on the&#xD;
      labor and delivery unit, patient safety, and patient satisfaction feedback.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, Grobman et al, published the ARRIVE trial showing that labor inductions without&#xD;
      medical indication at 39 weeks gestation are associated with improved maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes compared to expectant management.1 In the wake of these landmark findings, labor&#xD;
      inductions without medical indication are becoming increasingly common not only on a nation&#xD;
      scale, but locally as well. Recent data show that labor inductions without medical indication&#xD;
      encompass nearly one third of all inductions at Christiana Care Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labor induction can include both mechanical and pharmacological measures to ripen the cervix&#xD;
      and stimulate uterine contractions. The ultimate challenge, which has been the focus of&#xD;
      numerous studies to date, is to determine which mechanical and/or pharmacological products&#xD;
      and which clinical settings are safest and most efficacious for inducing labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, transcervical Foley catheters are the gold-standard mechanical method of cervical&#xD;
      ripening. However, new-emerging data has shown that hygroscopic cervical dilators,&#xD;
      traditionally used for early pregnancy termination, may be a viable alternative. DILAPAN-S® ,&#xD;
      a hygroscopic dilator composed of a synthetic hydrogel was approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for cervical ripening in 2015 and has been the subject of recent&#xD;
      investigation. In a single-center, randomized, open-label trial consisting of 419 patients,&#xD;
      Saad et al showed that DILAPAN-S® is not inferior to the Foley catheter for pre-induction&#xD;
      cervical ripening at term; there was no significant difference in maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      adverse events and patients with DILAPAN-S® were more satisfied than patients with the Foley&#xD;
      catheter as far as sleep, relaxing time, and performance of desired daily activities.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the pursuit of improving patient satisfaction with consideration of&#xD;
      healthcare resources, studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of outpatient&#xD;
      mechanical cervical ripening.3 Sciscione et al, showed that in a low-risk population of 1,905&#xD;
      patients, no adverse outcomes were associated with outpatient Foley catheter cervical&#xD;
      ripening and patients on average avoided 9.6 hours of hospitalizations compared to the&#xD;
      inpatient group.4 The ACOG practice bulletin on induction of labor now states that outpatient&#xD;
      cervical ripening, particularly mechanical methods, may be appropriate in select patients.5&#xD;
      Based on the literature cited above, it is plausible to hypothesize that DILAPAN-S® used for&#xD;
      outpatient cervical ripening may optimize patient satisfaction and healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization without compromising patient safety and efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      perform a noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing DILAPAN-S® to the Foley catheter&#xD;
      for outpatient cervical ripening in term elective labor inductions, examining time spent on&#xD;
      the labor and delivery unit, patient safety, and patient satisfaction feedback.&#xD;

Specific number of pieces always depends on decision and clinical judgement of physician and indications.
