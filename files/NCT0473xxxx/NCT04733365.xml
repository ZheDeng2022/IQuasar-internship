      An aerobic physical exercise protocol will be applied to patients admitted in ward due to&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure, in order to validate the efficacy and safety of physical&#xD;
      exercise in this phase of clinical stabilization, through the said training protocol - ERIC&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the objective of validating the efficacy and safety of physical exercise as a&#xD;
      therapeutic resource in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure; will be applied,&#xD;
      by rehabilitation nurses, a protocol of physical exercise, with increasing levels of&#xD;
      intensity. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized through an online&#xD;
      program (randomizer.org) and the ERIC protocol will be applied to the test group. The control&#xD;
      group will be implemented the usual care of rehabilitation nursing. The ERIC protocol&#xD;
      comprises 5 levels of intensity, as following shown:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - respiratory and calisthenic exercises (5-10 minutes) Stage 2 - pedaler for 5-10&#xD;
      minutes Stage 3 - aerobic training: walking on the corridor for 5-10 minutes Stage 4 -&#xD;
      aerobic training: walking on the corridor for 10-15 minutes Stage 5 - aerobic training:&#xD;
      walking on the corridor for 15 minutes + climbing stairs for 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored and followed up by a rehabilitation nurse while they are doing&#xD;
      the exercise. The investigator decides, depending on the patient's performance and clinical&#xD;
      conditions, the form of progression in the program, but it is mandatory to follow the&#xD;
      previously defined levels of intensity. Patients in the test group may start the program only&#xD;
      on stage I or II according to clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission of the patients (test group and control group) clinical and sociodemographic&#xD;
      parameters are evaluated, as well as data related to Barthel's indices and London Chest of&#xD;
      activities of daily living (LCADL). At the discharge date, the Barthel index and the LCADL&#xD;
      scale will also be evaluated, as well as the 6-minute walking test.&#xD;
