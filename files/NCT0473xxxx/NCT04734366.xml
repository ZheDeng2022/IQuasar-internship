  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery rates in Turkey as well as all over the world are increasing. Recent data&#xD;
      in Turkey shows that the value of cesarean delivery rate reached 53%. This worldwide increase&#xD;
      causes new concerns. Incomplete healing of the uterine scar after cesarean is a complication&#xD;
      with potential long-term consequences. There is evidence that the risk of uterine scar&#xD;
      defects is associated with the number of previous cesarean deliveries and the method of&#xD;
      uterotomy closure. Study was designed as prospective randomized clinical trial to analyze the&#xD;
      effects of two different uterine suture techniques. The investigators aim is to compare the&#xD;
      closure of the incision with the &quot;baseball&quot; suture technique and the single-layer locking&#xD;
      technique in terms of the incidence and depth of the isthmocele in the uterine incision scar&#xD;
      as a short-term result.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a double-blind randomized prospective and cross-sectional.&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery planned patients who will admit to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic,&#xD;
      Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University Research and Application Center between January 2021 and June&#xD;
      2021 will be evaluated. Participation of the patients in the study will be based on written&#xD;
      consents. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized into two groups&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;baseball&quot; or single layer locked).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University Institutional Review Board and&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (Project no= 20-KAEK-311, Approval Date= 12/17/2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who are over 37 weeks, have no pregnancy complications, and will undergo&#xD;
      uterine surgery for the first time will be included in the study. Exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      determined as: Preoperative hemogram value below 10mg/dL, active labor (regular contraction&#xD;
      and&gt; 4cm cervical opening), placental anomaly, previous uterine surgery, chorioamnionitis,&#xD;
      premature rupture of membranes, additional disease, body mass index BMI&gt; 35kg / m2, consuming&#xD;
      tobacco and / or alcohol, needing blood transfusion and multiple pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be created on a computer controlled by a statistician to create two&#xD;
      groups. Before cesarean delivery, sealed, opaque and numbered envelope containing the&#xD;
      definition and image of the suture technique will be reported to the surgeon. Participants&#xD;
      included in the study 3 months after the operation will be called for control by an external&#xD;
      observer. Follow-up data and ultrasound measurements of uterine incision scar area will be&#xD;
      documented by sonographer who does not know the uterotomy closure technique applied to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up examination, weight and breastfeeding status of the patient and&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement of uterine length, uterine position, residual myometrial thickness,&#xD;
      isthmocele depth, isthmocele width, cervical thickness, isthmocele fundus distance,&#xD;
      isthmocele cervical distance, hypoechoic isthmocele width in transverse plane will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on a study by Roberge S et al. (2016) titled Impact of&#xD;
      uterine closure on residual myometrial thickness after cesarean: a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The mean residual myometrial thickness values of this study were found to be 3.8 ±&#xD;
      1.57 in the single-layered group and 4.77 ± 1.34 in the double-stitched group. The power&#xD;
      analysis performed using GPower 3.1 (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/) program, when 80% power and&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05 are taken, the total sample size calculated using the student's t test was found&#xD;
      to be 36 for each group. Considering possible problems, it is planned to include 80&#xD;
      participants, 40 for each group. The normal distribution of the data of the measurements will&#xD;
      be analyzed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data of two groups of patients will be&#xD;
      analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 program using&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA analysis, post-hoc test, T-test, chi-square and Fisher test according to the&#xD;
      data characteristics. Statistical significance will be accepted as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
