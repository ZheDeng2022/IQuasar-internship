    <textblock>
      This is a first-in survivor pilot study with the goal of establishing preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two senolytic regimens to reduce markers of cellular&#xD;
      senescence (primary outcome: p16^INK4a) and improve frailty (primary outcome: walking speed)&#xD;
      in adult survivors of childhood cancer. If successful, this pilot would provide the&#xD;
      preliminary evidence needed for a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to establish&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy of two, short duration&#xD;
           senolytic regimens: 1) combination of Dasatinib plus Quercetin and 2) Fisetin alone, to&#xD;
           improve walking speed and decrease senescent cell abundance in blood (p16^INKA):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary endpoints of this trial will be change in walking speed and senescent cell&#xD;
           abundance in blood (p16^INK4A) determined at baseline and again at 60 days, within an&#xD;
           individual arm. Extended follow up at 150 days will assess the permanence of change&#xD;
           after completion of the trial. Secondary endpoints of this trial will be effect of&#xD;
           intervention on additional measures of frailty (beyond walking speed; Fried criteria)&#xD;
           and on other cell senescence markers, markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, bone&#xD;
           resorption, and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to test the safety and tolerability of two different senolytic&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of the two senolytic regimens in improving walking speed and&#xD;
           decreasing senescent cell abundance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the longitudinal pattern in measures of frailty.&#xD;

      Eligible subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized, stratified on sex, 1:1 and&#xD;
      age ( ≥40 vs &lt; 40) to receive Dasatinib (100 mg/day) plus Quercetin (500 mg twice daily) on&#xD;
      days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 taken orally or Fisetin (20 mg/kg/day) alone on days 1, 2, 30&#xD;
      and 31 taken orally. At the visit on day 7, we will assess blood CD3+ T lymphocyte p16^INK4A&#xD;
      mRNA and other markers of inflammation and senescence to verify that senescent cells have&#xD;
      been cleared by the intervention. Post-treatment follow-up will occur on day 60 (primary&#xD;
      endpoints) and day 150 to assess the permanence of change after completion of the trial.&#xD;
      Treatment adherence will be confirmed by the study coordinator who will administer the&#xD;
      Dasatinib + Quercetin in clinic on days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 or Fisetin alone on days 1,&#xD;
      2, 30 and 31.&#xD;
