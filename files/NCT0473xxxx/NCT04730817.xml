  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive frailty is a clinical syndrome in which cognitive impairment (e.g., poor memory,&#xD;
      visuospatial function) and physical frailty (e.g., slowness, poor muscle strength, physical&#xD;
      inactivity) co-exist. It is prevalent in community-dwelling older people. The progressive&#xD;
      decline of cognitive and physical functions restricts older people from participating in&#xD;
      activities (e.g., social get-togethers). Reduced participation further jeopardizes their&#xD;
      life-space mobility (e.g., ability to travel to areas far away from home). Therefore, those&#xD;
      with cognitive frailty are at risk of developing dementia and becoming dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous motor-cognitive training is more effective at promoting optimal functioning in&#xD;
      older people than motor or cognitive training alone. Gaming is effective at promoting the&#xD;
      motivation to participate. The contents of games in the market are unrelated to the context&#xD;
      or daily living of the elderly. Currently, available training is non-simultaneous. This makes&#xD;
      the training less transferable to the daily life of the elderly and reduces its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) technology can provide a virtual space that mimics the real environment.&#xD;
      This allows clients to participate in daily activities in a virtual space. Older people can&#xD;
      be trained to improve their cognitive and physical skills in a painless, fun way. However,&#xD;
      the effect and feasibility of employing simultaneous motor-cognitive training launching on a&#xD;
      VR platform mimicking the daily living environment in older people with cognitive frailty is&#xD;
      poorly known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the findings from the previous proof-of-concept test (registration number:&#xD;
      NCT04467216), we proceed to implement the study to 400 participants from six different&#xD;
      elderly centres between the period of March 2021 and December 2022.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the intervention, VR will be employed to simulate a daily living environment familiar to&#xD;
      older people. Participants will wear a commercially available head-mounted VR system with&#xD;
      hand-held controllers to experience the participation of daily activities in a virtual&#xD;
      environment. Simultaneous physical and cognitive training will be embedded in the training&#xD;
      system to promote optimal function. Participants will attend physical training in a sitting&#xD;
      position through cycling on an ergometer and moving the hand-held controllers. Motion sensors&#xD;
      built into the VR system and ergometer will track these movements to control everyday tasks&#xD;
      in the virtual environment (e.g., moving around the city). Simultaneously, participants will&#xD;
      undergo cognitive training by participating in various tasks demanding cognitive functions,&#xD;
      such as visual-spatial (e.g., wayfinding) and problem-solving (e.g., wallet loss) functions.&#xD;
      Gamification will be employed to promote the motivation to participate. All training&#xD;
      activities will be gamified by blending in fun elements, such as difficulty-levelling,&#xD;
      competition, and e-tokens. Co-participation is allowed to promote interpersonal interactions.&#xD;
      The prototype enables real-time co-viewing among participants. Other elderly centre members&#xD;
      and the activity facilitators can share the view of the participants in the game on either a&#xD;
      large-screen monitor or a tablet computer, allowing them to simultaneously discuss and share&#xD;
      about their gaming experiences.&#xD;
