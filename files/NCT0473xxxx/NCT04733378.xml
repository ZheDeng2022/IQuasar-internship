  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a prospective observational study whose main objective will be to determine&#xD;
      whether there is an association between age at surgery (days of life) and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome in patients with CCHD. Secondly, we will study the relationship between age at&#xD;
      surgery and (i) the incidence of WMI observed on pre- and post-operative cerebral MRI (ii)&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity as defined by the occurrence of post-operative complications&#xD;
      (haemodynamic, infectious, neurological, surgical) and (iii) the length of hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease is the most frequent congenital malformation and concerns 9 newborns&#xD;
      per 1000 live births, i.e. nearly 1% of births. Half of these children present a complex form&#xD;
      of congenital heart disease requiring surgery during the first months of life. More than one&#xD;
      child in two will present a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from brain damage beginning&#xD;
      in utero and continuing in the post-natal period. In the newborn with complex congenital&#xD;
      heart disease (CCHD), cerebral immaturity is synonymous with vulnerability, leading in half&#xD;
      of the cases to the perioperative occurrence of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral lesions, most of&#xD;
      which affect the white matter. These white matter injuries (WMI) are a prognostic factor for&#xD;
      motor, cognitive, language and behavioural disorders that induce psycho-social difficulties&#xD;
      in adulthood, altering the quality of life of patients. In newborns with CCHD (Transposition&#xD;
      of Great Arteries or Left Ventricular Hypoplasia) operated on later in the neonatal period,&#xD;
      both the incidence of perioperative BSL and post-operative morbidity are increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier surgery may therefore be a neuroprotective strategy leading to a reduction in&#xD;
      perioperative WMI, postoperative morbidity and a better neurodevelopmental prognosis in&#xD;
      infants with CCHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective observational study whose main objective will be to&#xD;
      determine whether there is an association between age at surgery (days of life) and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome in patients with CCHD. Secondly, the investigators planned to&#xD;
      study the relationship between age at surgery and (i) the incidence of WMI observed on pre-&#xD;
      and post-operative cerebral MRI (ii) post-operative morbidity as defined by the occurrence of&#xD;
      post-operative complications (haemodynamic, infectious, neurological, surgical) and (iii) the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be performed in a prospective cohort (n=50) of neonates with CCHD requiring&#xD;
      surgery during the first 2 months of life and benefiting from pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      cerebral MRI, standardized neurological examinations at 4, 12, 24 months and&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation with a Bayley III test at 24 months.&#xD;
