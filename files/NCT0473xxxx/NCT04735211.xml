  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic postsurgical pain had number of prevalence on 20%. Its derivates from risk factors,&#xD;
      but recent research provide new potential risk factors to develop chronic postsurgical&#xD;
      pediatric pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the body of knowledge, an observational study is proposed in pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of pediatric patients undergoing surgery will be followed at the Maternal and Child&#xD;
      Hospital October 12, Madrid. The group of patients that develops post-surgical chronic pain&#xD;
      and the group that does not develop it will be observed, and risk factors will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgical intervention, the risk factors described in the literature will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Children will be followed up to 6 months after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Assess by Child Anxiety Symptoms Scale (CPASS) is a 20-item scale for children adapted from the adult PASS-20. For each statement, children are asked to rate the extent to which they think, act, or feel that way on a scale from 0 (''never think, act or feel that way'') to 5 (''always think, act, or feel that way''). Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of pain anxiety.</description>
