  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further develop the patient care pathway for women classified with a pregnancy of unknown&#xD;
      location (PUL) and ectopic pregnancy (EP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and design-There is a need for the patient care pathway to evolve in order to aid and&#xD;
      improve the diagnosis and management of women with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and&#xD;
      ectopic pregnancy (EP). There is potential for this to be achieved by the incorporation of a&#xD;
      statistical model that uses one or more novel markers identified by this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment-1000 patients. Inclusion: Patients attending the Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU) in&#xD;
      the first trimester with a PUL or ectopic pregnancy on trans-vaginal ultrasound scan between&#xD;
      the ages of 18-50 years. Exclusion: Patients diagnosed with cancer, presence of acute medical&#xD;
      condition, patients aged less than 18 years, patients who cannot give fully informed study&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent - Posters will advertise the study. Patients in EPU will be invited to the study by a&#xD;
      member of the clinical care team. Written consent will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality - The Chief Investigator will preserve the confidentiality of participants&#xD;
      taking part in the study and is registered under the Data Protection Act. Patient consent&#xD;
      forms will be stored securely within the study file. All patient identifiable information,&#xD;
      where required, will be stored electronically on National Health Service (NHS) approved&#xD;
      computers, accessible only by personnel involved in the study via password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest - None involved in the study have a conflict of interest. Dissemination&#xD;
      of results - No patient identifiable information will be included in the research report or&#xD;
      publication. Anonymised results will be disseminated to scientific community by means of&#xD;
      publication in peer-reviewed literature and presented at national and international meetings.&#xD;
