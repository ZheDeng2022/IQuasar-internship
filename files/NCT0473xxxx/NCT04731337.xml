    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to Assess and compare canine occlusal relation in children with&#xD;
      carious primary molars before they are treated by stainless steel crowns under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and after their placement, evaluate the possibility and the time required for the&#xD;
      post-operative canine relation to resolve and how the treatment affects frequency and type of&#xD;
      food intake.&#xD;

      1. Children who require immediate full mouth rehabilitation under general anaesthesia will&#xD;
           be recruited from the General Anesthesia (GA) unit in the Department of Pediatric&#xD;
           Dentistry, Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two postgraduate students will be filling the patient's assessment chart as shown in&#xD;
           appendices prior to treatment. They will measure the canine overlap. The measurements&#xD;
           will be made in the maximum intercuspation position (MIP) in the centric occlusion (CO)&#xD;
           guided by the operators' hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before general anaesthesia, an anesthesiologist and an internal medicine specialist will&#xD;
           examine participating children, and the necessary preclinical tests will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. On the day of the procedure, parents of the participants will fill a questionnaire&#xD;
           asking for previous dental treatments of the child and his/her medical history and&#xD;
           acceptance to join the study (written consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The vertical overlap of both upper and lower primary canines shall be determined by&#xD;
           locating the meeting tip of the cusp of the upper primary canine over the lower primary&#xD;
           canine at the right and left sides using a sharp pencil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The distance from this point to the tip of the lower primary canine shall be determined&#xD;
           using a digital calliper (Shenzhen Jiabaili Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd), and the&#xD;
           reading will be photographed by a digital camera (iPhone 11 dual 12 MP Ultra-Wide and&#xD;
           wide camera, Apple Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The highest part of the drawn line will be considered as the reference line. For further&#xD;
           accuracy, this will be repeated twice, and in case of the presence of a difference, the&#xD;
           measurement will be repeated for the third time, and the mean of the values will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The treatment will be performed under general anaesthesia, tooth preparation will be&#xD;
           done, and the eight Stainless-steel Crowns (3M™ ESPE™ Stainless Steel Primary Molar&#xD;
           Crowns) will be seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The measured values will be recorded preoperatively and immediately after the treatment&#xD;
           while the patient is unconscious.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Pre-operative determination of the vertical overlap of the upper and lower primary&#xD;
           canines will be done; after placement during the operation and after 2, 4 months follow&#xD;
           up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. If the pre-operative overlap is not restored after four months, we will continue to&#xD;
           follow up for six months.&#xD;
