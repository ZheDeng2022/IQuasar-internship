  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The doctor-patient relationship, medical competence and patient expectations influence&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with anesthesia. Preoperatively all patients are routinely assessed by&#xD;
      an anesthesiologist. However, in many centers, the anesthesiologist who performs the&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation will not necessarily be the anesthesiologist who provides the&#xD;
      intraoperative service. This study evaluated the effect of this practice on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, level of confidence and anxiety among adult patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Background: The doctor-patient relationship, medical competence and patient expectations&#xD;
      influence patient satisfaction with anesthesia. Preoperatively all patients are routinely&#xD;
      assessed by an anesthesiologist. However, in many centers, the anesthesiologist who performs&#xD;
      the preoperative evaluation will not necessarily be the anesthesiologist who provides the&#xD;
      intraoperative service. This study evaluated the effect of this practice on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, level of confidence and anxiety among adult patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 100 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 equal groups: In Group A patients were evaluated and anesthetized by the same&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. In Group B the preoperative assessment and actual anesthesia was performed&#xD;
      by two different anesthesiologists. On the first postoperative day all patients completed a&#xD;
      questionnaire designed to evaluate their sense of preoperative security (confidence) and&#xD;
      their overall satisfaction with the anesthetic experience.&#xD;
