  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a randomized-controlled trial of Guided Written Disclosure Protocol for&#xD;
      dermatological patients with the aim of reducing psychological distress, expressive&#xD;
      suppression, and skin-related symptoms, and improving spiritual well-being, cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal, and sense of coherence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sample size assessment: A recent meta-analysis reported a study which showed that Guided&#xD;
      Written Disclosure Protocol reach on effect size of 0.89 on psychosocial outcomes (Gidron et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Mogk et al., 2006). Power analysis showed that with an alpha of 0.05 and a power&#xD;
      of 0.80, we needed a sample of 34 participants to detect effect sizes of 0.89 and higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data: Occasional missing values were imputed by calculating, for each&#xD;
      participant, the average score for each subscale and then replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: We conducted a 2 (group) X 2 (time [pre-treatment vs.&#xD;
      post-treatment]) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for a set of&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;

    <description>The writing task consists of three sessions of 20 minutes each, with an interval of one week between each other. In the first session, patients were asked to describe the onset of illness, describing chronologically and detailed places, images, sounds and actions, as they are followed and detached from the emotions. In the second session, the patients were asked to write about thoughts and emotions felt during the illness experience, talking about the impact that illness had on their daily lives and how it had changed their personal attitude to life itself. In the third and final session, the patients were asked to analyze subjective new skills acquired.</description>
