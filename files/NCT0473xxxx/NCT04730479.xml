  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing cardiac or aortic surgery, the placement of a radial KTA is sometimes&#xD;
      difficult, the purpose of this study is to do an ultrasound in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      diagnostic values of the internal diameter of the radial artery to predict the failure to&#xD;
      install the radial KTA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Arterial Catheter (KTA) enables continuous measurement of invasive blood pressure in&#xD;
      patients with accurate and reliable hemodynamic monitoring. Radial Artery Catheterization is&#xD;
      the currently recommended placement site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing cardiac or aortic surgery, placement of a radial KTA is sometimes&#xD;
      difficult, with a failure rate of around 15%. It is also a source of local complications and&#xD;
      prolongation of the anesthetic duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no predictive diagnostic test for failed radial KTA placement in anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurately predicting the failure of radial catheterization by echography will, in the&#xD;
      future, make it possible to offer &quot;at risk&quot; patients an immediate catheterization in an other&#xD;
      site as for example brachial site.&#xD;
