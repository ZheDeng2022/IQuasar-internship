  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate the safety and feasibility of a biomarker-guided cardioprotection&#xD;
      strategy using NTproBNP, as compared to usual care, in breast cancer and lymphoma patients&#xD;
      treated with anthracyclines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label pilot trial of a biomarker-guided strategy using NT-proBNP&#xD;
      to identify and treat patients with a high risk of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled and randomized prior to initiation of anthracycline-based therapy&#xD;
      and followed for 12 months with blood samples, echocardiography, and patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes surveys. The overall hypothesis is that a biomarker guided treatment strategy that&#xD;
      initiates neurohormonal antagonists in breast cancer or lymphoma patients who have increases&#xD;
      in NT-proBNP prior to, during, or after anthracyclines will be feasible, well-tolerated, and&#xD;
      result in attenuation of cardiotoxicity, compared to standard care.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the potential harm to an unborn&#xD;

          -  Patient with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history of treatment, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, has the potential to interfere with the safety or&#xD;
             efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe hepatic impairment, defined as serum bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal, or AST&#xD;
             or ALT &gt; 5.0 upper limit of normal within 28 days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have end-stage renal failure on dialysis, history of repeated&#xD;
             hyperkalemia with a potassium &gt; 5.5 mEq/l, or have a history of kidney transplant, or&#xD;
