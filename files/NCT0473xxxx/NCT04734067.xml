    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter observational study to explore the predictive factors of&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) and to establish predictive models by combining&#xD;
      imaging information for IRP. The imaging type of CIP, the pathological type, various&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines and tumor proportion score(TPS) of PD-L1 expression level, etc. will&#xD;
      be paid more attention.&#xD;

      Prospective dual-arm, multicenter observational study to explore the predictive factors of&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) and to establish predictive models by combining&#xD;
      imaging information.Patients will receive work-up, treatment and follow-up exclusively as&#xD;
      routinely done except monitoring and evaluation of CIP. Necessary tests will be required,&#xD;
      such as lung function tests, lymphocyte subsets, and thin-section CT of the chest during&#xD;
      evaluation of the disease.This study mainly included patients with malignant tumor who&#xD;
      received immune checkpoint inhibitors for the first time.Fasting venous blood was taken&#xD;
      before treatment and before cycle 3,5...2n+1 of treatment. Then the blood samples were&#xD;
      centrifuged and frozen in a refrigerator at -80℃ for later mass spectrometry analysis. IrAEs&#xD;
      of patients was strictly recorded according to CommonTerminology Criteria Adverse Events V4.0&#xD;
      (CTCAE V4.0). The main objective was to explore the relationship between various indicators&#xD;
      and the occurrence of CIP, including pulmonary ventilation and diffusion function at&#xD;
      baseline, C-reative protein(CRP), cytokines, interleukin-6(IL-6), CD4+ T lymphocyte count and&#xD;
      percentage, CD8+ T lymphocyte count and percentage, NK cell count and percentage, total T&#xD;
      lymphocyte count and percentage, neutrophil counts and percentages, eosinophilic cell count&#xD;
      and percentage, white blood cell count, blood platelet count, serum albumin(ALB), alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptadase（γ-GGT),&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), serum procalcitonin(PCT), smoking index and various inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints: The predictive factors and the predictive models of CIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints: The incidence and clinical characteristics of CIP.&#xD;
