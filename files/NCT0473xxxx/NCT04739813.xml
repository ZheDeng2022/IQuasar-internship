    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive B-cell lymphomas can be cured but people with disease that resists treatment or&#xD;
      that returns after treatment have poor outcomes with standard therapies. Indolent B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas are generally incurable with standard therapy and treatment is aimed at controlling&#xD;
      symptoms and achieving a durable remissions. Researchers want to see if a combination of&#xD;
      drugs can help patients with both aggressive and indolent B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if it is safe and effective to give polatuzumab along with venetoclax, ibrutinib,&#xD;
      prednisone, obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide to people with certain B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma who have had at&#xD;
      least one prior cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of how they do their daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue biopsy (if needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body imaging scans (may get a contrast agent through an intravenous (IV) catheter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy. A needle will be put into the&#xD;
      hipbone. Bone marrow will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood, tissue, saliva, or cheek swab samples. They may have optional&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given for up to 6 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take venetoclax and prednisone tablets by mouth. They will take ibrutinib&#xD;
      and lenalidomide capsules by mouth. They will get obinutuzumab and polatuzumab by IV&#xD;
      infusion. They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic 30 days after treatment ends. They will have follow-up&#xD;
      visits for 5 years. If needed, they can visit their local doctor instead. They may be&#xD;
      contacted by phone, mail, etc., for the rest of their life....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination chemotherapy with rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for&#xD;
           CD20-positive B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with&#xD;
           chemoimmunotherapy, but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas&#xD;
           remain mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted therapies, aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies,&#xD;
           are emerging and showing significant activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in both the&#xD;
           relapsed and first-line settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanistically based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who&#xD;
           cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ViPOR-P targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis);&#xD;
           BTK (B-cell receptor signaling and NF-kB); Cereblon (NF-kB) and CD20 with additional&#xD;
           genotoxic stress from the anti-mitotic antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b,&#xD;
           polatuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity profile of&#xD;
      polatuzumab in combination with venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      Revlimid(SqrRoot) (lenalidomide) (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women and men greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma,&#xD;
           excluding mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic&#xD;
           lymphoma (CLL/SLL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1 study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of polatuzumab in combination&#xD;
           with venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (lenalidomide)&#xD;
           (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small expansion cohort will be treated at the MTD in a further analysis of safety and&#xD;
           preliminary activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore all dose levels in the phase 1 study and to allow for the possibility of a&#xD;
           few screen failures and inevaluable subjects, the accrual ceiling will be set at 32&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Aggressive B-cell lymphoma: includes DLBCL and subtypes, transformed lymphoma,&#xD;
                  Burkitt lymphoma, as well as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and/or BCL2&#xD;
                  and/or BCL6 rearrangement(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Indolent B-cell lymphoma: with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  MCL is excluded given increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with&#xD;
                       venetoclax compared to other non-Hodgkin lymphomas and need for venetoclax&#xD;
                       ramp-up, dose-escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  CLL/SLL is excluded given alternative dosing of FDA-approved venetoclax for&#xD;

&#xD;
        -Age greater than or equal to18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
        polatuzumab in combination with venetoclax, ibrutinib, obinutuzumab, prednisone and&#xD;
        Revlimid in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be&#xD;

                  patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PTT/aPTT less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional ULN normal except if, in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the investigator, the aPTT is elevated because of a positive Lupus&#xD;
                  Anticoagulant, or a significant bleeding risk has been ruled out in the absence&#xD;
                  of a positive Lupus Anticoagulant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional ULN (or less than or&#xD;
                  equal to 3 X institutional ULN for patients with documented Gilberts syndrome&#xD;

        NOTE: Cr Cl will be calculated with the use of the 24-hour creatinine clearance or eGRF in&#xD;
        the clinical lab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RBC transfusions and use of G-CSF will be allowed in order to meet eligibility&#xD;
             parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immune-modulating drugs (IMiDs) including Revlimid are known to be teratogenic&#xD;
                  and potential embryo-fetal harm can be seen with use of polatuzumab, venetoclax&#xD;
                  and ibrutinib. The effects of obinutuzumab on the developing human fetus is&#xD;
                  unknown. For these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
                  to use adequate contraception as described below. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
                  or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
                  study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For women of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse)&#xD;
                            or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;
                            year as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Agreement to refrain from donating eggs during timelines specified&#xD;
                            below.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative&#xD;
                            serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL&#xD;
                            within 10-14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing&#xD;
                            Revlimid for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days as&#xD;
                            required by Revlimid REMSTM) and must either commit to continued&#xD;
                            abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable&#xD;
                            methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one&#xD;
                            additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before&#xD;
                            she starts taking Revlimid FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
                            testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is&#xD;
                            post-menarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (greater than&#xD;
                            or equal to 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause&#xD;
                            other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                            (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of less than 1%&#xD;
                            per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal&#xD;
                            contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine&#xD;
                            devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to&#xD;
                            the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
                            lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
                            ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
                            not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For men:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse)&#xD;
                            or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating&#xD;
                            sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain&#xD;
                            abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that&#xD;
                            together result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year as noted&#xD;
                            below. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a&#xD;
                            condom as noted below to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to&#xD;
                            the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
                            lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
                            ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
                            not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;

                  events due to previously administered anti-cancer treatment, surgery, or&#xD;
                  procedure. NOTE: Exceptions to this include events not considered to place the&#xD;
                  subject at unacceptable risk of participation in the opinion of the PI (e.g.,&#xD;
                  alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring the use of warfarin are excluded because of potential drug-drug&#xD;
             interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring the following agents to the first dose of venetoclax or ibrutinib&#xD;

        medication used, whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the&#xD;
             discretion of the inves0tigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or uncontrolled&#xD;
                  cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other&#xD;
                  infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment, or any&#xD;
                  major episode of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or&#xD;
                  hospitalization (relating to the completion of the course of antibiotics) within&#xD;
                  2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other&#xD;
                  hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis; as well as active infection with&#xD;
                  HBV or HCV:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients who are positive for HCV antibody must be negative for HCV by&#xD;
                       polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible for study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as positive total&#xD;
                       hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and negative HBsAg) may be included if HBV&#xD;
                       DNA is undetectable (i.e., none detected in copies/mL or IU/mL). These&#xD;
                       patients must be willing to undergo monthly DNA testing during treatment and&#xD;

                  requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women, or women who intend to become pregnant during the study, are excluded&#xD;
             from this study because Revlimid has known teratogenic effects and polatuzumab,&#xD;
             venetoclax, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with venetoclax, ibrutinib and Revlimid and combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active tumor lysis syndrome based on laboratory assessment&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other active malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or&#xD;
             interpretation of results&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma or&#xD;
                  stage 1 melanoma of the skin as well as any in situ carcinoma are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also&#xD;
                  be eligible. Individuals in documented remission who are not receiving active&#xD;
                  treatment prior to enrollment may be included at the discretion of the&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase; or, known&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs&#xD;
