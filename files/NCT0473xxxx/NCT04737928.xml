      The objective of this study was to investigate the improving effect of corneal disorder in&#xD;
      primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients, when switched from the 0.005%&#xD;
      latanoprost ophthalmic solution (one drop at a time, once daily) to the 0.0015% tafluprost&#xD;
      ophthalmic solution (one drop at a time, once daily). Efficacy also was investigated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 20 years or older and those who was provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  POAG or OH patients whose IOP did not exceed 22 mmHg at Visit 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients had treated with prostaglandin ophthalmic solution (0.005% Latanoprost) for&#xD;
             at least 3 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had corneal disorders due to the PG usage. (At least one eye had a score&#xD;
             above 1 on the NEI scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If only one eye was eligible, it was evaluated. When both eyes were eligible, then the&#xD;
             eye with a higher NEI score was selected for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatients who visited the clinic on the designated day as instructed by the&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Those who received corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a history of ocular surgeries (such as corneal refractive surgery,&#xD;
             intraocular surgery including ocular laser treatment which affected the patient's&#xD;
             ocular surface condition) within 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any corneal abnormality or other condition preventing IOP measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who used artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with severe dry eye, ocular allergy, ocular infection or ocular inflammation&#xD;
             which considered affect interpretation of the results of the study. Those who used&#xD;
             systemic or ophthalmic steroids (excluding topical skin steroidal ointment) and&#xD;
             anti-glaucoma agents other than prostaglandin ophthalmic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who were pregnant, nursing or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a history of drug allergy (hypersensitivity) to the drugs to be used during&#xD;
             the study period (anesthetic ophthalmic solution, fluorescein, etc.) or similar drugs&#xD;
             to the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who wore contact lenses during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who had participation in another clinical trial involving an investigational&#xD;
             drug/device, or participation in such a trial within the last 30 days.&#xD;
