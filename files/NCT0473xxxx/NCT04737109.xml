    <textblock>
      This multicenter Phase I/II trial consists of two stages: a phase I stage in patients with&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer in which the recommended phase II dose will be&#xD;
      determined for ipatasertib administered in combination with darolutamide; and a phase II&#xD;
      neoadjuvant stage in which patients with high risk prostate cancer and loss of PTEN&#xD;
      expression in the tumor tissue planning on undergoing prostatectomy receive ADT,&#xD;
      darolutamide, and ipatasertib for 24 weeks prior to planned surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial is a single arm, two stage trial looking for an efficacy signal in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting in patients with PTEN-null tumors. The active therapy is a combination of&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy, darolutamide, and ipatasertib. Patients will be treated for 6&#xD;
      months prior to prostatectomy, since previous studies have shown that pCR+MRD rate is higher&#xD;
      with 6 months of ADT + abiraterone (24%) than 3 months (4%) (Taplan ME et al. J Clin Oncol.&#xD;
      2014;32(33):3705-15). Since the combination has not been evaluated before, a lead-in cohort&#xD;
      in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer will be performed to evaluate safety&#xD;
      and drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead-in cohort will enroll 6 patients to assess the safety of ipatasertib and&#xD;
      darolutamide. Ipatasertib has already been evaluated in combination with the AR pathway&#xD;
      inhibitors abiraterone and enzalutamide, where 400 mg was found to be safe. Therefore&#xD;
      patients will receive the expected final dose of darolutamide 600 mg BID and ipatasertib 400&#xD;
      mg daily. Toxicities will be monitored for 28 days, and blood samples will be drawn for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. If one or fewer patients experience a DLT the trial will&#xD;
      advance to the neoadjuvant setting. If two or more patients experience a DLT at 400 mg, the&#xD;
      dose will be reduced for already enrolled patients and another 6 patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      evaluate darolutamide 600 mg BID and ipatasertib 200 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK evaluations will continue for a total of 6 months. Enrollment in the neoadjuvant cohort&#xD;
      can proceed before PK studies are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have response evaluated at 12 weeks, including PSA response and radiographic&#xD;
      response per modified PCWG3. If there is progression on bone scan alone, patients should have&#xD;
      confirmatory bone scan in at least 6 weeks later. Patients will continue on therapy until the&#xD;
      time of progression.&#xD;
