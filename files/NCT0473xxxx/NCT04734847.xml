  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a common, chronic, and debilitating&#xD;
      condition in women. Preliminary evidence suggests that IC/BPS pain can be reduced applying&#xD;
      non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to areas of the brain that&#xD;
      regulate pelvic floor muscle activity. However, prior studies have examined rTMS in a very&#xD;
      limited sample and have not examined changes in brain or pelvic floor muscle activity to&#xD;
      determine the mechanism of rTMS for IC/BPS. This study is designed to directly address these&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a common, chronic, and debilitating&#xD;
      condition in women. The underlying cause of IC/BPS remains unknown. We recently published the&#xD;
      first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study comparing brain function in women&#xD;
      with IC/BPS to healthy women. We found that women with IC/BPS have altered resting activity&#xD;
      in supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically, these changes appear in a part of SMA that&#xD;
      we have shown to control pelvic floor muscle activity. We call this part of SMA &quot;pelvic-SMA&quot;.&#xD;
      Our results provide the first potential explanation for extensive published reports of&#xD;
      increased pelvic floor muscle activity in women with IC/BPS. We hypothesize that we are&#xD;
      observing evidence of an important theory of chronic pain: motor cortical changes occur that&#xD;
      are initially beneficial to increase protective muscle activity but are ultimately&#xD;
      maladaptive and perpetuate pain. If this theory is true, it should be possible to reduce pain&#xD;
      and muscle activity by improving brain activity. The proposed work is to do exactly that.&#xD;
      Using non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) directed at&#xD;
      pelvic-SMA, we aim to determine if we can reduce pain (Aim 1), improve resting brain activity&#xD;
      (fMRI) and resting pelvic floor muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity in IC/BPS (Aim 2),&#xD;
      and to link the pain reductions to fMRI/EMG improvements to develop a causal mediation model&#xD;
      of IC/BPS symptoms (Aim 3). We will recruit 50 women with IC/BPS to participate in the study,&#xD;
      and participants will be randomized to 2 groups of 25: high-frequency (active) or sham&#xD;
      (inert). Our preliminary data suggest that high-frequency stimulation is the best stimulation&#xD;
      protocol for reducing pain and improving pelvic-SMA activity and resting pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      activity. Our preliminary results agree with a large body of literature suggesting that&#xD;
      high-frequency rTMS applied to motor cortex is the best stimulus paradigm to reduce pain, but&#xD;
      our proposed work has the potential to greatly innovate the field of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation for pain by providing a mechanism by which the stimulation can improve&#xD;
      deficiencies in motor function in chronic pain patients.&#xD;
