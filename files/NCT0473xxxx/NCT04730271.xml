  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market research study is to gather clinical and radiographic (X-ray)&#xD;
      information about total knee replacement surgeries completed with the VELYS Robotic-Assisted&#xD;
      Solution and with standard manual instrumentation. The VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution helps&#xD;
      the surgeon to plan bone cuts and then accurately achieve the planned cuts during the total&#xD;
      knee replacement surgery. The study aims to compare how well the VELYS Robotic-Assisted&#xD;
      system enables the surgeon to position the implants exactly as planned compared to manual&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of Long leg Alignment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post operative</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the accuracy to plan of the long leg alignment achieved with the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution is non-inferior to the accuracy to plan of the long leg alignment achieved with the manual ATTUNE Intuition instrumentation. This will be assessed on long-leg X-rays taken at 12 weeks. If non-inferiority is successfully demonstrated, then the study will be deemed to be successful, and a test for superiority of mechanical axis alignment achieved with VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution will be conducted.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. Scores are derived by a 5 digit code. The higher the number, the better the overall health status of the patient.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Forgotten Joint Scores comprise measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO). These PRO questionnaires focus on patients' awareness of a specific joint in everyday life. Joint awareness can be simply defined as any unintended perception of a joint. This may include strong sensations like pain, but also includes more subtle feelings like mild stiffness, subjective dysfunction, or any discomfort. The FJS-12 score ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst score and 100 being the best. A higher score means the patient is better able to forget about the artificial joint in daily life. So, the higher the score, the better the outcome is.</description>
