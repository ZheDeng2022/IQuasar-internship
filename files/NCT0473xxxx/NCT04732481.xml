  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized in intensive care often require intravenous administration of fluid in&#xD;
      order to optimize the functioning of the heart and thus ensure perfusion of vital organs such&#xD;
      as the kidneys, the brain or the digestive tract. However, it is necessary to find the right&#xD;
      balance in fluid intake because it has been shown that excessive administration has a&#xD;
      negative impact on patient survival, the length of their stay in intensive care or the&#xD;
      duration of invasive mechanical ventilation.The passive leg lifting maneuver is regularly&#xD;
      used to determine which patients should be infused with these large volumes (the patient's&#xD;
      chest is placed in a horizontal position and the legs are elevated at 30 ° by tilting the bed&#xD;
      for 2 minutes ). To be interpreted, this maneuver requires the presence of invasive devices&#xD;
      (bloody arterial pressure catheter, PICCO monitor) or an operator experienced in cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound.Our study aims to evaluate an easy-to-use, non-invasive tool widely available in&#xD;
      intensive care and emergency departments (carotid vascular doppler ultrasound) to assess the&#xD;
      response to a passive leg lifting maneuver. . The measurements are taken before and after a&#xD;
      passive leg lifting maneuver and then before and after a filling decided before inclusion by&#xD;
      the doctor responsible for the patient.&#xD;
