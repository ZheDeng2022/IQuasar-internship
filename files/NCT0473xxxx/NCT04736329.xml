    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) poses a major health burden in various populations, with devastating&#xD;
      annual rates of morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that 1%-to-2% of the general&#xD;
      population suffer from the heart failure syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is the most studied among different strata of&#xD;
      ejection fractions (compared to HFpEF and HFmrEF), and thus therapies with evidence based&#xD;
      survival benefit are well identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The syndrome of heart failure and the subsequent reduced cardiac output triggers activation&#xD;
      of neurohormonal compensatory responses aiming to augment cardiac output and tissue&#xD;
      perfusion, like upregulation of sympathetic nervous system and over-activation of the Renin&#xD;
      Angiotensin Aldosterone System. Nevertheless, overshooting of such compensatory mechanisms&#xD;
      have deleterious effects on heart failure in terms of aggravation of symptoms and reduction&#xD;
      of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin II acts primarily on type I receptors inducing the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intense arteriolar vasoconstriction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stimulates sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stimulates adrenal medulla to secrete catecholamines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stimulates sympathetic nervous system, through facilitation of ganglionic stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modestly inhibits vagus (parasympathetic system)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stimulates secretion of vasopressin/anti-diuretic hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stimulates adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, which promotes sodium and water&#xD;
           reabsorption and promotes potassium secretion at the distal convoluted tubules in&#xD;
           addition to induction of myocardial remodeling and fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  constricts the glomerular efferent arteriole which increase filtration pressure and&#xD;
           promotes proteinuria and nephron injury/loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While, angiotensin type II receptors activation have beneficial effects like vasodilatation&#xD;
      and promoting endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin-II receptor type I&#xD;
      blockers (ARBs) or Angiotensin receptor blocker- neprilisin inhibitor (ARNI) are considered a&#xD;
      cornerstone in HFrEF therapy for both: symptoms relief and improvement of survival. Yet,&#xD;
      hypotension, hyperkalemia or worsening of renal function are potential side effects that&#xD;
      occasionally may lead to ACEi/ARBs/ARNI intolerance and subsequent discontinuation with loss&#xD;
      of their cardioprotective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, cardiorenal syndrome is a recently introduced medical category due to the&#xD;
      frequent association of cardiac and renal dysfunction in clinical practice. CardioRenal&#xD;
      Syndrome CRS type I; acute cardiac dysfunction leading to renal dysfunction, is reported in&#xD;
      25%-to-33% of acute heart failure patients, and this prevalence jumps to 70% in cases of&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock. CRS type II; chronic cardiac dysfunction leading to renal dysfunction, was&#xD;
      found in 45% of chronic heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the definite renoprotective and antiproteinuric effects of RAAS blockade in patients&#xD;
      with chronic renal impairment, in cases when the glomerular filtration is critically&#xD;
      dependent on angiotensin II-mediated efferent vasoconstriction such as in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure and severe depletion of circulating volume-, ACEi/ARBs can lead to profound reduction&#xD;
      of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The concerns about the safety of RAAS blockade in&#xD;
      the presence of renal impairment has led to profound underutilization of these drugs in CHF&#xD;
      patients with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very prevalent co-existence of heart failure and renal impairment prominently impairs&#xD;
      patients' outcomes both by direct disease effects and indirectly due to the occasional but&#xD;
      frequent enforced discontinuation of therapies with proven survival benefit.[6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telmisartan is an ARB with peculiar pharmacodynamic properties. Unlike most of the ACEi/ARBs&#xD;
      family, Telmisartan primarily depends on hepatic excretion and only a minority depends on&#xD;
      renal excretion. Telmisartan has been proved in human and animal studies to be an effective&#xD;
      agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR ɣ) which potentiates&#xD;
      its renoprotective effects being acting by dual mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it can be hypothesized that Telmisartan might be better tolerated than standard ACEi/ARBs&#xD;
      in HF patients with moderate renal impairment, guranteeing less frequent interruptions and&#xD;
      more consistent cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. However, there is no wealth of&#xD;
      data to support or deny this theory.&#xD;

      Population of study &amp; disease condition Chronic heart Failure patients with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction, (LVEF &lt;40%) associated with moderate impairment of renal functions, (eGFR by&#xD;
      Cockroft-Gold equation 60-40 ml/min/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either Enalapril (2.5 up to 20mg ) or Telmisartan (20&#xD;
      up to 80mg) for RAAS inhibition, as part of their heart failure therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Compare efficacy, safety and tolerability of Telmisartan versus Enalapril in HFrEF patients&#xD;
      with impaired renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Methodology in details: HFrEF patients with moderate renal impairment as defined per&#xD;
      protocol and after accepting participation to the study, will be randomly allocated into 2&#xD;
      equal groups using closed envelopes randomization system based on web-based randomization&#xD;
      tables. Group 1 will receive Enalapril (between 2.5 to 20mg daily) as tolerated. Group 2 will&#xD;
      receive Telmisartan (between 10 to 80mg daily) as tolerated. Both groups will receive other&#xD;
      guidelines directed medical therapy for HFrEF. Patients will be monitored for :-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of NYHA class.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minutes walk test at baseline at 2, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

           Albumin/Creatinine ratio and serum albumin levels respectively, at baseline at 2, 6 and&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Rates of discontinuation of / intolerance to the used agent for RAAS inhibition&#xD;
