  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot core training is very important for the intrinsic muscles of the foot, but it is often&#xD;
      neglected in exercise programs given to individuals with pes planus. The aim of our study is&#xD;
      to reveal the effects of foot core training, which will be added to the exercise program&#xD;
      routinely given to individuals with asymptomatic flexible pes planus, on walking, muscular&#xD;
      activations, balance and lower extremity functional performance with objective, evidence&#xD;
      based results.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled study and will be carried out on volunteer individuals&#xD;
      with asymptomatic flexible pes planus aged between 18-25, studying at Alanya Alaaddin&#xD;
      Keykubat University. Persons meeting the inclusion criteria will be determined by the&#xD;
      specialist physiotherapist. Surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements will be made by a&#xD;
      doctorate physiotherapist. Other evaluations will be made by a specialist physiotherapist.&#xD;
      Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria, who volunteered to participate in the study and&#xD;
      signed the consent sheet will be randomly divided into two groups, the control group and the&#xD;
      foot core group. Individuals with initial evaluations will be followed up in an exercise&#xD;
      program planned for 8 weeks. The control group will be given exercises to strengthen the&#xD;
      weakened muscles, stretch the shortened structures and increase proprioception. Foot core&#xD;
      training will be given to the study group in addition to the exercises given to the control&#xD;
      group. Before and after exercise, the subjects will be assessed with navicular height&#xD;
      measurement, muscle activation evaluation, evaluation of walking parameters, functional lower&#xD;
      extremity performance evaluation and balance evaluation.&#xD;
