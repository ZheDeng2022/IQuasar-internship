  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      InSight Lifetech Intravascular Ultrasound Diagnostic System (referred to as InSight Lifetech&#xD;
      IVUS system below),is a new high-speed and high-resolution device for providing clear images&#xD;
      of plague morphology, as well as the quantitative and qualitative assessment of coronary&#xD;
      artery. This study will compare the differences, if any, between the intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound(IVUS) measured by the two different IVUS diagnostic system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported that IVUS is an accurate method for determining optimal stent&#xD;
      development (complete stent expansion and apposition and lack of edge dissection or other&#xD;
      complications after implantation), and the size of the vessel undergoing stent implantation.&#xD;
      The novel 60 megahertz(60MHz) high-definition IVUS has evolved as a next-generation IVUS&#xD;
      imaging technology to provide higher image resolution than conventional 40 megahertz(40MHz)&#xD;
      IVUS but with sufficient imaging depth preserved for the assessment of the entire vessel wall&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      InSight Lifetech IVUS system is a novel device with high-speed and high-resolution, including&#xD;
      TrueVisionTM intravascular ultrasound diagnostic catheter and VivoHeartTM intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound diagnostic device, and its higher image acquisition rate also enables high-speed&#xD;
      pullback imaging at up to 10mm/sec. This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      single-blind, controlled study with the purpose of the differences, if any, between IVUS&#xD;
      measurement by the InSight Lifetech IVUS system and Boston Scientific IVUS system whose&#xD;
      imaging catheter is conventional 40MHz. The secondary purpose is to analyze the feasibility&#xD;
      of high-speed pullback in the assessment of IVUS. A total of 125 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      at 6 centers in China.&#xD;
