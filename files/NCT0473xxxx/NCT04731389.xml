    <textblock>
      Almost 35% of patients treated to dermatosis have some psychiatric disorder. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the prevalence and severity of skin picking disorder and other&#xD;
      dermatosis, and also test the efficacy of an online-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy to&#xD;
      improve skin picking disorder severity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The interface between dermatology and psychiatry represents a major challenge for the&#xD;
      management of chronic itchy pathologies. Dermatology requires adherence to chronic treatments&#xD;
      that must be incorporated as changes in habit. In addition, patients with chronic pruritic&#xD;
      dermatoses often develop a scratching habit that often leads to the development of&#xD;
      dermatillomania, requiring psychiatric intervention. In general, among the patients who seek&#xD;
      the dermatologist, 33% complain of psychiatric symptoms. On the other hand, patients with&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions have a higher prevalence of dermatoses when compared to the healthy&#xD;
      population, with anxiety, depression and psychosis being situations that can induce or worsen&#xD;
      dermatological conditions. Despite the important interface between dermatology and&#xD;
      psychiatry, there is still a gap in the literature about the best way to diagnose and treat&#xD;
      these patients affected by psychodermatosis, and also a lack of professionals' knowledge&#xD;
      about this theme. One study addressed the quality of the treatments currently offered for&#xD;
      skin picking, also known as dermatillomania, finding that only 53% of patients report having&#xD;
      received the correct diagnosis of their pathology, and after the treatment offered, 54.7% of&#xD;
      individuals reported that their clinical condition was unchanged or worse, and only 11% of&#xD;
      patients reported feeling better with the treatment performed. When asked about the training&#xD;
      of professionals, 85% of patients reported that the professional did not seem to have&#xD;
      knowledge about his clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current world moment, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, keeps these patients away&#xD;
      from possible interventions that could bring relief to the situation, either for fear of&#xD;
      contamination, difficulties in displacement or even a temporary reduction in vacancies for&#xD;
      care. The great and just effort of the Health Systems to face the pandemic can, on the other&#xD;
      hand, impact the offer of assistance to chronic dermatological diseases. Around the world,&#xD;
      telemedicine and other distance health care protocols have been used in an attempt to assist&#xD;
      patients. But not all carriers of these chronic diseases are part of health systems. It is&#xD;
      also known that during the COVID pandemic19, dermatoses frequently associated with&#xD;
      dermatillomania are still the most common causes of consultations with dermatologists, such&#xD;
      as acne and eczema. Changes in routine, especially food and physical activity, but also in&#xD;
      certain habits, such as frequent hand hygiene and the use of astringent substances, such as&#xD;
      alcohol gel, worsen or trigger inflammatory conditions. Still, the frequent use of masks&#xD;
      induces the appearance of pruritus, which can increase the severity of already existing&#xD;
      dermatoses and, also, lead to the misuse of props.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose the development of an electronic website with educational&#xD;
      strategies and self-applicable tools for cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with&#xD;
      dermatoses who have pruritus or symptoms on the skin with the potential to develop or even&#xD;
      with the diagnosis of skin picking. The website proposed here aims to help patients with&#xD;
      chronic dermatoses seeking both the prevention and treatment of possible complications. This&#xD;
      set of Internet pages aims to provide educational material, strategies to increase adherence&#xD;
      to treatment and interventions with cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, facilitating&#xD;
      patients' autonomy in caring for their skin disorders, especially in times as troubled as the&#xD;
      current one.&#xD;
