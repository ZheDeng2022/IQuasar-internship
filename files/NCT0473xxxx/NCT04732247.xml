  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naval Special Warfare (NSW) operators are exposed to a variety of extreme environmental&#xD;
      conditions and intense physical demands. In addition to breathing high pressure gases at&#xD;
      depth, prolonged cold water immersion and inadequate recovery from sustained physical&#xD;
      exertion negatively impact individual and team performance. Biotechnologies that could&#xD;
      mitigate the effects of cold as well as support physical recovery represent a significant&#xD;
      unmet need for the NSW operational community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin (OT) has a wide range of actions both locally in the brain and peripherally in the&#xD;
      body including skeletal muscle. These peripheral effects can be mediated by classic&#xD;
      ligand-receptor activation given the abundant expression of the oxytocin receptor in&#xD;
      peripheral tissues, along with local expression of OT in peripheral tissues where it is&#xD;
      likely to act in an autocrine manner. Exogenous OT via intranasal administration is FDA&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND)-approved and has been demonstrated as an easy and safe method&#xD;
      to increase circulating OT concentrations that may augment actions on peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the pleiotropic effects of OT on whole body metabolism, thermogenesis, stress&#xD;
      responses, pain, mood, inflammation, appetite, glycemic control, skeletal homeostasis, and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle repair and regeneration, there is increasing interest in the administration&#xD;
      of exogenous OT for benefits to human health, performance and resilience. However, the&#xD;
      biological mechanisms by which OT exerts tissue-specific effects (e.g., skeletal muscle)&#xD;
      remain poorly understood, particularly in humans. This project is designed to significantly&#xD;
      advance this understanding while testing the central hypothesis that intranasally&#xD;
      administered OT attenuates systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress and inflammation&#xD;
      induced by the combined stressor of resistance swim exercise and hyperoxia.&#xD;

      Naval Special Warfare (NSW) operators are exposed to a variety of extreme environmental&#xD;
      conditions and intense physical demands. In addition to breathing high pressure and hyperoxic&#xD;
      gases at depth, prolonged cold water immersion and inadequate recovery from sustained&#xD;
      physical exertion negatively impact individual and team performance. Biotechnologies that&#xD;
      could mitigate the effects of these extreme conditions as well as support physical recovery&#xD;
      represent a significant unmet need for the NSW operational community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin (OT) has a wide range of actions both locally in the brain and peripherally&#xD;
      including skeletal muscle and a number of peripheral targets. OT may attenuate acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular stress responses, while chronic OT exposure may reduce risk of CVD and other&#xD;
      chronic diseases via anti-inflammatory effects and attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative&#xD;
      stress. These effects can be mediated by classic ligand-receptor activation given the&#xD;
      abundant expression of the oxytocin receptor in peripheral tissues, along with local&#xD;
      expression of OT in peripheral tissues where it is likely to act in an autocrine manner.&#xD;
      Exogenous OT via intranasal administration is FDA Investigational New Drug (IND)-approved and&#xD;
      has been demonstrated as an easy and safe method to increase circulating OT concentrations&#xD;
      that may augment actions on peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the pleiotropic effects of OT on whole body metabolism, thermogenesis, stress&#xD;
      responses, pain, mood, inflammation, appetite, glycemic control, skeletal homeostasis, and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle repair and regeneration, there is increasing interest in the administration&#xD;
      of exogenous OT for benefits to human health, performance and resilience. However, the&#xD;
      biological mechanisms by which OT exerts tissue-specific effects (e.g., skeletal muscle)&#xD;
      remain poorly understood, particularly in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is designed to significantly advance this understanding while testing the&#xD;
      central hypothesis that intranasally administered OT attenuates systemic and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation induced by the combined stressor of resistance swim&#xD;
      exercise and hyperoxia. If efficacy is demonstrated, the ultimate deliverable would be an&#xD;
      easily administered, adjunctive biological therapy expected to improve performance and&#xD;
      resilience of undersea warfighters. The planned project will extend current IHMC research&#xD;
      focused on developing biotechnologies to enhance human performance and resilience. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis will be tested via two specific aims - using a rigorous, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial leveraging a wash-in design, enrolling N=40 18-39 y/o&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To investigate the efficacy of intranasal OT on attenuating systemic and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle oxidative stress and inflammation induced by the combined stressor of&#xD;
      intensive, resistance swim exercise and hyperoxia. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      with a 1:1 distribution to 48 IU intranasal OT vs. placebo (saline). Investigators will test&#xD;
      the effects of 4x per day (QID) intranasal treatment on performance and the acute&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to resistance swimming under hyperoxia, along&#xD;
      with the timecourse of recovery over 48 h. To assess blood and muscle oxidative stress&#xD;
      investigators will measure antioxidant enzymes, along with markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress-induced DNA damage, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation. Systemic&#xD;
      inflammation will be assessed via a 7-plex serum cytokine array, and muscle inflammation will&#xD;
      be assessed via the TNF-a and IL-6 signaling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To leverage proven molecular mapping strategies to identify key molecular&#xD;
      transducers likely driving any effects of intranasal OT on systemic and muscle oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammation throughout 48 h of recovery. Given the paucity of data on mechanisms&#xD;
      by which exogenous OT exerts its effects, the investigators will take a discovery approach to&#xD;
      identify novel molecular networks and pathways that are differentially regulated by OT vs.&#xD;
      placebo during recovery from an intensive, resistance swim exercise under hyperoxia. To&#xD;
      accomplish this the investigators will perform multi-level modeling that integrates data from&#xD;
      metabolomics, transcriptomics (both long and small RNA sequencing from blood plasma and&#xD;
      muscle), and miRNA sequencing of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intranasal OT demonstrates efficacy, the deliverable would be an adjunctive biological&#xD;
      therapy that mitigates oxidative stress as well as enhances performance during and recovery&#xD;
      from resistance swimming under hyperoxia.&#xD;
