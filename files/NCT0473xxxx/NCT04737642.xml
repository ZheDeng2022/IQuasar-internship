  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate feasibility and safety of intraoperative bile duct clearance by sphincter of&#xD;
      Oddi balloon dilatation via cystic duct at cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: rate of successful bile duct stone clearance (feasibility). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints (safety): rate of peri-interventional complications (injury to the common bile&#xD;
      duct, bleeding, injury to surrounding organs: stomach, duodenum, liver) and short-term&#xD;
      postoperative complications (bile leak, cholangitis, lipasaemia, pancreatitis, pneumonia).&#xD;
      Duration of procedure. Length of hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard approach to address common bile duct stones is endoscopic retrograde cholangiography&#xD;
      (ERC) with sphincterotomy. Those interventions are performed either before or after&#xD;
      gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), thus, requiring at least two interventions. Moreover,&#xD;
      ERC with sphincterotomy is associated with a considerable rate of short and long-term&#xD;
      morbidity. The main complications are pancreatitis (2-7%), post sphincterotomy bleeding&#xD;
      (1-2%), impaired function of the sphincter with reflux of duodenal content to the bile ducts&#xD;
      and a consecutive risk for cholangitis, stone recurrence and even a potential higher risk for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate an alternative surgical approach of bile duct clearance&#xD;
      at the time of cholecystectomy. Literature of this approach is scarce; however, it has shown&#xD;
      a trend to lower postoperative complications if compared to ERC. The technique of sphincter&#xD;
      of Oddi balloon dilatation and bile duct clearance from stones via cystic duct at&#xD;
      cholecystectomy has been described in a few case series. These small case series have shown a&#xD;
      good success rate of bile stone clearance and low complication rates when applying the&#xD;
      balloon dilation technique for smaller stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have used this technique in selected cases with good success as well.&#xD;
      However, the technique needs to be assessed regarding feasibility and safety in a consecutive&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
