  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and&#xD;
      schedule assessed to be safe for EMB-06 and to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      EMB-06 at the RP2Ds. Pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and the anti-multiple myeloma&#xD;
      activity of EMB-06 will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed&#xD;
      to assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for EMB-06 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
