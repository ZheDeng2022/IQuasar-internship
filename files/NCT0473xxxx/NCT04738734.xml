  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized comparison study is designed to&#xD;
      compare the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System to Cryosurgery for the clearance of&#xD;
      cutaneous non-genital common warts on all areas of the body excluding the scalp, nose, within&#xD;
      the orbital region of the face, plantar or periungual area in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy adult subjects with a minimum of two cutaneous non-genital&#xD;
      warts, excluding the face, with each wart lesion not exceeding 10 x 10mm. Macrophotography of&#xD;
      all study warts will be captured along with a blinded site Investigator to characterize wart&#xD;
      healing, wart clearance and wart reduction. All subjects will be followed at 7, 30, 60, and&#xD;
      90-days following the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure. All wart lesions are eligible&#xD;
      for up to a total of 3 treatments over the course of the study. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
