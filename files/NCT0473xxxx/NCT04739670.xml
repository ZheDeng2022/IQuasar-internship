  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesise that the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab and&#xD;
      atezolizumab may be synergistic and improve outcomes for patients with early relapsed TNBC by&#xD;
      overcoming mechanisms of immune resistance and thus potentiating greater and more durable&#xD;
      responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Early relapsing TNBC represents a high&#xD;
      priority, unmet need whereby effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, single arm phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      locally recurrent, inoperable or metastatic recurrent PD-L1 positive or stromal TIL positive&#xD;
      TNBC (Triple Negative Breast Cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status will be available centrally for&#xD;
      patients in which PD-L1 testing or stromal TIL testing has not been performed or is not&#xD;
      available. In such cases, patients will be required to sign a pre-screening consent form&#xD;
      allowing collection and testing of archival tumour samples for PD-L1 status. Patient's that&#xD;
      are PD-L1 positive and who fulfil the remaining study eligibility criteria will then be&#xD;
      offered participation into the main BELLA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility and registration to the main study, patients will&#xD;
      receive treatment as outlined in Table 1 until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. In the absence of disease progression, the&#xD;
      discontinuation of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin or gemcitabine (owing to AEs) can&#xD;
      occur independently. In the event of ongoing clinical benefit but disease progression,&#xD;
      treatment continuation may occur if approved by the CPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Order Treatment Dose Dose Frequency Route of Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Atezolizumab 1200 mg Day 1 of each 21 day cycle IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Day 1 of each 21 day cycle IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Carboplatin AUC 5 Day 1 of each 21 day cycle IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour response will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. Any evaluable and measurable&#xD;
      disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed every 6 weeks from cycle 1 - day 1,&#xD;
      regardless of any dose delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT or MRI scans should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CT or MRI scans of the brain&#xD;
      should be completed at screening and subsequently performed if clinically indicated. At the&#xD;
      Investigator's discretion, CT or MRI scans may be repeated at any time if progressive disease&#xD;
      is suspected. Imaging based assessments should always be completed rather than clinical&#xD;
      assessment to determine response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue treatment for any reason will have an End of Treatment visit 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of treatment after which, patients will move into the follow-up phase of&#xD;
      the study where they will be assessed on a 3 monthly basis. Patients with progressive disease&#xD;
      will be followed for survival only and patients who discontinue treatment for other reasons&#xD;
      will be followed for progression and survival. All patients will be followed up for 2 years&#xD;
      after the last patient has been commenced treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 31 patients recruited into the study. If a patient does not receive any&#xD;
      protocol treatments for any reason, that patient will be replaced in the study. There are no&#xD;
      requirements for follow-up on patients who do not commence treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that it will take 24 months to accrue the required 31 evaluable patients.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up until 2 years after the last patient has commenced treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-treatment archival FFPE sample collected at pre-screening or screening for the main&#xD;
           study will be tested retrospectively at the completion of the trial for&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantification of PD-L1 expression and Quantification of TILs on H&amp;E slides&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two fresh tumour tissue samples to be collected if deemed clinically feasible by the&#xD;
           investigator: an &quot;on-treatment&quot; tumour sample should be collected during cycle 1, days&#xD;
           15-21 and a &quot;post-progression&quot; tumour sample should be collected ≥ 14 days after the&#xD;
           last dose of bevacizumab, and prior to commence of a new therapy. On-treatment FFPE&#xD;
           sample will be tested for&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantification of PD-L1 expression Quantification of TILs on H&amp;E slides&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A whole blood sample will also be taken prior to the start of treatment, prior to day 1&#xD;
           of cycle 3, and at disease progression (EoT visit) for future research purposes for the&#xD;
           assessment of biomarkers of immune activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional biomarker research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the patient has consented to the Optional Biomarker Study, an additional whole blood&#xD;
           sample will be taken on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior starting the treatment for germline&#xD;
           whole-genome SNP genotyping to be performed retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient has consented to the Optional Biomarker Study, stool samples for&#xD;
           microbiome analysis will be collected prior to the start of treatment, prior to day 1 of&#xD;
           cycle 3, and at disease progression (EoT visit). Microbiome analysis will be performed&#xD;
           retrospectively.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or&#xD;
             previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease&#xD;
             has been clinically stable for &gt; 2 weeks prior to registration to study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic, untreated, or actively progressing CNS metastases. Patients with a&#xD;
             history of treated CNS lesions are eligible, provided that all of the following&#xD;
