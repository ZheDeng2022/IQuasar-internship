    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the recovery kinetics of neuromuscular fatigue,&#xD;
      muscle microtrauma indicators, performance and oxidative stress factors after three different&#xD;
      exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD) protocols in adult Males. Also, this study will&#xD;
      determine the comparison among three different eccentric protocols in neuromuscular fatigue,&#xD;
      muscle microtrauma indicators, performance and oxidative stress factors. The eccentric&#xD;
      protocols will be differentiated in training volume and specifically in the eccentric&#xD;
      repetitions in isokinetic dynamometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that eccentric exercise induces muscle microtrauma. Also, eccentric type of&#xD;
      exercise are associated with inflammatory response. The leukocytes and the immune cells&#xD;
      during the phagocytosis process alter the redox status causing secondary muscle damage to the&#xD;
      muscle tissue and also increase oxidative stress concentration. Despite of the existence of&#xD;
      studies that examine the muscle damage indicators, inflammatory response, performance and&#xD;
      neuromuscular fatigue and oxidative stress concentrations after eccentric exercise, however&#xD;
      no studies are detected in order to compare the differences among three eccentric protocols.&#xD;
      The eccentric protocols will be differentiated in training volume and specifically in the&#xD;
      eccentric repetitions in isokinetic dynamometer. Specifically, a randomized, fourth-trial,&#xD;
      cross-over, repeated measures design will be applied. Healthy male adults (age 18-30 years)&#xD;
      will participate in the present study. Also, it is considered necessary that the participants&#xD;
      will not suffer from any musculoskeletal injuries that will limit their ability to perform&#xD;
      the exercise protocols. Also the participants will not be smokers and will not consume&#xD;
      alcohol and nutritional supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase all participants will sign an informed consent form after they will be&#xD;
      informed about all benefits and risks of this study and they will sign a recent historical of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury or illness form. Subsequently, fasting blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      by venipuncture using a disposable needle (20-gauge) in order to measure muscle damage&#xD;
      markers (CK), inflammation markers (WBC) and oxidative stress markers (TBARS, PC, GSH, ΤΑC,&#xD;
      CAT, UA). After, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in the knee flexors (KF) and extensors&#xD;
      (KE) of both limbs, body weight (BW), height and body composition (DXA method) will be&#xD;
      measured in the lab. Completing the first phase, participants will be instructed by a&#xD;
      dietitian how to record a 5 days diet recalls estimating the energy intake during the trials&#xD;
      will be the same. The knee range of motion (KJRM) will be determined by the use of a&#xD;
      goniometer, 24 hours after (second phase). The counter movement jump (CMJ) will be evaluated&#xD;
      on a force platform using two force platforms at 1000 Hz, with each foot in parallel on the&#xD;
      two platforms providing a separate yet time-synchronized measurement of the data for each&#xD;
      leg. During the CMJ will be measured the jump height (cm), the ground reaction force (N), the&#xD;
      peak and mean power (W/kg), the vertical stiffness (Kvert, N/m/kg) and the peak rate of force&#xD;
      development (RFD, N/s), while at the same time will be evaluated the change in peak and mean&#xD;
      normalized EMG during the eccentric and concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for&#xD;
      the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis muscles. Electromyography data will be&#xD;
      collected wirelessly at 2.000 Hz using a Myon MA-320 EMG system. The peak eccentric and&#xD;
      concentric isokinetic torque of the knee flexors and extensors, in both limbs will be&#xD;
      evaluated on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60°/sec. Also, the isometric peak torque of the&#xD;
      knee extensors will be evaluated at 65° in both limbs. Finally, Open-circuit spirometry will&#xD;
      be utilized for assessment of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using an automated online&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange system via breath-by-breath analysis during a graded exercise testing&#xD;
      on a treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      96 hours after, the participants are going to perform one of the three eccentric protocols&#xD;
      randomly, on an isokinetic dynamometer. The eccentric protocol will be performed on a&#xD;
      different limb for each trial. The ECC 75 trial will include 75 eccentric maximum repetitions&#xD;
      (5 sets, 15 reps/set and recovery period: 30sec.) at 60°/sec. The ECC 150 trial will include&#xD;
      150 eccentric maximum repetitions (10 sets, 15 reps/set and recovery period: 30sec.) at&#xD;
      60°/sec. The ECC 300 trial will include 300 eccentric maximum repetitions (20 sets, 15&#xD;
      reps/set and recovery period: 30sec.) at 60°/sec. The DOMS indicator in the knee flexors (KF)&#xD;
      and extensors (KE) of both limbs and the KJRM will be evaluated immediately after each&#xD;
      protocol. Also, the (CMJ) will be evaluated on a force platform using two force platforms at&#xD;
      1000 Hz, with each foot in parallel on the two platforms providing a separate yet&#xD;
      time-synchronized measurement of the data for each leg. During the CMJ will be measured the&#xD;
      jump height (cm), the ground reaction force (N), the peak and mean power (W/kg), the vertical&#xD;
      stiffness (Kvert, N/m/kg) and the peak rate of force development (RFD, N/s), while at the&#xD;
      same time will be evaluated the change in peak and mean normalized EMG during the eccentric&#xD;
      and concentric phases of the counter movement jump, for the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus&#xD;
      lateralis muscles. Electromyography data will be collected wirelessly at 2.000 Hz using a&#xD;
      Myon MA-320 EMG system. In addition, the peak eccentric and concentric isokinetic torque of&#xD;
      the knee flexors and extensors, in both limbs will be evaluated on an isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
      at 60o/sec. Also, the isometric peak torque of the knee extensors will be evaluated at 65o in&#xD;
      both limbs. All the above markers will be evaluated 24, 48 and 192 hours post eccentric&#xD;
      protocol, however at these time points, fasting blood samples (20ml) will be collected in&#xD;
      order to estimate hematological and biochemical indicators. Α 2 - week washout period will be&#xD;
      adapted among trials. After, the participants will perform the process until they complete&#xD;
      the trials.&#xD;
