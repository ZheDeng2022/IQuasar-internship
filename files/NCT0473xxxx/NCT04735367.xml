    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multicenter, observational study in Japan. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate overall survival (OS) in Japanese patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      who have been treated with palbociclib plus letrozole. This observational study was planned&#xD;
      as follow-up study of Japanese phase 2 study of palbociclib (NCT01684215, phase 2 portion of&#xD;
      A5481010 study).&#xD;
