  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of alendronate sodium vitamin D3 tablets&#xD;
      compared with placebo on the improvement of joint structure and joint pain in participants&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis. The treatment period of this study is one year and followed-up&#xD;
      period is 2 years. The results of knee joint MRI will be evaluated by using the WORMS score.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study This study is&#xD;
      planned to commence after obtaining Ethics Committee approval. participants will be&#xD;
      randomised to a one-year course of alendronate sodium vitamin D3 tablets or placebo. 1:1&#xD;
      double blinded randomisation will be undertaken. This study plans to enroll 60 participants&#xD;
      and will be carried out in three domestic centers (Peking Union Medical College Hospital,&#xD;
      Zhongshan Hospital and The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University) with a&#xD;
      follow-up period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the main goal of this exploratory study is to evaluate the effect of alendronate sodium&#xD;
      vitamin D3 tablets compared with placebo on the improvement of joint structure and joint pain&#xD;
      in participants with knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcome measure is WORMS score of knee&#xD;
      joint MRI at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
