  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, which seeks to compare two groups of&#xD;
      volunteers (naive and previously exposed to malaria) vaccinated with three doses of a&#xD;
      synthetic derivative of the CS protein of Plasmodium vivax to determine their protective&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then volunteers will be subject to an infectious challenge (Controlled Human Malaria&#xD;
      Infection) to assess the infectivity of gametocytes in the blood early stage of P. vivax in&#xD;
      Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective controlled, blinded clinical trial, designed to establish the&#xD;
      protective efficacy induced by the vaccine PvCSP between human volunteers with and without&#xD;
      history of malaria. Volunteers will be recruited in Cali, Colombia and Quibdó, Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: This study will require the involvement of two types of volunteers, parasite&#xD;
      donors and volunteers for immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasite donors: 5-15 P. vivax-infected patients who will serve as parasites donors for&#xD;
      experimental infection of mosquitoes, who will be enrolled in the endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers for immunization: Two other groups of volunteers will be immunized with the PvCSP&#xD;
      vaccine. A group of 60 people without previous exposure to malaria (naïve) and another 60&#xD;
      people with a history of previous malaria infection (pre-immune).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Recruitment of infected patients: Parasite donors will be recruited among P.&#xD;
      vivax infected patients attending a diagnostic center in the endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection of mosquito's blood from donors will be used to feed three-day-old mosquitoes by&#xD;
      artificial membrane feeding technique. At day 7, a sample of mosquitoes will be examined to&#xD;
      determine the level of infection by dissection of the mosquito's gut. On day 14, a small&#xD;
      number of mosquitoes with a good degree of infectivity will be used to infect challenged&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of pre-immune and naive volunteers: Volunteers for the immunization stage will be&#xD;
      recruited both in the city of Cali (Colombia), non-endemic region, and in Quibdó (Colombia),&#xD;
      a malaria endemic region, through various activities such as conferences, meetings and other&#xD;
      strategies previously approved by the IRB, like posters, radio advertising flyers and social&#xD;
      media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization: Volunteers will be immunized with the vaccine (n=60) or placebo (n=60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of volunteers will be performed under medical vigilance during the first hour&#xD;
      following the immunization to detect any adverse reaction. After the first hour period a&#xD;
      medical exam will be made. Eight hours after immunization, each volunteer will be contacted&#xD;
      via telephone to assess physical condition. Any adverse event (AE) will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent follow up will be made on the day next to immunization and 1 or 2 weeks before the&#xD;
      next immunization by a new clinical evaluation and AE report. Volunteers will be instructed&#xD;
      to contact the research staff at any moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection of volunteers immunized volunteers will be challenged on day ~150 of the study, 1&#xD;
      month after the third immunization by the bite of 2-4 infected mosquito. A &quot;feeding cage&quot;&#xD;
      will be placed on the forearm of a volunteer for 10 minutes, allowing that the feeding&#xD;
      window, which will be covered by a mesh surface be placed against the volunteer's skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be instructed about the signs and symptoms of malaria and they will have a&#xD;
      daily telephone contact during the first 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between days 7 and 23 the volunteers will be asked to go to the Clinical Trials Unit daily to&#xD;
      establish the presence or absence of disease through thick blood smear and samples will be&#xD;
      collected for retrospective real time PCR P. vivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 23 until day 31, volunteers will receive physical and laboratory evaluation every&#xD;
      other day and will have daily telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patients present signs and symptoms of the disease curative treatment will be&#xD;
      immediately provided, and 15 ml of blood will be drawn, which will be used for immune&#xD;
      response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteers do not develop the disease during the follow-up period, on day 31 they will&#xD;
      be given antimalarial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Volunteers will be treated with antimalarial drugs approved by the Colombian&#xD;
      Ministry of Social Health: chloroquine (three (3) doses: 600 mg initially, followed by 450 mg&#xD;
      at 24, and 48 hours), associated with primaquine (30mg/day) for 14 days. All the volunteers&#xD;
      will be asked to return two weeks after starting treatment for a thick blood smear test to&#xD;
      ensure cure of malaria.&#xD;
