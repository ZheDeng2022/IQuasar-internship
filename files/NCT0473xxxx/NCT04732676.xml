      This translational project is the clinical application of research results from the&#xD;
      University of Bordeaux, Sanpsy Lab, CNRS USR3413 - on individual predictors of substance use.&#xD;
      This project will test the efficacy of a smartphone application to help subjects concerned&#xD;
      about reducing or stopping their substance use / behavioral addiction. This new therapeutic&#xD;
      tool, designed by University of Bordeaux, Sanpsy Lab, CNRS USR3413 - to manage craving and&#xD;
      individual predictors of use, will offer the possibility of an easy to-use and personalized&#xD;
      intervention accessible to the greatest number of subjects. Based on our previous results&#xD;
      that supports that, for all types of addiction, craving and individual cues are a significant&#xD;
      drive for use in people with addiction, the application tested in this study was designed to&#xD;
      be used among people presenting various types of addiction (substance and behavioral&#xD;
      addictions). The application will also evaluate all concurrent substance uses and addictive&#xD;
      behaviors to identify and prevent risk of addiction transfers.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing two parallel groups. This is a comparative study of superiority that evaluates the efficacy of using an interventional smartphone application,in reducing main problematic substance use/addictive behavior after 4 weeks, and after 4 months among participants requesting treatment for substance or behavioral addiction.</intervention_model_description>

It is an heteroevaluation of craving for all substances and addictive behaviors reported by the subject. This tool explores the frequency of craving, corresponding to the number of days craving was reported during the last 30 days, as well as mean and maximum intensity on a scale ranging from 0 (no craving) to 10 (extreme craving).&#xD;

    <description>During the 4 weeks use of the application, all participants will be instructed to complete 4 daily EMA electronic interviews to assess craving-and substance use/addictive behavior (see Serre, Fatseas et al. 2012). At each electronic interview, participants will be asked to rate the maximum level of craving (i.e. the desire to use the main substance/addictive behavior) that they felt since the previous assessment on a seven-point scale (1 no desire to 7 extreme desire), and will also be asked if they had used, since the previous assessment, the main substance/addictive(yes/no)&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility, acceptability and intervention satisfaction will be assessed at the one-month follow-up by number of days and frequency of use of the application (calculated from EMA responses: number of questionnaires answered on total number of questionnaires proposed by the application), with acceptability questionnaire (AES) and with a specific questionnaire assessing intervention satisfaction, rate of participants not completing the study, and reasons for stopping.&#xD;
The Acceptability E-scale is a 6-item questionnaire that evaluates the extent to which subjects find E-health systems acceptable. Each item is ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, generating a total score of acceptability ranging from 6 (lowest acceptability) to 30 (highest acceptability) (Micoulaud-Franchi, Sauteraud et al. 2016)</description>

Follow-ups measures will be compared to baseline measures, and the difference will be compared between the two groups.</description>
