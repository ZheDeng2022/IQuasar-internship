  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective and effective research study. The aim is to assess the difference&#xD;
      in the quality of life of the family members of patients with colorectal cancer after&#xD;
      application of follow-up disease management using mobile network terminals and routine&#xD;
      clinical treatment follow-up management. The hypothesis is that the application of&#xD;
      mobile-based disease management system significantly improves the quality of life of the&#xD;
      patients' family members, thereby improving the quality of life of the patients' families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 families of colorectal cancer patients who had been diagnosed as high-risk&#xD;
      stage II or stage III and required adjuvant chemotherapy XELOX regimen within 6 months after&#xD;
      initial diagnosis were randomly assigned to the control and study groups at a 1: 1 ratio,&#xD;
      with approximately 50 cases in the control group and about 50 patients in the study group.&#xD;
      The reason for choosing these tumors is because the patients with these tumors will present a&#xD;
      series of clinical symptoms during the treatment, which requires family members to take care&#xD;
      of them. All patient and their family demographics, questionnaires on quality of life of&#xD;
      patient's family, adverse events and other information will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a network-centric randomization system. In the randomization process,&#xD;
      stratified randomization will be carried out according to the education level of the&#xD;
      patient's family members (junior college degree or above vs. below college degree). The&#xD;
      family members of the patients participating in the study will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      tumor patient management platform or clinical routine treatment follow-up group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members of all patients will be followed up to 2 months after randomization, or&#xD;
      withdrew from the study (with the preceding events as the end point). Unless the patient's&#xD;
      family member withdraws from the study, lost to follow-up, or the study is terminated, the&#xD;
      patient is considered to be in the study. Family members of patients who are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the full management platform need to participate in a 60 minutes concentrated&#xD;
      training session for 27 days, taught by experts online. The content of the lectures includes&#xD;
      medical treatment guidelines, pain relief, family rehabilitation, family communication,&#xD;
      family roles, early screening prevention, Medical insurance and other aspects. The contents&#xD;
      of the online courses are: 1) Doctors are also mortal; 2) New medicines and new therapies; 3)&#xD;
      Alternative therapies; 4) Don't panic during the operation; 5) Pain relief; 6) Side effects&#xD;
      of treatment; 8) About the truth; 9) New topics; 10) Anti-cancer cost-effectiveness; 11)&#xD;
      Medical insurance; 12) Commercial medical insurance; 13) Exercise and rehabilitation; 14)&#xD;
      Nutrition and Foods to increase leukocytes level ; 15) Long-term persistence; 16) Acceptance&#xD;
      Change; 17) Two new roles; 18) Future expectation.&#xD;

    <description>First of all, The Cronbach's α coefficient of the QOLLTI-F family quality of life questionnaire that is used in this study will be calculated; then the minimum, maximum, median (quartile) and mean (standard deviation) of the quality of life scores of the family members of the study group and the control group will be determined; finally we will use t test to compare the scores to investigate whether there is a difference in the quality of life score between two groups; in order to eliminate the influence of confounding factors (such as age, gender, education level, etc.) on the main research results, several common influencing factors will be selected to construct a covariance analysis regression model to assess whether the intervention strategy of this study has an impact on the quality of life of patients' family members.</description>

    <description>Patients' families are grouped based on their educational level, and the minimum, maximum, median (quartile), and mean (standard deviation) of the scores of quality of life questionnaire of each group will be calculated; Analysis of variance will be used to compare whether there are differences in the quality of life scores of patients' families among different education levels. If a general difference occurs, the Bonferroni method will be used to further perform multiple comparisons. At the same time, the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test will be used to compare the overall differences between the groups and the Steel-Dwass-Critchlow-Fligner test will be used for further multiple comparisons.</description>
