  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading agent involved in community-acquired&#xD;
      bacterial pneumopathies and bacterial meningitis. The frequency of these infections is&#xD;
      increasing in at-risk subjects. Paradoxically, pneumococcal vaccination coverage in this type&#xD;
      of patient is limited at the national level, even though the French High Council for Public&#xD;
      Health (HCSP) has been extending the 13-valent conjugate and 23-valent non-conjugate double&#xD;
      vaccination in this target population since March 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients generally benefit from regular medical follow-up involving several health&#xD;
      professionals in hospital or outpatient clinics. In spite of this, one of the factors&#xD;
      identified as a hindrance to pneumococcal vaccination is the absence of a proposal from the&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to assess compliance with the recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
      according to the High Council of Public Health (HCSP) in at-risk patients leaving hospital.&#xD;
      We also wish to measure the potential impact of an intervention by the clinical pharmacist on&#xD;
      the application of these recommendations.&#xD;
