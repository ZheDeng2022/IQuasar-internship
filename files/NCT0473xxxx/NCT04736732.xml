      Sample Size: n=570&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Ceiling: n=627&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients age 18 to 100 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Period: February 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start Date: January 1, 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Date: March 1, 2025&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration includes 18 months to recruit patients and 24 months of total follow-up&#xD;
      time counted from the first day of COVID-19 symptoms or date of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate the short- and&#xD;
      long-term end-organ complications of COVID-19 and to establish a COVID-19 biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who had previous asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (mild=never required&#xD;
           supplemental oxygen during the acute phase of the infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who had previous moderate or severe COVID-19 (moderate=required supplemental&#xD;
           oxygen by nasal cannula during the acute phase of the infection; severe=required&#xD;
           supplemental oxygen by either high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
           ventilation or intubation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who had COVID-19 but did not have signs or symptoms related to COVID-19 lasting&#xD;
           beyond 4 weeks from the date of COVID-19 symptom-onset or diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who have not had COVID-19 (i.e. patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and&#xD;
           who never had symptoms consistent with COVID-19)&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the short- and long-term end-organ complications post-COVID-19 in relation to&#xD;
           the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish a post-COVID-19 biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Develop a model based that may predict the development of end-organ complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of any end-organ complication that can plausibly be related to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detection of any new abnormality on echocardiogram &gt;4 weeks after COVID-19 symptom-onset&#xD;
           or diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Detection of any new abnormality on pulmonary function testing (PFT) or any change in&#xD;
           PFT compared to a pre- or post-COVID-19 baseline PFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An increase in liver enzymes &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal that occurs post-COVID-19&#xD;
           and is not associated to any other process (e.g. cholestasis, drug toxicity, alcohol&#xD;
           abuse, hepatitis A, B, C, D, E).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any change in pre-COVID-19 weight, waist circumference or body mass composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any change in blood glucose, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), Glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
           (HgA1C), lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T4 from pre-COVID-19 baseline&#xD;
           that begins or persists &gt;4 weeks after COVID-19 symptom-onset or diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A positive fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin measurement occurring &gt;4 weeks after&#xD;
           COVID-19 symptom-onset or diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any significant change in renal parameters (e.g. micro-albuminuria, serum creatinine,&#xD;
           glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) detected &gt;4 weeks after COVID-19 symptom-onset or&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Any change in dietary habits (nutritional quantity and quality) as measured by the Food&#xD;
           Frequency Questionnaire, in physical activity as measured by pedometer reading, and/or&#xD;
           well-being as measured by our Well-Being Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any impact on neuro-psychological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (for more than 28 days) will have up to 5 medical visits&#xD;
      (depending on the time since diagnosis) over the course of 24 months from the date of&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptom onset or diagnosis. COVID-19 negative patients will have up to 3 medical&#xD;
      visits. The data will be collected for clinical monitoring and biobanking purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Well-being questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food frequency questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam (if indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight and height measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impedance / evaluation of body mass composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pedometer reading (worn for 7 days continuously)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous glucose monitoring (monitor worn for 14 days continuously)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool collection (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasopharyngeal swab (optional)&#xD;
