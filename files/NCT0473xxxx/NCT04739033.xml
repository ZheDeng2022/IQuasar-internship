      This study aims to analyze the effects of a online program focused on promoting healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle habits (healthy eating and increased physical activity), on obese or overweight&#xD;
      adults with hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public&#xD;
      hospital. These patients will be randomized allocated into two interventional groups:&#xD;
      experimental group will receive audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist&#xD;
      doctor, and the control group from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include:&#xD;
      body composition (BMI), blood pressure, and eating behaviour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension incidence and overweight or obesity related, constitute a worrying public health&#xD;
      problem nowadays. Evidence indicates that, despite the existence of several factors involved&#xD;
      in their etiology, diet and physical activity play a particularly important role in the&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of obesity and associated disorders. However, interventions for the&#xD;
      treatment of obesity encounter some environmental and personal barriers, specifically&#xD;
      problems or deficits in motivation. These barriers sometimes make it difficult to implement&#xD;
      intervention strategies. In this sense, there is an important agreement about the need to&#xD;
      generate alternatives and strategies which promote intrinsic motivation, self-regulation and&#xD;
      self-efficacy as fundamental variables which have a direct relationship with the adherence&#xD;
      and success of obesity treatments. To achieve this, Information and Communication&#xD;
      Technologies (ICTs) are a very promising alternative, as they can provide personalised&#xD;
      feedback and can be flexibly adapted to each user. In addition, ICTs also present other&#xD;
      important advantages, especially their excellent cost-benefit ratio, and the possibility of&#xD;
      increasing the efficiency of the interventions, since they allow to reach a greater number of&#xD;
      users at a lower cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months duration self-applied online&#xD;
      program, composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy lifestyle habits (healthy eating&#xD;
      and increased physical activity), on obese or overweight adults with hypertension.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public hospital. These patients&#xD;
      will be randomized allocated into two interventional groups: experimental group will receive&#xD;
      audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist doctor, and the control group&#xD;
      from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include: body composition (BMI), blood&#xD;
      pressure, and eating behaviour.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire has 33 items, 13 of which refer to the emotional eating scale (eg, 'Desire to eat when irritated') and 10 of which refer to the external (eg, 'Eating when you feel lonely') and restrictive (eg, 'Difficult to resist delicious food') scales. The items can be rated on a five-point Likert-type scale, with a score of 1 indicating 'never' and 5 indicating 'very often (range 33-165). The lower the scores are, the lower the problematic eating behaviours are.</description>
