  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the study is that telerehabilitation is an effective treatment method&#xD;
      and it is not inferior than standard physiotherapy.The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of telerehabilitation in patients with subacromial pain syndrome by comparing&#xD;
      it with standard physiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial pain syndrome formerly known as subacromial impingement syndrome is the cause of&#xD;
      approximately 44% to 65% of pain complaints related to the shoulder. Methods such as&#xD;
      immobilization, drug therapy, injection techniques, physical therapy modalities and&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, acupuncture and surgery can be used in the treatment&#xD;
      of the disease. Due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan&#xD;
      province of China in December 2019, the problems in patients' access to hospitals and&#xD;
      rehabilitation services caused telerehabilitation to be on the agenda. Telerehabilitation can&#xD;
      be summarized as the delivery of rehabilitation services to those in need by using&#xD;
      communication technologies. This method covers the steps of evaluation, monitoring,&#xD;
      prevention, intervention, control, training, and consultation. Although there are many&#xD;
      studies on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in the literature, there is no study on&#xD;
      the superiority of telerehabilitation, physical therapy under supervision and home exercise&#xD;
      program over each other.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Pain Intensity at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one and three month after the randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to mark their pain by giving a score between zero (no pain) and 10 (the most severe pain) on a 10 cm long visual analog scale (VAS) during each visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline SPADI total score at 1 and 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one and three month after the randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a questionnaire with a total of 13 questions developed to measure shoulder pain and associated disability. In the subgroup of the pain, the patient is asked to express the severity of him/her pain by giving a score between zero (no pain) and 10 (the most severe pain) during different activities in the last week. In the subgroup of disability, the patient is asked to score between zero (no difficulty) and 10 (receiving assistance) how hard they have experienced during different activities in the last week. Zero points indicate maximum well-being, 130 points indicate maximum disability.</description>

    <description>Patients in the standard physiotherapy group will receive one-to-one physiotherapy sessions in the hospital 5 days a week for 3 weeks. In these sessions, active-passive exercises accompanied by a physiotherapist and physical therapy methods (electrotherapy and thermotherapy) will be applied in accordance with the standard procedure according to the patient's needs.</description>

    <description>The home exercise program was explained to the patients in the control group by the physiotherapist and the relevant brochures were delivered to the patients. Home exercise program will consist of telerehabilitation group exercises. However, patients will be not under any supervision and exercise themselves at home.</description>
