  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss&#xD;
      worldwide, and nearly two million Australians have some signs of AMD. This proposed project&#xD;
      is a prospective, observational study that seeks to to understand the underlying aetiology of&#xD;
      AMD, factors associated with differences between age-related macular degeneration (AMD)&#xD;
      phenotypes or severities, or between AMD and healthy individuals. It also seeks to understand&#xD;
      the natural history of AMD progression and the factors associated with the rate of&#xD;
      progression. In this project, the disease phenotype, genotype and severity and rate of&#xD;
      progression will be determined based on non-invasive clinical imaging or functional&#xD;
      assessment of the retina, from obtaining biological samples from the participants, or from&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The second aim of this project is to characterise the natural history of AMD and factors associated with its rate of progression. These aims will be achieved by using performing imaging and functional assessment of the retina, characterisation of the genetic, systemic and environmental factors, and by obtaining patient-reported outcomes.</description>
