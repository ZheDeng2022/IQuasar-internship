  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autophagy is considered one of the key molecular mechanisms for the broad preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of periodic fasting. While it is generally known that fasting induces&#xD;
      autophagy, there are no human studies that focus on the size and temporal kinetics of&#xD;
      autophagy and its association with fasting specific signaling pathways. The kinetics of&#xD;
      autophagy in patients with chronic diseases will now be compared with the kinetics of&#xD;
      autophagy in healthy subjects, who both fast according to the same scheme; and further&#xD;
      changes in metabolic and inflammatory parameters will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic fasting has been used for many decades in naturopathy and integrative medicine&#xD;
      clinically successfully in the treatment of chronic diseases and pain syndromes. In&#xD;
      particular, fasting therapy is used for chronic rheumatic, inflammatory, and metabolic&#xD;
      diseases with increasing patient demand in specialized clinical facilities (fasting clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the various historically developed forms of fasting, the fasting program according to&#xD;
      the Buchinger Wilhelmi method has established itself worldwide as the most frequently applied&#xD;
      method. This involves a subtotal caloric restriction with a daily caloric intake&#xD;
      (200-400kcal/day) in the form of liquid components over a defined period of at least 10 days,&#xD;
      accompanied by supporting measures of a health-promoting lifestyle program with elements such&#xD;
      as exercise therapy, manual procedures, stress reduction and hydro-balneotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In early randomized studies and a systematic review, the effectiveness of inpatient fasting&#xD;
      therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis was proven with 1a evidence. For the other&#xD;
      indications, there is mainly empirical evidence or data from observation or prospective&#xD;
      uncontrolled studies. In recent years, extensive basic science research activity has&#xD;
      developed in the area of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. In this context, a&#xD;
      large number of favorable animal experimental findings have been demonstrated by defined&#xD;
      fasting periods, including reductions in insulin, IGF-1, increases in adiponectins, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, neurotrophic factors, and, over longer observation periods, a decrease in the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic, and more recently oncological&#xD;
      diseases in a wide variety of animal species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that fasting or total or subtotal caloric&#xD;
      restriction is a potent inducer of cellular autophagy. For autophagy, numerous beneficial&#xD;
      effects on chronic diseases or disease defense functions have now been experimentally&#xD;
      documented and also hypothesized for humans, including neurodegenerative and metabolic&#xD;
      diseases, but also acute infections and inflammatory diseases. Unclear to date is the&#xD;
      kinetics of the autophagy enhancing effect of fasting. In theoretical transfer from animal&#xD;
      experimental data, an increase is postulated between 12 and 36h of fasting and possibly a&#xD;
      decrease after several days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, autophagy will now be investigated for the first time in blood&#xD;
      samples from fasting healthy and diseased individuals in an exploratory clinical study.&#xD;
