      To compare analgesic effects of preoperative administration of paracetamol 500 milligram plus&#xD;
      codeine 30 milligram in single-tablet and effervescent formulation to ibuprofen 400&#xD;
      milligram, and placebo in the management of moderate to severe postoperative pain after&#xD;
      mandibular third molar surgery.&#xD;

      Materials and methods: One hundred twenty healthy outpatients aged 15 to 29 years undergoing&#xD;
      surgical removal of one bony impacted mandibular third molar were enrolled in this,&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, randomized, triple-blind parallel-group, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      clinical trial. Study participants were randomly assigned to three treatment arms. According&#xD;
      to the concealed allocation, each patient 30 minutes before surgery received paracetamol 500&#xD;
      mg plus codeine 30 mg (group A), ibuprofen 400 mg (group B) or placebo (group C). Rescue&#xD;
      therapy allowed in the postoperative period was paracetamol 500 mg plus codeine 30 mg in&#xD;
      groups A and C and ibuprofen 400 mg in group B. Patients recorded on Numerical Rating&#xD;
      Scale-11 (NRS-11) the pain intensity, total number of postoperative-supplement medications&#xD;
      and time of the first intake, until 12-hours after surgery and over extra two days&#xD;
