      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) a condition characterized by atherosclerotic occlusive&#xD;
      disease of the lower extremities is commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD) patients, particularly those on dialysis. The investigators conducted detailed&#xD;
      biomarkers such as thrombospondin and related inflammatory biomarkers for the risk of&#xD;
      developing and presence of PAD. Thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) is an extracellular matrix protein&#xD;
      of the vessel wall. Despite bench evidence, its significance in the clinical setting of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is missing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional, single-center study. A cohort of 450 patients aged 20 or over, who&#xD;
      have been on HD for at least 3 months prior to enrollment (Dec 1, 2021) will be included.&#xD;
      TSP-4 and TSP-1 will be measured in HD patients using a commercially available ELISA. PAD is&#xD;
      diagnosed by the ankle-brachial index (ABI) We will measure related blood biomarkers such as&#xD;
      serum hs-cTnT, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, s-Klotho and FABP-4.&#xD;

      Study Population and Data Source This is a cross-sectional, single-center study which will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Dialysis Center of Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital (TTMHH) in the&#xD;
      coastal region of central Taiwan. A cohort of 450 patients aged 20 or over, who have been on&#xD;
      HD for at least 3 months prior to enrollment (Dec 1, 2021) will be included. The medical&#xD;
      charts of these patients are reviewed for eligibility identification, and should be&#xD;
      compatible with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and enrolled in our analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the diagnostic criterion for asymptomatic PAD is an ABI value lower than or&#xD;
      equal to 0.9 with no clinical symptoms in the lower limb such as muscle discomfort or&#xD;
      intermittent claudication. PAD is considered symptomatic if patients have an ABI ≤0.9 and&#xD;
      clinical symptoms or if they undergo previous surgical revascularization procedures or limb&#xD;
      amputation. The characteristics of patients will be exclude from our study were (1) baseline&#xD;
      ABI values &gt; 1.3 , (2) symptomatic PAD , (3) decompensated cirrhosis , (4) neoplastic&#xD;
      diseases , (5) incomplete data, (6) receiving hemodialysis &lt; 3 months and active infection.&#xD;
      The baseline data such as demographics, comorbidities, anthropometrics, and relevant&#xD;
      laboratory data, clinical diagnosis of PAD based on measurements of ABI, and medication&#xD;
      history will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle Brachial Index Measurements The ABI was measured by trained technicians using the&#xD;
      Fukuda Vascular Screening System (VaSera VS-1000™, Fukuda Denshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan),&#xD;
      which measures blood pressure from bilateral arm and ankle (brachial and posterior tibial&#xD;
      arteries, resp.) simultaneously by an oscillometric method. The systolic pressure of the arm&#xD;
      without dialysis access and the lower value of the ankle systolic pressure were used for the&#xD;
      calculation. ABI was calculated by the ratio of the ankle systolic pressure divided by the&#xD;
      arm systolic pressure. Of the two ABI values, respectively, calculated from the left- and&#xD;
      right-limb measurements, the lowest value is used in this study. All participants were&#xD;
      annually measured in a supine position after resting for at least 15 minutes and before&#xD;
      dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, ABI less than 0.90 was considered as evidence of PAD . Absence of PAD was&#xD;
      defined as ABI between 0.90 and 1.30 . Individuals with ABI greater than 1.30 were excluded,&#xD;
      because this indicates poorly compressible leg arteries and inability to gauge arterial&#xD;
      perfusion accurately .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Mesaurements Blood was drawn with EDTA anticoagulant in the morning after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 12 h before a dialysis session. The samples were separated via&#xD;
      centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min) and immediately stored at -80°C for subsequent assays.&#xD;
      Glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL), triglycerides and total cholesterol are&#xD;
      all measured by standard assays using the analyzer. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)&#xD;
      is measured by standard assay. Beta 2 microglobulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (hsCRP) and are measuredusing standard nephelometry. Serum hs-cTnT was measured using a&#xD;
      sandwich immunoassay method, a novel highly sensitive assay with a lower measurable limit of&#xD;
      3 ng/L. N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP) is measured using a sandwich&#xD;
      immunoassay method, the lower limits of quantification were 5 pg/mL. The serum levels of&#xD;
      a-Klotho were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, and this&#xD;
      assay detects circulating a-Klotho using 2 monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize&#xD;
      the extracellular domain of Klotho, the lower limits of quantification were 6.15 pg/mL and&#xD;
      the intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation of &lt;10%. Plasma blood concentrations&#xD;
      of FABP4 were measured by means of (sandwich) ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).&#xD;
      Plasma TSP-1 and TSP-4 levels were assessed via ELISA. Calculated intra-assay and interassay&#xD;
      coefficient of variation for TSP-4 were 9.3% and 7.7%, respectively.&#xD;
