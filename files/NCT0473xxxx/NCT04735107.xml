    <textblock>
      Background: Dehiscence of colorectal anastomosis is a serious complication associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality and impaired functional and oncological outcomes. We hypothesised that&#xD;
      anastomosis reinforcement and vacuum trans-anal drainage could eliminate some risk factors of&#xD;
      colorectal anastomotic dehiscence,including mechanically stapled anastomosis instability and&#xD;
      local infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study included consecutive patients older than 18 years who had low anterior resection of&#xD;
      the rectum and anastomosis performed by double-stapler technique, for rectal cancer located&#xD;
      within 10 cm from the anal verge. All patients had undergone pelvic magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging. Nutrition screening was performed in all patients. If patients had undergone&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CHRT), restaging was performed within 6 weeks of CHRT&#xD;
      completion, and surgery was performed 10 weeks after CHRT completion. For the surgical&#xD;
      procedure, low anterior resection (LAR) was performed by experienced surgeons who perform&#xD;
      more than 50 rectal procedures per year and have sufficient expertise in minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery. Oral bowel preparation was used preoperatively and antibiotics were administered&#xD;
      according to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedure milestones (descending colon blood perfusion, tension-free anastomosis,&#xD;
           safely performed stapled anastomosis and reinforcement, and safely performed mucosal&#xD;
           flap) were defined. Simultaneous checkpoints to control milestones were identified and&#xD;
           methodology of their documentation (video, photography) were defined. The purpose was to&#xD;
           achieve demonstrable control over the individual steps during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Abdominal phase&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laparoscopic procedures were performed in the Lloyd-Davis position, using the 4-ports&#xD;
           technique. During the abdominal phase, dissection was guided by a medio-lateral&#xD;
           approach. A high tie of the a. mesenterica inferior (AMI) was performed in all patients.&#xD;
           Dissection was performed medio-laterally and down to the pelvic floor according to the&#xD;
           principles of total mesorectal excision (TME). The rectum was transected using an&#xD;
           endostapler after lavage with Betadine solution (Egis Pharmaceuticals, PLS, Budapest,&#xD;
           Hungary). Furthermore, the splenic flexure was fully mobilized using a combination of&#xD;
           medio-lateral and lateral approaches. In most cases, the inferior mesenteric vein was&#xD;
           divided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The marginal artery was dissected and the character of arterial blood flow was carefully&#xD;
           evaluated; pulsatile arterial blood flow was considered as sign of adequate colon&#xD;
           perfusion (Checkpoint 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A specimen of tumor was pulled through the minilaparotomy and resected. The descending&#xD;
           colon was divided at the level of the distal part and the colonic mucosa was again&#xD;
           evaluated with respect to blood perfusion; a light red or pink colored mucosa and fresh&#xD;
           light red capillary bleeding were considered as signs of good colonic mucosa perfusion&#xD;
           (Checkpoint 2). The colon needed to lie freely in the sacrum excavation and no tension&#xD;
           was allowed on the mesenterial site. This was confirmed by lifting the colon ventrally&#xD;
           from the sacrum at the promontory level after anastomosis construction (Checkpoint 3).&#xD;
           The anastomosis was performed end-to-end using a double-stapler technique, strictly&#xD;
           between the descending colon and rectum in a tension-free manner. A pelvic drain was&#xD;
           left in place till the third postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Trans-anal phase&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the trans-anal phase, a Lone Star retractor (Cooper Surgical, Inc. USA) and a&#xD;
           plastic single use anoscope were applied. An initial, careful inspection and manual&#xD;
           check of the stapler anastomosis integrity, the blood supply to the colonic mucosa, and&#xD;
           signs of a tension-free anastomosis were performed (Checkpoint 4). The mucosal flap was&#xD;
           subsequently created using individual polydiaxone (PDS) II 5/0 sutures (polydiaxonone,&#xD;
           Ethicon, Johnson&amp;Johnson, USA): individual stitches were placed on each quadrant; and&#xD;
           then another four stitches were applied in between. It is important to note that the&#xD;
           condition of the mucosal flap upon creation were signs of a floppy, prolapsing colonic&#xD;
           wall into the anastomosis. Finally, a sponge soaked (Endo-SPONGE, B. Braun, Germany)&#xD;
           with povidone-iodine (Betadine, Egis Pharmaceuticals, Budapest, Hungary) was introduced&#xD;
           into the anastomosis. The trans-anal sponge drain was removed 24 hrs postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Fecal diversion&#xD;
&#xD;
           The decision on diversion was based on intraoperative checkpoint adherence: when&#xD;
           Checkpoint 6 and 7 were not fulfilled, an ileostomy was created.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data regarding the type of procedure, type of anastomosis, stapler diameter, the number&#xD;
      of stapler cartridges used, dissection of the mesenteric blood vessels, and complete&#xD;
      histopathology were collected prospectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed on&#xD;
      the third and fifth day after surgery.0 Patients were followed up for 3 months, and&#xD;
      postoperative endoscopy was performed before discharge, usually on postoperative day 7, 1&#xD;
      month after surgery, and 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
