  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initially, the exploration of brain metabolism by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS) of the high magnetic field proton (1H) (11.7T) applied to acute and chronic animal&#xD;
      models of Parkinson's disease (PD) showed glutamatergic hyperactivity within the striatum,&#xD;
      one of the components of the basal ganglia. Interestingly, acute administration of L-dopa and&#xD;
      acute, subchronic and chronic deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN)&#xD;
      normalizes these neurochemical profiles. Investigators also show an increase in glutamate&#xD;
      levels in the STN ipsilateral to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) damaged by the&#xD;
      neurotoxin, expected phenomenon, but also and surprisingly in the STN controlateral to the&#xD;
      lesion. A degeneration of dopaminergic neurons is also observed in the controlateral SNpc at&#xD;
      the lesion suggesting that the hyperglutamatergy of the controlateral STN to the lesion could&#xD;
      promote neuronal death in the SNpc and thus participate in the progression and lateralization&#xD;
      of the PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using 3T MRS in PD patients, as in other studies in humans, investigators do not see changes&#xD;
      in glutamate and glutamine levels in the putamen of Parkinsonian patients. This difference&#xD;
      between animal and human studies can be explained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. by the different rate of progression between PD in humans and animal models with&#xD;
           plasticity phenomena limiting glutamatergic hyperactivity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. by the effect of treatment in PD masking changes in glutamate metabolism,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. by limiting sensitivity in the detection of metabolites (Glutamate, glutamine, GABA) at&#xD;
           3T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 7T 1H MRS improves the dispersion of chemical shifts of the metabolites studied,&#xD;
      increases the sensitivity of the measurement, makes it possible to select regions of interest&#xD;
      of smaller volumes (1 cm3) and thus limits the magnetic susceptibility effects that degrade&#xD;
      the quality of the measured signal. This makes it possible to reliably separate glutamate and&#xD;
      glutamine peaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, investigators propose to study the metabolic changes in a homogeneous group&#xD;
      of de novo Parkinsonian patients, naive to any treatment intended to replace the missing&#xD;
      dopamine. The gain in spatial resolution, contrast and signal will allow better&#xD;
      characterization of localized anomalies in small-volume structures such as basal ganglia,&#xD;
      putamen and STN.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The project presented is an open and controlled exploratory prospective study, assessing&#xD;
      metabolic concentrations in putamen and NST left and right of treatment-naïve de novo&#xD;
      Parkinsonian patients compared to healthy subjects. Patients will be included consecutively&#xD;
      following the screening. Since this study is cross-sectional, a single visit will be made. De&#xD;
      novo PD patients will be pre-selected in the departments of Neurology of the CHU of&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand and Poitiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion visit will be carried out during a consultation during their usual follow-up in&#xD;
      the departments of Neurology of the CHU of Clermont-Ferrand and Poitiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be noted: age, sex, level of study, duration of disease progression,&#xD;
      ongoing treatments, medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients verifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be definitively included and&#xD;
      their consents will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De novo PD patients will undergo their NMR examination in the department of radiology, 7T MRI&#xD;
      at the Poitiers hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will report to MRI and the following measurements will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of motor disorders by the UPDRS scale, the Hoehn and Yahr and Schwab and&#xD;
           England score;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acquisition of NMR images and spectra. The experimental time will be 30 minutes for the&#xD;
           UPDRS scale and 30 minutes for the NMR exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the subjects in the control group will be carried out in the patients' family&#xD;
      and in that of the staff of the departments of neurology and radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be matched to de novo PD patients according to age, sex and level of education. In&#xD;
      practice, after pre-screening the control subjects, they will be informed about the protocol,&#xD;
      their consent will be collected. The following data will also be noted: age, sex, duration&#xD;
      and level of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verification of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the witnesses will take the NMR&#xD;
      examination in the Radiological Department, 7T MRI at the Poitiers University Hospital&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

    <description>The MRI protocol will be performed at 7T on a Siemens NMR imaging system (Magnetom Terra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), the radio frequency emission and signal reception will be done through a head quadrature resonator (64-channel phase-array coil). To avoid motion-related artifacts, the patient will be seated in a supine position, with the arms along the body and the head immobilized using a suitable head restraint. The MR protocol will take place in two phases:&#xD;
Acquisition of 3D multi-slice T1 and T2-weighted morphological images to identify areas of interest;&#xD;
Acquisition of 1D RMN spectra in the right and left putamen and STN. Spectra will be acquired in volumes of interest of 15mmx15mmx15mm using a localized spectroscopy sequence with and without suppression of the water signal. Main parameters are: TR (repetition time)=3000ms; TE (echo time)=20 ms; number of repetitions=128; scan time 6min).</description>
