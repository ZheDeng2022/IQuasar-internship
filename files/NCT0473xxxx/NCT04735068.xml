      This study will evaluate using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) along with binimetinib as an&#xD;
      effective method for treating cancer. All patients will receive binimetinib at a standard&#xD;
      dose approved for other cancers. The dose of HCQ will also be fixed based on ongoing phase I&#xD;
      studies. Eligible subjects will have lung cancer that has a mutation in a key cancer gene&#xD;
      called KRAS, and the cancer has spread to other parts of their body.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with B 45 mg two times daily and HCQ 400 mg twice daily beginning on day 1. The dose of HCQ is based on an ongoing Phase 1 trial, and may be modified in a future amendment prior to the first patient enrolled. Efforts will be made to ensure dose homogeneity throughout the trial. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis on a 28 day cycle</description>
