  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether the Support, Educate, Empower (SEE) personalized Glaucoma&#xD;
      Coaching Program improves eye drop medication adherence among glaucoma patients compared to&#xD;
      enhanced standard care in a randomized controlled clinical trial. As a secondary outcome, the&#xD;
      study will test whether glaucoma related distress decreases among SEE program participants&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that glaucoma patients with poor adherence who receive&#xD;
      motivational-interviewing based counseling and personalized education from a trained&#xD;
      non-physician glaucoma coach through the SEE Program will improve their medication adherence&#xD;
      compared to glaucoma patients standard care enhanced by additional educational handouts.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured objectively using electronic monitors with a bottle-in-bottle technique where all glaucoma medications are placed inside electronic pill bottles. An adherent event is defined as using an eye drop medication within a specified time window of a dose on the previous day. Adherence will be calculated as the proportion of doses taken on time divided by total doses prescribed over the six-month study period. For participants on more than one medication, adherence will be first measured at the medication level and then aggregated to the person level by dividing the total number of doses of all medication(s) taken on time by the total number of doses prescribed. Mean medication adherence will be compared at six months between the intervention and control groups.</description>

    <description>Glaucoma-related Distress will be measured by the Diabetes Distress Scale adapted for glaucoma, a 17-item scale where a higher score indicates a higher distress level.

    <description>This is a six-month personalized glaucoma coaching program where a coach trained in motivational interviewing (MI)-based counseling uses a web based tool that generates tailored education to help glaucoma patients identify their barriers to optimal medication adherence and explore potential solutions during three in-person coaching sessions. The coach provides between-session support through four phone calls, with two phone calls between the first and second session and one phone call after each subsequent session. Participants can elect to receive any of the following type of alarm when a dose of medication is due: visual or audible alert or automated text or phone call reminder. Glaucoma medication adherence will be monitored electronically for all participants between the baseline visit and the exit visit six months later.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive non-tailored educational materials about glaucoma from leading sources by mail every 2 months for a total of 3 mailings during the 6-month study period. Glaucoma medication adherence will be monitored electronically for all participants between the baseline visit and the exit visit six months later.</description>
