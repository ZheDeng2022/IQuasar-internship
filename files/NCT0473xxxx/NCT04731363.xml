  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal goal for the study is to examine whether ingestion of a beverage containing&#xD;
      artificial sweeteners alters in vitro platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the increasing number of cardiometabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, in&#xD;
      the population, the use of artificial sweeteners to replace free sugars has been gaining&#xD;
      popularity. Two popular artificial sweeteners are erythritol and xylitol. Erythritol and&#xD;
      xylitol are both naturally occurring polyols found in fruits and vegetables. They are potent&#xD;
      artificial sweeteners with a higher sweetening intensity and lower calorie content than table&#xD;
      sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that the higher levels of sugar alcohols, like those used as&#xD;
      artificial sweeteners, in the blood are related to a higher risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications, like heart attacks and strokes, and death. This may be because higher levels&#xD;
      of sugar alcohols in one's blood may increase the activity of platelets, which would then&#xD;
      increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. The investigators therefore want to find if&#xD;
      consuming a single beverage that contains an artificial sweetener can raise the levels of&#xD;
      sugar alcohols in the blood and if it can alter platelet function or aggregation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if drinking a single beverage that contains an&#xD;
      artificial sweetener can perceptibly alter the activity of platelets in the body. Platelets&#xD;
      are a component of blood that are primarily responsible for helping to stop bleeding and&#xD;
      repair damaged blood vessels by grouping together, a process known as aggregation, to form&#xD;
      clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial sweeteners are popular because they have a lower calorie content than table sugar&#xD;
      while still making food and beverages sweet. Their use as a sugar substitute is especially&#xD;
      attractive for people with heart disease or diabetes, or for people who are trying to lose&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two popular artificial sweeteners are erythritol and xylitol. Erythritol and xylitol are both&#xD;
      naturally occurring polyols, also called sugar alcohols, found in fruits and vegetables. They&#xD;
      are potent artificial sweeteners with a higher sweetening intensity and lower calorie content&#xD;
      than table sugar.This makes them attractive for the use as sugar substitutes or alternatives,&#xD;
      particularly for patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, there is no prospective data available about polyols with respect to their impact&#xD;
      on event outcomes in cardiovascular patients, despite their extensive use in the food&#xD;
      industry. Moreover, little is known about plasma levels and metabolic changes following food&#xD;
      intake of artificial sweeteners, in particular polyols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously measured fasting levels of various polyols in a large&#xD;
      clinical cohort of cardiovascular patients and found that some candidate polyols are related&#xD;
      to a higher risk of cardiovascular complications and death. In vitro data using human&#xD;
      platelets revealed that the polyols xylitol and erythritol at the levels observed in fasting&#xD;
      patients induce platelet aggregation potential. The investigator's data shows that erythritol&#xD;
      and xylitol impact platelet function and may, therefore, contribute to cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary studies the investigators found that when ingesting either erythritol or&#xD;
      xylitol, the levels of these sweeteners in the plasma rise within the first hour after&#xD;
      consumption. With this study the investigators wish to examine whether the postprandial&#xD;
      levels are capable of altering platelet function in vitro. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      postprandial polyol concentrations following ingestion increase platelet aggregation in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
