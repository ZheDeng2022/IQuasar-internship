  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise tolerance decreases with age and a sedentary lifestyle. Muscle critical power (CP),&#xD;
      is a sensitive measure of exercise tolerance that is more even more relevant to and&#xD;
      predictive of endurance performance than VO2max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While recent evidence indicates that CP and muscle function decrease with aging, the cause of&#xD;
      this decrease in CP and the best way to mitigate the decrease in CP are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure knee extensor CP in young and old individuals and determine the extent to which&#xD;
           changes in muscle oxygen delivery (e.g. resistance artery function, maximum exercise&#xD;
           blood flow), muscle mass and composition (e.g. whole-muscle size, muscle fiber&#xD;
           cross-sectional area) and mitochondrial oxygen consumption (e.g. maximal coupled&#xD;
           respiration of permeabilized fibers biopsied from the knee extensors) contribute to the&#xD;
           decrease in CP with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the effectiveness of two different therapies (1. High Intensity Interval&#xD;
           Training, HIIT and 2. Muscle Heat Therapy) at improving muscle function and critical&#xD;
           power in young and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the impact of muscle disuse (2 weeks of leg immobilization), a potential&#xD;
           contributor to the decrease in muscle function with aging, on muscle function and&#xD;
           critical power and determine if heat therapy is an effective means of minimizing the&#xD;
           impact of disuse on muscle function and critical power.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Young (18-35 years) and Older (60+ years) will be randomly assigned to one of 3 different conditions (High Intensity Exercise Training of the Knee Extensors, Heat therapy of the Knee Extensors or Sham Heat therapy of the Knee Extensors). Muscle function will be measured before and after 6 weeks of the randomized treatment.&#xD;
A separate set of 40 young adults (18-35 years) will undergo 2 weeks of leg immobilization. Half of the subjects will receive daily heat therapy, while the other half will receive a sham heat therapy treatment. Muscle function and critical power will be measured before and after immobilization for both groups</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects assigned to the heat therapy and the sham heat therapy will not know if they are truly receiving the heat therapy or not. The muscle heater (shortwave diathermy) will be placed on the muscle during each visit, but, unbeknownst to the heat and sham group, will not be turned on for the sham group.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Critical Power</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle exercise tolerance, quantified as critical power, will be assessed before and after each intervention. The main outcome will be the change in critical power, expressed in Watts, elicited by each intervention.&#xD;
Specifically, participants will perform 3-5 different power outputs of single leg knee extension exercise as long as they can. Subsequently, the line of best fit between the total work performed and duration of each power output trial will be used to quantify critical power, expressed in Watts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resistance Artery Function</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resistance Artery Function will be assessed with the Passive Leg Movement (PLM) technique before and after each intervention. The main variable of interest will be the change in peak blood flow elicited by PLM from before to after each intervention.&#xD;
Specifically, PLM will be performed with a member of the research team moving a subject's knee joint through a 90 degree range of motion, at a rate of 1 Hz for 60 seconds. This passive movement elicits a hyperemic response that will will be quantified with Doppler ultrasound of the femoral artery and expressed in ml/min. The highest 1-second average of blood flow to occur during the movement will be identified as the peak blood flow response.&#xD;
The main variable of interest will be the change in peak blood flow elicited by PLM from before to after each intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Exercise Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum rate of blood flow achieved during exercise will be determined before and after each intervention. The main variable of interest will be the change in maximum exercise blood flow from before to after each intervention, expressed in ml/min.&#xD;
Specifically, exercise blood flow will be assessed by quantifying the peak hyperemic response, expressed in ml/min, to active single leg knee extension exercise. Following a warm-up, subjects will perform maximal single leg knee extension exercise for 3 minutes while blood flow is quantified with Doppler ultrasound (Logiq E, GE) of the femoral artery. The average rate of blood flow achieved during the final 30 seconds of the exercise will be identified as the maximum exercise blood flow, expressed in ml/min.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Fiber Size</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cross-sectional area of muscle fibers biopsied from the treated vastus lateralis will be used to quantify the size of muscle size before and after each intervention. The main variable of interest will be the change in average myofiber cross-sectional area, expressed in square micrometers, from before to after each intervention.&#xD;
Specifically, muscle biopsy samples will be mounted on a cork in tragacanth gum . Frozen samples will be adhered to a microscope slide for staining. Slides will be incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies. CSA will be quantified for each fiber using Olympus CellSens software and subsequently averaged for all fibers on the slide.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Mitochondrial Function</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle mitochondrial function will be measured in permeabilized fibers biopsied from the vastus lateralis before and after each intervention.&#xD;
Specifically, maximal coupled respiration (i.e. OXPHOS or State 3) will be measured with a clark-type electrode (O2K, Oroboros) and expressed in picomoles of oxygen consumed per second.&#xD;
The main variable of interest will be the change in Maximal Couple Respiration from before to after each intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vastus Lateralis Cross-Sectional Area</measure>
    <time_frame>3-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The cross-sectional area of the treated vastus lateralis will be measured with magnetic resonance imaging before and after each intervention. The main variable of interest will be the change in cross-sectional area, expressed in square centimeters, from before to after each intervention.&#xD;
Specifically, MRI will be used to assess whole muscle cross sectional area of the vastus lateralis. Participants will be scanned while laying supine in a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens). A stock Siemens 2-D multi-slice gradient-recalled echo (GRE) MRI pulse sequence will be used. Images will be takin in slices every 5mm, resulting in a total sequence time of approximately 2-min. This will provide cross-sectional images of the vastus lateralis from the base of the femur (distal condyles) up to the groin. .</description>

    <intervention_name>High Intensity Interval Training of the Knee Extensors</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will perform intense, single leg knee extension exercise 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Specifically, subjects will be seated in a custom knee extension ergometer and perform single leg, dynamic knee extension (similar to single leg cycling) as they perform the exercise. After a 6 minute warm-up at ~20% of that leg's maximum aerobic power (determined during a graded exercise test of single leg knee extension), subjects will perform 4 bouts of 4 minutes at ~80% of maximum aerobic power. Recovery of 4 minutes at ~40% will occur between each bout of exercise. A cool down will be provided at the end of exercise. In total, subjects will perform 40 minutes of single leg knee extension exercise, 3 times a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
Maximum aerobic power (determined by a graded exercise test) will be determined again at 3 weeks to appropriately adjust the training intensity.</description>
