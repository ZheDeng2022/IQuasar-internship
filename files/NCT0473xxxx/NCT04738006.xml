  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative gastric sonography may provide a validated, reliable, fast, and cost-efficient&#xD;
      approach to assess aspiration risks in both elective and emergency patients. Practiced&#xD;
      sonographers are able to perform point-of-care gastric sonography in a few minutes, thus&#xD;
      severe delay in daily clinical practice should not be expected. Nevertheless, how this highly&#xD;
      sensitive and specific tool should be best established in daily clinical practice is still&#xD;
      unclear. There are no preexisting structured and validated trainings for this specific&#xD;
      point-of-care ultrasound application. To address these issues, all patients with increased&#xD;
      aspiration risk at the Institute of Anaesthesiology in Winterthur will be evaluated for&#xD;
      participation during a one year recruiting period. Participants will receive a preoperative&#xD;
      gastric ultrasound by a trained professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this investigation is to validate our structural training and proof the importance&#xD;
      and effectiveness of this diagnostic tool to lay ground for improvement of anesthesiologic&#xD;
      management and presumably patient safety in patients with an increased risk of a pulmonary&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration pneumonias still exhibit a significant morbidity and mortality and are accountable&#xD;
      for a significant part of anaesthesia-related deaths. Various diseases and especially&#xD;
      emergency situations correlate with prolonged gastric emptying and therefore with a higher&#xD;
      risk of pulmonary aspiration. In clinical practice the decision to perform a Rapid Sequence&#xD;
      Induction (RSI) is mostly based on clinical and anamnestic findings. Preoperative gastric&#xD;
      sonography may provide an objective, validated, non-invasive, reliable, fast, and&#xD;
      cost-efficient approach to assess aspiration risks in both elective and emergency patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How this highly sensitive and specific tool may be best introduced and implemented in daily&#xD;
      clinical practice or anesthesiologic guidelines remains unclear. Structured educational&#xD;
      programmes or training recommendations for this point-of-care ultrasound application rarely&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish preoperative gastric sonography before Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) and in&#xD;
           patients with one or more aspiration risk factors scheduled for a advanced laryngeal&#xD;
           mask (LMa) or regional anaesthesia at the Kantonsspital Winterthur, Department of&#xD;
           Anaesthesiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation of our structured training/education by comparing sonographic estimated and&#xD;
           directly measured gastric content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emphasize the importance and effectiveness of this diagnostic tool to improve&#xD;
           anesthesiologic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Cantonal Hospital of Winterthur, a mid-size Swiss teaching hospital all residents and&#xD;
      attending anaesthesiologists will receive a structured training in a period of 1 to 8 weeks&#xD;
      before inclusion of the first patient. All participating staff will give written informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tutors/experts are all expert sonographers on different modalities. They will receive a&#xD;
      preceding training, consisting of a theoretic introduction and a course by a radiologist and&#xD;
      abdominal sonography expert, certified by the Swiss Society for Sonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included candidates will receive a structured preoperative sonography. Primary, a&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of the gastric content should be performed in supine and right-lateral&#xD;
      decubitus (RLD) position. In low volume states a right-lateral decubitus position (RLD) has&#xD;
      the advantage of a gravitational shift to the antrum. That is why the investigators plan to&#xD;
      perform the examination in both positions. If RLD position is not possible due to patient&#xD;
      factors a half sitting or supine position can be tried. Gastric content will be classified&#xD;
      into empty, fluid, solid or mixed. After identification, cross sectional area (CSA) will be&#xD;
      measured and gastric content is estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the routine naso- or orogastric tube (standard for RSI and LMa patients at&#xD;
      our institute) the investigators compare the calculated and effective suctioned volume of the&#xD;
      gastric content and analyse the difference and quality of the sonographic measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No changes in or adaptions of the established clinical practice will be made for the sole&#xD;
      purpose of this study. In exceptional cases the responsible anaesthesiologist is allowed to&#xD;
      upgrade patients from an advanced laryngeal mask to a RSI (gold standard) after ultrasound&#xD;
      performance to ensure patient safety. Downgrading from RSI to advanced laryngeal maks on base&#xD;
      of the ultrasound results is not allowed.&#xD;

        Within a study period of 12 months (estimated), all elective and emergency patients&#xD;
        scheduled for a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) and patients with one or more aspiration&#xD;
        risk factors scheduled for a advanced laryngeal mask or regional anaesthesia will be&#xD;
        screened for possible participation in this study. The indication for RSI and aspiration&#xD;
        risk evaluation is previously determined by the responsible anaesthetist and based on&#xD;
        patient medical history and clinical findings according to department standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        After evaluation of eligibility, the responsible anaesthesiologist will work through the&#xD;
        list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of note, patients which are of the highest&#xD;
        urgency where a delay is medically and ethically not acceptable, will not be included in&#xD;
        this study. Also, patients where ability to consent is not given due to patient or&#xD;
        circumstantial reasons, will be excluded.&#xD;
