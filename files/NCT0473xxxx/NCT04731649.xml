  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite reductions in adolescent sexual behavior over the past decade, premature sexual&#xD;
      activity remains prevalent among adolescents and alarming adolescent sexual and reproductive&#xD;
      health (SRH) disparities exist. Positive youth development (PYD) research has identified&#xD;
      adolescent protective factors, such as success sequencing, self-regulation, goal setting, and&#xD;
      strong family support [i.e., positive family development (PFD)] that are associated with&#xD;
      increased sexual risk avoidance as well as individual life opportunities and societal&#xD;
      benefits. Needed are programmatic efforts to strengthen adolescent protective factors among&#xD;
      populations in greatest need, with a particular emphasis on the important role of parents in&#xD;
      promoting sexual delay. The proposed project is designed to target Latino and Black&#xD;
      adolescents aged 12-17 years residing in the South Bronx, New York City, a high-need&#xD;
      community for sexual risk programming and promotion of adolescent life opportunities. The&#xD;
      investigators evaluate a program called Families Talking Together Plus (FTT+), an online,&#xD;
      parent-based intervention that is medically accurate, culturally tailored, and&#xD;
      age-appropriate. To implement FTT +, the investigators draw upon an innovative and culturally&#xD;
      competent intervention delivery approach, namely community health workers (CHWs) as &quot;Life&#xD;
      Opportunity Coaches.&quot;&#xD;

      Despite reductions in adolescent sexual behavior over the past decade, premature sexual&#xD;
      activity remains prevalent among adolescents and alarming adolescent sexual and reproductive&#xD;
      health (SRH) disparities exist. The adverse short and long-term consequences of premature&#xD;
      adolescent sexual behavior are well-documented, including negative effects on the physical,&#xD;
      emotional, social, and economic well-being of youth. Positive youth development (PYD)&#xD;
      research has identified adolescent protective factors, such as success sequencing,&#xD;
      self-regulation, goal setting, and strong family support [i.e., positive family development&#xD;
      (PFD)] that are associated with increased sexual risk avoidance as well as individual life&#xD;
      opportunities and societal benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families Talking Together Plus (FTT +) is an online intervention designed to reduce&#xD;
      adolescent sexual risk behavior through supporting caregiver-adolescent communication about&#xD;
      sex. The goals of the program are to (1) delay sexual debut, (2) reduce sexual behavior, (3)&#xD;
      increase correct and consistent condom use, and (4) increase engagement with community&#xD;
      resources among Black and Latino adolescents aged 12-17 years (n=600) residing in a community&#xD;
      with disparate adolescent SRH outcomes and high need for improved adolescent life&#xD;
      opportunities and success sequencing support, the South Bronx, New York City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2-arm parallel RCT will evaluate the efficacy of the FTT + intervention in delaying&#xD;
      sexual debut, reducing adolescent sexual behavior, and linking adolescents to community&#xD;
      resources and services for sexual risk behavior, PYD, and success sequencing. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit adolescents and their primary adult caregivers in their homes&#xD;
      using area sampling methods piloted-tested by CLAFH staff with excellent results in our&#xD;
      previous research in the target community. Parents and adolescents will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire (separately) at baseline assessments. Subsequently, parent-adolescent dyads&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either, (1) the experimental group (who will receive the FTT +&#xD;
      intervention), or (2) the control group that does not receive any intervention. The baseline&#xD;
      sample size will be 600 dyads, with 300 dyads in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents randomized to the experimental condition will receive three 60 to 90 minute virtual&#xD;
      intervention sessions consisting of 9 modules delivered to the parent by community healthcare&#xD;
      workers. Intervention sessions should happen within the first month following the baseline&#xD;
      interview. FTT + modules address self-regulation, success sequencing, the benefits of&#xD;
      delaying sex, correctly using a condom every time, healthy relationships, goal setting,&#xD;
      resisting sexual coercion, dating violence, and other youth risk behaviors such as underage&#xD;
      drinking or illicit drug use. In addition, parents receive guidance on effective adolescent&#xD;
      monitoring and supervision and strengthening their relationship quality with their&#xD;
      adolescent.&#xD;
