  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label, single-administration of gene therapy agent AAV9/CLN7,&#xD;
      administered intrathecally into the lumbar spinal cord region of pediatric patients with CLN7&#xD;
      Batten disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of a one-time injection of AAV9/CLN7. There are two Cohorts with a low&#xD;
      dose and a high dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this clinical study is to evaluate safety. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to determine the efficacy of AAV9/CLN7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures include motor, cognition and intelligence assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory outcome measures include visual impairment assessment, cognitive evaluations,&#xD;
      Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      and echocardiogram (ECHO).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) a 3 item observer rated scale that measures illness severity global improvement or change and therapeutic response.&#xD;
The CGI-S is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).&#xD;
Possible score ranges from 1-7, with highest score indicating the most severely ill patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in disease burden as measured by Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Program (ECDEU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Program (ECDEU) version of the CGI asks that the clinician rate the patient relative to their past experience with other patients with the same diagnosis. Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side effects) to 4 (unchanged or worse and side effects outweigh the therapeutic effects).&#xD;
Possible scores range from 0-4, with lower score indicating more improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in motor function as measured by Pediatric Balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Mean change in Neuropsychological state as measured by Mullen scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mullen Scales of Early Learning is a comprehensive Neuropsychological assessment of early language, motor and cognitive abilities. T scores are given for individual scales and the four cognitive scales (visual reception, fine motor, receptive language and expressive language) are combined to to yield a composite score of Early Learning. Each scale is comprised of interactive tasks with a scoring range for each item of zero to 5 points.&#xD;
Test ages are converted to normalized T-scores by using tables based on the child's age. T scores have the same meaning regardless of a child's age.&#xD;
Possible score ranges from 1-100 for percentile ranking, with higher score indicating higher performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Neuropsychological state as measured by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale is one of the most well-known and well-validated Neuropsychological measures of adaptive functioning. Four key domains will be rated including communication skills, daily living skills, social skills and motor skills. The combination of these makes up the overall Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC). Scores are based on standard scores for the domains and age-equivalents meaning the scores are compared to that of others that are his or her age.&#xD;
The score is a percentile ranking in an individual's normative age group. The higher the percentage ranking indicates a better outcome on the scale.&#xD;
Possible score ranges from 1 -100 for percentile ranking, with higher score indicating higher performance.</description>

    <description>Quality of Life Inventory - Disability (QI-Disability) questionnaire measures quality of life with 32-item measures that includes - a child's social interactions, positive emotions, physical health, negative emotions, leisure skills, and independence. Scores are a 5-point Likert scale and then are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100.&#xD;
Possible scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The ITQOL Short Form is a 47-item measure to assess physical and psychosocial functioning of children ages 2 months to 5 years. It contains 12 scales including physical functioning, growth and development, bodily pain, temperament and moods, general behavior, getting along, general health perceptions, parental impact-emotional, parental impact-time, family activities, family cohesion, and change in health. Scores are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100.&#xD;
