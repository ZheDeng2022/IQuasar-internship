  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety of the drug ON 123300 at increasing doses to determine&#xD;
      the best dose to use in future clinical trials.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study including potential risks, patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will proceed to a screening period when assessments will be performed to&#xD;
      determine whether the patient is eligible to participate in the study. If the patient is&#xD;
      eligible, they will start to receive ON 123300 as capsules every day. On day 1 and Day 8 of&#xD;
      the study, patients will be required to provide eight blood samples to allow measurement of&#xD;
      the amount of drug in their blood. Three ECGs will also be performed during this time.&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive ON 123300 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      or patient or physician decision to stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of patients will receive 40mg of ON 123300 daily, the next group 80mg of ON&#xD;
      123300, the 120mg, etc. until the correct dose has been determined for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will visit the clinic on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9, then weekly for the first month, then&#xD;
      every two weeks for two more months, then every month.&#xD;
