  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each new generation of phacoemulsification system has aimed to optimize the control of&#xD;
      fluidics and the delivery of energy during phacoemulsification. Nicoli CM et al., (J Cataract&#xD;
      Refract Surg 2016;42:157-162) suggested a better anterior chamber stability when using an&#xD;
      active fluidics system. Malik PK et al., (Eye and Vision 2017;4:22) showed that using an IOP&#xD;
      based phacoemulsification system in association with the use of an Intrepid balanced tip&#xD;
      provides a reduction in CDE (Cumulated Dissipated Energy and EFU (Estimated Fluid Usage). It&#xD;
      has also been shown that a lower CDE provides obvious benefits: less endothelium cells&#xD;
      damages and lower complication rates (Mady MA et al., Clin.Ophthalmol. 2012; 6:503-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest technologies, i.e. the Active Sentry Handpiece and Hybrid tips, have been&#xD;
      introduced to further improve the safety of phacoemulsification. The Active Sentry system has&#xD;
      moved pressure sensors closer to the operated eye, hence further reducing the risk of surge&#xD;
      during procedures. (Thorne A et al. Phacoemulsifier occlusion break surge volume reduction, J&#xD;
      Cataract Refract Surg. 2018;44:1491-1496). The Hybrid tips have been designed to prevent&#xD;
      posterior capsule rupture in the event of contact with the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new technology allows phacoemulsification procedures under reduced infusion pressures&#xD;
      and a &quot;high-vacuum - low energy&quot; strategy which may lead to a safer procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will try to demonstrate that cataract surgeries with Active Sentry will&#xD;
      need less CDE and therefore may be safer, due to the surge effects decrease. This CDE&#xD;
      parameter will be analysed according to differents subgroups: Presence of hybrid tip or&#xD;
      balanced tip, cataract score based on the WHO nuclear grading recommendation (Thylefors B et&#xD;
      al., (2002) The WHO Cataract Grading Group, Ophthalmic Epidemiology, 9:2, 83-95) The recent&#xD;
      experiences conducted in real world condition in different sites have suggested that&#xD;
      Centurion with AS was able to improved settings: maximum vacuum and UltraSound (US) time&#xD;
      reduction and as a consequence a 20 to 30% CDE reduction.&#xD;
