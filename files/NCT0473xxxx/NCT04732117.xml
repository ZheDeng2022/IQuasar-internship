    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of secukinumab in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with active nr-axSpA. Treatment difference of secukinumab 150mg vs. placebo&#xD;
      in Chinese nr-axSpA patients in terms of ASAS 40 response rate as well as safety profile will&#xD;
      be provided by the study.&#xD;
