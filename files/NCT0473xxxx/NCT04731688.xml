  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this randomized controlled trial are to determine the effects of a lifestyle&#xD;
      program that supports weight maintenance and fat mass loss during pregnancy in women with&#xD;
      grade 2 and 3 obesity on changes in 1) maternal weight, fat mass, and cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors; 2) safety measures, including fetal and neonatal growth; 3) the mediators and&#xD;
      moderators of the fat mass loss intervention and 4) the effects gestational fat mass loss has&#xD;
      on reducing incidence of adverse obstetrical outcomes, including non-elective cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and pre-eclampsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred pregnant women with grade 2 or 3 obesity who are otherwise healthy will be&#xD;
      studied from early pregnancy until approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Major assessments will&#xD;
      occur at baseline (13-16 weeks gestation), 27-29 weeks gestation, 35-37 weeks gestation, and&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks postpartum. Safety assessments will be collected every 4 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment. Participants will be equally randomized within site (50 individuals at Pennington&#xD;
      Biomedical Research Center and 50 individuals at California Polytechnic University) and&#xD;
      obesity grade 2 or 3 to either: Provider Directed Group or Weight Maintenance Group.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals in this group will receive all aspects of the Provider Directed Group plus a comprehensive behavioral fat mass loss intervention with food provision. Individuals in this group will be provided foods to eat to support weight maintenance and loss of body fat throughout pregnancy. They will be asked to attend two behavioral counseling sessions at the beginning of the study to help learn the program and set goals. They will return for brief visits with a lifestyle counselor every two weeks until 20 weeks gestation and at least once a month until delivery. Individuals will be provided a scale to help keep track of weight during pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Individuals in this group will receive what is standard practice by their prenatal care providers during pregnancy. In addition, individuals in this group will be asked to attend a brief session at the time of randomization to familiarize with the study and what is expected. They will also be provided with materials describing healthy behaviors in pregnancy.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Weight Maintenance Group</intervention_name>
    <description>The behavioral program is rooted in social learning theory and based on our existing prenatal intervention but with full food provision to ensure gestational fat mass loss is steady and closely supervised. Brief counseling sessions are designed to review self-monitoring records, reinforce adherence to the structured food provision program, problem-solve barriers, and provide additional support. Individuals will be provided with a structured meal plan designed to promote 25% calorie restriction during the second trimester followed by eucaloric intake during the 3rd trimester. Participants will be provided three meals and two snacks on 7 days at no cost.</description>
