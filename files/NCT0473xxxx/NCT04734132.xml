  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moringa oleifera (MO) is a traditional food in tropical and subtropical areas and has&#xD;
      attained a growing interest for its medicinal properties. It's a nutrient-rich vegetable,&#xD;
      high in protein and polyphenol content. The MO dry leaves and leaf extracts have been shown&#xD;
      to exert numerous in vitro activities and in vivo effects, including the hypoglycemic effect.&#xD;
      Thus, MO could be an alternative to prevent or treat diabetes. Studies in humans, however,&#xD;
      are still limited. This proposal aims to study the efficacy of Moringa oleifera to improve&#xD;
      the control of glycaemia in subjects with prediabetes. A 3-month dietary intervention with MO&#xD;
      dry leave capsules will be performed and compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tree Moringa oleifera (MO) is a traditional medicinal plant in tropical and subtropical&#xD;
      areas, also consumed as food, which is currently expanding worldwide as a protein-rich leafy&#xD;
      vegetable and for the medicinal value of its phytochemicals, in particular its&#xD;
      glucosinolates. Specifically, MO dry leaves and leaf extracts have been shown to exert&#xD;
      numerous in vitro activities and in vivo effects, including the hypoglycemic effect. Thus, MO&#xD;
      could be an alternative to prevent or treat diabetes. In this sense, in vitro and preclinical&#xD;
      experiments have shown that MO could potentially reverse some of the pathophysiological&#xD;
      manifestation of diabetes and its comorbidities, such as hepatic fat accumulation and insulin&#xD;
      resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation and peripheral hyperglycemia. Studies in humans,&#xD;
      however, are still limited. This proposal aims to study the efficacy of Moringa oleifera to&#xD;
      improve the control of glycaemia in subjects with prediabetes. A 3-month dietary intervention&#xD;
      with MO dry leave capsules will be performed and compared to placebo. This will be a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group intervention study. Subjects&#xD;
      will randomly consume either 6 capsules of dry MO leaves (400 mg dry leaf powder /capsule) or&#xD;
      6 placebo capsules per day during 3 months. The study subjects will provide samples for&#xD;
      outcome measurements at three different time points: basal, 6 weeks and 12 weeks of&#xD;
      supplementation. Glycaemia and plasma inflammatory and metabolic markers will be measured, as&#xD;
      well as the gut microbiota composition.&#xD;
