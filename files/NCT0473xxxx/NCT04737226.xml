  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The myotonometric assessment is becoming popular and important in athletic population. It is&#xD;
      mentioned an alternate method than expensive methods, and it is easy and reliable assessment.&#xD;
      Still there is not enough information of mechanical characteristics in athletic population&#xD;
      and ankle mobility. Most clinicians or trainers can use this results and technique for&#xD;
      enhancing performance, rehabilitation or prevention&#xD;

      The soft tissue mechanical properties can be assessed through elastography and&#xD;
      ultrasonography. Both methods can measure passive and active soft tissue properties. These&#xD;
      methods are the gold standard to measure stiffness and elasticity, but they are expensive,&#xD;
      operator dependent and need a laboratory settings.Recently, myotonometric device has been&#xD;
      used to measure the mechanical properties of the muscles and tendons. This method serves many&#xD;
      advantages, such as non-invasive, painless and cost-effective. There is an increasing&#xD;
      literature on athletic training about how training effects viscoelastic properties. However,&#xD;
      to the best of our knowledge, there were no studies assessing stiffness and elasticity of AT,&#xD;
      PF and ITB and the relation with ankle mobility in different sport disciplines. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study were to demonstrate the mechanical properties of AT, PF and ITB and find out&#xD;
      relation with restricted ankle mobility in athletes.&#xD;

    <description>The measurement method of the device is based on the free oscillation technique. Firstly, the probe of the device is placed perpendicular to the skin and a pre-pressure is applied to compress the subcutaneous tissue. Then, a short mechanical impulse is applied, causing damped oscillation on the tissue and the co-oscillation is recorded by an accelerometer.</description>
