  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the retrospective data analysis, patients with genetic diseases of any age and, if&#xD;
      available, other family members, for whom genetic analyzes were carried out between 10/2016&#xD;
      and 12/2020, should be included. This equates to approximately 13,000 records, minus combined&#xD;
      analyzes in the same patient, an estimated 12,000 individuals.&#xD;

      The methodological developments of the last few years allow the broad use of&#xD;
      next-generation-sequencing (NGS) -based methods in the routine molecular genetic diagnosis of&#xD;
      genetic diseases.The aim of the retrospective data analysis is to create a solid data basis&#xD;
      for further discussion regarding the development and mapping of diagnostic algorithms and&#xD;
      subsequent supply routes. For the genome data, this evaluation is to be expanded to include&#xD;
      the evaluation of the Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in the sense of an additional finding.&#xD;

    <description>The outlined evaluation contributes to the improvement of molecular genetic diagnostics in patient care - for example when which diagnostics can be sensibly recommended for patients with which indications or not. Diagnostic gaps can be systematically evaluated and specifically addressed in the future. This potentially affects every examination assignment for current and future patients. In addition, the evaluation of the PRSs for example, can contribute significantly to the timely introduction to routine diagnostics. For familial breast cancer, according to the guidelines, there may be very specific preventive measures. Estimates currently assume up to 5% of patients, which would mean up to 25 cases per year with a potentially adapted management for patients with the question of a tumor disease alone.</description>
