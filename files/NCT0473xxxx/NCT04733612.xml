    <textblock>
      The objective of our study was to assess awareness-raising of medication adherence (MA),&#xD;
      physical activity (PA), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) values&#xD;
      by providing information on diabetes via short message (SMS) technology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study investigates T2DM patients who have not had surgery or cardiac event in the last 3&#xD;
      months, between the ages of 40 and 64 years, with T2DM diagnosis between the last 1 and 10&#xD;
      years and oral antidiabetic therapy for at least 1 The study design is a single-blinded&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study, and was conducted in the Diabetes Polyclinic of the Istanbul&#xD;
      University Medical Faculty Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group, in addition to traditional treatment&#xD;
      received three to four informative SMS messages per week during the 6-month period, while the&#xD;
      control group was followed in accordance with the traditional treatment schedule.&#xD;
