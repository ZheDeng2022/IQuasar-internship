      Prospective, observational study to assess sarcopenia across three chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases: chronic liver disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis both before&#xD;
      and after therapeutic intervention (standard of care treatment i.e. nutrition/exercise;&#xD;
      biologic for IBD etc).&#xD;

      Introduction: Several chronic inflammatory diseases co-exist with and accelerate sarcopenia&#xD;
      (reduction in muscle strength, quantity and quality) and negatively impact on both morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. There is limited research on the extent of sarcopenia in such conditions, how&#xD;
      to accurately assess it and whether there are generic or disease specific mechanisms driving&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective cohort study is unique; it provides a multi-modal approach to&#xD;
      assess sarcopenia across three chronic inflammatory diseases: chronic liver disease,&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis both before and after therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. A total of 170 patients will be recruited (50 with Chronic liver disease, 20&#xD;
      with non-cirrhotic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 50 with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and&#xD;
      50 with Rheumatoid Arthritis) and including a comparison cohort of n=20 age-sex matched&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo 4 assessments at defined time points; weeks 0, 2, 12 and 24, with&#xD;
      blood tests to assess endocrine and inflammatory status; anthropometric (hand grip strength;&#xD;
      mid-arm muscle circumference; triceps skinfold thickness); functional testing (short physical&#xD;
      performance battery and isokinetic dynamometry); imaging ( ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging of the quadriceps), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy. Physical activity and sleep&#xD;
      will be monitored using actigraphy, and quality of life via questionnaires. Food diaries for&#xD;
      nutritional intake analysis will be sampled between 0-2, 12 and 24 weeks. Stool and urine&#xD;
      samples will be sampled for future microbiome and metabolomics analysis, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify mechanisms across the groups and within each cohort, to further&#xD;
      target interventions to reduce sarcopenia in the future. This is the first study to use a&#xD;
      multi modal assessment to characterise sarcopenia in chronic disease. The multi-modal&#xD;
      assessment includes serological, anatomical, functional and histological analyses to evaluate&#xD;
      the deep phenotyping of these patients. The observational study of small sample sizes will&#xD;
      allow potential future targets for intervention.&#xD;
