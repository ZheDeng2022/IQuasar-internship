      This trial is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-designed trial to compare the&#xD;
      effects of a2 Platinum® stage 1 infant formula versus conventional, A1 and A2&#xD;
      β-casein-containing stage 1 infant formula versus breastfeeding on crying, tolerance, gut&#xD;
      health, and immune function.&#xD;

      The protocol was updated from V8.2 to V9.1 and was approved by the Ethical Committee of&#xD;
      Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, the main site. The major changes are: from&#xD;
      &quot;blind to participants&quot; to &quot;non-blind to participants&quot;; from &quot;Single-Centre&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;Multi-Centre&quot;; number of subjects from &quot;270&quot; to &quot;180&quot;; trial period from &quot;3 weeks&quot; to &quot;4&#xD;
