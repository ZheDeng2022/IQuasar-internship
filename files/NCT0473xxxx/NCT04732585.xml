      Aim of the research project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire research project aims to investigate human peripheral joints (knee, foot &amp; ankle,&#xD;
      elbow, wrist &amp; hand) by dynamic 4D radiographic imaging acquisition during real-time motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the specific study on Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate kinematics and motion changes pre and post physiotherapy&#xD;
      intervention in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and compare them with a&#xD;
      healthy control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the specific study on patients undergoing ACL reconstruction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate kinematics and motion changes pre and post-surgical&#xD;
      intervention in patients with ACL injury that require surgical reconstruction and compare&#xD;
      them with a healthy control group.&#xD;

      Study on PFPS patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized Control Clinical Trial. The patient that satisfies inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria is informed about the nature study at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. If&#xD;
      necessary, the study coordinator provides additional information to the patient. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained prior to inclusion in the study. The patient will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo a dynamic scan of the knees prior to and after the physiotherapy treatment. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment is not specifically controlled but best evidence-based guidelines are&#xD;
      provided to the patient's physiotherapist in order to have an intervention as homogeneous as&#xD;
      possible. Guidelines suggest a tailored and progressive exercise program to improve muscle&#xD;
      strength and control, joint mobility, and patient understanding of the problem and how to&#xD;
      manage it. Additional interventions like tape or manual treatment can also be implemented but&#xD;
      should not be exclusive. During imaging acquisition, the patients lay on the CT's bed with&#xD;
      the lower limb inside the gantry. They are asked to perform a repetitive movement of the knee&#xD;
      into different planes of motion (i.e. flexion-extension). Before the start of the dynamic CT&#xD;
      scan protocol, a physical examination is performed by a physiotherapist. It consists of&#xD;
      muscle strength (dynamometer) and joint ROM assessment. VAS scale and Kujala and KOOS&#xD;
      questionnaires will be also administrated to the patients. Healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      provided with a brief explanation of the study the moment they make contact to be involved.&#xD;
      Further information and informed consent will be obtained on the day of the scan. Identical&#xD;
      procedure for the CT scan and physical assessment used with the patient will be used for the&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

      undergo a dynamic scan of the knees prior to and approximately 6 weeks after ACL surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction. Type of surgical intervention is on surgeon discretion following&#xD;
      Best-Evidence practice guidelines.&#xD;
