      CYRON is a Prospective, Open-Label, Pilot, Multicentric Clinical Investigation to Evaluate&#xD;
      the Performance and Safety of Cerviron® Ovules in Cervix Lesions Postoperative Care. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess the therapeutic performance and tolerability of Cerviron®&#xD;
      Ovules in postoperative care in patients that underwent surgical removal of benign, cervical&#xD;
      lesions. The secondary objective of this clinical investigation is the assessment of&#xD;
      performance of the medical device by clinical exam and patients' degree of satisfaction&#xD;
      related to the use of the medical device.&#xD;

      Identifying premalignant and benign diseases of the cervix and selecting an appropriate&#xD;
      treatment path can be challenging. The adult uterine cervix may exhibit a wide variety of&#xD;
      pathologic conditions that include benign entities (eg, cervicitis, hyperplasia, nabothian&#xD;
      cysts, cervical polyps, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and congenital abnormalities) as well as&#xD;
      malignant lesions, particularly cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical lesions range from being visible only with an instrument that augments sight such as&#xD;
      a colposcope to being visible by speculum examination or endovaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent types of cervical lesions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Cervical polyp Cervical polyps are benign growths, usually protruding from the surface of&#xD;
      the cervical canal. They commonly occur during the reproductive years, especially in women&#xD;
      over 20 years of age. Cervical polyps are the most common non-cancerous tumour of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cervical polyps may vary in size, shape, and origin. They can present as single or&#xD;
      multiple, tear-shaped or lobular, cherry-red, or greyish-white in color, depending on the&#xD;
      vascularity of the lesion. The size of the cervical polyp is typically less than three cm in&#xD;
      diameter; however, as mentioned earlier, they can vary in size and can be large enough to&#xD;
      fill the vagina or be present at the introitus They usually originate in the endocervical&#xD;
      canal. Endocervical polyps may be caused by chronic inflammation. They rarely become&#xD;
      malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nabothian cyst Nabothian cysts are a benign gynecological condition in reproductive age&#xD;
      without clinical significance. These cysts are at the squamocolumnar junction of the uterine&#xD;
      cervix, which is the targeted anatomical area of brush sampling at the time of cervical&#xD;
      screening cytology. They are filled with mucus, but they may also contain proteinaceous&#xD;
      material, neutrophils, or neutrophil debris. These cysts usually appear superficially and are&#xD;
      easily recognized during colposcopy examination. If left untreated, they can induce&#xD;
      considerable enlargement of the cervix, which can lead to symptomatology. Other causes of&#xD;
      these large cysts include cystic degeneration of uterine leiomyoma and congenital uterine&#xD;
      cysts such as mesonephric and paramesonephric cysts and cystic adenomyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of Nabothian cysts include hematometra, labor passage obstruction, rectal&#xD;
      compression, abnormal uterine bleeding, specifically in case of giant cysts, and chronic&#xD;
      urinary retention by restricting the bladder's outlet or by compressing the pudendal and&#xD;
      sacral nerves, thus, disturbing the nerve supply to the detrusor muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical fibroid Cervical fibroids (myomas) start in the muscle tissue of the cervix. They&#xD;
      are similar to uterine fibroids but less common. Cervical fibroids may not cause symptoms.&#xD;
      The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pain during intercourse may happen. If&#xD;
      the fibroid becomes large, it may partially block the urinary tract and cause urinary&#xD;
      drainage problems such as dribbling or urinary retention. If myomas become infected, they may&#xD;
      cause pain, bleeding, or a discharge from the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended treatment in all cases is excision. After surgery, haemostasis and rapid&#xD;
      recovery should be promoted with the support of local, re-epithelizing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerviron® ovules Cerviron® ovules is a class IIb medical device used as adjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      cervical lesions of mechanical origin. It favors the healing and re-epithelialization&#xD;
      processes and reduces the proliferation of endogenous pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bismuth subgallate causes shrinkage of damaged tissue by stopping bleeding and promoting&#xD;
      tissue healing. Being an insoluble salt and very little absorbed the bismuth subgalate forms&#xD;
      a protective film that allows the other components to act locally. &quot;Through its active&#xD;
      ingredient, Bismuth subgallate, Cerviron® ovules exert a protective action on mucous&#xD;
      membranes and raw surfaces. Moreover, it provides a strong hemostatic effect, as shown in&#xD;
      multiple studies. Moreover, it contains collagen with nutritive, hydrating, healing and&#xD;
      trophic effect. Collagen is structurally and functionally a key protein of the extracellular&#xD;
      matrix which is also involved in forming the scars during the healing of conjunctive tissues,&#xD;
      due to its chemotactic role. Many collagen bandages were developed to improve the repair of&#xD;
      the wound, especially of non-infected, chronic, idle cutaneous ulcerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Marigold extract (Calendula Officinalis) contains as active principles carotenoid&#xD;
      substances, triterpenic compounds and volatile oil, favouring a healing, antitricomonazic&#xD;
      effect and reducing the excessive secretion (leucorrhea). Flavonoids and triterpene&#xD;
      glycosides boast soothing properties and also help improve microcirculation. Marigold is&#xD;
      mainly used for treating skin disorders: irritation, redness and inflammation. The plant was&#xD;
      employed in the civil war to treat wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the second clinical investigation on human subjects with this medical device, in&#xD;
      which 50 patients will be enlisted, and which will take place in two research centres in&#xD;
      Romania.&#xD;
