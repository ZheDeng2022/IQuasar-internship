  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of a novel, dyadic&#xD;
      intervention for heart failure couples versus an educational counseling intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need for theoretically- and empirically-driven dyadic interventions to&#xD;
      improve the outcomes of both adults with heart failure and their partners. The proposed study&#xD;
      will evaluate a novel, dyadic program, Taking Care of Us, versus an educational counseling&#xD;
      condition using a randomized controlled trial on 72 couples living with heart failure. Both&#xD;
      programs are offered via Zoom by trained interventionists and last approximately two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will 1) determine the efficacy of the Taking Care of Us intervention on&#xD;
      dyadic health; 2) determine the efficacy of the Taking Care of Us intervention on dyadic&#xD;
      appraisal and dyadic management; and 3) determine the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      Taking Care of Us intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Taking Care of Us involves seven sessions delivered via Zoom to couples over approximately two months. Sessions last approximately 45-60 minutes and are delivered by a trained interventionist. The program is a communication-based, relationship-focused intervention that is strengths-based and fosters new skills to support couples managing heart failure. The goals of the program are to 1) target the couple with heart failure as a team; 2) increase shared appraisal within the couple; 3) improve communication skills within the couple; 4) improve collaboration within the couple and dyadic management of heart failure; 5) improve confidence within the couple; and 6) improve both individual and dyadic health and well-being.</description>
