  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is faecally&#xD;
      contaminated and thus likely to lead to diarrheal illness: nearly 1,000 children die each day&#xD;
      due to water and sanitation-related diarrhoeal diseases. Diseases related to the consumption&#xD;
      of contaminated drinking-water place a major burden on human health. In 2017, 785 million&#xD;
      people still lacked access to an improved drinking water source, and these are mostly the&#xD;
      poor and marginalised. Almost a quarter of those people rely on surface water that is&#xD;
      untreated and over 90% live in rural areas. Many people are forced to rely on sources that&#xD;
      are microbiologically unsafe, leading to a higher risk of contracting waterborne diseases,&#xD;
      including typhoid, hepatitis A and E, polio and cholera. The objectives of the SAFEWATER&#xD;
      project is to develop technologies to provide clean water to economically deprived&#xD;
      communities in rural Colombia and Mexico. These water technologies will be tested under real&#xD;
      conditions with the cooperation of the rural communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAFEWATER field trials aims to evaluate the health and behaviour impacts of implementing&#xD;
      SAFEWATER water treatment technologies for drinking water disinfection, with a behavioral&#xD;
      change intervention, within rural communities in Colombia and Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has three specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess water quality improvement at household level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess behaviors and test behavioral interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess child growth and related health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three communities in Colombia and one community in Mexico were recruited to take part in the&#xD;
      study. Communities were selected based on factors such as current availability of clean&#xD;
      water, accessibility, safety, community size and current activities within the communities.&#xD;
      Pilot and feasibility studies were carried out prior to commencing field trials, thus the&#xD;
      design of the trials vary across countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mexico field trial: The trial in Mexico will use a stepped-wedge design, randomized at&#xD;
      household level over a 12-month period (6-12 steps dependent on adherence and feasibility).&#xD;
      All households (max n200) willing to be involved will be recruited (separate&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colombia field trial: the trial in Colombia will use a non-randomized parallel design (2:1;&#xD;
      intervention:control). A maximum of 84 households (54:30; intervention:control) will be&#xD;
      recruited to take part, with families with young children (&lt;12 years) prioritized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for both countries will include 1) water quality, 2) water-related behaviour (e.g.&#xD;
      frequency of system use, uses of treated / raw water), and 3) health, e.g. diarrhoea&#xD;
      prevalence, growth (height/weight), school attendance, water insecurity status, gut&#xD;
      integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: The development and deployment of the SAFEWATER technology has the potential to&#xD;
      impact on clean drinking water access for participating communities in Mexico and Colombia&#xD;
      and subsequently on the health and wellbeing of those individuals involved. Additionally if&#xD;
      successful, the work will also provide an evidence based model for the provision of improved&#xD;
      access to clean drinking water for rural communities in developing regions more widely.&#xD;
