  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab when given in&#xD;
      combination with nab-paclitaxel as treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (HR NMIBC) which is not completely resectable. Patients will receive treatment&#xD;
      with tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 4 treatment cycles&#xD;
      over 12 weeks followed by transurethral resection biopsy.&#xD;
