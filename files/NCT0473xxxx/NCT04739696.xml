  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will investigate the ability of an effective stress management&#xD;
      psychoeducation program for employed caregivers to mitigate psychological distress and&#xD;
      pathophysiology in spousal or partnered caregivers of patients' diagnosis with a solid tumor&#xD;
      cancer of any stage. It is expected that improving caregiver status will have reduced&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of PsychoEducation Paced Respiration and Relaxation (PEPRR)&#xD;
           delivered remotely as Virtual-PEPRR or online as Pep-Pal on caregivers employed at the&#xD;
           time of their patient's cancer diagnosis and preselected based on high self-reported&#xD;
           distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patient psychological status and healthcare utilization in patients whose&#xD;
           caregivers received Virtual-PEPRR or Pep-Pal versus TAU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether caregivers employment outcomes are associated with patient symptom&#xD;
           management as an exploratory question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Caregivers are randomized to one of 3 groups (1:1:1) 1) Treatment as usual (TAU), 2)&#xD;
      Virtual-PEPRR, or 3) Pep-Pal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I (treatment as usual [TAU]): Caregivers randomized to TAU will not participate in&#xD;
           the stress management interventions. The TAU condition for this study takes into account&#xD;
           published recommendations for an adequate representation of TAU. All participants&#xD;
           regardless of randomization will be encouraged to use available psychological resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II (Virtual PsychoEducation Paced Respiration and Relaxation [Virtual-PEPRR]):&#xD;
           Caregivers participating in the Virtual-PEPRR intervention will consist of eight 60-75&#xD;
           minute video or telephone sessions. Each Virtual-PEPRR session will be devoted to a&#xD;
           specific topic with the goal of assisting the caregiver in developing and applying&#xD;
           stress-management skills both in caregiving as well as in their work setting. Sessions&#xD;
           include problem-solving, identifying cognitive distortions, application of relaxation&#xD;
           techniques such as the emWave2, acquiring new coping skills, utilizing social support,&#xD;
           and establishing appropriate goals, and finding support. All caregivers in Virtual-PEPRR&#xD;
           will be provided a Caregiver Workbook that includes information about the session topics&#xD;
           and homework assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III (Pep-Pal): Pep-Pal is a mobilized version of Virtual-PEPRR. Pep-Pal includes&#xD;
           eleven web-based video modules replicate essential components of each session of&#xD;
           Virtual-PEPRR, but in shorter format (&lt;20 minute. duration) with engaging relaxation&#xD;
           exercises. The modules include learning skills in problem-solving, identifying cognitive&#xD;
           distortions, using relaxation techniques, acquiring new coping skills, utilizing social&#xD;
           support, establishing suitable goals, and finding support. Pep-Pal includes &quot;Mini-Peps&quot;&#xD;
           which are video guided, 3-minute stress reduction exercises that the caregiver can&#xD;
           access any time. Caregivers randomized to Pep-Pal will complete modules at times that&#xD;
           are convenient and web-accessible by smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.&#xD;
           Caregivers can complete more than one module a week, repeat any session, and access the&#xD;
           Mini-Peps as frequently as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers and patients undergo psychosocial assessments prior to randomization, and at 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after baseline. At each phase, caregivers and patients&#xD;
      will complete battery of questionnaires that includes the Center for Epidemiological&#xD;
      Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), the perceived stress scale (PSS), and the State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Caregivers will be asked monthly to complete eight very short&#xD;
      questions Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Additionally the&#xD;
      patient will complete the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory each time while the caregiver&#xD;
      completes questionnaires will cover details about how being a caregiver has affected their&#xD;
      lives, details about employment, insurance and accommodations, general physical and mental&#xD;
      well-being, and the impact Covid-19 has had on their lives. The patient and the caregiver&#xD;
      will additionally complete a demographic questionnaire that includes questions regarding age,&#xD;
      diagnosis, income, and other standard questions regarding nutrition, health behaviors, and&#xD;
      health services utilization. At study completion, an exit questionnaire will address each&#xD;
      subject's evaluation of the study and the group in which they were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva and hair samples from caregivers will be collected every three months: baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after baseline.&#xD;
