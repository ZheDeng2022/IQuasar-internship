  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a &quot;muscle phenotyping&quot; magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) assessment in patients receiving clinical care at the Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Philadelphia (CHOP) for mitochondrial disease that is either suspected (based on clinical&#xD;
      presentation) or has a definite genetic diagnosis. The MRI assessment quantifies skeletal&#xD;
      muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope that this study will contribute to our current knowledge of mitochondrial&#xD;
      diseases and this study will help create a new diagnostic tool for use in both clinical care&#xD;
      and in clinical trials.&#xD;

      This research study visit will occur on the same day as the participants clinically scheduled&#xD;
      MRI. The clinically indicated and study-specific scanning time will not exceed 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study team member will review inclusion and exclusion criteria with the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study team member will review medical history review with the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safety assessment will occur prior to study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During which the participant will use an MRI-safe machine to stimulate exercise, similar&#xD;
           to pressing a gas pedal&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible participants return to CHOP for future clinical imaging, we will also request a&#xD;
      study-specific MRI assessment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females, between the ages of 7 and 75, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected (based on clinical presentation) or definite genetic mitochondrial disease&#xD;
             diagnosis (i.e., genetic mutations in the constituents of the mitochondrial&#xD;
             respiratory chain and/or genetic mutations that are likely to affect mitochondrial&#xD;
             function)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing-and screened eligible for-a clinically indicated MRI of the lower leg.&#xD;
             Investigators are conducting clinical leg MRI scans of patients with definite&#xD;
             mitochondrial disease for indications that include muscle weakness and muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to perform sub-maximal ankle dorsiflexion leg exercise during the MRI study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, inability to fully comply with research procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active alcohol and/or substance abuse, including tobacco-use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pacemaker; any metal-based medical or non-medical devices/implants; any&#xD;
             non-removable metal-based object (e.g., body piercings, jewelry, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of intraocular injury or fragment in or around the orbit that cannot be&#xD;
             cleared through radiologic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of bullet, shrapnel, or stabbing wounds that cannot be cleared through&#xD;
             radiologic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past or current employment involving (or exposure to) a metal grinder (e.g., at a&#xD;
             construction worksite)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia or any known medical conditions which can be exacerbated by stress,&#xD;
             anxiety, or panic attacks triggered by enclosed spaces&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to lie flat in an MRI scanner for up to 120 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any potentially interfering clinical MRI contrast agents, as reviewed with the&#xD;
             radiology team&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the discretion of the principal investigator (PI), any medical condition that will&#xD;
             interfere with or prevent the safe completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any female participant with childbearing potential who is knowingly pregnant or&#xD;
             suspects that she is pregnant will be removed from the study. (Although there are no&#xD;
             known risks of MRI on pregnant females or fetuses, there is a possibility of yet&#xD;
             undiscovered pregnancy-related risks. Since there is no direct benefit from&#xD;
             participating in this protocol for pregnant females, they will be excluded to ensure&#xD;
             their long-term safety and that of their unborn fetus.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To note, for this protocol, participants are instructed to lie still in the MRI&#xD;
             scanner; there is no contrast or sedation. Participants will be asked to perform a&#xD;
             brief (&lt; 2 minute) foot-pedal exercise. Investigators will ensure that total MRI&#xD;
             scanning time (i.e., clinically indicated and study-specific scanning) does not exceed&#xD;
             120 minutes within a single day. Participants who do not possess the cognitive and/or&#xD;
             physical abilities to perform these procedures will not be included.&#xD;
