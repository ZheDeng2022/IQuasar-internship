  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a new technology called breathprinting,&#xD;
      or electronic nose (e-nose), to detect early-stage lung cancer. Additionally, researchers&#xD;
      also want to see if the e-nose technology is more effective at diagnosing lung cancer if the&#xD;
      tumor size is larger.&#xD;

    <description>One hundred evaluable individuals aged 21 to 85 years with a single undiagnosed pulmonary nodule measuring &lt;3 cm, clinically staged as cT1N0M0 (eighth edition of the TNM staging manual) by CT and PET scans, will be enrolled in this diagnostic study and will undergo e-nose testing. These patients must have a risk assessment profile that, according to institutional guidelines, identifies them as candidates for subsequent surgical resection of the pulmonary nodule, which will confirm the results of the breathprinting analysis.</description>

    <description>Consented, enrolled participants will undergo a breathprinting test (e-nose) during the presurgical visit and at the same facility as their presurgical or prebiopsy visit, before any attempt is made to obtain cytohistological diagnosis of the pulmonary nodule.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,&#xD;
        the principal investigator (PI), or the research team at MSK. If the PI is a member of the&#xD;
        treatment team, he or she will screen his or her patients' medical records for suitable&#xD;
        research study participants, and discuss the study and the patient's potential for&#xD;
        enrolling in the research study with the patient. Potential subjects contacted by their&#xD;
        treating physician will be referred to the PI/research staff to record appropriate contact&#xD;
        information, so that these patients can be approached about enrolling in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 21-85&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Single, monolateral nodule of at least 50% solid composition visible on chest CT scan&#xD;
             (with or without contrast) suspicious for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MSK radiologist report or read suggestive (i.e. at least 50% certainty) of suspected&#xD;
             primary lung cancer (in accordance with the level of certainty criteria set forth by&#xD;
             MSKCC Radiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative test for COVID-19 performed locally or at MSK, done as part of standard of&#xD;
             care testing (i.e. only when required by specific institutional policy) prior to&#xD;
             biopsy or surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, robotic bronchoscopy, and/or surgical&#xD;
             resection for diagnosis (i.e., does not have comorbidities precluding these).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented, signed, and dated informed consent, obtained before any procedures, for&#xD;
             the proposed research study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must agree to undergo fine-needle aspiration biopsy, robotic bronchoscopy,&#xD;
             and/or surgical resection for diagnosis prior to e-nose collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;21 and &gt;85 years at first outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple ipsilateral or bilateral nodules reported on chest CT scan and/or concurrent&#xD;
             as suspicious for lung cancer (note: nodules deemed indeterminate, inflammatory, etc.&#xD;
             will not exclude a patient from participating in this study) semisolid GGOs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lung nodule of interest is less than 50% solid in composition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Per MSK radiologist report or read, the lung nodule of interest is &quot;less likely&quot; or&#xD;
             &quot;unlikely&quot; (i.e. less than 50% certainty) to be neoplastic (in accordance with the&#xD;
             level of certainty criteria set forth by MSKCC Radiology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous history of lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of all other (i.e. non-lung) cancers within the last five years (note:&#xD;
             prior history of completely treated non-lung cancer from over five years ago will be&#xD;
             eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic lung cancer disease seen on chest CT or PET scan at hilar/mediastinal nodes&#xD;
             or contralateral lung or extrathoracic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous medical history of a lung biopsy/surgical procedure for cancer diagnosis&#xD;
             (note: patients who underwent a lung biopsy over five years ago that showed negative&#xD;
             for lung cancer will be eligible)&#xD;
