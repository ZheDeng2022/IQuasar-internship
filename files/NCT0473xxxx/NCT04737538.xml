  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a daily use toothpaste containing sodium bicarbonate,&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate and sodium fluoride with the intention of providing improved/ fast gum&#xD;
      healing. This Proof-of-Principle study will investigate the efficacy of an experimental&#xD;
      dentifrice compared to a regular fluoride dentifrice, and also whether this provides any&#xD;
      additional benefit in reducing gingival inflammation/ bleeding compared with a 67% w/w sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate/ 0.221% w/w sodium fluoride containing toothpaste.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, examiner-blind, randomized, stratified, three-treatment,&#xD;
      parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers with mild to moderate gingivitis. There will&#xD;
      be six visits to the study site: Screening, Baseline, Day 3 and Weeks 1, 2 and 6. Gingivitis&#xD;
      will be assessed using a Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and a Bleeding Index (BI). Plaque will&#xD;
      be assessed by the Turesky modification of the Quigley Hein (TPI). All evaluable teeth (in&#xD;
      relation to the inclusion/ exclusion general dentition criteria) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage regimen of twice daily treatment (morning and evening) for the washout dentifrice&#xD;
      and study products will be the same for all participants and is based on widely recommended&#xD;
      oral hygiene practice/typical consumer habit. Study participants will be instructed to brush&#xD;
      for at least 1 timed minute with their assigned study dentifrice on each brushing occasion.&#xD;
      After 6 weeks (Day 42+/-3 days) twice daily treatment, each participant should complete&#xD;
      between approximately 84-90 treatment applications. During the washout period for this study&#xD;
      (minimum 14 days/ maximum 28 days), eligible participants will use a marketed, regular&#xD;
      fluoride toothpaste and toothbrush (as provided).&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Gingivitis by Comparing Efficacy of an Experimental Dentifrice Compared to Negative Control Dentifrice, Measured by Bleeding Index (BI) After 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BI method will be used to assess gingival bleeding as measure of gingival health for facial and lingual/palatal gingival surfaces of all evaluable teeth, six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual/palatal, lingual/palatal, and distolingual/palatal). Comparison will be done between experimental dentifrice and negative control dentifrice containing 1100 ppm sodium fluoride. Examiner will insert a round-end probe approximately(app.) 1millimeter(mm) into gingival sulcus (at app. 60 degrees) and move around tooth, from distal interproximal area to mesial interproximal area, gently stretching gingival epithelium. Gingival bleeding will be assessed 30 seconds after probing. Assessments will be performed 1 quadrant at a time; BI scores will be recorded as per given scoring criteria: 0=absence of bleeding on probing,1=bleeding observed within 30 seconds of probing,2=bleeding observed immediately on probing. Score range 0-2 where lower scores indicate better results.</description>

             medical history or upon oral examination, or condition, that would impact the&#xD;
             participant's safety, wellbeing or the outcome of the study, if they were to&#xD;
             participate in the study, or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow&#xD;
             study procedures and requirements.&#xD;
