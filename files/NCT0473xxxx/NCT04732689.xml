      The overarching objective of the research program entitled ELIPTO (Enhancing Liver&#xD;
      Insufficiency and Postoperative Transplantation Outcomes) (www.elipto.ca) is to improve the&#xD;
      perioperative care of liver transplant recipients. One of this program's purposes is to&#xD;
      better define the effects of intraoperative hemodynamic management on postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      in adult liver transplant recipients. In this study, the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications within this population will be defined in Canada and the association between&#xD;
      intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative outcomes will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplantation improves the survival of patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD).&#xD;
      It is the second most transplanted organ with a continuously increasing annual number of&#xD;
      transplantations, an observation partly explained by an endemic ESLD etiology in the United&#xD;
      States, the obesity-related non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis. In recent&#xD;
      decades, although sicker patients are prioritized, survival has improved possibly through an&#xD;
      overall improvement in the quality of care. However, postoperative complications have&#xD;
      concomitantly increased. On average, liver transplant recipients suffer from more than three&#xD;
      postoperative complications, mainly infectious, pulmonary, renal or graft-related, two thirds&#xD;
      of them being severe. In a low-risk patients cohort, close to 60% of all patients suffered&#xD;
      from at least one severe complication up to 6 months after surgery. Such complications&#xD;
      increase mortality, readmissions and cost of care. Organs available for transplantation are a&#xD;
      scarce resource; up to 10% of grafts are no longer functional after one year. Interventions&#xD;
      that improve patients' postoperative and graft outcomes are needed and few perioperative ones&#xD;
      are supported by high-quality evidence.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to describe and measure the effects of intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamic management on postoperative outcomes in liver transplantation in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the overall incidence of postoperative complications and graft outcomes in&#xD;
           adult liver transplant recipients in Canada and across different recipients'&#xD;
           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the effects of fluid balance, within an overall hemodynamic instability and&#xD;
           management strategy, on the postoperative outcomes of liver transplant recipients in&#xD;
           Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypotheses of this study are that an intraoperative hemodynamic management based&#xD;
      on a restrictive fluid administration may improve postoperative outcomes in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPOSURE VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposures of interest will be the intraoperative fluid balance and the intraoperative&#xD;
      doses and types of vasopressors used. Fluid balance will be defined as the sum of the volume&#xD;
      of administered crystalloids, colloids and blood product transfusions minus drained ascites,&#xD;
      intraoperative diuresis and bleeding. Doses of administered vasopressors will be converted&#xD;
      into a time-weighted total norepinephrine equivalent dose calculated as the total equipotent&#xD;
      units of norepinephrine administered as an infusion divided by the number of hours the&#xD;
      infusion was given during the period between entrance in the operating room and end of&#xD;
      surgery. Types of vasopressors used will also be collected. Since a restrictive fluid&#xD;
      management strategy is associated with a higher use of vasopressors and vice versa, both&#xD;
      variables may covary together. However, more difficult surgeries will be associated with&#xD;
      higher blood loss, higher volume of administered fluid and higher doses of vasopressors. The&#xD;
      combination of these two variables will help estimate the intraoperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      management strategy used and delineate the effects of each component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other patients' characteristics and perioperative practices variables will be captured for&#xD;
      descriptive purposes. Recipients' demographic characteristics (age, sex), anthropometric&#xD;
      variables (body mass index (BMI)), the presence of any previous abdominal surgery, presence&#xD;
      of hepatic encephalopathy, need for preoperative organ support or any preoperative hospital&#xD;
      admission will be collected as well. Data on the perioperative use of invasive cardiac output&#xD;
      monitoring (thermodilution catheter, transoesophageal echocardiography, etc.), as well as&#xD;
      coagulation management (use of thromboelastometry, tranexamic acid, transfusion thresholds,&#xD;
      etc.) will be collected. Other donor and graft variables, such as donor sex, donor's BMI, the&#xD;
      type of vascular and biliary anastomoses, the use of extended-criteria donor graft, the use&#xD;
      of ex vivo perfusion, ischemia time, the practice of donation after circulatory death (donor&#xD;
      characteristics, heparin usage, etc.) and the perioperative use of liver biopsies will also&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTIVE AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data The investigators will train all sites regarding quality of data collection and&#xD;
      will emphasize the importance of complete data collection. In case a complete case analysis&#xD;
      would exclude more than 5% of the observations, the investigators will use multiple&#xD;
      imputations by chained equations using 5 to 20 imputated datasets assuming MAR (missingness&#xD;
      at random) on the covariables and the outcomes. In case of any missing outcome, the&#xD;
      investigators will not include imputated outcomes in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses and complications incidences across centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidences of different complications will be described. The main descriptive&#xD;
      analysis will be to report these incidences overall as well as across denominated centers.&#xD;
      For each complication, the investigators will first compute a chi-square test for each&#xD;
      complication to test if the variation across centre is statistically significant. Secondly,&#xD;
      investigators will estimate multivariable determination models for each complication by&#xD;
      fitting generalized mixed effect models using a logit link adjusted for age, sex, disease&#xD;
      severity (MELD) and the DRI with an estimated random-effect for clustering within centres.&#xD;
      The investigators will then compute intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficients to better&#xD;
      define the variability of complications across centres (heterogeneity). However,&#xD;
      investigators will fit a Cox regression with a frailty factor for biliary&#xD;
      complications.Finally, the investigators will fit a generalized mixed effect model using a&#xD;
      log link and quasi-Poisson distribution for the total number of complications up to 30 days&#xD;
      per patient with an estimated random effect for clustering within centres The secondary&#xD;
      exploratory analyses will be to report the cumulative incidence of each complications&#xD;
      according to age categories (&lt; 50, 50-60, &gt;60), sex, nature and severity of liver disease&#xD;
      (chronic liver disease (CLF), acute liver failure (ALF), retransplantation and MELD&#xD;
      categories among CLD patients (&lt; 20, 20-30, &gt;30). Such incidences per subgroups will be&#xD;
      reported with 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will also report survival up to 6&#xD;
      months over and across centres by fitting a Cox regression with a frailty factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Association between hemodynamic management and postoperative complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary association analysis will be the association between fluid balance and primary&#xD;
      graft dysfunction by 7 days after transplantation using a multivariable mixed-effect model&#xD;
      using a logistic link and random intercepts to estimate inter-centre variability and&#xD;
      intra-cluster correlation, adjusted for the time-weighted dose of vasopressors and the&#xD;
      aforementioned confounders. The investigators will consider any patient needing a&#xD;
      retransplantation within 7 days after the index transplantation as having a primary graft&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary main analysis will be the association between fluid balance and time to biliary&#xD;
      non-anastomotic strictures using a multivariable Fine and Gray model, adjusted for the same&#xD;
      confounders, with retransplantation and death (not caused by the biliary non-anastomotic&#xD;
      strictures) considered as competing risks. The intra-cluster correlation will be addressed&#xD;
      using a frailty factor. The second transplantation of any patient performed during the&#xD;
      observation period will be excluded to avoid intra-patient correlation and censor the first&#xD;
      transplantation follow-up at retransplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other secondary analyses will be the association between fluid balance and other outcomes&#xD;
      using similar adjusted survival models (with frailty factors) or generalized mixed effect&#xD;
      models (with random intercepts). Statistical interaction will be explored between fluid&#xD;
      balance and the vasopressors dose variable. Risk proportionality over time will be explored&#xD;
      using the Harrel and Lee test and a visual inspection of the Schoenfeld residuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first conduct a sensitivity analysis using a generalized propensity&#xD;
      score for fluid balance (based on probability density) that will include all confounders and&#xD;
      the vasopressor exposure and estimate a marginal effect of fluid balance using an inverse&#xD;
      probability of treatment weighting with stabilized weights. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      influential analyzes to explore the robustness of their findings by alternatively excluding&#xD;
      patients transplanted for acute liver failure, those who received a living donor graft or&#xD;
      cadaveric donor graft after cardiocirculatory arrest, and those with severe chronic renal&#xD;
      failure (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 15 mL/hour/1.73 m2 or on dialysis). The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the confounding effect of hypotension by removing it from the models and&#xD;
      measure the observed change in estimate as well as by a sensitivity analysis restricted in&#xD;
      the subgroup of patients without significant residual hypotension (&lt; 150 min*Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will conduct all analyses by adding data from the French centre to&#xD;
      explore the variation in the estimates created by adding a non-Canadian centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An economic analysis to evaluate hospital costs associated with the observed incidences of&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be conducted. The costs associated with our fluid balance&#xD;
      exposure effect will be analyzed. Costs will be those associated with the actual procedures,&#xD;
      as determined by every hospital using its account systems, and include both fixed and&#xD;
      variable components previously identified as major cost drivers (mechanical ventilation days,&#xD;
      LOS, reoperation and ICU readmission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical trials in major surgery, a relative difference of 25% for all complications&#xD;
      was considered minimally clinically significant. If investigators assume an overall 7-day&#xD;
      proportion (cumulative) incidence of primary graft dysfunction of 25% at the mean of fluid&#xD;
      balance and a relative increase of 25% of this complication (absolute increase of 6.25%) by&#xD;
      increasing the fluid balance by 1 standard deviation, a sample of 475 will be necessary&#xD;
      (power = 90%, R2 of the covariables on the main exposure = 0,1).Since random effects have a&#xD;
      minimal impact on the sample size when the intervention is not cluster randomized, the&#xD;
      investigators did not take it into account in the sample size calculation. To prevent&#xD;
      potential seasonal variability in organ procurement, have more power in case of missing data&#xD;
      or a slightly lower than expected incidence of the primary outcome, the investigators planned&#xD;
      to enroll all eligible patients over a 1-year period. The investigators anticipated being&#xD;
      able to enroll 500 consecutive liver transplant recipients over such period according to the&#xD;
      annual volume in each centre (CHUM: 65, MUHC: 45, TGH: 200, LHSC: 60, UAH: 100, QEIIHSC: 30).&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was conducted using G-Power software using the recommended Demidenko&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 7 days after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was chosen because preliminary data from the CHUM suggested that a higher fluid balance was associated with primary graft non-function (retransplantation or death). Since graft perfusion is correlated with cardiac output, intraoperative hemodynamic management may have an effect on graft perfusion and postoperative graft function. Also, this is a well-defined, quantitative definition, that is associated with overall graft and patient survival. Since graft loss of 10% at 1 year is a concern among the transplant community, finding causes and solutions to improve graft function is paramount.</description>
