  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre, international case-control study to develop a biobank of sera from 150 cases&#xD;
      of serotype III GBS disease and associated clinical information from seven countries (Malawi,&#xD;
      Uganda, UK, the Netherlands, Italy and France), with 3:1 (450) serotype matched healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes severe infections in young infants across the world. In&#xD;
      2015 it was estimated that there were at least 319,000 infants under three months of age with&#xD;
      GBS disease worldwide, resulting in 90,000 deaths and at least 10,000 children with long term&#xD;
      disabilities. Around 20% of all pregnant women carry GBS in their vagina and bowel, and&#xD;
      babies are exposed to GBS bacteria around the time of birth. The options for prevention are&#xD;
      currently limited to offering antibiotics during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vaccine that could be given to pregnant women has the greatest potential to benefit mothers&#xD;
      and babies worldwide. There are vaccines currently being tested in clinical trials, including&#xD;
      in pregnant women. Given the complexity, size and costs associated with a phase III trial, it&#xD;
      is generally agreed that indirect evidence (correlates) of protection (CoP), based on&#xD;
      immunologic data from vaccine and seroepidemiological studies, opsonophagocytic assays and&#xD;
      supported by animal models, could be pivotal for vaccine licensure, with effectiveness&#xD;
      subsequently confirmed in post-licensure evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop a biobank of sera from 150 cases of serotype III GBS disease and&#xD;
      associated clinical information from seven countries (Malawi, Uganda, UK, the Netherlands,&#xD;
      Italy and France) with 3:1 (450) serotype matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS cases will be identified through active surveillance of GBS disease in infants, as part&#xD;
      of ongoing epidemiological studies in Uganda, the UK, Italy, France, the Netherlands and&#xD;
      Malawi. Upon identification of cases, consent will be requested to obtain a serum sample (1-2&#xD;
      mL of blood collected from infant), the GBS isolate and to collect brief clinical and&#xD;
      demographic details. Each site will aim to collect around 50 cases of invasive GBS disease&#xD;
      cases (with all samples) over the course of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will also recruit approximately 1000 women to have a rectovaginal swab at 35-37&#xD;
      weeks gestation and cord and maternal blood samples at delivery. These women and their&#xD;
      infants will be followed up to 90 days of age and considered appropriate controls if the&#xD;
      infants are exposed to the same serotype/strain of GBS at delivery as the case - but do not&#xD;
      develop GBS the first 90 days of life. We will select 3 controls for every case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biorepository will be established at the St George's University of London for all samples&#xD;
      from the European Union and Malawi and the MRC/UVRI &amp; LSHTM Uganda Research Unit for Ugandan&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
