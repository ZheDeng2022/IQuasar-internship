  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) may be useful in managing the pathologies that alter&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, such as Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia (FM). The anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect of LDN should be produced through the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 activity&#xD;
      expressed in the membrane of various immune system cells (e.g. microglia). Conversely, due to&#xD;
      a rebound effect, LDN could exercise an analgesic effect that strengthens the endogenous&#xD;
      inhibitory system. According to this hypothesis, the low-intensity and intermittent blocking&#xD;
      of the opioid receptors generated by LDN should induce a compensatory mechanism that should&#xD;
      facilitate an increase in the production of endogenous opioids and greater sensitivity of the&#xD;
      system to their effects. To date, the effects of LDN in patients with FM have been evaluated&#xD;
      through crossover studies that have yielded promising results. Given that the studies&#xD;
      conducted up to now have had small sample sizes and crossover designs, and given that there&#xD;
      are still no studies in which its potential cost-utility is assessed, studies with greater&#xD;
      methodological rigor and larger samples are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of LDN in&#xD;
      FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jointly evaluating the effectiveness and cost-utility, the changes in metabolites in certain&#xD;
      areas of the brain, and systemic inflammatory markers potentially linked to the&#xD;
      etiopathogenesis of FM, should allow us to gain a more detailed knowledge of the&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of LDN in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of LDN in patients with FM and analyse&#xD;
      its cost-utility both from the government and the healthcare perspective at 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
      Brain metabolites and systemic inflammatory biomarkers will be included to evaluate&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms behind LDN therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, Controlled Trial. Centre: Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu (St. Boi de&#xD;
      Llobregat, Spain). Participants: 120 patients with FM will be randomly assigned to LDN&#xD;
      (4.5mg/day) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measure: Pain severity using Ecological Momentary Assessment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: functionality, affective symptoms, fibrofog, quality of life. Costs and QALYs will&#xD;
      be also calculated. Biomarkers: 50% of the patients will be scanned at baseline and at week&#xD;
      12 for changes in brain metabolites related to neuroinflammation and central sensitization.&#xD;
      Immune-inflammatory markers in serum will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Low-dose Naltrexone (LDN): A potential treatment for fibromyalgia (FM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used for treating opiate and alcohol dependency that&#xD;
      blocks the mu receptors and, to a lesser extent, the delta-opioid receptors. There is growing&#xD;
      evidence that naltrexone administered in very low doses (i.e. low-dose naltrexone, LDN)&#xD;
      -approximately 1/10 of the usual dose, between 1.5-5 mg vs. 50 mg/day- may be useful in&#xD;
      managing the various pathologies that alter inflammatory markers, such as Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-inflammatory effect of naltrexone should be produced through the inhibition of TLR-4&#xD;
      (Toll-like receptor 4) activity expressed in the membrane of various immune system cells&#xD;
      (e.g. microglia, macrophages). Conversely, due to a &quot;rebound effect&quot;, LDN could exercise an&#xD;
      analgesic effect that strengthens the endogenous inhibitory system. According to this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the low-intensity and intermittent blocking of the opioid receptors generated by&#xD;
      LDN should induce a compensatory mechanism that should facilitate an increase in the&#xD;
      production of endogenous opioids and greater sensitivity of the system to their effects. To&#xD;
      date, the effects of LDN in patients with FM have only been evaluated through crossover pilot&#xD;
      studies and have always produced highly promising results. Thus, in the first study conducted&#xD;
      with LDN in FM (N= 10), ameliorations in the daily pain, stress and fatigue levels were&#xD;
      observed. In the same vein, in a posterior study (N= 31), significant improvements (vs.&#xD;
      Placebo) in daily pain (28% vs. 18%), satisfaction with life and mood were also observed. In&#xD;
      another single-blind crossover study (N= 8) the pre and post changes in the levels of&#xD;
      cytokines in plasma were evaluated over 8 weeks, with reductions in a wide range of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers being observed (e.g. IL-1, sIL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha), as well as&#xD;
      changes in the levels of pain (-15%) and FM symptoms (-18%). Given that the studies conducted&#xD;
      up to now had reduced sample sizes and crossover designs, and given that there are still no&#xD;
      studies in which its potential cost-utility is assessed, studies with greater methodological&#xD;
      rigor and larger samples are necessary to confirm the clinical effectiveness of LDN in FM.&#xD;
      Jointly evaluating the efficacy and cost-utility analyses, the changes in metabolites (i.e.&#xD;
      Glu) in certain areas of the brain, and systemic inflammatory markers potentially linked to&#xD;
      the etiopathogenesis of FM, should allow us to gain a more detailed knowledge of the&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of LDN in this population. The INNOVA&#xD;
      project will enable all these factors to be evaluated for the first time.&#xD;
