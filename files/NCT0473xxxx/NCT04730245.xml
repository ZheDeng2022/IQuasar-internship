  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, abnormalities in gut microbiota have been identified in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson´s disease having a possible role in motor manifestations. Among 80 patients with&#xD;
      PD, we selected 14 with LID and motor fluctuations with limited response to pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy to receive treatment with sodium phosphate enema, oral rifaximin and polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol to improve motor complications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We studied consecutive patients diagnosed with PD according to the Queen Square Brain Bank&#xD;
      Criteria [Hughes et al 1992] in a tertiary care center for movement disorders, from June 2018&#xD;
      to March 2020.&#xD;

    <description>Patients were hospitalized for 4-5 hours to receive two saline colon enemas with sodium phosphate Fleet®, 2 to 3 hours apart, appropriate hydration was provided during the procedure. If signs of fecal impaction were observed, the stools were removed manually prior to the first enema. Patients were discharged with oral treatment consistent with rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 7 days and polyethylene glycol-3350, 17 gr per day in water for 10 days, but it was continued if necessary. Importantly, no modifications in time and dose of dopaminergic therapy or anti-dyskinetic medication (i.e. amantadine) were done at baseline or during the study</description>
