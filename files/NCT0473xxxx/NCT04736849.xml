  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare electrophysiologic activity of epidural stimulation and dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglion stimulation, as well as quantify changes in motor performance with both types of&#xD;
      stimulation over the course of 10 rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to expand the understanding of how electrical spinal stimulation enables&#xD;
      function, specifically the pathophysiological mechanisms of action underlying spinal&#xD;
      electrical stimulation after SCI, and to address the gap in knowledge of spinal sensorimotor&#xD;
      network inputs and outputs generated by spinal electrical stimulation in humans with SCI.&#xD;

    <description>Change in measurements of impairment of sensory and motor functions using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AISA Scale). Individuals are classified from A&quot; (complete spinal cord injury) to &quot;E&quot; (normal function). 28 dermatomes and 10 key muscles are assessed bilaterally. Results are summed to produce overall sensory and motor scores and are used in combination with evaluation of anal sensory and motor function as a basis for the determination of AIS classification. Sensory scores are rated 0 (sensation absent) to 2 (normal), bilaterally for each of 28 dermatomes. Muscle function is rated 0 (total paralysis) to 5 (active movement, full range of motion against significant resistance) for each myotome. Upper Extremity Motor Subscores and Lower Extremity Motor Subscores are each scored from 0 to 50; the ASIA Motor Score is scored from 0 to 100. The presence of anal sensation and voluntary anal contraction are assessed as a yes/no.</description>
