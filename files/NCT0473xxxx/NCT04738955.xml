      This is a multi-center, prospective, open, observational and optimal clinical research to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of different doses of micafungin sodium for&#xD;
      injection in patients with hematological tumors. Researchers screened suitable subjects&#xD;
      according to the admission criteria, and after signing the informed consent form, micafungin&#xD;
      sodium for injection was used for preventive or empirical treatment. During the treatment&#xD;
      period, subjects who need to change the treatment plan due to uncontrollable infection or&#xD;
      other reasons will withdraw from this research and the researchers will decide the follow-up&#xD;
      treatment plan.All subjects were monitored for efficacy and safety according to the visit&#xD;
      plan during the research.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old, male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with hematological tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neutropenia: The absolute neutrophils count (ANC) in peripheral blood was 0.5×109/L or&#xD;
             was expected to be ANC&lt;0.5×109/L 48 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Fever: single measurement of oral temperature ≥ 38.3℃ (axillary temperature ≥ 38.0℃)&#xD;
             or oral temperature ≥ 38.0℃ (axillary temperature ≥ 37.7℃) lasts for more than 1h&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with high risk factors of IFD (Invasive Fungal Disease), such as patients&#xD;
             treated with allo-HSCT, patients with acute leukemia (including MDS) undergoing&#xD;
             primary induction or rescue chemotherapy, patients with expected granulocytosis&#xD;
             lasting more than 10 days, patients with severe granulocytosis or patients with severe&#xD;
             aplastic anemia receiving antithymic globulin (ATG) therapy or HSCT therapy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is being treated with an antifungal drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. People who are known or suspected to be allergic to echinocandins&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The infection is suspected to be caused by parasites, viruses or Mycobacterium&#xD;
             tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Existing drug sensitivity results suggest that patients resistant to micafungin&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh grade C&#xD;
&#xD;
