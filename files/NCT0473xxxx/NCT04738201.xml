  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and prevalent joint disorder with great impact on quality of&#xD;
      life and high economic burden. Although a number of conservative therapies have proven to be&#xD;
      effective for the management of hand OA, only modest treatment effects were reported for most&#xD;
      individual interventions. The aim of the proposed study is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      proprioceptive training on pain, function and sense perception in patients with&#xD;
      carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind, clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio, will be carried out involving patients diagnosis of CMC joint OA grade 1-2 (aged 18&#xD;
      years and above). Both assessor and statistician will remained blinded. The research&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis will be used to assess all&#xD;
      individuals who agree to participate. Based on the clinical and radiological findings, the&#xD;
      participants will be classified by a rheumatology. Those with CMC OA grade 2-3 will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard conservative thumb CMC joint OA treatments will received for both the control and&#xD;
      experimental groups for a period of 12 weeks. The experimental group will received a&#xD;
      proprioceptive training program during the same intervention period, which will be conducted&#xD;
      twice weekly (24 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of pain with activity will be measured according to the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS). QuickDASH questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. Patient's&#xD;
      occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure&#xD;
      (COPM) and proprioception with Joint position sense (JPS) testing. All outcome measures will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks&#xD;
      following the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be voluntary and patients will be included if they satisfied&#xD;
      specific inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be follow in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible&#xD;
      committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration. All participants will sign a written informed consent in accordance with&#xD;
      guidelines approved by the local ethics committee.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline-4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception using active joint position sense (JPS) has been utilized in studies to establish a correlation between therapy intervention and proprioception. The target position of 30º CMC abduction will be selected. Joint angle will be measured using a standard clear plastic goniometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for pain assessment which is used frequently for clinical and research purposes. It consists of a 10-cm line anchored at each end. The left-hand anchor reads 'no pain' and the right-hand anchor reads 'worst possible pain'; the patients marked a line to represent their pain level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick dash</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. This tool consists of 11 items providing a total score ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates no limitation and 100 suggests full disability. Eight items include questions about the ability of the patient to perform certain daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The COPM enables subjects to identify goals for hand therapy and engage in a subject-specific therapeutic process. It has been established that the COPM has good convergent validity and responsiveness for evaluating the relationship between patient self-perception and satisfaction for patients with CMC thumb OA .</description>
