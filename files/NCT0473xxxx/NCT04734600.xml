      This study is trying to answer the following research question: &quot;Are there any differences&#xD;
      between effects of aerobic training and myofascial release on claudication among peripheral&#xD;
      arterial insuffiency patients?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease is a systemic disorder and for the most part progressive. The&#xD;
      condition is associated with life and limb-threatening complications. Symptoms of PAD range&#xD;
      from intermittent claudication-defined as fatigue or discomfort in calf, buttock, or thigh&#xD;
      muscles on exertion that is relieved by rest-to critical limb ischemia-defined as distal leg&#xD;
      pain at rest with or without ischemic ulcers Despite many advances in endovascular surgery,&#xD;
      amputations of digits and limbs are not uncommon. Thus, the present-day approach is to&#xD;
      prevent the disorder in the first place. There are many evidences that support changes in&#xD;
      lifestyle can significantly decrease the rate of progression of the disease and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life in addition to aerobic training exercise and manual therapy .&#xD;

Before the MF will starte, patient will rested in a relaxed prone position for 15 to 30 mints and also after end session time, MF protocol will applied as follow sequence over all period of total treatment sessions (8) week.:&#xD;
thoracolumbar cross hand facial release technique for at least 5 mints for every barrier depth area, started by one hand will place on high thoracic area with pressure applied cephalic, the other hand was placed directly on the lower lumbo -sacrum area pushing caudal and arms are crossed to maximize as leverage as the barrier sense of softening will occurre and release sense on fascia under hand (release done at transverse alternative with longitudinal direction)alternation same methods to affected leg</description>
