  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The suprascapular nerve block is frequently used to treat chronic shoulder pain.&#xD;
      The nerve blockade provides probably only a short-term relief, and more compelling approaches&#xD;
      have been investigated. Pulsed radiofrequency stimulation of suprascapular nerve has been&#xD;
      reported as safe and reliable method for pain treatment. However, formal efficacy study for&#xD;
      pRF stimulation of the shoulder joint has not been published. Evidence-based validation of a&#xD;
      new method is necessary for both scholastic and practical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a randomized active controlled blind trial. Lidocaine injections alone&#xD;
      and pRF stimulation with two different combinations will be performed. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed during 6 months, and subjective and objective outcome variables will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients are randomly allocated for suprascapular nerve block (n=50), for suprascapular nerve&#xD;
      pRF stimulation (n=50) or for both suprascapular nerve blocks and humeroscapular joint pRF&#xD;
      stimulation (n=50). All patients will receive standardized physical therapy at the unit of&#xD;
      physical medicine and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Pulsed radiofrequency is thought to be a non-neurolytic neuromodulation method with&#xD;
      some effectiveness in relieving of both experimental and clinical neuropathic pain. Our&#xD;
      earlier results suggest additional therapeutic benefit obtained when pRF was performed in&#xD;
      addition to physiotherapy (TAU). In a review, Chan et al. (2016) concluded that SSNB&#xD;
      treatment could be more effective in treating pain in patients with longstanding rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis when compared to intra-articular injection of corticosteroid. Also short-term pain&#xD;
      reduction occurred in patients with chronic rotator cuff lesions. With regard to adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis, SSNB treatment showed a greater effect in relieving pain but on functional&#xD;
      outcome, the results were inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: In summary, this study investigate effects of pRF for patients with chronic&#xD;
      shoulder pain from arthritis, frozen shoulder and/or degenerative shoulder disease. PRF can&#xD;
      be performed in an outpatient department and provides the clinician with an alternative or&#xD;
      additional approach to oral drug treatment and intra-articular injection. Further, it may&#xD;
      prove to be a useful treatment for patients who are unfit or unwilling to consider surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Introduction After spinal and knee pain, shoulder pain is estimated to be the third most&#xD;
      common type of musculoskeletal pain, causing considerable psychosocial impact if progressing&#xD;
      to the chronic phase. While majority of patients with shoulder pain recover within few&#xD;
      months, over 40% of patients have persisting symptoms after 12 months. Establishing a&#xD;
      treatment strategy for shoulder pain can be challenging, as the effectiveness of many&#xD;
      treatment options is unclear. Non-surgical strategies are preferred in the first-line&#xD;
      management, with physiotherapy being of the treatment of choice in the majority of cases.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy, pain medication and corticosteroid injections (CSI) are used but the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these interventions may be insufficient. Corticosteroid injections are often&#xD;
      used in treatment of shoulder pain, though there is no clear evidence of long-term benefit.&#xD;
      It has been reported that CSI might lead to adverse events such as tendon degeneration,&#xD;
      cutaneous atrophy or infection. In addition, CSI can cause systemic side effects including&#xD;
      changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and elevated blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. Therefore, safer pain management options with more long-lasting pain relief are&#xD;
      sought. The suprascapular nerve derives from the ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves C4,&#xD;
      C5, and C6 and arises from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus, contributes approximately&#xD;
      70% of the sensory innervation to the shoulder joint. Suprascapular nerve blocks have been&#xD;
      used to manage acute and chronic shoulder pain, although the efficacy of treatment alters in&#xD;
      different studies and when compared to other treatment options. The short duration of action&#xD;
      of local anesthetics raises the question of their efficacy in the management of chronic&#xD;
      shoulder conditions. In addition to SSNB, pulsed radiofrequency stimulation (pRF) has also&#xD;
      been researched for its potentially greater and longer-lasting outcomes when comparing to&#xD;
      local anesthetics. There has been limited numbers of reviews specifically investigating the&#xD;
      usefulness of SSNB for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain. Liu et al. concluded in their&#xD;
      review pRF treatment to result in good efficiency in shoulder patients with no significant&#xD;
      complications reported. The pain relief could last several months. Only few case reports have&#xD;
      been made on pRF treatment of the glenohumeral joint. Considering the adverse effects of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, SSNB with local anesthetics could be regarded as a potential alternative for&#xD;
      pain relief in patients who have adhesive capsulitis. Our earlier results suggested&#xD;
      additional therapeutic benefit obtained when pRF for both suprascapular nerve and shoulder&#xD;
      joint was performed in addition to physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare whether pRF treatment of both glenohumeral joint and&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve provided additional clinical benefits compared to suprascapular nerve&#xD;
      block or pRF treatment of suprascapular nerve only. The rehabilitation included also&#xD;
      individual functional training and treatment as recommended by the national task group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This randomized controlled trial will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials Statement; it will be performed at Central Hospital in Satakunta, Pori, Finland. The&#xD;
      study has been approved by the local Research Ethics Committee (SS/1184/13.01/2018). The&#xD;
      sample size estimate was obtained to detect differences between the treatment groups in&#xD;
      relation to the primary outcome of the study after the intervention. Kukkonen's et al. study&#xD;
      estimated the clinically important minimal difference in CM score in 10.4 points in patients&#xD;
      with rotator cuff rupture after 3 months of surgical treatment by the arthroscopic method.&#xD;
      The estimated sample size of 45 patients per group, total of 135patients, would reach 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a 10.4 difference between the groups in the SPADI instrument follow-up score&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of up to 15 points with a significance level of 5% using a&#xD;
      t-Student test. Predicting a loss of around 10% at 6 months follow-up, we aim to recruit 50&#xD;
      patients per group. The placebo response is usually estimated as high as 30%. Using&#xD;
      calculation of difference between proportions, the sample size was estimated as 50 patients&#xD;
      total. Randomization 1:1:1 is performed. Patients will be consecutively allocated to one of&#xD;
      three proposed treatment methods. The software R was used to generate a randomization list,&#xD;
      considering 150 patients included in the study and the same probability of allocation for&#xD;
      methods of pain treatment intervention. Patients with shoulder pain &gt; 3 months duration,&#xD;
      clinical and imaging confirmation of adhesive capsulitis, tendinosis, arthritis, rotator cuff&#xD;
      or capsular tears are eligible for participation. Failure of conservative medical therapy is&#xD;
      documented. Exclusion criteria comprised refusal to participate, extrinsic source of shoulder&#xD;
      pain (e.g., cervical radiculopathy) and pain related to bony fracture. All patients are at&#xD;
      first evaluated by specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who use ultrasound and&#xD;
      clinical examination to estimate shoulder function. Patients who have more specific shoulder&#xD;
      dysfunction based on subjective symptoms and clinical evaluation are asked to participate&#xD;
      this intervention study. Of totally around 300 consecutive patients who receive pRF on the&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve and shoulder joint, 150 consecutive patients are estimated voluntarily&#xD;
      participate the study. Primary outcomes, such as Shoulder Pain and Disability Index ,15D&#xD;
      self-administered measure of health-related quality of life and working ability are measured.&#xD;
      This study is also part of the quality register study of the unit. Our standardized patient&#xD;
      surveys cover demographic data, level of education, work status and future outlook, pain&#xD;
      intensity, psychological factors, measurements of activity/participation and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (MPI, HAD SF-36, EQ-5D,CPAQ;Tampa,ISI). Those patients, who report no pain&#xD;
      relief at 2-month follow-up and are dissatisfied, have an option to undergo pRF procedure any&#xD;
      time after the first follow-up visit. Patients are able to dropout from the study any time.&#xD;
      The randomization will be carried out by assisting nurse and delivered in sealed envelopes&#xD;
      marked SSPS &quot;subscapularis&quot; (suprascapular nerve block), &quot; pRF suprascapular&quot; (pRF&#xD;
      stimulation of suprascapular nerve) or &quot;suprascapualar + joint&quot; (pRF stimulation both&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve and shoulder joint). Patient will be blinded. Two operators to minimize&#xD;
      individual technical differences perform all procedures. Physician who did not treat the&#xD;
      patient primarily and did not know which treatment patient received will conduct follow up&#xD;
      estimation (pretreatment, 10 and 30 weeks after intervention). The groups will be compared&#xD;
      according to the presence of categorical clinical outcomes by Chi-square or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      tests, depending on the distribution observed after data collection. The analyzes will be&#xD;
      performed with the aid of the SPSS program, considering a significance level of 5%.&#xD;
      Demographic variables will be compared using a t-test or chi-squared test for continuous and&#xD;
      categorical variables, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA will be utilized for the primary&#xD;
      outcome of Pain NRS and the secondary outcomes of the SPADI and AROM. Planned contrasts&#xD;
      examining the linear trend effect of each group's scores over time were also included in the&#xD;
      analysis. For the HRQoL scale, paired-sample t-tests will be conducted to compare groups, at&#xD;
      each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions All patients will be offered conservative treatment including pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      (opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, paracetamol, adjuvant medication) and physiotherapy.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy program based on manual therapy intervention focus on increasing function and&#xD;
      pain control. Physical training is largely based on specific movements supervised by&#xD;
      qualified physiotherapists. The emphasis is on individual training program, and on learning a&#xD;
      functional use of the arm. PRF treatment and nerve block will be performed under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. First, the suprascapular notch is identified using ultrasound with the patient in&#xD;
      the sitting position, shoulders relaxed and forearms placed on the thighs. The puncture site&#xD;
      is located on the line dividing the upper-outer quadrant of the scapula approximately 2.5 cm&#xD;
      from the top. Following the puncture, an isolated radiofrequency 23-G 60 mm needle with a 5&#xD;
      mm active tip (Top Neuropole needle XE 60 mm 23G) is introduced perpendicularly to the skin&#xD;
      in all planes. Selective stimulation of motor fibers (50 Hz) commenced after the needle tip&#xD;
      had penetrated into the suprascapular notch. Motoric response or paresthesia at a voltage&#xD;
      between 0.3 and 0.5 V is sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Envelopes marked SSPS &quot;supraspinatus&quot; will result in injection of 1 ml Lidocaine (10%) and&#xD;
      &quot;pRF suprascapularis&quot; or &quot;suprascapualris+joint&quot; result in pRF stimulation, a 4-minute cycle&#xD;
      of pRF with STP (Sluijter Teixeira Pulsed Poisson) program (TOP Lesion Generator TLG-10,&#xD;
      Equip Medikey BV, The Netherlands) will be performed. One ml Lidocaine (10%) will be injected&#xD;
      at the end of therapy since irritation of nerve fibers by the electrical field (without&#xD;
      thermolesion) has been described as occurring frequently. Shoulder joint RF stimulation&#xD;
      procedure use posterior approach. The sulcus between the head of the humerus and acromion is&#xD;
      identified by ultrasound. The needle is inserted 2-3cm inferior and medial to the&#xD;
      posterolateral corner of the acromion and directed anteriorly towards the coracoid process.&#xD;
      An isolated radiofrequency 23-G 60 mm needle with a 5 mm active tip (Top Neuropole needle XE&#xD;
      60 mm 23G) will be introduced perpendicularly to the skin in all planes completely into the&#xD;
      joint. First, 0,1-0,2 ml Lidocaine (10%) will be injected after puncture of skin and after&#xD;
      pRF treatment 0,8 ml in the shoulder joint. Joint capsule stimulation, a 4 minute cycle of&#xD;
      pRF with STP program is performed. Pain VAS, glenohumeral joint active range of motion and&#xD;
      any complications will be recorded before discharge. The patients receive contact details of&#xD;
      an available nurse prior to discharge. Next week after the RF-stimulation, we recommend&#xD;
      restart of physiotherapy intervention focused on increasing function and pain control.&#xD;
      Average rehabilitation time is calculated to be three months and on average patients have six&#xD;
      consultations (1-12) in 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS Prior to the first MD appointment, participants are asked to compleat&#xD;
      questionnaire. At the first appointment, using standardized clinical data forms; MD record&#xD;
      the history of the participant's shoulder problem and clinical examination findings. In&#xD;
      addition to active and passive ranges of motion, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Shoulder&#xD;
      Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), are recorded to assess shoulder function. The SPADI is a&#xD;
      patient administered questionnaire consisting of 13 items divided into two subscales: pain (5&#xD;
      questions) and disability (8 questions). The pain and disability subscales are scored&#xD;
      separately and then calculated into a total SPADI score, with higher scores demonstrating&#xD;
      increased pain and disability. We also included 15D self-administered measure of&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 15D is a generic, comprehensive, 15-dimensional,&#xD;
      standardized, self-administered measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and it can&#xD;
      be used as a profile and single index score measure. The single index score (15D score) on a&#xD;
      0-1 scale, representing the overall HRQoL, is calculated. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      during 6 months, and subjective and objective outcome variables will be recorded for primary&#xD;
      outcome instruments at 2 and 6 months and secondary outcome instruments at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
