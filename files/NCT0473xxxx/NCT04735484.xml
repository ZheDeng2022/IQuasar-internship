      Observational case-control study to see if the Margin of Stability and Dynamic Postural&#xD;
      Stability (measured using a motion capture gait laboratory and wearable device, respectively)&#xD;
      are different in children with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis and matched controls.&#xD;
      Participants will walk across level ground and on a treadmill once for data collection and no&#xD;
      follow-up is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational case-control study is to validate the Margin of Stability&#xD;
      (MoS) and Dynamic Postural Stability (DPS) measures using a motion capture gait laboratory&#xD;
      and wearable device in patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measures will provide a consultant with objective data about a patient's movement and&#xD;
      balance that the consultant and other healthcare professionals can use to infer about their&#xD;
      spinal deformity progression or improvement. This research is an early step for working&#xD;
      towards providing a distance medicine, non-invasive outcome measure that can be used&#xD;
      alongside or in the absence of current clinical measures and radiography. Use of this data&#xD;
      could reduce the frequency with which radiographs are required and so reduce the impact of&#xD;
      radiation exposure. This wearable device could complement and improve upon existing outcome&#xD;
      measures in the treatment of spinal deformity, reduce the need for radiographs and ameliorate&#xD;
      the need for distance patient monitoring methods. A motion capture gait laboratory will be&#xD;
      used as the gold-standard comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study has been carried out on healthy participants with a simulated spinal deformity&#xD;
      in a kinematic gait laboratory and using the wearable device, which showed altered balance in&#xD;
      the simulated scoliosis group compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see if there's a difference in MoS and DPS between children with AIS and controls,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To see if a difference can be detected using motion capture gait analysis and a wearable&#xD;
           device,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To see how similar results from the wearable device are to the motion capture gait&#xD;
           laboratory,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the ability of the wearable device to measure a scalable difference between&#xD;
           radiographic curve magnitude in patients with AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend one data collection appointment where they will walk across level&#xD;
      ground and on a treadmill. No follow-up is required.&#xD;

        Patient records will be accessed by a member of the clinical care team with legitimate&#xD;
        access to patient records and who is independent to the research team to identify eligible&#xD;
        patients as 'Case' participants. These patients and their parents will be approached with a&#xD;
        letter asking them to contact the researcher if they are interested in participating.&#xD;
        Additionally, recruitment posters will be displayed in the RNOH outpatient and RNOH&#xD;
        orthotics departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For 'Control' participants, with permission from the participating schools and colleges, a&#xD;
        letter will be sent to parents of children aged 10-18 at local schools and colleges&#xD;
        requesting they volunteer for this study.&#xD;
