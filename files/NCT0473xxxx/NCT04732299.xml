    <textblock>
      Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a venous reflux disorder caused by abnormal coagulation of&#xD;
      blood in the deep vein, which usually occurs in the lower extremities. After thrombosis,&#xD;
      venous valve function is often destroyed, causing lower limb swelling, ulcers and other&#xD;
      congestive diseases, affecting the quality of life of patients; thrombus shedding is also&#xD;
      easy to cause pulmonary embolism, serious cases can lead to sudden death. Therefore, the&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis and curative effect evaluation of DVT are of great significance to the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients. At present, the treatment of DVT includes systematic thrombolysis and&#xD;
      catheter contact thrombolysis, among which oral drug thrombolysis has certain advantages in&#xD;
      clinical application. However, in the process of thrombosis, the composition of thrombus is&#xD;
      different in different periods, thus, defining the staging of thrombus plays an important&#xD;
      role in the decision-making of drug treatment. In view of the high resolution of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging of soft tissue, thrombus can be directly imaged. Therefore, this project&#xD;
      will take the staging diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis as the starting point. Through the&#xD;
      development of magnetic resonance imaging, this paper tries to solve the problem of&#xD;
      evaluating the therapeutic effect of deep venous thrombosis in clinic.&#xD;

      Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a venous reflux disorder caused by abnormal blood coagulation&#xD;
      in the deep vein, which usually occurs in the lower extremities. DVT is common in patients&#xD;
      with limb immobilization (such as after major orthopedic surgery), severe trauma, tumor, coma&#xD;
      or long-term bedridden patients. After thrombosis, venous valve function is often destroyed,&#xD;
      causing lower limb swelling, ulcers and other congestive diseases, affecting the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients; thrombus shedding is also easy to cause pulmonary embolism, serious cases&#xD;
      can lead to sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the process of thrombosis, the components of thrombus are different in different stages.&#xD;
      in the acute stage of thrombosis, the consumption of blood fibroses is less, mainly in the&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy of activating plasminogen; in the subacute and chronic phase of&#xD;
      thrombosis, the consumption of fibrinolytic enzyme is more, anticoagulant therapy is needed&#xD;
      to prolong the clotting time. Therefore, defining the staging of thrombus is the key to make&#xD;
      a reasonable treatment plan and improve the therapeutic effect of DVT. The guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that for patients with moderate or high likelihood of DVT, if two consecutive&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations are negative, further X-ray venography, CT venography or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance venous thrombosis direct imaging are recommended. Among them, magnetic resonance&#xD;
      thrombus direct imaging depends on the content of methemoglobin in the body and will not&#xD;
      produce radiation to the human body. it can not only accurately judge the thrombus in the&#xD;
      pelvic and inferior vena cava, but also show the details of the changes in the vein wall or&#xD;
      lumen. Therefore, magnetic resonance thrombus direct imaging has a certain potential in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of acute, subacute and old thrombus. In this study, we will use&#xD;
      magnetic resonance thrombus direct imaging to stage and judge the efficacy of drug treatment,&#xD;
      in order to provide help for clinic.&#xD;
