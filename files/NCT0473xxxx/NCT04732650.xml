      In this study, the investigator will evaluate the treatment effects and safety, patient&#xD;
      compliance of Ambrisentan in Eisenmenger syndrome in PAH patients who have been previously&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin receptor antagonist is an established class of targeted therapy for pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (PAH). Nonselective ERA, Bosentan was the first approved ERA for PAH.&#xD;
      Selective ERA, Ambrisentan was also approved for PAH treatment consequently. Although&#xD;
      non-selective and selective ERA are both effective in clinical trials, there is no direct&#xD;
      comparison for non-selective and selective ERA. Furthermore, approval study for both&#xD;
      non-selective and selective ERA did not include the PAH associated with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease (PAH-CHD) with significant shunt including Eisenmenger syndrome. Approval study for&#xD;
      Ambrisentan;ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 trials also did not include the PAH-CHD In Korea, Bosentan&#xD;
      was approved in 2003 and Ambrisentan was approved in 2009 for idiopathic PAH. Bosentan was&#xD;
      also approved for PAH-CHD, however, Amrisentan was not because of limited data for PAH-CHD.&#xD;
      Therefore, Bosentan was the only ERA covered by public health insurance since 2018 for&#xD;
      PAH-CHD. Recently, Amrisentan was also approved for PAH associated with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease including Eisenmger syndrome. And, there is a need for changing medication from&#xD;
      double pill medication to once-daily dose medication because of patient's compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH associated with CHD includes the group with significant shunt vs without shunt (s/p&#xD;
      corrected state). When there is a shunt flow, change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)&#xD;
      and cardiac output can be a modulator of shunt flow, thus impact of pulmonary vasodilator on&#xD;
      hemodynamics can be different from PAH without shunt. However, there is a limited data for&#xD;
      changing ERA from non-selective to selective ERA. Our patients population can be interesting&#xD;
      study group to understand the clinical response to changing between ERA because they are&#xD;
      uniformly treated with non-selective ERA to selective ERA, Bosentan to Ambrisentan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the treatment effects and safety, patient&#xD;
      compliance of Ambrisentan in Eisenmenger syndrome in PAH patients who have been previously&#xD;
      treated with Bosentan.&#xD;
