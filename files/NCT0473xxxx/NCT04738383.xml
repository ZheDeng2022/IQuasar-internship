  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise groups are a form of rehabilitation sport that is offered to cardiac patients (e.g.&#xD;
      after a heart attack) in long-term rehabilitation. In Germany, the constant presence of a&#xD;
      physician is mandatory. In order to meet the increasing demand for heart groups, the present&#xD;
      study implements emergency care during the heart group sessions with three alternatives:&#xD;
      paramedics, physician-on-call or specially trained instructors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators compare these alternatives (three experimental&#xD;
      conditions) with the conventional way (control condition). Perceived safety, trust,&#xD;
      acceptance and organisational feasibility are the main outcomes of the study. The methods&#xD;
      used are questionnaires to the participants, instructors, organizers and, if applicable,&#xD;
      paramedics. Additionally, partially structured interviews with attending physicians are&#xD;
      conducted according to an interview guide.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exercise groups are a form of rehabilitation sport that is offered to cardiac patients (e.g.&#xD;
      after a heart attack) in long-term rehabilitation. In Germany it is paid for by the health&#xD;
      insurance, when certain quality criteria are fulfilled. Among others, the constant presence&#xD;
      of a physician is mandatory. In order to meet the increasing demand for heart groups, the&#xD;
      National Paralympic Committee Germany (NPCG) received a special permit to try other forms of&#xD;
      medical care during a pilot project. In this so-called &quot;supervisor conception&quot; the physician&#xD;
      focuses on higher-level supervision for several exercise groups. Emergency care during the&#xD;
      heart group sessions is ensured with three alternatives: by paramedics, by a&#xD;
      physician-on-call or by specially trained instructors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators compare these alternatives (three experimental&#xD;
      conditions) with the conventional way (control condition). Before the start of the research&#xD;
      project, the different versions were defined and approved by the NPCG and other responsible&#xD;
      actors in German rehabilitation sport. The project is implemented for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the evaluation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and acceptance of the participants, instructors and supervisors with regard to&#xD;
           medical care, consultation and cooperation, feasibility and communication between the&#xD;
           interfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning effects and implementation of the training measures for emergency management&#xD;
           and health education measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementability of the supervisor conception in the clubs and regional associations of&#xD;
           the three model regions and transferability on the clubs and state associations of the&#xD;
           NPCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods used are questionnaires to the participants, instructors, organizers and, if&#xD;
      applicable, paramedics, in which the assessment of the respondents is measured for perceived&#xD;
      safety, acceptance and feasibility. The questionnaires to the participants and instructors&#xD;
      are carried out during a session by employees of the participating sports clubs. The&#xD;
      organizers fill out their questionnaires at a self-chosen time point. The questionnaires were&#xD;
      developed by the university and were sent out after the client has given his/her informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, partially structured interviews with attending physicians are conducted&#xD;
      according to an interview guide. The questions address the physicians' assessment of safety,&#xD;
      acceptance and feasibility of the supervisor conception.The guidelines are developed by us&#xD;
      and are used by us after approval by the client. We conduct the interviews ourselves by&#xD;
      telephone and evaluate them.&#xD;

    <description>Instead of a physician, who is constantly present, a paramedic is present next to the instructor during the sessions, who can give first aid in case of an emergency and bridge the time until the ambulance arrives on site.

    <description>This version implicates that a physician is not physically present but is on call during the sessions and must be constantly accessible by phone and able to arrive within three minutes in case of an emergency. To ensure this, version two should be implemented in facilities, which are linked to cardiac or rehabilitation center.</description>

    <description>The sessions take place with the instructor only, who receives a comprehensive emergency training before and during the model phase and replaces the constantly present physician. Just like in the previous versions the physician still acts as a supervisor visiting the group roughly every six weeks.</description>
