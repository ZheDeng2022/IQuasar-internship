  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale&#xD;
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for&#xD;
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence&#xD;
      and how to implement such studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE&#xD;
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims&#xD;
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly&#xD;
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.&#xD;
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a&#xD;
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators&#xD;
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that&#xD;
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims&#xD;
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the&#xD;
      validity of the original RCT finding.&#xD;

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group retrospective cohort study design&#xD;
        comparing sacubitril/valsartan to ACE inhibitors. Although the trial compared&#xD;
        sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril, we expanded the definition of the comparator group to&#xD;
        include all ACEi therapies to improve power, since all medications within this class of&#xD;
        medication are indicated and guideline recommended for use in heart failure with reduced&#xD;
        ejection fraction patients and would be expected to have similar effects on the primary&#xD;
        outcome of CV death and HF hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of&#xD;
        180 days before initiation of sacubitril/valsartan or a ACEi (cohort entry).&#xD;
