  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common cause of disability in patients who are often young and&#xD;
      active. Surgery being an option only for the most severe cases, there is little alternative&#xD;
      in case of failure of recommended medication. Inflammatory hypervascularization of the joint&#xD;
      is a known source of pain. Temporary embolization of intra-arterial inflammatory&#xD;
      hypervascularization has been used since 2012 with good results on pain relief to treat&#xD;
      patients with musculoskeletal disorders that are resistant to conventional treatments.&#xD;
      Lipiodol® has transient embolizing properties when in emulsion with a contrast agent. It has&#xD;
      been used as an emulsion with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastases and primary&#xD;
      intra-arterial liver cancer (chemo-embolization) for many years without serious side effects.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that Lipiodol® in emulsion could serve as a temporary embolization agent for&#xD;
      the treatment of inflammatory hypervascularization responsible for musculoskeletal disorders&#xD;
      in humans.&#xD;

      It is a Phase 1, Single-Arm, Open-label, Multicenter Interventional Prospective Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the best possible patient safety, a sequential inclusion of the first 6&#xD;
      patients is planned. Thus, the inclusion of each subsequent patient (patient 2-6) will only&#xD;
      be considered after reviewing previously included patient safety data. Safety data after the&#xD;
      inclusion of each patient (after a step-back of at least one week), as well as the cumulative&#xD;
      review of previously included patient safety data, will be brought to the attention of all&#xD;
      investigators involved in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following information will be transmitted to the Competent Authority without&#xD;
      delay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a review of the safety and efficacy of the first 3 patients included with a step back&#xD;
           for the last patient of at least one week after the administration of the experimental&#xD;
           drug, as well as an argument as to the continuation of this research with regard to&#xD;
           these data, with a discussion of the risks incurred in relation to the expected profit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a review of the safety and effectiveness of the first 3 patients after the inclusion of&#xD;
           the first 6 patients, as well as an argument as to the continuation of this research&#xD;
           with regard to these data, with a discussion of the risks incurred compared to the&#xD;
           expected benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be embolized by the Interventional Radiology Department of the European&#xD;
      Hospital Georges Pompidou (HEGP). Embolization will be performed by an experienced&#xD;
      radiologist during a conventional hospitalization or a day hospitalization. A clinical&#xD;
      follow-up will be carried out at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after embolization by clinics&#xD;
      and patient self-assessment (WOMAC, SF-36).&#xD;
