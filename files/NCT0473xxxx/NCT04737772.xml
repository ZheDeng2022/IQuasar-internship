  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cigarettes remains the number one preventable cause of death and disease in the US.&#xD;
      Smokers who call tobacco quitlines and use marijuana struggle to quit tobacco due to the&#xD;
      interactive effects of nicotine and marijuana. A recent study found that 25% of callers to&#xD;
      state quitlines said they were using marijuana and 44% of those were interested in quitting&#xD;
      or cutting back their marijuana use (in addition to wanting to quit smoking). The&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop an integrated intervention for co-users of marijuana and&#xD;
      tobacco to be delivered via state-funded quitlines. The investigators will incorporate key&#xD;
      elements of an evidence-based brief behavioral intervention called 'The Marijuana Check-Up'&#xD;
      into the tobacco quitline treatment. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and preliminary effects of the new intervention in a small randomized pilot&#xD;
      study with 100 co-users recruited from four participating state quitlines. Outcomes measured&#xD;
      at 3 months post randomization will include tobacco abstinence (biochemically verified) and&#xD;
      days used marijuana. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will: (1) be&#xD;
      feasible to deliver (measured by coach treatment fidelity scores); (2) be acceptable to&#xD;
      co-users (measured by enrollments into the study and call completion numbers); (3) increase&#xD;
      tobacco cessation rates compared with standard quitline treatment; (4) increase co-users&#xD;
      motivation to change MJ use; and (5) produce greater reduction in days using MJ compared with&#xD;
      standard quitline treatment. The proposed brief behavioral intervention addressing co-use may&#xD;
      increase quitline callers' chances of achieving and maintaining tobacco abstinence and&#xD;
      increase participants' motivation to reduce marijuana use. As non-medicinal marijuana use&#xD;
      becomes common and legal in more states, a low touch phone and web-based intervention for&#xD;
      co-users of marijuana and tobacco could improve health outcomes for many. Findings will&#xD;
      inform development of scalable public health intervention strategies for co-users easily&#xD;
      implemented across quitlines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to adapt a brief motivational intervention for marijuana (MJ) users&#xD;
      who call tobacco quitlines for help quitting tobacco. The investigators plan to recruit adult&#xD;
      co-users of tobacco and MJ from four state quitlines that have legalized non-medicinal MJ&#xD;
      user. Quitline registration staff will screen participants for current use of Marijuana and&#xD;
      interest in learning about marijuana. Interested co-users will then talk to a specially&#xD;
      trained quit coach who will ask additional eligibility questions, obtain informed consent&#xD;
      from eligible participants, conduct a baseline assessment, randomize individuals to one of&#xD;
      two groups and deliver the first counseling session according to the assigned intervention.&#xD;
      Randomization will be automated using the pre-programmed random number table (stratified by&#xD;
      state and gender) built into the Quitline coaching application. Individuals will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive the standard Quitline or the integrated MJ and quitline intervention. All&#xD;
      participants will receive the standard quitline treatment which includes counseling sessions&#xD;
      delivered over the phone, as well as cessation medications (nicotine replacement therapy;&#xD;
      NRT) and unlimited calls into the quitline for help between calls. Quit coaches will deliver&#xD;
      the marijuana intervention during the tobacco quitline calls for the intervention group.&#xD;
      Study participants will complete surveys at baseline and 3-months. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare groups on treatment engagement (calls completed) and outcomes at 3 months (tobacco&#xD;
      abstinence and change in days used MJ). Our proposed sample size of 100 (50 per group) is&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve our study aims of assessing the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of the new integrated intervention compared with standard quitline&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
