  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Surgical treatment in the neonatal period mostly consists of congenital&#xD;
      anomalies. Due to the different characteristics of newborns, the practice of monitoring this&#xD;
      group of patients by neonatal specialists in neonatal intensive care units is increasingly&#xD;
      common in the world and in our country. In our hospital, neonatal surgery intensive care unit&#xD;
      model has been applied for about six years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study was aimed at examining the data gathered from the neonatal surgery&#xD;
      intensive care unit we created at Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital and the contribution of&#xD;
      this model toward improving the health of newborns with surgical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The file records of newborns admitted to the neonatal and neonatal surgery intensive&#xD;
      care units which operate on two separate floors at Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital were&#xD;
      retrospectively analyzed for the period January 2014 to December 2019. The information of the&#xD;
      patients was recorded retrospectively for the study period with the information obtained from&#xD;
      the hospital database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the neonatal surgery intensive care unit model should become&#xD;
      widespread in Turkey. As there is a paucity of information concerning this subject in the&#xD;
      literature worldwide and in our country, through this study the investigators wanted to draw&#xD;
      attention to the subject by sharing our own experience working at İhsan Dogramaci Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

      Children's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed for the period January 2014 to December&#xD;
      2019. The demographic, neonatal, and clinical information of the patients-including medical&#xD;
      and surgical diseases and mortality rates-was recorded retrospectively for the study period&#xD;
      with the information obtained from the hospital database. In addition, the gestational week,&#xD;
      birth weight, gender, and length of hospital stay of the patients who were operated on in our&#xD;
      unit in the last 2 years were examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from the hospital database were recorded in Microsoft Excel and SPSS 22.0&#xD;
      Base, and statistical analysis was performed.&#xD;
