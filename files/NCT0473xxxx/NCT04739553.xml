  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the clinical feasibility of His pacing in patients with expected high&#xD;
      demand for ventricular pacing and no established indication for cardiac resynchronization&#xD;
      therapy. Secondarily, examine differences in electrical and mechanical cardiac activation&#xD;
      between traditional pacing and His pacing.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all eligible patients giving&#xD;
      written consent will be included. The study is a clinical single-center interventional study.&#xD;
      The patients (n = 25) need to have an expected high demand for ventricular pacing and no&#xD;
      established class I indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy. They will receive a&#xD;
      pacemaker implant with a traditional right ventricular pacing lead and an additional His&#xD;
      pacing lead in a basal high septal position at the level of the proximal electrical&#xD;
      conduction system (His). An atrial lead is implanted if dual chamber pacing is needed. All&#xD;
      leads are connected to a biventricular pacemaker with the His lead in the LV port.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the baseline examinations will include: transthoracic echocardiography,&#xD;
      12-lead ECG with a 3D photography of the chest wall to document ECG electrode location, and a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scan. The echocardiography and ECG will be performed during&#xD;
      traditional right ventricular pacing only and His pacing only. His pacing will be used as the&#xD;
      permanent programming of choice if feasible during follow up. The CT scan is used for&#xD;
      documenting the final positions of the pacing leads and to create a patient-specific 3D model&#xD;
      of the cardiac electrical activation using a software which enables merging of a CT scan and&#xD;
      ECG and a CT chest photography. During follow up (1-3 and 12 months), transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography, 12-lead ECG and 3D chest photography are repeated for assessment of&#xD;
      mechanical and electrical function during pacing. The performance of all implanted pacing&#xD;
      lead will be evaluated at each follow up visit.&#xD;
