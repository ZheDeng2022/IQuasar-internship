    <textblock>
      A multicentre study to provide evidence that the relationship between an immune marker value&#xD;
      (anti-GBS IgG concentration) and the probability of invasive GBS (iGBS) disease in infants&#xD;
      less than 90 days of age is sufficiently strong that a vaccine able to induce an immune&#xD;
      response will lead to a meaningful decrease in the probability of iGBS disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a bacterium (a bug) that causes serious infections in young&#xD;
      infants across the world. In 2015 it was estimated that there were at least 319,000 infants&#xD;
      under 3 months of age with GBS disease worldwide, resulting in 90,000 deaths and at least&#xD;
      10,000 children with long term disabilities. Around 20% of all pregnant women carry GBS in&#xD;
      their vagina and bowel and babies are exposed to GBS bacteria around the time of birth. The&#xD;
      options for prevention are currently limited to offering antibiotics during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vaccine that could be given to pregnant women has the greatest potential to benefit mothers&#xD;
      and babies worldwide. There are vaccines currently being tested in clinical trials, including&#xD;
      in pregnant women. The iGBS3 study aims to find out what levels of immunity (usually measured&#xD;
      as antibody) a woman needs to pass to her baby to protect the baby from getting GBS disease.&#xD;
      This will allow us to predict what antibody level a vaccine has to achieve to be effective&#xD;
      and then to get those vaccines licensed and implemented as quickly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the study need to take a small sample of cord blood from a very large number of&#xD;
      women just after delivering their baby. The study will need to follow around 180 000 babies&#xD;
      in order to find at least 170 babies with GBS disease (of which 100 will have disease with&#xD;
      the most common type) and compare their levels of antibody in cord blood with 300 healthy&#xD;
      babies exposed to the same GBS type. To achieve this, SGUL will work with the Nottingham&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Unit to embed this study in their existing GBS3 Trial, in which 80 hospitals&#xD;
      across England, Scotland and Wales will be involved for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design iGBS3 is a large, multicentre, prospective, unmatched case control study in the&#xD;
      UK designed to compare levels of antibody in cord blood in mothers whose infants develop GBS&#xD;
      disease (iGBS) and colonised mothers whose infants do not develop GBS disease. To achieve&#xD;
      this, the project aim to recruit at least 170 babies with GBS disease (of which 100 will have&#xD;
      disease with the most common type) and 300 healthy babies exposed to the same GBS type. An&#xD;
      exploratory substudy will look into levels of antibody in cord blood in mothers whose infants&#xD;
      develop severe bacterial or viral infections caused by pathogens other than GBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration The overall duration of the project is planned for 36 months. This includes 2 months&#xD;
      set-up, 12 months recruitment for Phase 1, 4 months for interval analysis, 12 months&#xD;
      recruitment for Phase 2, 6 months for final retrieval of data, analysis and write-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1 - cord blood collection and blood from an infant at time of GBS disease to&#xD;
           establish the correlation between antibody at time of disease and cord blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2 - if Phase 1 demonstrates that the correlation is strong, then in Phase 2&#xD;
           collection of blood from disease cases is required only; if Phase 2 shows a weak&#xD;
           correlation, then in Phase 2 prospective collection of cord blood will continue.&#xD;
