        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age (extremes included), on the date of&#xD;
             signing the informed consent form. Female subjects should be of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential, defined as permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, i.e.&#xD;
             surgical removal of ovaries, bilateral salpingectomy, i.e. surgical removal of the&#xD;
             fallopian tubes, or hysterectomy, i.e. surgical removal of uterus), or with no menses&#xD;
             for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND a follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone level in the postmenopausal range. These female subjects must also have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test. For surgical sterilization, documented confirmation will be&#xD;
             requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m², inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judged to be in good health by the investigator based upon the results of a medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
             fasting clinical laboratory safety tests available at screening and prior to&#xD;
             enrolment. Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts must be above the lower limit&#xD;
             of normal range. Total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase must be within normal ranges. Other clinical laboratory safety test&#xD;
             results must be within the reference ranges or test results that are outside the&#xD;
             reference ranges need to be considered not clinically significant in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This list only contains the key inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to investigational product (IP) and/or MDZ ingredients or&#xD;
             history of a significant allergic reaction to IP and/or MDZ ingredients as determined&#xD;
             by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any medication (including over-the-counter and/or prescription&#xD;
             medication, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, vitamins and/or herbal supplements,&#xD;
             and hormonal replacement therapy for postmenopausal subjects) except occasional&#xD;
             paracetamol (maximum dose of 2 g/day and maximum of 10 g/2 weeks) in the last 2 weeks&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to the first dosing.&#xD;
