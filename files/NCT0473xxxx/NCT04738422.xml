      Airway pH imbalances cause numerous adverse physiological changes within the airways,&#xD;
      including hyperreactivity, cough, bronchoconstriction, ciliopathy, decreased response to&#xD;
      bronchodilators, bacterial growth, nitrosative/oxidative stress, neutrophilic/eosinophilic&#xD;
      inflammation, and cell death. Airway pH is known to be low (acidic) in chronic and acute&#xD;
      pulmonary diseases. The gold standard approach to measuring airway pH is to bronchscopically&#xD;
      obtain epithelial cell lining fluid using protected brush sampling. The expense and invasive&#xD;
      nature of this approach is a barrier to fully characterizing the role of airway pH in the&#xD;
      health and disease. In this study, we will evaluate non-invasive clinical methods that can be&#xD;
      done using equipment standard in clinical pulmonary function laboratories for measuring&#xD;
      airway pH.&#xD;

      pulmonary diseases. The gold standard approach to measuring airway pH is to bronchscopically&#xD;
      obtain epithelial cell lining fluid using protected brush sampling. The expense and invasive&#xD;
      nature of this approach is a barrier to fully characterizing the role of airway pH in the&#xD;
      health and disease. In this study, the investigator will evaluate non-invasive clinical&#xD;
      methods that can be done using equipment standard in clinical pulmonary function laboratories&#xD;
      for measuring airway pH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team has previously demonstrated that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH and&#xD;
      changes in fractional exhaled nitric oxide collected at 50mL/sec (FeNO50) after inhalation of&#xD;
      an alkaline glycine buffer (AGB) indicate low airway pH. While EBC pH is the most common&#xD;
      method and validated method for estimating airway pH, the investigators believes that the&#xD;
      change in FeNO50 is the most sensitive test for general airway pH. Specifically, this&#xD;
      proposed test makes use of the facts that the pH of nitrite/nitrous acid (NO2-/HNO2) is just&#xD;
      under 4. Nitrous acid thus evolves nitric oxide (NO) when pH is less than 6.5, and NO&#xD;
      evolution stops when pH is above 7. Because endogenous human airway NO2- levels are normally&#xD;
      low μM, (32) NO2 protonation can be used as a noninvasive test for airway pH. Using the&#xD;
      Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the investigator can use these changes in NO to calculate pH.&#xD;
      The investigator has now done studies with both inhaled phosphate buffer and AGB, both of&#xD;
      which show that specific patients with asthma have a significant fall in FeNO50 following&#xD;
      buffer inhalation. While FeNO50 is validated to represent the nitric oxide levels of the&#xD;
      middle airways, sampling can be done at several different flowrates and times to evaluate the&#xD;
      nitric oxide levels in different compartments of the lung. This can allow for regional airway&#xD;
      pH measurement which would be helpful since many airway diseases are heterogeneous and&#xD;
      regional. The investigator will further characterize the normal range of airway pH in health&#xD;
      and disease compartmentally within the airways and in subsequent studies will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of clinically altering pH when it is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recently discovered that airway pH is integral to airway cell entry and&#xD;
      replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, one of the pathways by which the virus enters&#xD;
      cells and replicates is blocked by intracellular alkalinization. The investigator therefore&#xD;
      tested to determine whether AGB would cause intracellular alkalinization in cultured primary&#xD;
      human airway epithelial cells. It did; and the drug was well-tolerated by the cells in vitro&#xD;
      (as it is in vivo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believes that the next step is to determine whether AGB inhibits viral&#xD;
      replication and viral entry in our primary human airway epithelial cultures. To do this, the&#xD;
      investigator is partnering with the Indiana University BSL3 virology lab. The investigator&#xD;
      has acquired the virus, completed preparations of it, and has infected human airway&#xD;
      epithelial cultures with it. The study team is awaiting preliminary results of the effects of&#xD;
      AGB on viral entry and replication. If in fact AGB inhibits viral cell entry and, thereby,&#xD;
      replication, the investigator intends to expand the IND with the FDA, allowing a trial in&#xD;
      patients at risk for respiratory distress associated with known COVID-2 respiratory disease.&#xD;
      Ultimately, outcomes of this trial would be proposed to include: mortality (primary); as well&#xD;
      as ICU length of stay and oxygen saturation index area under the curve (secondary). The&#xD;
      investigator has submitted grants to the NIH, the DoD, and several other agencies for this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposed here will not only provide further insight into the use of AGB in a larger&#xD;
      population but also will allow for evaluation of airway pH in those receiving it which could&#xD;
      be used to guide therapy.&#xD;
