  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      inpatient study to examine the efficacy and safety of KarXT in adult subjects who are acutely&#xD;
      psychotic with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of KarXT (a fixed&#xD;
      combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily [BID]) versus&#xD;
      placebo in reducing Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult&#xD;
      inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objectives of the study are&#xD;
      to evaluate improvement in disease severity and symptoms, safety and tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

    <description>The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. For positive symptoms in schizophrenia, participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Negative Marder Factor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Negative Marder Factor score is derived from the PANSS and consists of the sum of 5 negative scales (N) and 2 general scales (G) (N1. Blunted affect; N2. Emotional withdrawal; N3. Poor rapport; N4. Passive/apathetic social withdrawal; N6. Lack of spontaneity; G7. Motor retardation; and G16. Active social avoidance), with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S modified asked the clinician 1 question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; The clinician's answer rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>
