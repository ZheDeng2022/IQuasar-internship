  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consuming large volumes of water has recently been identified as a common weight loss&#xD;
      strategy among U.S. adults. It is a widespread belief that drinking water increases feelings&#xD;
      of satiety and reduces food intake, which could contribute to long-term weight maintenance.&#xD;
      Many studies have shown support for this, demonstrating water's ability to reduce hunger and&#xD;
      energy intake. In some cases, increased water consumption was associated with weight loss.&#xD;
      However, the mechanisms of how water affects food intake have been minimally explored. There&#xD;
      is potential that the effect of water on reduced food intake and increased satiety is due to&#xD;
      individuals' belief that water will reduce their appetite and food intake. The question&#xD;
      remains if water expectancy has a meaningful influence on water's ability to reduce food&#xD;
      intake. The investigators hypothesize that participants will report less hunger and consume&#xD;
      fewer calories when given water and an expectancy that water will affect appetite, compared&#xD;
      to a condition when given water and do not expect water to have an effect on appetite. We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that calorie intake will not meaningfully differ when participants are&#xD;
      given water with no expectancies compared to when given no water. During this experiment, the&#xD;
      investigators will vary the presence of water and manipulate expectancies about water's&#xD;
      effects on appetite across three conditions: (1) an expectancy and water condition; (2) an&#xD;
      expectancy and no water condition; and (3) a no expectancy and water condition. In each&#xD;
      condition, participants will engage in a bogus taste test and complete two short cognitive&#xD;
      tasks for distraction purposes. In an effort to prevent demand characteristics, this study&#xD;
      involves deception. Participants will be told that the research team is interested in testing&#xD;
      the effects of three different mint herb variations on attention, coordination, and taste&#xD;
      perceptions. After completing the cognitive tasks and taste test, participants will have a 10&#xD;
      minute period to eat as much of the remaining food as they'd like. Food will be weighed&#xD;
      before and after this period (without the participant's knowledge) in order to determine&#xD;
      caloric intake.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be instructed to consume the mint herb and 500mL of water before the start of the taste test. The script will inform them of research that has shown water to decrease appetite by up to 50%. In this condition, however, the research team will also inform them that this herb is expected to counteract the effects of water on appetite because it decreases water retention, causing water to pass through the stomach and intestines at a faster than normal rate (attempting to create no water expectancy or nullify any pre-existing expectancy).</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed to consume the mint herb and 50mL of water before the start of the taste test. Participants will be given 100mL of water during the taste test to aid in their ability to taste and consume food, and to avoid acute thirst interfering with food consumption. Access to fluids during a taste test has been used in control conditions in similar studies. The script for this condition will inform participants of research that has shown water to decrease appetite by up to 50% but acknowledge that they will not be receiving water (thus, they should not expect an effect on appetite).</description>
