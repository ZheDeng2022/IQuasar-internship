      Aim of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      is to evaluate the influence of stress level on the response of non surgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy in patients affected by severe periodontitis divided into &quot;Medium/High stress level&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;Low stress level&quot; based on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The defined primary outcome&#xD;
      referring to the clinical response of the patients is the bleeding index, Full-Mouth Bleeding&#xD;
      Score (FMBS), as a clinical sign of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocentric prospective triple blinded study. A single evaluator conducting all the&#xD;
      psychologic tests, a single operator blinded to the results of the psychologic tests doing&#xD;
      all the clinical measurements, and the patients will be initially blinded to the category of&#xD;
      stress that they'll belong to. The minimum number of patients to enrol will be 89 based on a&#xD;
      sample calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into&#xD;
      the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age from 20 to 80 years Diagnosis of Periodontitis stage III/IV according to the new&#xD;
      classification (2018); Presence of at least 14 teeth, with a minimum of 10 sites with PD at&#xD;
      least &gt; 5 mm and radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers &gt; 10 cig/die Patients with orthodontic appliances; Pregnant or lactating women;&#xD;
      Individuals who have received periodontal treatment in the 6 months prior to recruitment;&#xD;
      Patients with systemic diseases that could interfere the clinical response to periodontal&#xD;
      treatment (i.e. diabetes); Subjects under treatment with antibiotics, steroidal and/or&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication 3 weeks prior to the visit and patients treated&#xD;
      with antiepileptic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters and psychologic test will be done at the baseline. All the patients will&#xD;
      be treated by means of non surgical periodontal therapy on a quadrant protocol including oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions and motivations and subgingival instrumentation in four successive&#xD;
      visits. 6 weeks after the last visit, the clinical parameters will be registered again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal condition of each patient will be evaluated through the collection of the&#xD;
      following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full-Mouth Bleeding score (FMBS): presence/absence of bleeding on probing using a&#xD;
           periodontal probe on each surface of the tooth (six sites per tooth), calculated in&#xD;
           percentage for all the examined teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full-Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS): presence/absence of plaque using a periodontal probe on&#xD;
           each surface of the tooth (six sites per tooth), calculated in percentage for all the&#xD;
           examined teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probing Depth (PD): measured for each surface of the tooth (six sites per tooth) using a&#xD;
           periodontal probe, measured as the distance between the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and&#xD;
           the depth of the pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival recession (Rec): measured for each surface of the tooth (six sites per tooth)&#xD;
           using a periodontal probe, measured as the distance between the cementoenamel junction&#xD;
           (CEJ) and the free gingival margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical attachment level (CAL): The sum of PD and Rec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologic Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stress condition of each patient will be assessed by a Psychologist using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSS is a 10-items self-report questionnaire that measure the degree to which situations in&#xD;
      one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS is scored on a 5-point scale (never, almost&#xD;
      never, sometimes, fairly often and very often). PSS norms are available from a sample of the&#xD;
      USA collected by Cohen &amp; Williamson (1988). The mean level for men was 12.1 (S.D. 5.9) and&#xD;
      for women 13.7 (S.D. 6.6).&#xD;
