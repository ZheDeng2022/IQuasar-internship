  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of iso-energetic energy deficits&#xD;
      induced by exercise or dietary restriction on energy intake and appetite feelings in&#xD;
      adolescents with obesity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to an energy deficit of 400 kcal&#xD;
      induced once by realisation of an acute exercise set at moderate intensity and once by a&#xD;
      dietary restriction imposed at lunch (compared with a control condition). 18 adolescents with&#xD;
      obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control&#xD;
      session (CON); ii) one session with an exercise-induced energy deficit (Def-EX); iii) one&#xD;
      session with an energy restriction-induced energy deficit (Def-EI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during dinner time. Appetite feelings will be&#xD;
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <description>food intake will be measured ad libitum during a dinner buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software.</description>

    <description>Control condition without exercise / rest condition. The adolescents will be asked to remain quiet and at rest during the morning and will receive an ad libitum meal at dinner time. Their food reward will be assessed before dinner. Their appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals.</description>

    <description>Condition with an exercise-induced energy deficit The adolescents will be asked to complete an acute exercise set at 65% of their capacities (cycling) during the afternoon, inducing an energy expenditure of 400 kcal. Dinner will be served ad libitum. Their food reward will be assessed before dinner. Their appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals.</description>

    <description>Condition with an energy-restriction energy deficit The adolescents will be asked to remain quiet during the whole day (no physical activity). They will receive a calibrated breakfast reduced from 400 kcal compare to their CON and Def-EX conditions. Dinner will be served ad libitum. Their food reward will be assessed before dinner. Their appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals.</description>
