  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the top killer nowadays. Pressure-wire-based Fractional Flow&#xD;
      Reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for measuring ischemia in coronary arteries. CFD-based&#xD;
      RuiXin-FFR, which is noninvasive, is developed recently. But its accuracy is not verified.&#xD;
      This is a multi-center and prospective study to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      accuracy of CFD-based RuiXin-FFR compared with wire-based FFR.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants are entered with suspended CAD and angiography ischemia between 30%-90% from&#xD;
      6 hospitals in China. Pressure-wire-based FFR is conducted in the standard protocol by each&#xD;
      hospital. FFR&gt;0.8 is chosen as the threshold to indicate non-ischemia. CFD-based RuiXin-FFR&#xD;
      is performed by Raysight Medical (Shenzhen, China). CT images are acquired in a standard&#xD;
      protocol by each hospital. Images with poor quality are excluded in this trial. Based on&#xD;
      these images, RuiXin-FFR reconstructs the 3D model of coronary trees and obtains RuiXin-FFR&#xD;
      values by conducting CFD simulations in a blinded fashion. RuiXin-FFR&gt;0.8 is chosen as the&#xD;
      threshold to indicate non-ischemia as well. By comparing the clinical diagnosis outcome of&#xD;
      pressure-wire-based FFR and CFD-based RuiXin-FFR, the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      RuiXin-FFR are obtained, which is the primary end point of this trial. The secondary end&#xD;
      point includes the measurement of accuracy, NPV, PPV and ROC of the RuiXin-FFR.&#xD;
