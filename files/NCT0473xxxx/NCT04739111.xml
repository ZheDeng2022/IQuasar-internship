    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory clinical study of Human Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody Injection (LDP)&#xD;
      combined with Recombinant Anti-EGFR Human Mouse Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody Injection (CDP1)&#xD;
      in patients with advanced malignant tumor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, dose-escalation and dose-extension exploratory clinical study for patients&#xD;
      with advanced malignancy who have failed standard therapy. In the dose-escalation phase, a&#xD;
      fixed dose of CDP1 will be given once a week, while LDP will be given every two weeks with&#xD;
      dose climbing. Then, cohort studies (cohorts 1 to 5) will be conducted during the&#xD;
      dose-expansion phase. The purpose is to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDP&#xD;
      combined with CDP1 in the treatment of patients with advanced malignant tumor, and to&#xD;
      determine the recommended dose for clinical trial.&#xD;
