      Among the hemodialysis units, the global incidence of HCV infection ranges from 1.2% to 2.9%.&#xD;
      Data regarding the long-term risk of reinfection among hemodialysis patients achieving SVR&#xD;
      are limited. To our best knowledge, only one study assessed the long-term negativity of serum&#xD;
      HCV RNA in hemodialysis patients who achieved SVR after IFN-based therapies. With a median&#xD;
      follow-up of 48 months following SVR, the life-time cumulative survival for HCV RNA&#xD;
      negativity was 86% among the 121 participants who were on maintenance dialysis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the life-time cumulative survival for HCV RNA negativity was 95% among the 45 participants&#xD;
      who underwent renal transplantation from HCV-negative donors. Because the literatures&#xD;
      regarding the long-term follow-up of viral outcome, the patient numbers to be recruited are&#xD;
      still limited, and all studies are focused on IFN-based treatment, we aim to assess the&#xD;
      long-term risk of HCV reinfection in hemodialysis patients attaining SVR by IFN-based or&#xD;
      IFN-free therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important public health problem. Compared to the&#xD;
      global prevalence of HCV infection to be around 1.0%, the prevalence of HCV infection in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients is around 10%. The high prevalence of HCV infection in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients receiving long-term renal replacement therapy may be reasoned by the nosocomial&#xD;
      transmission in hemodialysis units. If chronic HCV infection is left untreated, the survival,&#xD;
      hospitalization and the quality of life are significantly compromised in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. In contrast, the survival is improved following successful treatment-induced HCV&#xD;
      clearance Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is the treatment of choice for hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      with HCV infection in earlier years. However, the treatment responses are far from ideal and&#xD;
      the treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) are frequently encountered, making the global&#xD;
      treatment uptake rate by IFN-based therapies to be only 1.5%. Based on the excellent efficacy&#xD;
      and safety, IFN-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been the mainstay of therapy for&#xD;
      HCV. Furthermore, the world health organization (WHO) has set the goal of global HCV&#xD;
      elimination by 2030. The microelimination of HCV among hemodialysis patients is also listed&#xD;
      as the prioritized target by WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The updated definition of sustained virologic response (SVR) is the presence of serum&#xD;
      undetectable HCV RNA level at week 12 after the stopping of antiviral therapy. However, the&#xD;
      consensus in Taiwan mandates that hemodialysis patients who achieve SVR at off-therapy week&#xD;
      24 can be moved from HCV-segregated zone to cleat zone in hemodialysis unit, instead of the&#xD;
      global definition of off-therapy week 12. The delay of bed-transfer from HCV-infective zone&#xD;
      to clear zone might increase the risk of reinfection in hemodialysis patients achieving SVR.&#xD;
      Therefore, we aim to assess the risk of short-term of HCV reinfection in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients achieving SVR at week 12 after antiviral therapy, which may be great relevance and&#xD;
      importance for health policy making.&#xD;
