  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      SonoClear Acoustic Coupling Fluid (ACF). The performance will be assessed by analysis of the&#xD;
      contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and assessment of image quality by using the Surgeon Image&#xD;
      Rating (SIR) Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-centre single-arm study where the performance of SonoClear ACF&#xD;
      relative to routinely used acoustic coupling fluid is investigated by each patient being&#xD;
      their own control. Patients with the diagnosis of HGG and LGG at up to 4 sites will be&#xD;
      included. Additionally, safety data are collected up to 30 days post-procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SonoClear ACF will be used in combination with conventional ultrasound imaging equipment,&#xD;
      with the transducer positioned at the cortex or on top of the surgical entry point in the&#xD;
      brain. Any CE-marked ultrasound system and transducer that can provide high-level image&#xD;
      quality may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pivotal single-arm trial in 3 or 4 centres on approximately 20 participants&#xD;
      with either low grade (WHO Grade I/II) or high grade (WHO Grade III/IV) gliomas undergoing&#xD;
      primary surgery, to collect performance and safety data on Sonoclear ACF in comparison with&#xD;
      saline solution (the saline standard of care) as an acoustic coupling fluid during ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging in brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two primary performance outcomes, Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) to quantify the&#xD;
      reduction in noise and the Surgeons Image Rating (SIR) to assess the image quality and a&#xD;
      primary safety outcome. The two primary performance outcomes will be addressed in a&#xD;
      hierarchical gatekeeping approach. First, the SonoClear ACF will be tested for superiority&#xD;
      over saline with respect to reduced image artefacts as detected by CNR. Besides the&#xD;
      superiority of SonoClear ACF on CNR, it will be tested for superiority over saline using SIR.&#xD;
      SIR is designed to assess if the expert panel, given an objective improvement in the&#xD;
      quantitative CNR measures, can see a difference in image quality which potentially may help&#xD;
      surgeons to deliver better excisional margins and more complete tumour resection (which might&#xD;
      then lead to improved patient outcomes). By specifying this gatekeeping hierarchy, we present&#xD;
      the two performance outcomes which are important clinically and in their logical order, and&#xD;
      in such a way that the statistical chance of a false positive (a type 1 error) is still&#xD;
      controlled at the usual 5% without the need for adjustment for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be according to a modified Intention to Treat (mITT) set, which is&#xD;
      a subset of the safety set and will include all participants who have a biopsy confirmed&#xD;
      glioma and who have a complete set of interpretable images for each of the performance&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e. an interpretable image on both SonoClear ACF and saline for both the CNR and&#xD;
      the SIR outcomes showing the tumour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety set will be defined as all participants who received at least one dose of&#xD;
      SonoClear ACF.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The following measures have been taken to minimize or avoid bias:&#xD;
Core-lab evaluation of the CNR outcome in a blinded fashion&#xD;
SIR clinical rating of US images by an independent expert panel in a blinded fashion&#xD;
Due to the nature of brain surgery and the diversity of the tumours, it is seen as a strength to the trial that the patient can act as its own control even though the images can never be 100% the same in the separate image acquisition. This is especially true for 2D US images, whereas with a 3D US image it is more likely to obtain the same position for sequential image acquisition.</masking_description>

    <measure>Surgeons Image Rating (SIR) to assess the image quality</measure>
    <time_frame>During ultrasound guided brain tumour resection</time_frame>
    <description>Quality assessment of the images is done by the core-lab in a blinded manner using the Surgeon Image Rating (SIR) scale, a 1-10 rating scale to score the quality of the image according to 3 questions at different time points during the operation. First timepoint being after craniotomy (no fluids involved). The second time point is when some tumour is left in the bottom of the deeper part of the resection cavity (approximately 80% of tumour removed), and the third time point being when the surgeon deems resection of the tumour to be completed.</description>

    <description>The primary safety outcome is the adverse event (AE) rate, which will be compared with the expected AE rate from an identical counterfactual cohort (in terms of patient numbers and characteristics) based on published literature &amp; accessible registry data. This group of patients underwent the same procedure, in some cases have been exposed to Saline, however, have not been exposed to the SonoClear ACF.</description>
