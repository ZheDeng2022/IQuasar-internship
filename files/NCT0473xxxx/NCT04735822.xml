      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 2-part study in healthy male subjects to&#xD;
      evaluate the taste profile of different belumosudil oral suspensions and the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of those chosen oral suspensions of belumosudil compared to oral tablets of&#xD;
      belumosudil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an open-label, randomized single-period study of oral suspensions of belumosudil 40&#xD;
      mg/mL delivered in 6 different vehicles. Approximately 12 healthy male subjects, 2 subjects&#xD;
      in each of 6 groups, will be administered a single dose of belumosudil 40 mg/mL in 6&#xD;
      different vehicles (Vehicles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) in corresponding Regimens A, B, C, D, E,&#xD;
      and F in different sequences of the 6 vehicles. All subjects will receive 1 dose of all&#xD;
      belumosudil in all 6 vehicles which are as follows: ABFCED; BCADFE; CDBEAF; DECFBA; EFDACB;&#xD;
      and FAEBDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period design to assess the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of a selected belumosudil suspension formulation compared to the oral&#xD;
      belumosudil. Tablet reference and the effect of food on the selected belumosudil suspension&#xD;
      formulation in 18 healthy male subjects. Subjects will be randomized prior to the&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of IMP to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (GHI, HIG, IGH, IHG,&#xD;
      GIH and HGI), with 3 subjects assigned to each treatment sequence where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen G--oral belumosudil 200 mg tablet (reference) with the subject fed; Regimen&#xD;
      H--belumosudil powder 200 mg for oral suspension or belumosudil 200 mg oral suspension with&#xD;
      the subject fasting; and Regimen I--belumosudil 200 mg powder for oral suspension or&#xD;
      belumosudil 200 mg oral suspension with the subject fed.&#xD;

      PART 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, open-label, randomized, single period design to assess the taste&#xD;
      profile of different novel regimens from bottles containing 1200 mg of belumosudil. Twelve&#xD;
      healthy subjects will receive single doses of the 6 bottled oral formulations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A: belumosudil 40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 1 (sterile water for irrigation);&#xD;
      Regimen B: belumosudil 40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 2 (low sucralose solution); Regimen C:&#xD;
      belumosudil 40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 3 (high sucralose solution); Regimen D: belumosudil&#xD;
      40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 4 (orange flavor with low sucralose solution); Regimen E:&#xD;
      belumosudil 40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 5 (tropical fruit blend with low sucralose&#xD;
      solution); Regimen F: belumosudil 40 mg/mL delivered by Vehicle 6 (lemon flavor with low&#xD;
      sucralose solution)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sip the belumosudil oral suspension and then spit it out. The maximum dose is&#xD;
      belumosudil 200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, two subjects each will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences with&#xD;
      belumosudil:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABFCED (2 subjects); BCADFE (2 subjects); CDBEAF (2 subjects); DECFBA (2 subjects); EFDACB (2&#xD;
      subjects); FAEBDC (2 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures to determine their eligibility for&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study at a screening visit (Day -28 to Day -2 of Part 1). Subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical unit on the morning prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
      administration (Day -1) for confirmation of eligibility and baseline procedures. Prior to the&#xD;
      first administration of IMP (either Day -1 or prior to the completion of breakfast [pre-dose]&#xD;
      on Day 1), subjects will be given a training questionnaire using an example fluid (e.g.,&#xD;
      orange juice/squash).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evening of Day -1, subjects will receive a light snack and will then fast from all&#xD;
      food and drink (except water). Following the overnight fast (approximately 8 hours), subjects&#xD;
      will consume a standard breakfast. Following breakfast, subjects will brush their teeth using&#xD;
      tap water (toothpaste will not be permitted). The first dose of IMP will be administered&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours after breakfast has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the test belumosudil from bottles in regimens according to a&#xD;
      randomization schedule. Each regimen will follow the same study design. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of belumosudil 40 mg/mL as an oral suspension, which will be held in the mouth&#xD;
      for approximately 1 minute before it is expectorated, and will subsequently complete a&#xD;
      written taste/palatability questionnaire individually and privately. No belumosudil is to be&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a washout period of 30 min Â± 10 min (minimum 20 min) between tasting each&#xD;
      regimen (inclusive of palate cleansing). During this time, subjects will cleanse their&#xD;
      palates using tap water (administered freely in 50 mL aliquots) and unsalted crackers before&#xD;
      further tasting. It is expected that all regimens will be tasted on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) sample will be taken approximately 1 hour post-final&#xD;
      dose (prior to discharge from the clinical unit). This sample will be retained and only&#xD;
      analyzed in case of accidental swallowing of the formulation by a subject and/or for the&#xD;
      purpose of investigating a possible treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to the&#xD;
      IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain on site until 1 hour post-final taste/palatability assessment. To ensure&#xD;
      the ongoing well-being of the subjects, a follow-up phone call will take place 3 to 7 days&#xD;
      after the final dose. If a subject reports any adverse events (AEs) after discharge which is&#xD;
      a cause for concern, they will be required to attend the clinical unit for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. This follow-up visit will be considered an unscheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of Part 1, an interim data review will be performed during which the&#xD;
      taste/palatability assessment data will be reviewed to determine the flavor system that will&#xD;
      be incorporated into the IMP formulation for administration in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period design to assess the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of a selected belumosudil suspension formulation from Part 1 compared to the&#xD;
      belumosudil oral tablet. Eighteen subjects will receive single doses of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen G = 200 mg belumosudil tablet (reference drug) orally when subjects are fed; Regimen&#xD;
      H = 200 mg belumosudil powder for oral suspension or belumosudil oral suspension when&#xD;
      subjects are fasting; and Regimen I = 200 mg belumosudil powder for oral suspension or&#xD;
      belumosudil oral suspension when subjects are fed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, three subjects each will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences with&#xD;
      belumosudil:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GHI (3 subjects); HIG (3 subjects); IGH (3 subjects); IHG (3 subjects); GIH (3 subjects); HGI&#xD;
      (3 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures to determine their eligibility for&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study at a screening visit (Day -28 to Day -2 of Part 2). Subjects who have&#xD;
      taken part in Part 1 of the study are permitted to take part in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study period will follow a similar design. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical&#xD;
      unit on the morning prior to the first IMP administration (Day -1 of Period 1) for&#xD;
      confirmation of eligibility and baseline procedures. For Regimen H only, subjects will be&#xD;
      given a training questionnaire using an example fluid (e.g., orange juice/squash) prior to&#xD;
      IMP administration. This will be performed either on Day -1 (only applicable if Regimen H is&#xD;
      administered in Period 2 or 3) or prior to the completion of breakfast (pre-dose) on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single dose of IMP in the morning of Day 1 following an overnight&#xD;
      fast of a minimum of 10 hours (Regimen H, fasted state) or following a standard breakfast&#xD;
      (Regimens G and I, fed state). Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals for PK&#xD;
      analysis. Following administration of Regimen H, subjects will complete a written&#xD;
      taste/palatability questionnaire individually and privately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will reside in the clinical unit for 10 consecutive nights that will cover all 3&#xD;
      treatment periods. All subjects will remain on site until 72 h post-final dose for safety and&#xD;
      PK assessments. There will be a minimum washout period of 3 days between each IMP&#xD;
      administration. To ensure the ongoing well-being of the subjects, a follow-up phone call will&#xD;
      take place 3 to 7 days after the final dose. If a subject reports any AEs after discharge&#xD;
      which is a cause for concern, they will be required to attend the clinical unit for a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment. This follow-up visit will be considered an unscheduled visit.&#xD;
