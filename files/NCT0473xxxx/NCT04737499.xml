  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aimed to evaluate the implementation process and efficacy of a culturally&#xD;
      tailored Diabetes Self-Management and Education (DSME) program with mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      technology integration, entitled Culturally Appropriate Strategies for Chinese Americans with&#xD;
      Diabetes (CASCADe), among Chinese American adults with Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CASCADe program includes 1) a home visit for training of monitoring devices use, WeChat&#xD;
      app and acquiring family support, 2) 8 weekly education sessions with a combined format of&#xD;
      group class, games, food demonstration, group exercise, video and discussion, 3) WeChat&#xD;
      follow-up on education tips, monitoring data summary, and group discussion. The monitoring&#xD;
      system used a smartphone to coordinate cloud data transmission from a set of wireless devices&#xD;
      to capture daily monitoring data on physical activity, body weight, blood pressure and blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. WeChat app was used to facilitate behavioral self-monitoring by providing&#xD;
      daily messages related to diabetes education curriculum, weekly summary reports on monitoring&#xD;
      data as well as reinforcement messages and group discussion on readings and monitoring&#xD;
      results implication. A single group pre-post-test design was adopted to evaluate changes of&#xD;
      primary (HbA1c) and secondary (Self-efficacy, quality of life and stress coping) outcomes&#xD;
      assessed at pre and post of intervention. Engagement and adherence in education sessions and&#xD;
      self-monitoring system, and satisfaction with the content and delivery of intervention were&#xD;
      also evaluated at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention consisted of eight weekly sessions of health education and diabetes management. Topics covered include recognition of diabetes and its complications, risk factors, nutrition knowledge, dietary practices, exercise, behavioral self-monitoring, medication adherence, and stress management. Intervention also included a home visit for training of monitoring devices use, WeChat app and acquiring family support, and weekly WeChat follow-up on education tips, monitoring data summary, and group discussion. The monitoring system used a smartphone to coordinate cloud data transmission from a set of wireless devices to capture daily monitoring data on physical activity, body weight, blood pressure and blood glucose levels.</description>
