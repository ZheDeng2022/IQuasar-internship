  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to explore the effects of cosmetic care on body image (BI), and social&#xD;
      avoidance and distress (SAD) in young Chinese breast cancer patients, aged 18-40 years old,&#xD;
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This was a single-center, 2-arm quasi-experimental study.&#xD;
      The control group received usual care, while cosmetic care was added to the intervention&#xD;
      group. The primary outcomes were BI and SAD accompanying chemotherapy, and the secondary&#xD;
      outcome was the appearance satisfaction.&#xD;

      Background: The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may still bring severe psychological&#xD;
      trauma to women. Cosmetic care is an effective measure to enhance patients' psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, which can help cancer patients cope with disfigurement-related adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aimed to explore the effects of cosmetic care on body image (BI), and&#xD;
      social avoidance and distress (SAD) in young Chinese breast cancer patients, aged 18-40 years&#xD;
      old, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This was a prospective, 2-arm quasi-experimental study, comprising two groups:&#xD;
      the controlled group and the interventional group. In order to avoid interference, the two&#xD;
      groups of participants were recruited at different periods. The control group was recruited&#xD;
      from Jan 2015 to Mar 2015, and the intervention group was recruited from January 2016 to&#xD;
      September 2017. All participants came from the department of a breast surgery in Shanghai,&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control condition: Participants in the control group received usual care during adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants in the intervention group received cosmetic care in combination&#xD;
      with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: Ethical approval of this study was obtained from the ethical committee of a&#xD;
      cancer center in Shanghai. The approval number was 1403132-2. Informed consent was explained&#xD;
      to the participants and the forms were signed by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses: The IBM SPSS 22.0 was used to analyze all the data.&#xD;

    <description>Body image (BI) was assessed using the body image scale. It is a 10-item self-assessment scale, measuring cancer patients' perception of their appearance. The minimum and maximum values of the scale are 0 and 30. A higher score signifies a worse BI.</description>

    <description>Social avoidance and distress (SAD) was assessed using social avoidance and distress scale, which contains 28 items. The total score in the scale ranges from 0 to 28. A higher score means greater SAD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appearance satisfaction questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The end of cycle of chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days, and there were 4-6 cycles totally.).</time_frame>
    <description>The appearance satisfaction questionnaire was designed by the researchers of this study, and aimed to assess whether the several body image- related side effects of treatments would affect patients' appearance satisfaction. It involved six aspects: hair loss, facial skin pigmentation, acne skin, breast loss, weight gain, and fatigue. The answers included either a &quot;Yes&quot; or a &quot;No.&quot; The description of each item was used percentage.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group received cosmetic care in combination with usual care. The cosmetic care was a 3-hour, free-of-charge beauty activity, including face moisturizing steps, make-up, wigs, and breast prostheses wearing. It was provided by professional cosmeticians at a cosmetic training base before the patients finished half of their chemotherapy cycle.</description>
