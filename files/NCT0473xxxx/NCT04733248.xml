      The objective of the study is to find the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on the patient's&#xD;
      functional status in non-specific neck pain. This is an RCT in which 26 participants with&#xD;
      non-specific neck pain who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study.&#xD;
      Individuals were randomly allocated into two groups (control and experimental) by using a&#xD;
      sealed envelope method. The treatment protocol given to the experimental group includes&#xD;
      kinesiotaping on upper trapezius muscle using inhibition technique (I-O) along with exercise&#xD;
      therapy while in the control group exercise therapy was given alone. Data was collected by&#xD;
      using NPRS and NDI. Pre and post assessment was taken on 1 st, 2nd, and 3rd sessions, and&#xD;
      each session was 3 days apart. Parametric tests including independent T-test and paired&#xD;
      T-test were applied for analyzing normal data. while non-parametric tests including Mann&#xD;
      Whitney and Wilcoxon were applied for nonnormal data analysis.&#xD;

      As expected, the prevalence increases with longer prevalence periods, and generally, women&#xD;
      have more NP than men. Neck pain (NP) is a major public health problem, both in terms of&#xD;
      personal health and overall well-being as well as indirect expense. For instance, the total&#xD;
      cost of NP in the Netherlands in 1996 was estimated at about 1% of the total health care&#xD;
      expenditure or 0.1% of the Dutch gross domestic product.Accurate prevalence estimates are&#xD;
      desirable to serve as a basis for etiological studies and health care evaluation, and to&#xD;
      assess the effect of NP in general populations. Unfortunately, prevalence studies on NP show&#xD;
      great variation in both quality and results. For instance, the point prevalence varies&#xD;
      between 6% and 22%, and 1-year prevalence between 1.5% and 75%.Neck pain is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly common throughout the world. It has a considerable impact on individuals and&#xD;
      their families, communities, health-care systems, and businesses. The estimated 1-year&#xD;
      incidence of neck pain from available studies ranges between 10.4% and 21.3% with a higher&#xD;
      incidence noted in office and computer workers. While some studies report that between 33%&#xD;
      and 65% of people have recovered from an episode of neck pain at 1 year, most cases run an&#xD;
      episodic course over a person's lifetime, and, thus, relapses are common. The overall&#xD;
      prevalence of neck pain in the general population ranges between 0.4% and 86.8% (mean:&#xD;
      23.1%); point prevalence ranges from 0.4% to 41.5% (mean: 14.4%); and 1 year prevalence&#xD;
      ranges from 4.8% to 79.5% (mean: 25.8%). Prevalence is generally higher in women, higher in&#xD;
      high-income countries compared with low- and middle-income countries, and higher in urban&#xD;
      areas compared with rural areas. Many environmental and personal factors influence the onset&#xD;
      and course of neck pain. Most studies indicate a higher incidence of neck pain among women&#xD;
      and an increased risk of developing neck pain until the 35-49-year age group, after which the&#xD;
      risk begins to decline. The Global Burden of Disease 2005 Study is currently making estimates&#xD;
      of the global burden of neck pain in relation to impairment and activity limitation, and&#xD;
      results will be available in 2011. Nonspecific or simple neck pain, is the most common form&#xD;
      of pain in the neck, affecting two out of three people at some point in their lives. While&#xD;
      the exact etiology of the pain is often unknown, most cases of non-specific neck pain are&#xD;
      caused by mechanical factors such as sprains and strains of the muscles or ligaments in the&#xD;
      neck. Inflammation of the facet joints or the joints between the vertebrae leads to an&#xD;
      aggravation of these structures during movement (i.e. when turning or bending the neck),&#xD;
      giving rise to pain.Other factors that can contribute to the development of mechanical neck&#xD;
      pain include Poor posture (i.e. prolonged sitting in a 'bent-forward' position), Physical&#xD;
      overload, Stress, Smoking, and Poor psychological health, etc.Most cases of nonspecific neck&#xD;
      pain are acute and resolve within three to six weeks with minimal intervention, although some&#xD;
      people suffer from recurrent pain. However, if neck pain persists for longer than three&#xD;
      months, it is considered chronic and further treatment may be warranted. Furthermore, if neck&#xD;
      pain persists or gets worse, it can cause numbness or referral pain in the arm.In general,&#xD;
      neck pain refers to pain that occurs between the occipital bone, thoracic vertebra, and&#xD;
      shoulder joint. While the majority of people suffer from non-specific or mechanical neck&#xD;
      pain, other types of neck pain.Symptoms of non-specific neck pain include Stiff neck,&#xD;
      Restricted movement of the neck, Pain when moving the neck, which may spread down an arm and&#xD;
      even into the finger, Sensation of 'pins and needles' in part of an arm or hand (caused by&#xD;
      irritation of a nerve from the neck/spinal cord going to the arm), Crunching sound when&#xD;
      bending or turning the neck.The Kinesio Taping Method is a definitive rehabilitative taping&#xD;
      technique that is designed to facilitate the body's natural healing process while providing&#xD;
      support and stability to muscles and joints without restricting the body's range of motion as&#xD;
      well as providing extended soft tissue manipulation to prolong the benefits of manual therapy&#xD;
      administered within the clinical setting. Latex-free and wearable for days at a time, Kinesio&#xD;
      Tex Tape is safe for populations ranging from pediatric to geriatric, and successfully treats&#xD;
      a variety of orthopedic, neuromuscular, neurological, and other medical conditions. The&#xD;
      Kinesio Taping Method is a therapeutic taping technique not only offering patients the&#xD;
      support they are looking for, but also rehabilitating the affected condition as well. By&#xD;
      targeting different receptors within the somatosensory system, Kinesio Tex Tape alleviates&#xD;
      pain and facilitates lymphatic drainage by microscopically lifting the skin. This lifting&#xD;
      affect forms convolutions in the skin thus increasing interstitial space and allowing for a&#xD;
      decrease in inflammation of the affected areas.Based upon years of clinical use, Kinesio Tex&#xD;
      Tape is specifically applied to the patient based upon their needs after evaluation. The&#xD;
      findings of the clinical evaluation or assessment dictate the specifics of the Kinesio Tex&#xD;
      Tape application and other possible treatments or modalities. With the utilization of single&#xD;
      &quot;I&quot; strips or modifications in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; or other specialized shapes as well&#xD;
      as the direction and amount of stretch placed on the tape at the time of application, Kinesio&#xD;
      Tex Tape can be applied in hundreds of ways and has the ability to re-educate the&#xD;
      neuromuscular system, reduce pain and inflammation, optimize performance, prevent injury and&#xD;
      promote good circulation and healing, and assist in returning the body to&#xD;
      homeostasis.Evaluation and assessment are key to the treatment of any clinical condition. In&#xD;
      order to get the desired results from a Kinesio Tex Tape application as well as any other&#xD;
      treatment, a full assessment of the patient is necessary. In some cases, the treatment of a&#xD;
      condition may require treatment of other underlying conditions as well. This assessment&#xD;
      should include manual muscle testing, range of motion testing, gait assessment, and any other&#xD;
      orthopedic special tests that you deem necessary. The information gained from these&#xD;
      assessments will allow for the proper treatment protocol to be laid out. Kinesio Tex Tape can&#xD;
      be a valuable addition to this protocol. It has been proven to have positive physiological&#xD;
      effects on the skin, lymphatic and circulatory system, fascia, muscles, ligaments, tendons,&#xD;
      and joints. It can be used in conjunction with a multitude of other treatments and modalities&#xD;
      within the clinic and is effective during the rehabilitative and chronic phases of an injury&#xD;
      as well as being used for preventative measures.It includes surgical versus non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment options.Neck pain is a common complaint. Many Conservative treatments are available&#xD;
      to patients and accepted as standard forms of practice, including such common conservative&#xD;
      strategies as medication, physical medicine methods, manual treatments, and education of&#xD;
      patients.The best advice for recovering from simple neck pain is to use anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      medications or muscle relaxants to ease the pain and to resume normal activities as soon as&#xD;
      possible. Gently moving the neck in all directions several times a day will prevent the neck&#xD;
      from stiffening up.Treatment options for mechanical neck pain include Physiotherapy (i.e.&#xD;
      heat, cold, traction, manipulation), Gentle neck exercises, Learning proper sitting posture,&#xD;
      Yoga for improving neck posture, Massage therapy, Pressure point therapy, and Kinesio taping.&#xD;
      Kinesiology taping (KT) is a therapeutic tool and has become increasingly popular within the&#xD;
      sporting arena. Taping has been used for a long time for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      sporting injuries. KT is not only used for sporting injuries but for a variety of other&#xD;
      conditions. It was developed by Japanese chiropractor Kenzo Kase in the 1970s with the&#xD;
      intention to alleviate pain and improve the healing in soft tissues. There are many proposed&#xD;
      benefits to KT, including proprioceptive facilitation; reduced muscle fatigue; muscle&#xD;
      facilitation; reduced delayed-onset muscle soreness; pain inhibition; enhanced healing, such&#xD;
      as reducing edema, and improvement of lymphatic drainage and blood flow.An RCT was conducted&#xD;
      which concluded that In daily practice, manual therapy is a favorable treatment option for&#xD;
      patients with neck pain compared with physical therapy or continued care by a general&#xD;
      practitioner. Patients with acute WAD receiving an application of Kinesio Taping, applied&#xD;
      with proper tension, exhibited statistically significant improvements immediately following&#xD;
      application of the Kinesio Tape and at a 24-hour follow-up. However, the improvements in pain&#xD;
      and cervical range of motion were small and may not be clinically meaningful. Future studies&#xD;
      should investigate if Kinesio Taping provides enhanced outcomes when added to physical&#xD;
      therapy interventions with proven efficacy or when applied over a longer period. Patients&#xD;
      with mechanical neck pain who received cervical thrust manipulation or Kinesio Taping&#xD;
      exhibited similar reductions in neck pain intensity and disability and similar changes in&#xD;
      active cervical range of motion, except for rotation. Changes in neck pain surpassed the&#xD;
      minimal clinically important difference, whereas changes in disability did not. Changes in&#xD;
      cervical range of motion were small and not clinically meaningful. Because investigators did&#xD;
      not include a control or placebo group in this study, investigators cannot rule out a placebo&#xD;
      effect or natural changes over time as potential reasons for the improvements measured in&#xD;
      both groups. This study shows that Kinesio Taping leads to improvements in pain, pressure&#xD;
      pain threshold, and cervical range of motion, but not a disability in a short time.&#xD;
      Therefore, Kinesio Taping can be used as an alternative therapy method in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with MPS.&#xD;
