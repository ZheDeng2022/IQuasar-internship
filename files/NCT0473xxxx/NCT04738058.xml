    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at increased risk of developing feeding intolerance due to functional&#xD;
      immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and may lead to discontinuation of enterak&#xD;
      feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactoferrin promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria, stimulates differntiation and&#xD;
      proliferation of enterocytes and expression of intestinal digestive enzymes , lead to&#xD;
      improvement of feeding intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we hypothesized that supplementation of bovine lactoferrin would be benificial on feeding&#xD;
      intolerance and decrease intestinal permeability in preterm infants with feeding intolerance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at increased risk of developing feeding intolerance (FI) due to&#xD;
      functional immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract. Feeding intolerance often leads to&#xD;
      discontinuation of enteral feeds, delayed achievement of full enteral feeding, increased&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, sub-optimal nutrition, postnatal growth restriction, prolonged&#xD;
      parenteral feeding with an increased risk of nosocomial infections and poor&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome.1,2 Although there is no consensus on the definition of FI, a&#xD;
      gastric residual volume of more than 50% of the previous feeding volume, gastric&#xD;
      regurgitation, abdominal distension and/or emesis, are used as indicators for FI.1,3&#xD;
      Intestinal microflora plays an important role in the promotion and maintenance of intestinal&#xD;
      functions such as mucosal trophism, gut barrier, sensori-motor function, hormone secretion,&#xD;
      angiogenesis and immune defences.4 Many factors lead to unbalanced microflora colonization in&#xD;
      the preterm infant as cesarean delivery, NICU stays, fasting and antibiotic use, leading to&#xD;
      FI and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).5 Several strategies have been developed to improve&#xD;
      the enteral feeding tolerance in preterm infants such as the implementation of standardized&#xD;
      feeding protocols, the use of prokinetic agents and probiotics. The beneficial effect of&#xD;
      probiotic supplementation on FI has been reported in several studies.6,7 Multiple mechanism&#xD;
      of action has been proposed, including strengthening the intestinal mucosal barrier function,&#xD;
      thereby inhibiting bacterial translocation, regulation of bacterial colonization, modulation&#xD;
      of intestinal inflammation.8 Although probiotics may be a promising approach for the&#xD;
      prevention of FI and NEC in preterm infants, several issues exist regarding strain&#xD;
      specificity, schedule of supplementation, and long-term adverse effects.9 Lactoferrin (LF), a&#xD;
      member of the transferrin family of iron-binding glycoproteins, is present in high amounts in&#xD;
      colostrum and maternal milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactoferrin is almost completely absent from processed formulae. Lactoferrin is the major&#xD;
      factor responsible for the protective effects of breast milk-decreased rates of infection and&#xD;
      NEC, improved neurodevelopment and better immune responses due to its antimicrobial,&#xD;
      anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.10 Lactoferrin stimulates&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cell proliferation and differentiation via extracellular signal-regulated&#xD;
      kinase, limits IL-8 secretion, prevents NF-kB and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a activation,&#xD;
      suggesting strong anti-inflammatory effects.11 Lactoferrin also promotes the growth of&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria, stimulates differentiation and proliferation of enterocytes and&#xD;
      expression of intestinal digestive enzymes.12 Its bifidogenic activity in the gut may improve&#xD;
      tolerance to feeds.13 Very preterm infants receive little or no milk during early neonatal&#xD;
      period and have low intake of LF.14 Because human LF is expensive, bovine lactoferrin has&#xD;
      been considered as an alternate supplement to correct this deficiency, as it is about 70%&#xD;
      homologous with human LF but has higher antimicrobial activity.15 Bovine LF has no known&#xD;
      toxicity and is registered as GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe) by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.16 A systematic review including 6 RCTs involving almost 1100 preterm infants&#xD;
      concluded that there is an evidence of low quality suggesting that LF supplementation to&#xD;
      enteral feeds with or without probiotics decreases late-onset sepsis and NEC stage II or III&#xD;
      in preterm infants without adverse effects.17 A more recent systematic review, included 9&#xD;
      trials that enrolled 1834 preterm infants indicated that LF supplementation in preterm&#xD;
      neonates is safe without obvious adverse effects, could significantly reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      NEC, and hospital-acquired infection. Moreover, LF could reduce the time to achieve full&#xD;
      enteral feeding (the mean difference for days to achieve full enteral feeding in preterm&#xD;
      infants was -2.19 days) and duration of hospitalization of preterm infants.18 A large RCT&#xD;
      &quot;The ELFIN Trial&quot;, included 2203 infants, has demonstrated that enteral LF supplementation&#xD;
      (150 mg/kg per day until 34 weeks' postmenstrual age) does not reduce the risk of late-onset&#xD;
      infection, other morbidity, or mortality in very preterm infants. However, this study did not&#xD;
      rule out important potential benefits, particularly for infants who receive formula for over&#xD;
      half of days of enteral feeds.19 The intestinal barrier provides highly selective protection&#xD;
      of the human body against the environment. It has several facets, which include: intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota; a protective mucus layer; intestinal epithelium cells with tight junctions (TJ);&#xD;
      and cells of the immune system and enteric nervous system.20 Intestinal barrier maturation in&#xD;
      preterm infants is gestational age and postnatal age-dependent and is influenced by feeding&#xD;
      type and antibiotic exposure.21 Zonulin (ZO), is an established marker of intestinal&#xD;
      permeability. Zonulin is one of the proteins that regulate the function of TJ between&#xD;
      intestinal epithelial cells, which determines paracellular transport in the gut. It is one of&#xD;
      the main factors securing the action of the &quot;gate of the gut&quot; mechanism by reversibly&#xD;
      influencing TJ's tightness. Zonulin increase and disruption of TJ has been demonstrated in an&#xD;
      animal model of NEC with intestinal TJ destruction proven by immune histochemical&#xD;
      evaluation.22 Zonulin increases in newborns presenting symptoms of infection and/ or&#xD;
      inflammation of the gut or being at risk of intestinal pathology.23 We hypothesized that&#xD;
      supplementation of bovine LF would have beneficial effects on feeding tolerance and decrease&#xD;
      intestinal permeability in preterm infants with FI.&#xD;
