    <textblock>
      Immune dysfunction in individuals with obesity, secondary to chronic inflammation, may have&#xD;
      an acute impact on War fighter health and readiness, and subsequent lethality. Indeed, ~51%&#xD;
      of military personnel ages 17 or older are overweight, and ~15% have obesity (ranging from&#xD;
      6.4% in the Marine Corps to 18.0% in the Army). In conjunction with in vitro functional tests&#xD;
      to assess systemic immune function, the suction blister model is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure that allows in vivo assessment of immune function (i.e., skin barrier restoration),&#xD;
      and related mechanisms (i.e., pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses at the wound site&#xD;
      during the early phases of wound healing), consequent to obesity. We have demonstrated that&#xD;
      the blister wound model reliably assesses skin barrier restoration and immune function at the&#xD;
      wound site; and that relatively modest sleep disruption degrades immune response at the site&#xD;
      of the disrupted skin barrier and delays the initial restoration of the skin barrier.&#xD;
      However, our prior work excluded participants with obesity (≥30 kg/m2), since obesity is&#xD;
      associated with an altered inflammatory response which may subsequently impact the body's&#xD;
      functional response to a skin wound. Prior studies have indicated that immune function and&#xD;
      wound healing is perturbed in individuals with obesity versus those without obesity. Existing&#xD;
      research mainly relied on blood biomarkers and in vitro tests to assess systemic immune&#xD;
      function; however, incorporating the blister wound model permits evaluation of the functional&#xD;
      immune response to obesity in addition to local immune response at the wound site. Further,&#xD;
      military personnel with obesity may be more physically active than civilians with obesity,&#xD;
      which could mitigate the effects of obesity on immune dysfunction. Therefore, the primary aim&#xD;
      of this parallel-group study is to utilize a suction blister model and in vitro functional&#xD;
      assays to examine differences in immune function between participants without obesity (BMI&#xD;
      18.5-24.9 kg/m2) and with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and related mechanisms (e.g., local&#xD;
      cytokine response at the wound site and circulating markers of inflammation). Research will&#xD;
      be conducted in a laboratory environment using males and females with obesity (BMI ≥ 30&#xD;
      kg/m2) compared to normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) controls. Participants in the study&#xD;
      described herein (n = 50; n = 25 with obesity and n = 25 lean) will undergo baseline testing&#xD;
      and a period of dietary surveillance prior to induction of up to eight blisters via suction&#xD;
      on participant's forearm, after which time the top layer of blisters will be removed to&#xD;
      reveal the dermal layer of skin. The primary outcome measure is initial restoration of the&#xD;
      skin barrier (via transepidermal water loss) and additional outcome measures include immune&#xD;
      function (e.g., circulating markers of inflammation, cytokines at the blister site, and&#xD;
      secretory immunoglobin) and nutrient status. Additionally, to assess the impact of BMI on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle inflammation, a subset of volunteers (n = 12 with obesity and n =12 lean)&#xD;
      will undergo a single muscle biopsy at the conclusion of skin barrier restoration. Findings&#xD;
      from this study will determine if obesity affects the early phases of wound healing and&#xD;
      whether further study is warranted, e.g., do stressors exacerbate immune decrements observed&#xD;
      in obese individuals, or can nutrition counter-measures mitigate immune decrements given that&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiency is common in individuals with obesity.&#xD;
