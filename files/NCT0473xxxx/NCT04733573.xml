      During the study, designated pressure points before and after one month of splint usage will&#xD;
      be evaluated as possible indicators of two different splints efficacy..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study groups will be formed. The study will be conducted on patients reporting to the&#xD;
      Dental Prosthetics Outpatient Clinic of PUM in Szczecin, Poland. Patients aged 18-65 years&#xD;
      with probable bruxism, yet requiring splint therapy will be included in the study. Probable&#xD;
      bruxism will be diagnosed on the basis of the patient's history and examination as follows.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Nocturnal Bruxism according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Second&#xD;
      Edition (ICSD-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The patient reports or is aware of tooth-grinding sounds or tooth clenching during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. One or more of the following is present: a. Abnormal wear of teeth b. Jaw muscle&#xD;
      discomfort, fatigue, or pain and jaw lock upon awakening. c. Masseter muscle hypertrophy upon&#xD;
      voluntary forceful clenching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The jaw muscle activity is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical&#xD;
      or neurological disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Additional questionnaire for detecting bruxers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Has anyone heard you grinding your teeth at night?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is your jaw ever fatigued or sore in the morning?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are your teeth or gums ever sore on awakening in the morning?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do you ever experience temporal headaches on awakening in the morning?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are you aware of grinding your teeth during the day?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Are you ever aware of clenching your teeth during the day&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Can you imitate a sound of grinding using your teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned into two groups. Sealed, opaque envelopes&#xD;
      will be used for randomization. The first group will be treated with a stabilization&#xD;
      appliance described by Okeson. The second group will undergo therapy with a two-jaw splint&#xD;
      with an arch. Patients will be informed about how to use and maintain hygiene of the splint.&#xD;
      It will be recommended to use a splint only while sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Pressure pain threshold test (PPT) will be carried out at the Department of&#xD;
      Prosthodontics of the Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland using the Wagner&#xD;
      Paintest FPX 25 algometer. Points within the following muscles will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      masseter muscles, anterior, middle and posterior abdomens of the temporal muscles, a point at&#xD;
      the height of the TMJ larger exterior convexity, the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the&#xD;
      preauriculare point, bilaterally two measurements at each visit. The test will be performed&#xD;
      at the first visit and after 30 days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algometer comes with a 1 cm2 rubber tip, which measures the pressure in kg / s while&#xD;
      pressing on the tested surface. Both test results will be used as a pre- and post- treatment&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
