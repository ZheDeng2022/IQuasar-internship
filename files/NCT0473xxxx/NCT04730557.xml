  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OA is a degenerative joint disease that involves the degradation of articular cartilage and&#xD;
      underlying subchondral bone. Obesity is identified as a critical and potentially modifiable&#xD;
      risk factor for the development and progression of OA. The first objective of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of obesity on cartilage composition and function. The second objective&#xD;
      of the study is to determine whether weight loss restores cartilage composition and function.&#xD;
      Study activities would require getting MR Imaging, evaluation of joint loading using gait&#xD;
      analysis techniques, cartilage strain measurement, and participating in weight loss&#xD;
      intervention. The study will target a population age group between 18 and 45 years with a BMI&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 29. Data analyses will be blinded to reduce potential bias. All&#xD;
      subjects participating in this study will be informed of the risks involved and sign an&#xD;
      IRB-approved consent form.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate study power will be achieved with 35 participants in the weight loss group and 35&#xD;
      participants in the weight maintenance control group (see Data Analysis and Statistical&#xD;
      Considerations). We will recruit and enroll obese (BMI ≥29 - ≤40) men and women, age 18 to&#xD;
      45, with no previous history of lower extremity injury, no evidence of symptoms OA, no knee&#xD;
      misalignment (neutral alignment between 178° and 182°), or other injury that would prevent&#xD;
      them from performing the walking task required by this study. All inclusion criteria specific&#xD;
      to knee injury, OA, and alignment will be verified by MRI scan. All participants in this&#xD;
      study will be informed of the risks involved. Upon expressing interest in study&#xD;
      participation, participants will be asked questions to determine whether they are free of&#xD;
      lower extremity injury and their height and weight will also be recorded to determine their&#xD;
      BMI. Potential participants will be pre-screened by phone using a phone script with a list of&#xD;
      questions. Once it is determined they meet all study inclusion criteria, they will be invited&#xD;
      to attend a consent meeting.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the weight-loss intervention arm of the study will be enrolled in an individualized 6-month intervention designed to achieve a 10% reduction of body weight relative to baseline. Each participant receives a calorie (kcal) prescription derived from calculations of estimated total energy expenditure (TEE) based on weight, height, sex, age, and activity level using equations developed by the Institute of Medicine [29]. Prescribed kcal levels are adjusted downward from the TEE to achieve a weekly weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds, generally a deficit of 500-1000 kcal/day. Intervention activities include individual diet counseling, group support, goal setting, self-monitoring, stress management, and problem solving. Weekly group support and education sessions, along with daily food journaling and weekly weigh-ins, are recognized approaches for successful weight loss [30-32]. Once the weight loss goal is achieved, diets will be liberalized for weight maintenance.</description>

    <description>Control participants will be counseled to maintain their baseline body weight and level of physical activity. They will report weights weekly and if their weight deviates from baseline they will be asked to keep daily food logs and counseled to return calorie intakes to weight maintenance level. To document diet intakes/adherence, 3-day food records will be collected at months 0, 3, and 6 and analyzed for calorie and nutrient composition. Participants will be encouraged not to change their physical activity levels from baseline and their activity will be monitored by Actigraph activity monitors worn in 7-day periods at months 0, 3, and 6. In addition, each participant will be invited to enter the weight loss intervention after completion of the health education control course.</description>
