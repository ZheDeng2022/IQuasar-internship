      Objective: To evaluate non-inferiority of Trimbow, an approved therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      severe COPD, in ICU compared to the standard of care which is based on the same therapeutic&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study location: CHU Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liège, Belgium Study duration: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type : Interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Prospective clinical trial Number of patients: 200 (randomized 1:1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Inclusion criteria :&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Admission for AE of COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed Inform consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admitted in ICU &gt;24h&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the ICU, the standard of care is still focused on the use of aerosolized therapies. These&#xD;
      therapies are time consuming and largely used unless the lack of proven superiority in&#xD;
      comparison with Pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) which are as effective and easier&#xD;
      to use. Moreover, aerosolized therapies are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      oropharyngeal deposition and not always efficiently delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of new ventilation techniques like high flow canula oxygen therapy is also&#xD;
      challenging in the particular context of inhaled therapies. Nowadays, no data are available&#xD;
      to confirm the appropriate deposition of the inhaled therapies. Therefore, it's necessary to&#xD;
      have to move forward the evaluation of pMDIs in the particular context of non invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (for example with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the use of triple therapy is now the standard of care in COPD patients experiencing a&#xD;
      severe exacerbation, it is the objective to propose the introduction of Trimbow as soon as&#xD;
      possible following the onset of a severe exacerbation, even in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the non inferiority of Trimbow associated with the standard of care in comparison&#xD;
      with the standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the other ICU-stay outcomes and long term outcomes of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Type of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label, prospective randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A : Open label, prospective study in hospital. Shift in phase IV at hospital discharge&#xD;
      (reimbursed treatment in Belgium, use of Trimbow as recommended)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B : Trimbow prescribed as accepted in Belgium following reimbursement criteria :&#xD;
      observational study (12 months), out of hospital. One visit in hospital every 3 months (as&#xD;
      usual) with classical evaluation during the visit (clinical, functional, symptomatic, scales,&#xD;
      exacerbation) 5 Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of one cohort of patients admitted in our hospital (CHU DE&#xD;
      LIEGE) for acute exacerbation of COPD. The COPD has to be diagnosed based on the&#xD;
      international recommendations (GOLD recommendations). The patient has to suffer from an acute&#xD;
      severe exacerbation requiring an ICU stay of at least 24hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be separated in 2 randomized groups (Trimbow + SOC versus SOC) 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 patients will be randomized in this study following the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusions criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be spited in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase A: Hospitalization (interventional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase B: Follow up study after discharged (observational)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational therapy TRIMBOW® pressurised inhalation solution: Beclometasone dipropionate&#xD;
      / formoterol fumarate /glycopyrronium 87/5/9 µg per inhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy DUOVENT®: Fenoterol 50 microg/ipratropium 20 microg (400/160 per day to&#xD;
      800/320 per day) Plus FLIXOTIDE®: fluticasone propionate (250-100 microg/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Informed consent: our study falls within the context of the law governing&#xD;
      clinical studies and requires the signature of an informed consent which will be duly signed&#xD;
      with the presence of an investigator and after the patient or his legal representative has&#xD;
      been able to ask the set of his questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical aspects At admission in our hospital, the patient or its legal representative will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in the TRIMICU study. All the explanations will be given by the data&#xD;
      manager in charge of the study. After a period of reflection, a local investigator will&#xD;
      re-consider the different aspects of the study with the various stakeholders and will&#xD;
      personally supervise the signing of the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signature, the patient will be randomized to trimbow + SOC versus SOC alone. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized in groups of 20 patients 10/10 by the study director or the data nurse.&#xD;
      None of them will have any therapeutic contact with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once started, the patient will be followed daily by the data manager during his&#xD;
      hospitalization (via study of the computerized file) and once every 3 months after his&#xD;
      discharge from hospitalization by telephone contact and a follow-visit every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite primary endpoint At ICU discharge: non inferiority of Trimbow + SOC versus SOC&#xD;
      alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU Length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of Ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      At hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B Explore the survival rate without exacerbation at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety variables Trimbow is known to be efficient in the specific case of severe COPD which&#xD;
      is by definition the case of all COPD patients admitted in ICU. As it is the standard of care&#xD;
      per se for ambulatory patients, treating patients earlier with this specific therapy designed&#xD;
      for COPD patients is theoretically appropriate. Trimbow is compound of bronchodilators and&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids already used in the specific ICU onset. No safety issue is expected&#xD;
      for this specific study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tachyarythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Two primary endpoints were considered for the sample size determination:&#xD;
      (1) the length of hospitalization stay (days) during Phase I, and (2) the survival rate (%)&#xD;
      without exacerbation at 1 year during Phase II. It was found that a total of 200 patients&#xD;
      (including a 15% drop-out rate) randomized in two groups of 100 subjects would be necessary&#xD;
      to show the non-inferiority of the &quot;SOC+Trimbow&quot; treatment compared to &quot;SOC alone&quot; treatment&#xD;
      with a power of 80% and an overall significance level of 5% for the two outcomes, by using&#xD;
      two one-sided unpaired t-test at α=0.025. In the power calculation, a non-inferiority margin&#xD;
      of 2 days was assumed for the hospitalization length of stay and of 5% for the survival&#xD;
      without exacerbation at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics will be performed for each continuous variable&#xD;
      measured and will include mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and number of&#xD;
      available observation. Frequency distributions will be used for ordinal and nominal variables&#xD;
      and will include numbers and percentages of each of the scores or categories, and the number&#xD;
      of missing observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be compared between control group (SOC alone) and test group (SOC +&#xD;
      Trimbow) with the convenient statistical test. The primary outcomes i.e. survival without&#xD;
      exacerbation at 1 year and length of hospitalization stay, will be compared with a&#xD;
      non-inferiority test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics will be done on the maximum available data. Results will be considered significant&#xD;
      at the 5% level (p&lt;0.05). Calculations will be done with SAS version 9.4 and R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data anonymization and Security Each subject in the study will be assigned a unique subject&#xD;
      number and will keep that number throughout the study. The medical investigators will keep a&#xD;
      list linking the subject's number to the subject's names. He will follow all applicable&#xD;
      privacy laws in order to protect a subject's privacy and confidentiality.&#xD;
