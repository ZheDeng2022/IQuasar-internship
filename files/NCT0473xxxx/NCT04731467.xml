    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, multi-dose escalation and dose expansion study in&#xD;
      subjects with selected advanced solid tumors (Part A), advanced recurrent immune checkpoint&#xD;
      refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Part B), and metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (Part C) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CM-24 in combination with nivolumab. In&#xD;
      Part C of the study nab-paclitaxel will be administered subsequent to CM24 and nivolumab.&#xD;
