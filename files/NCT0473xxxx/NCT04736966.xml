  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of guselkumab, a humanized anti-IL23 monoclonal antibody, for&#xD;
      patients with alcoholic liver disease. This drug is approved for the use in psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis but not for alcoholic liver disease. The investigators will be using a standard 3+3&#xD;
      phase I dose escalation trial design, the dose levels will start from 30 mg, 70 mg and to 100&#xD;
      mg, a maximum total of 24 patients will be evaluable. In this study the investigators propose&#xD;
      to establish safety of the product in those with alcoholic liver disease and efficacy&#xD;
      (secondary endpoint) will be determined by biomarkers for liver inflammation and fibrosis&#xD;
      surrogate biomarkers.&#xD;
