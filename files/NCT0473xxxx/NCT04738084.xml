      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Meru Health Program (MHP) versus a&#xD;
      waitlist (WL) control group, which will be offered access to the MHP after the waitlist&#xD;
      period (12 weeks) is over, for adults with depression. The Meru Health Program (MHP) is a&#xD;
      12-week mobile mental health intervention delivered via Smartphone app that includes&#xD;
      components of several evidence-based treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral&#xD;
      Activation Therapy, Mindfulness Meditation) and also several promising therapies (heart rate&#xD;
      variability-biofeedback [HRVB], nutritional psychiatry, sleep training) that is overseen by a&#xD;
      licensed clinical therapist.&#xD;

      Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of the Meru Health Program versus Waitlist Control for&#xD;
      Adults with Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Meru Health Program&#xD;
      (MHP) versus a waitlist (WL) control group, which will be offered access to the MHP after the&#xD;
      waitlist period (12 weeks) is over, for adults with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives*:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To compare changes in depressive symptoms and reduction in clinically&#xD;
      significant depression at the end of the program and compare between those in the MHP group&#xD;
      versus WL group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To compare changes in anxiety, worker productivity, burnout symptoms,&#xD;
      resilience, insomnia, quality of life, days spent engaging with the program per week and&#xD;
      hours spent in various program activities per week between those in the MHP group versus WL&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints*:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Depressive symptoms and adverse events at 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Anxiety, worker productivity, burnout, resilience, insomnia, and quality&#xD;
      of life at 12 weeks; days spent engaging with program per week and hours spent in various&#xD;
      program activities per week, program satisfaction, therapist rating, system usability scale..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients aged 18 or older presenting to the Meru Health Program with&#xD;
      depression (defined as having a PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: MHP online clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention/Experimental Manipulation: The Meru Health Program (MHP) is&#xD;
      a 12-week mobile health app delivered via Smartphone that includes components of several&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation Therapy,&#xD;
      Mindfulness Meditation) and also several promising therapies (heart rate&#xD;
      variability-biofeedback [HRVB], nutritional psychiatry, sleep training) that is overseen by a&#xD;
      licensed clinical therapist. This study will test the MHP versus a WL control group, of which&#xD;
      patients enrolled will be offered access to the MHP after 12 weeks in the WL control group,&#xD;
      to compare groups on depressive symptom outcomes and, secondarily, on other mood and&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes, engagement, and patient satisfaction outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration*: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: 12 weeks&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item depression scale during the program. Scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicative of more depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item anxiety scale during the program. Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicative of more anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of participants with change in burnout during program. A validated, single item burnout score measure will be used. Burnout is assessed through an item with 5-level responses and categorized as &quot;yes&quot; (&gt;=3) or &quot;no&quot; (&lt;3) on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 (no symptoms of burnout) to 5 (completely burned out).</description>
