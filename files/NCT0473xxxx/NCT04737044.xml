      Study 1: To investigate the effects of antioxidant-rich sugar as alternative compared to&#xD;
      granulated sugar on gene expression and other metabolic parameters in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses is antioxidant-rich sugar have positive effects on reducing inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, oxidative stress biomarkers and other metabolic parameters in intervention group&#xD;
      compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition education module in modifying sugar&#xD;
      consumption and other CMR-related outcomes in individuals with cardiometabolic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses is the nutrition education module significantly improves the sugar consumption&#xD;
      and other CMR-related outcomes in the intervention groups compared to the control group&#xD;

      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all subjects involved in the study. Respondents will be interviewed at&#xD;
      Nutritional Status Assessments Lab at University of Putra, Malaysia (UPM) to obtain&#xD;
      socio-demographic data, medical status, nutritional status, lifestyle practices and daily&#xD;
      dietary intake. This study will be conducted for a period of 8 weeks. The study design is&#xD;
      single-blinded parallel-randomized controlled trial (n=80), with 40 subjects in each group&#xD;
      (one intervention and one control group). The participants will be selected based on the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all subjects involved in the study prior to commencing the study. Respondents&#xD;
      will be screened at Nutritional Status Assessments Lab at UPM for mental health status, daily&#xD;
      sugar intake, cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) where blood pressure&#xD;
      and blood sample will be taken by the phlebotomist. Female candidates will be screened for&#xD;
      pregnancy or breast feeding. Those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      selected. They will be informed via communication application whether they are eligible for&#xD;
      the study. This study will be conducted for a period of 6 months.&#xD;
