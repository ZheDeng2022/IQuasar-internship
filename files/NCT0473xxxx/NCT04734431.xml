      No biological marker is highly specific of infection and currently available, especially for&#xD;
      bacterial infection. The ideal marker would be easy to perform, rapidly, inexpensive, and&#xD;
      correlated with the severity and prognosis of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      decreased in eosinophil count (EC) is unspecific of a particular clinical picture and may&#xD;
      support a systemic inflammation, whereas the deeper the eosinopenia is, the darker is the&#xD;
      prognosis in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of eosinopenia is not clearly documented, but it has been recently shown that EC&#xD;
      tends to normalization, rapidly after appropriate and effective antimicrobial therapy in case&#xD;
      of bacterial infection among adults patients hospitalized in a medicine ward. In the light of&#xD;
      this findings, Terradas et al. described that EC returned back to normal between the day 2 or&#xD;
      day 3 in survivors, indicating a potential interest as a predictive marker of the evolution&#xD;
      among hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no work has studied eosinopenia as a prognostic marker of&#xD;
      mortality during bacterial infections in the elderly patients in a hospital setting. Our&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the prognosis value of the EC in a geriatric unit of tertiary care&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

      We performed an observational, retrospective single-center study in a teaching hospital of&#xD;
      Paris area (Ambroise Paré Hospital in Boulogne-Billancourt). The hospital information system&#xD;
      that is routinely completed by healthcare staff for the financing of hospital activity&#xD;
      (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information - PMSI) was used to identify eligible&#xD;
      patients, i.e. those who had been hospitalized in acute geriatrics ward between January 1 and&#xD;
      December 31, 2018 with a diagnosis or a suspicion of bacterial infection. Information about&#xD;
      bacterial infection was then checked in the medical record of the patient. Infections of&#xD;
      interest were pulmonary, urinary, digestive, biliary, cutaneous, cardiac, and central nervous&#xD;
      system infections, as well as bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of multiple stays over the study period, only the last one was included in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, over this 12-month period, we analyzed the stays of patients affected by 126 father&#xD;
      codes (entitled &quot;family&quot; of pathology) which were sometimes broken down into child codes&#xD;
      (pathologies corresponding to these groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database had been declared to the French Authority for Data Protection (Commission&#xD;
      Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL) via the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de&#xD;
      Paris (AP-HP) (whose registration number is the 2216836).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected retrospectively by a single investigator, from the patient's medical&#xD;
      record on Agfa® Orbis software. The same software made it possible to consult the totality of&#xD;
      the biology, the images as well as the treatments administered throughout the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, eosinopenia is defined by an eosinophil count under 100 eosinophils/mm3 based&#xD;
      on our previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering D0 as the date of the start of diagnosis by a clinician in the hospital, the&#xD;
      other four dates were between D1 and D7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were separated into two groups: a group of patients who died during&#xD;
      hospitalization and a group of patients released alive from their stay. If the patients were&#xD;
      still hospitalized 30 days after their admission, they were classified in the group of&#xD;
      &quot;living&quot; patients since they had not died on D30.&#xD;
