      Study Title: FastFrame™ External Fixation System Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up Study (Knee&#xD;
      Spanning Kit and Damage Control Kit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor: Zimmer Biomet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective enrollment, prospective follow-up, single cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Phase: Postmarket&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: Up to three sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration per Subject: Subjects will be enrolled in the study until the time of exchange&#xD;
      of their FastFrame Kit to another device. Typically, this exchange occurs 2-4 weeks after&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The objective of this observational, prospective study is to confirm&#xD;
      safety and performance of the FastFrame External Fixation System and corresponding&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Frequency and incidence of device-related adverse events and device&#xD;
      deficiencies before the FastFrame External Fixation System is exchanged by another device&#xD;
      (i.e. plates, screws, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Adverse events that occur between application of the FastFrame External&#xD;
      Fixation System and exchange with another device that do not fall within the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be treated with either the Knee Spanning or Damage Control FastFrame&#xD;
             External Fixation System according to the European Economic Area (EEA) indications*&#xD;
&#xD;
        EEA Indications (a subset of the cleared US indications):&#xD;
&#xD;
        The FastFrame External Fixation System - Knee Spanning Kit is indicated for use in&#xD;
        treatment of long bone (distal femur, proximal tibia) fractures. Specifically, the system&#xD;
        is intended for temporary stabilization of open or closed fractures about the knee,&#xD;
        typically in the context of polytrauma or where open or alternative closed treatment is&#xD;
        undesirable or otherwise contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The FastFrame External Fixation System - Damage Control Kit is indicated for use in&#xD;
        treatment of mid-shaft long bone (femur, tibia) fractures. Specifically, the system is&#xD;
        intended for temporary stabilization of open or closed fractures of the femur and tibia,&#xD;
        typically in the context of polytrauma or where open or alternative closed treatment is&#xD;
        undesirable or otherwise contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an active or suspected infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has conditions that limit their ability and/or willingness to follow&#xD;
             instructions during the healing process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has inadequate skin, bone, or neurovascular status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a prisoner&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has a mental or neurologic condition that will not allow for proper Informed&#xD;
             Consent and/or participation in follow-up program in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
