    <textblock>
      ED GOAL is a 6-minute, motivational interviewing, advance care planning intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will pilot test (Part I) ED GOAL by training research nurses&#xD;
      to demonstrate its intervention fidelity and acceptability on older adults with serious&#xD;
      illness in the emergency department (ED). Upon demonstrating the intervention fidelity of&#xD;
      this intervention in Part I, the investigators will collect patient-centered outcomes (Part&#xD;
      II) of 100 older adults with serious illness after leaving the ED. Further in Part III, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a survey to the participants' outpatient clinicians to find out&#xD;
      how to optimize the care coordination from the ED to the outpatient office to facilitate&#xD;
      advance care planning conversations.&#xD;
