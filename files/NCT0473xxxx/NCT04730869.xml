  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a very aggressive brain tumour, is one of the most malignant&#xD;
      of all cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis. The majority of GBM cells display&#xD;
      damaged mitochondria (the &quot;batteries&quot; of cells), so they rely on an alternate method for&#xD;
      producing energy called the Warburg Effect, which relies nearly exclusively on glucose (in&#xD;
      contrast, normal cells can use other molecules, such as fatty acids and fat-derived ketones,&#xD;
      for energy). Metabolic interventions, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, target cancer cell&#xD;
      metabolism by enhancing mitochondria function, decreasing blood glucose levels, and&#xD;
      increasing blood ketone levels, creating an advantage for normal cells but a disadvantage for&#xD;
      cancer cells. Preliminary experience at Waikato Hospital has shown that a metabolic therapy&#xD;
      program (MTP) utilizing fasting and ketogenic diets is feasible and safe in people with&#xD;
      advanced cancer, and may provide a therapeutic benefit. We aim to determine whether using an&#xD;
      MTP concurrently with standard oncological treatment (chemoradiation followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy) is feasible and safe in patients with GBM, and has treatment outcomes&#xD;
      consistent with greater overall treatment efficacy than in published trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are tumours that originate from glial cells in the central nervous system. The most&#xD;
      common histological subtype is GBM, which accounts for nearly 50% of all malignant brain&#xD;
      tumours. Despite aggressive multimodal treatment, the median survival for GBM is poor (8-15&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although cancer is regarded as a genetic disease, it may be perceived as a metabolic&#xD;
      disorder. The majority of human cancers, including GBM, display low numbers of mitochondria,&#xD;
      most of which are structurally damaged, resulting in defective cell respiration. To&#xD;
      compensate, cancer cells greatly increase their uptake of glucose, which is fermented&#xD;
      (regardless of oxygen concentration, a process known as the Warburg Effect) to generate&#xD;
      energy. Cancer cells also rely on increased growth signaling pathways involving insulin,&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor-1, and mammalian target of rapamycin to support their unbridled&#xD;
      growth and proliferation. Cancer cells may therefore be vulnerable to interventions that&#xD;
      selectively target their abnormal metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic interventions, such as fasting and ketogenic diets, target cancer cell metabolism&#xD;
      and may be effective alongside standard treatments in advanced cancers. Fasting is a&#xD;
      voluntary abstinence from food and drink for a controlled period of time (typically, 12 hours&#xD;
      to 3 weeks in humans), whereas ketogenic diets are high-fat, adequate-protein,&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate diets that stimulate the body to create a fasting-like metabolic state.&#xD;
      Fasting and ketogenic diets stimulate mitochondria biogenesis, decrease blood glucose,&#xD;
      increase liver production of fat-derived ketones (which serve as a major alternative energy&#xD;
      source for most normal cells within the body, but cannot be utilized by cancer cells), and&#xD;
      decrease growth factor availability. Thus, fasting and ketogenic diets provide an advantage&#xD;
      for normal cells but a disadvantage to cancer cells by enhancing mitochondria biogenesis and&#xD;
      function, depriving cancer cells of their major fuel, and creating a cell environment&#xD;
      unfavourable for unbridled growth and proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary experience at Waikato Hospital has shown that a metabolic therapy program (MTP)&#xD;
      consisting of fasting and/or a ketogenic diet is feasible, safe, and may be effective in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer, including GBM. In a recent case report, a metabolic strategy&#xD;
      (7-day fast every 1-2 months, with a ketogenic diet between fasts) resulted in the&#xD;
      near-complete regression of a stage IVA metastatic thymoma after 2 years. Moreover, we are&#xD;
      currently observing 8 glioblastoma patients who voluntarily consented to undergo fasting and&#xD;
      ketogenic diet therapy in a manner similar to what we propose to use in this study; at an&#xD;
      average of 4-5 months, all patients have completed the fasts and adhered to their ketogenic&#xD;
      diet, experiencing only mild adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background, we aim to determine whether using an MTP concurrently with standard&#xD;
      oncological treatment (chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy) is feasible and&#xD;
      safe, and has treatment outcomes consistent with greater overall treatment efficacy than in&#xD;
      published trials, in patients with GBM.&#xD;
