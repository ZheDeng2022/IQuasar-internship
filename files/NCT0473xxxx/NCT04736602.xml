  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether the Triptorelin pamoate 15mg (3-month&#xD;
      formulation) effectiveness in Chinese population of CPP children has the same or similar&#xD;
      trend with that in overseas CPP population. This is measured by assessing the proportion of&#xD;
      children who have a suppressed Luteinizing Hormone (LH) response to Gonadotropin Releasing&#xD;
      Hormone (GnRH) test performed 3 months after injection of triptorelin.&#xD;

      For patients enter extension phase, two additional Triptorelin injections will be given at&#xD;
      month 6 and month 9 visits.&#xD;
