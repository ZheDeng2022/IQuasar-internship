    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop a minimally invasive microneedle sensor to monitor levodopa&#xD;
      levels in real time. We will test the accuracy, tolerability, and safety of this device in&#xD;
      people with Parkinson disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson disease (PD) lack the chemical dopamine, which is important for&#xD;
      movement. Levodopa replaces dopamine and restores normal motor function in PD. Early in the&#xD;
      disease stages, people with PD benefit significantly from levodopa. However, as PD&#xD;
      progresses, the brain loses more dopamine-producing cells, which causes motor complications&#xD;
      and unpredictable responses to levodopa. To maintain control of symptoms over time, levodopa&#xD;
      doses must be increased and given at increasingly shorter intervals. The optimal levodopa&#xD;
      regimen is different for each person and may vary from day-to-day, depending on a variety of&#xD;
      internal and external factors including meal consumption, activity level, and other lifestyle&#xD;
      variances. Currently, clinicians assess levodopa's benefit by the patient's testimony and by&#xD;
      clinical exam. However, these methods may not adequately represent the severity or range of&#xD;
      complications experienced by the PD patient. Thus, it can be difficult to determine the&#xD;
      optimal levodopa treatment regimen, which can cause suboptimal disease management and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to develop a continuous, minimally invasive microneedle device placed on&#xD;
      the skin (the &quot;Levodopameter&quot;) designed to continuously measure levodopa levels in real time,&#xD;
      with the future goals of identifying an individualized treatment regimen for people with PD&#xD;
      to improve disease management. We will compare levodopa levels measured by the Levodopameter&#xD;
      to the impractical and expensive &quot;gold standard&quot; high-performance liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC) analysis of plasma levodopa levels. We will first test the device after administering&#xD;
      oral carbidopa/levodopa in 10 participants with PD. After that portion of the study is&#xD;
      completed and safety confirmed, we will test the device in 10 participants with PD after&#xD;
      administering carbidopa and intravenous levodopa. We will also evaluate the device's safety&#xD;
      and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this device is to allow PD patients to take proactive measures to&#xD;
      assess and maintain an optimal, personalized levodopa regimen, similar to diabetes care in&#xD;
      which diabetic patients periodically self-monitor their glucose and adjust their insulin&#xD;
      regimen accordingly.&#xD;

    <description>Data analysis from this first-of-its-kind microneedle levodopa monitoring device is necessarily exploratory and descriptive. We will assess the Levodopameter's feasibility and accuracy by comparing its interstitial fluid levodopa measurements to plasma levodopa levels analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.</description>
