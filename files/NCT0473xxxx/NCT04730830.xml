  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis, which appeared at the end of the 1970s, quickly proved its worth both in&#xD;
      terms of its effectiveness and of its ease of compliance, which guarantees an improved&#xD;
      quality of life. To date there are different modes of application of this technique:&#xD;
      Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis, and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis. Whatever the&#xD;
      technique used, the placement of a dressing covering the exit site of the catheter is&#xD;
      necessary just after the placement of the PD catheter and this so that the site of emergence&#xD;
      is kept dry until healing (in general 2 to 4 weeks). Once the emergence site has healed, the&#xD;
      technique can be started. Discharge site infections are a major predisposing factor for the&#xD;
      development of peritonitis. Numerous studies in different parts of the world have shown that&#xD;
      the rates of PD-related infections have steadily declined over the past 10 to 20 years.&#xD;
      Several recommendations for the prevention and treatment of emergence site infections have&#xD;
      been published by the International Peritoneal Dialysis Society. Several studies nonetheless&#xD;
      call into question the recommendations by showing that catheter infection is not linked to&#xD;
      the number of risk factors present at the time of catheter insertion, nor to the prescription&#xD;
      of antibiotic prophylaxis, nor to the the experience of the caregiver, the antiseptic used or&#xD;
      the early dressing change. In addition, only antibiotic prophylaxis at catheter placement is&#xD;
      strongly recommended. Regarding the other measures, their relevance is not always&#xD;
      demonstrated and their application varies considerably from one center to another. In&#xD;
      addition, many authors have sought to establish a definition of catheter infections in order&#xD;
      to allow an optimal assessment of their frequency. However, these definitions are not&#xD;
      universal and have certain limitations. The objective of this work is on the one hand to&#xD;
      better characterize the incidence of infections at the site of emergence in peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis, and on the other hand, in the absence of a definition established according to the&#xD;
      recommendations, to use the score de Schaeffer, is in particular the value of this score&#xD;
      which would make it possible to define more precisely the presence of an infection.&#xD;

The infection of the site of emergence is defined by the practitioner as a minimum according to the recommendations: &quot;the presence of a purulent discharge, with or without erythema of the skin at the catheter-epidermal interface&quot; and inducing treatment with an antibiotic .</description>
