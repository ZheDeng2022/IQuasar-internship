  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator plans a randomized trial of melatonin versus standard care&#xD;
      post acute pediatric concussion. The investigator hypothesizes that patients with acute&#xD;
      concussions managed with melatonin will have decreased risk of prolonged concussion symptoms&#xD;
      and faster resolution of concussion symptoms.&#xD;

      To compare the risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) between melatonin and&#xD;
      standard care after an acute pediatric concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if melatonin compared to routine care reduces the risk of PPCS for pediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized control trial of pediatric patients in the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) diagnosed with an acute concussion. Patients 12-19 years old with an acute&#xD;
      concussion diagnosis will be eligible. All participants will receive standard of care per&#xD;
      treating physician and will receive actigraphy watches to wear on their wrists and measure&#xD;
      sleep and activity patterns. Participants in the melatonin group will be instructed to take 1&#xD;
      5-mg melatonin pill 1 hour prior to their habitual fall asleep time daily for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given a standardized diary to track their daily concussion and sleep&#xD;
      symptoms for one month. Research assistants will also arrange follow up in the neurology&#xD;
      headache clinic within 4 weeks post injury. At the follow-up visit, subjects will complete&#xD;
      the Post Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), a neurologic assessment, sleep assessment and&#xD;
      pediatric Functional Disability Inventory.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>For the study, researchers will collect the age, sex, past medical history and through surveys, past, present and future symptoms after a head injury. This information will be used to determine which age groups are at risk and which constellation of symptoms persist following an acute head injury. All research documents and protected health information will be kept in a locked cabinet and a password protected RedCap database that only study staff personnel have access to. No data will be shared until manuscript is written, but will only be shared in manuscript and not in individual data. If significant adverse data is found for a patient, the Lead principal investigator will discuss with the subject and primary care physician.</ipd_description>
