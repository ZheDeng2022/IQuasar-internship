      This study is designed as an open-label, single arm, proof of concept study in order to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate emapalumab dosing regimen neutralizing IFNγ in patients at risk of&#xD;
      GF. Patients presenting CXCL9 levels above a defined threshold and other clinical criteria&#xD;
      will be eligible to receive emapalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both children and adults, with malignant and non-malignant underlying diseases, receiving&#xD;
      allo-HSCT who are at high risk of GF as defined in the inclusion criteria will be included in&#xD;
      the study. The main objective of the study is to determine the appropriate emapalumab dose&#xD;
      regimen neutralizing interferon gamma (IFNγ) activity to pre-empt graft failure post&#xD;
      allo-HSCT in a population with various underlying diseases and at high risk of graft failure&#xD;
      (GF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 3 cohorts are foreseen to determine the appropriate dose regimen to pre-emptively&#xD;
      treat patients at risk of primary GF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emapalumab will be administered by IV infusion and treatment will last up to 56 days (15&#xD;
      infusions) or until evidence of engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last approximately 3 years from screening to the last follow-up&#xD;

      This study is designed as an open-label, single arm, proof of concept study in order to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate emapalumab dosing regimen neutralizing IFNγ in patients at risk of&#xD;
      GF. Patients presenting CXCL9 levels above a defined threshold and other clinical criteria&#xD;
      will be eligible to receive emapalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both children and adults, with malignant and non-malignant underlying diseases, receiving&#xD;
      allo-HSCT who are at high risk of GF as defined in the inclusion criteria will be included in&#xD;
      the study. The main objective of the study will be to determine the appropriate emapalumab&#xD;
      dose regimen neutralizing interferon gamma (IFNγ) activity to pre-empt graft failure post&#xD;
      allo-HSCT in a population with various underlying diseases and at high risk of graft failure&#xD;
      (GF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 3 cohorts are foreseen to determine the appropriate dose regimen to pre-emptively&#xD;
      treat patients at risk of primary GF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emapalumab will be administered by IV infusion over 1 to 2 hours depending on the volume of&#xD;
      the infusion. Treatment will last up to 56 days (15 infusions) or until evidence of&#xD;
      engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of the following study periods: screening (Day -21 to Day -8),&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT Day 0, monitoring period for primary GF (Day 1 up to Day 42), extended&#xD;
      monitoring for secondary GF (up to Day 98), treatment period (up to 56 days) and follow-up&#xD;
      period of 3 years after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this proof of concept study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the appropriate emapalumab dose regimen neutralizing interferon gamma (IFNγ)&#xD;
      activity to pre-empt graft failure post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT) in a population with various underlying diseases and at high risk of graft failure&#xD;
      (GF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following objectives will support the dose selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of emapalumab&#xD;
           post allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of emapalumab to pre-empt GF post allo-HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of emapalumab to pre-empt GF post allo-HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of emapalumab post allo-HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate further data on the correlation between relevant biomarkers including C-X-C&#xD;
      motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) levels and the risk of GF post allo-HSCT in a population&#xD;
      with various underlying diseases and at high risk of GF also in the context of development of&#xD;
      a diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last approximately 3 years from screening to the last follow-up&#xD;
      phone call for each patient.&#xD;

    <description>The first cohort of patients will receive a first infusion of 6 mg/kg at TD0, followed by a second infusion at 3 mg/kg after 3 days (treatment day 3 - TD3). Subsequent infusions of 3 mg/kg will be every 3 or 4 days from previous dose until dose 15 or until engraftment.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Emapalumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Emapalumab (previously referred to as NI-0501, trade name Gamifant®) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-IFNγ monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes IFNγ. Emapalumab binds to both soluble and receptor (IFNγR1)-bound forms of IFNγ.&#xD;
Emapalumab is in development for treatment of primary and secondary HLH. The benefit expected from the targeted neutralization of IFNγ by emapalumab has been validated by the recent FDA approval of emapalumab for treatment of patients with pHLH who have refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy. The safety profile has been assessed as acceptable.&#xD;
Emapalumab will be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 to 2 hours, depending on the volume of the infusion. The first infusion must be performed within 12 hours after CXCL9 levels have been measured above defined threshold. Treatment will last until maximum dose 15 (up to 56 days) or until evidence of engraftment, whichever comes first.</description>
