  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate brain insulin's relationship with food&#xD;
      intake in African Americans. Facilitating insulin's entrance into the brain through a nasal&#xD;
      spray is currently being studied as a way to prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease. However,&#xD;
      brain insulin may also have an impact on food intake. This study is designed to help&#xD;
      researchers understand how different factors related to Alzheimer's disease (i.e. APOE&#xD;
      genotype and cognitive functioning) influence brain insulin's relationship with food intake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will utilize a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover&#xD;
      design comparing a single acute dose of intranasal insulin to a single acute dose of a saline&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim will consist of exploring the differences in ingestive behaviors constructs&#xD;
      (i.e. hunger, satiety, and fullness) and ad libitum lunch caloric intake between acute&#xD;
      administration of either a dose of intranasal insulin or saline placebo. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that acute intranasal insulin will result in the consumption of fewer calories, greater&#xD;
      feelings of satiety and fullness, and less hunger compared to acute saline. A secondary aim&#xD;
      of this investigation will be to analyzing differences in food intake by APOE genotype,&#xD;
      adiposity, and AD family history.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 minutes post intranasal insulin administration</time_frame>
    <description>Ingestive behavior constructs (e.g. hunger, satiety, fullness, etc.) will be quantified through the use of visual analogue scales that have a positive and negative rating at each end attached to a specific question to address each construct separately. Ingestive behavior outcomes will be compared between insulin and placebo conditions to determine if there are greater or lesser feelings of ingestive behavior constructs.</description>

    <description>The spray will last a few seconds and then the participant will be asked to sniff to aid the drug into the nose. The device (i.e. ViaNase) is an atomizer that uses its patented technology that turns the liquid into a fine mist of droplets to facilitate the drug along the nose to brain pathway. Each nostril will receive this administration 2 times for a total of 40 IUs or 0.4 mL of liquid.</description>
