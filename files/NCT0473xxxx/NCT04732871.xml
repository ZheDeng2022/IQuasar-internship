  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      long-term persistence of immune response up to 3 years following a single dose vaccination of&#xD;
      GSK's investigational vaccine RSVPreF3 OA, in adults aged 60 years and above. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of additional vaccine doses given&#xD;
      according to different revaccination schedules.&#xD;
