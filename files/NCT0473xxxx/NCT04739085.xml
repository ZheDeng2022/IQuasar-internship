  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the level of agreement between clinical&#xD;
      defocus curves and the web Democritus Digital Acuity Reading Test (wDDART), which is a&#xD;
      web-based digital near and intermediate vision reading test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 'defocus curve' assessment technique aims to simulate different distances from near to&#xD;
      far over which the patient's visual acuity (VA) is evaluated. Defocus curves are created by&#xD;
      first measuring best-corrected distance and near VA of the examinee. Then, a series of&#xD;
      positive- and negative-powered trial lenses are added to the best-corrected distance visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCDVA) of the patient's eye. Viewing through the addition of a minus lens creates&#xD;
      divergent light rays with the same refractive effect as bringing the eye chart closer to the&#xD;
      viewer. For instance, a -2.50 D lens represents the distance of 40 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;defocus curve&quot; assessment technique is a method used widely for the assessment of the&#xD;
      functional vision range following multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Since this&#xD;
      method is a simulation of the near vision, it would be ideal if near vision could be&#xD;
      evaluated objectively with a near vision chart. However, the conventional printed near vision&#xD;
      charts are not available for a variety of reading distances. In addition, the measurement of&#xD;
      near VA at different distances with a printed reading chart intended for one predefined&#xD;
      distance (e.g. printed chart for 40 cm) and the transformation of the reading score at 40 cm&#xD;
      to an equivalent score for the examined distances is impractical in clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, a digital reading test that allows the text calibration for all reading&#xD;
      distances could be a practical method for the rapid and ease evaluation of the near VA,&#xD;
      especially in patients implanted with multifocal IOLs. The web-based digital near and&#xD;
      intermediate vision reading test wDDART offers the ability to estimate VA at different&#xD;
      distances with automated measurement of the patient-screen distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the level of agreement between clinical&#xD;
      defocus curves and the web-based digital near and intermediate vision reading test wDDART.&#xD;
