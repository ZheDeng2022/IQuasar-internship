  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, adaptive design, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, two-part&#xD;
      study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of multiple&#xD;
      topical doses of BEN2293 in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;

      This Protocol will be adaptive and designed to enable knowledge gained from the previous&#xD;
      cohort to be applied to subsequent cohorts. Changes made will be within the boundaries of the&#xD;
      adaptive elements with clear control mechanisms and guidance for staying within these&#xD;
      boundaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential group study to&#xD;
      investigate ascending multiple topical doses of BEN2293 in patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
      Patients will participate in only one cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to investigate&#xD;
      up to two dose regimens of topical doses of BEN2293 administered for a maximum of 28 days in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate AD.&#xD;

          -  Males and females with mild to moderate AD (based on vIGA) free from other clinically&#xD;
             significant illness or disease that may adversely affect the safety of the patient or&#xD;
             the integrity of the study as determined by medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             safety laboratory and other assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have AD lesions affecting &gt;3% untreatable areas (face, scalp, genitals,&#xD;
             palms of hands or soles of feet).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have concomitant skin disease or infection (e.g., acne, impetigo) or presence of skin&#xD;

          -  Patients who are excessively hirsute in areas of skin to be dosed with study ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unwilling to stop hair removal by any means (including shaving,&#xD;
             waxing or depilatory creams) to skin areas to be dosed with study ointment for 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Day -1 and throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant history of abnormal physical or mental health interfering with the&#xD;
             study as determined by medical history and physical examinations as judged by the&#xD;
