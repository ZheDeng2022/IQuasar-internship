  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is shortness of&#xD;
      breath and causes a decrease in the patient's quality of life. The best way to relieve&#xD;
      shortness of breath is inhaler therapy. However, it is known that patients frequently apply&#xD;
      this treatment incorrectly. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of breathing&#xD;
      exercises and inhaler training for COPD patients on the severity of dyspnea and life quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, two patient groups with a total of 67 people were included in the study. While one&#xD;
      group was trained on inhaler drug use, the other group was taught breathing exercises in&#xD;
      addition to the inhaler drug use training. Patients were asked to continue the practices they&#xD;
      learned regularly for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, it was observed that shortness of&#xD;
      breath decreased and the quality of life increased in both patient groups.&#xD;

    <description>This training was given to both intervention groups. How the patients used their inhaler medication was evaluated. The steps to use the correct inhaler medication were taught sequentially. It was applied with the patient. At the end of the training, brochures prepared by the researchers were given to the patients.</description>

    <description>This training was given only to the group that received breathing exercise and inhaler training.&#xD;
Pursed lips breathing exercises were taught to the patients. Patients were asked to continue their breathing exercise for 10 minutes before using their inhaler medication.&#xD;
Thus, it was evaluated whether breathing exercises performed before using inhaler drugs provided benefit on drug effectiveness.</description>
