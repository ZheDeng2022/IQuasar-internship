      Aims: The aim of this study is to carry out a randomised crossover intervention study&#xD;
      examining the effect of two different high nitrate vegetable juices on plasma nitrate levels&#xD;
      and blood pressure (BP) in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) to conduct a pilot cross-over randomized intervention study testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the health benefits of two different high nitrate vegetable juices products&#xD;
      will be similar; 2) to measure the volunteers' BP as the primary outcome; and 3) to collect&#xD;
      biological samples over the course of this study for the measurement of proposed biomarkers&#xD;
      of nutritional status, including plasma nitrate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, it is hypothesized that oral supplementation with different vegetable juices&#xD;
      (beetroot and green leafy vegetable) juice, with similar nitrate content, over a one week&#xD;
      period, will decrease BP in healthy volunteers to a similar extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Investigation: This study will be a randomised, controlled, crossover (2 groups)&#xD;
      trial of beetroot juice and green leafy vegetable juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A total of 16 healthy volunteers will be recruited (male and female), according&#xD;
      to the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Subjects will be screened and recruited from the general population through&#xD;
      advertisement, through local community groups and staff intranet postings (university&#xD;
      setting). The investigators have established mechanisms for recruiting from these populations&#xD;
      that have proven to be effective in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Following screening, eligible participants will give informed written consent.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized, using computer-generated random numbers, to two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the intervention (one week before), participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      four day food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consume one of the stated interventions daily (in the evening) for one&#xD;
      week. Then, the participant will follow their normal diet and will not consume nitrate-rich&#xD;
      juices for two weeks (washout period). In the fourth week, participants will consume the&#xD;
      alternative intervention to that already consumed - beetroot juice or green leafy vegetables&#xD;
      juice for a further one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention products The beetroot juice will be Organic beetroot and apple juice (James&#xD;
      White Drinks Ltd, UK), while the leafy green vegetable juice will be Leanandgreen (Cold&#xD;
      Pressed Juice) composed of 30% celery, 30% cucumber, 15% romaine, 15% spinach, 5% kale, 2.5%&#xD;
      ginger and 2.5% lemon (B. Fresh, UK). Both juices are available at Sainsbury's supermarket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both juices contain 5.5 mmol nitrate with different amount of the other nutrients. 250 ml of&#xD;
      green leafy vegetable juice and 115 ml of beetroot juice will provide 5.5 mmol of nitrate&#xD;
      daily to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juices will provided to the volunteers by the researcher before the intervention week and&#xD;
      both juices will have expiry dates that are beyond the intervention duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other lifestyle practices Participants will be asked to not change any other part of their&#xD;
      diet and to keep physical activity, alcohol, and caffeine and water source normal.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to avoid using mouthwash during the intervention weeks, as this&#xD;
      can interfere with nitrate metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for one-week intervention period. Inorganic nitrate and BP will respond quickly&#xD;
      to the intervention, so a one week intervention period will be sufficiently long to ensure&#xD;
      that participants will reach a steady state with regard to nitrate status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments (for participant characterisation, in addition to primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome data collection as described) During each intervention week participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a further four day food diary. Participants will also attend the Centre for&#xD;
      Public Health (CPH) to give a blood sample and have BP measured at the start and end of each&#xD;
      intervention period. Anthropometric data (weight and height) will also be obtained by&#xD;
      standard procedures and BMI will be calculated as weight in kg divided by the squared height&#xD;
      in metres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (20 ml) will be drawn from the antecubital vein and immediately separated and&#xD;
      stored for the proposed assays detailed below. All blood samples will be stored at -70Â°C&#xD;
      until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power As this is a pilot study, power calculations have not been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS for Windows, version&#xD;
      17. A medical statistician within CPH will give statistical advice where required. Analysis&#xD;
      of this two-period crossover study will be carried out according to the Hills &amp; Armitage&#xD;
      method. If there are no significant period or carry-over effects, which will be tested for,&#xD;
      paired samples t-tests will be used to compare the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection issues: Data collected in association with this study will be anonymised and&#xD;
      archived in password-protected study databases. All biological samples collected will be&#xD;
      anonymised.&#xD;
