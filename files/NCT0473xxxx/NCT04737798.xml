  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oil pulling&quot; or &quot;oil swishing&quot; originates from ancient Ayurvedic medicine in India and now&#xD;
      practiced in other parts of the world as a form of complementary and alternative medicine. It&#xD;
      has been described as Kavalagraha or Gandhoosha in the ayurvedic texts of Charaka Samhita and&#xD;
      Sushruta Samhita. It is a procedure that involves swishing oil in the mouth a period of 15&#xD;
      min, before spitting it out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its systemic benefits, oil pulling therapy has also benefits on oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oil pulling therapy can be performed by using edible oils like sesame oil, sunflower oil&#xD;
      and coconut oil. However, there is only one study in the literature comparing the effect of&#xD;
      oil pulling therapy using coconut oil versus sesame oil on plaque-induced gingivitis and the&#xD;
      results were in favor of coconut oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to clarify the gap in the literature on this field, this study was designed to&#xD;
      compare the plaque-inhibiting effects of oil pulling therapy with sesame oil or coconut oil&#xD;
      using 4- day plaque regrowth study model.&#xD;

      The study is conducted as an observer masked, cross over design with a single-center where&#xD;
      the participants were randomly allocated to groups. Before the initiation of the study period&#xD;
      all participants underwent thorough scaling and polishing of the teeth by both hand and&#xD;
      ultrasonic instruments to remove all plaque, calculus and stain and were instructed in how to&#xD;
      maintain oral hygiene. This phase considered as a preparatory period by the end of this&#xD;
      period all participants obtained healthy gingiva clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization of the participants were provided by closed envelop system (BM). The&#xD;
      conductors of the study were blinded to the mouthrinses received by participants. The tested&#xD;
      products and regimens of use are shown in Table 1. Identical coded bottles were used to fill&#xD;
      the mouthrinses. The bottles also had stickers on explaining the usage instructions. On the&#xD;
      first day of each study period, to confirm all patients to have plaque score of 0 at the&#xD;
      baseline, erythrosine was applied to all teeth and then scaling and polishing to remove&#xD;
      plaque and extrinsic stain and disclosing of the teeth was performed. All tooth cleaning&#xD;
      applications (other rinse, chewing gum or toothbrushing / toothpaste) were forbidden for 4&#xD;
      days of study protocol and rinsing regimen was performed. The tested agents included the&#xD;
      following: 1) Sesame oil (10 ml, twice daily 15-20 minute) 2) Coconut oil (10 ml, twice daily&#xD;
      15-20 minute). Participants were instructed to perform the mouthrinsing after breakfast and&#xD;
      dinner and to avoid rinsing, eating and drinking following hour after rinsing. Even though&#xD;
      the mouthrinses were in provided identical bottles and patients were not informed about the&#xD;
      products however due to the taste and color differences of the products total subject&#xD;
      blindness could not be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 5 (Friday), each subject was scored for staining using Lobene stain index following an&#xD;
      oral soft tissue examination. Following the satin scoring erythrosine disclosing was&#xD;
      performed and Turesky et al. modification of the Quigley and Hein index was used for plaque&#xD;
      scoring. All buccal and lingual surfaces of all fully erupted permanent teeth, with the&#xD;
      exception of the third molars were scored for stain and plaque. Six sites of each teeth were&#xD;
      also used to score Gingival Index (GI) and bleeding on probing (BOP). All clinical&#xD;
      examinations were performed by a single trained and calibrated clinician (YS) who was masked&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the recording of clinical parameters, all plaque and tooth stain (if present) were&#xD;
      removed by polishing and washout period of 14 days was awaited after the second phase of the&#xD;
      study. For the washout period, the subjects were instructed to go on to their routine oral&#xD;
      hygiene habits. Following this period the procedures explained before were repeated until&#xD;
      each participant used each of the rinses for the second phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized questionnaire were filled by the participants in order to evaluate their&#xD;
      attitudes and occurrence of adverse effects with regard to the product used at the end of&#xD;
      each phase. The questions evaluated the flavor of the mouthrinse, the alteration in the taste&#xD;
      of food and drinks, the perception of the plaque reduction, the staining that the mouthrinse&#xD;
      created, the feeling to create nausea. Five point Likert type scale was used to collect the&#xD;
      responses to the questions which ranged from 1- &quot;very negative&quot; to 5- &quot;very positive&quot;&#xD;
      excluding the question about the preference of the product. At the end of each phase&#xD;
      participants were asked to bring the bottles to control the remaining mouthrinses in order to&#xD;
      control the compliance of the participants.&#xD;

    <description>plaque regrowth inhibition will be tested using the Turesky et al. 21 modification of the Quigley and Hein index.a score of 0 to 5 is assigned to each facial and lingual nonrestored surface of all the teeth except third molars, as follows: 0: No plaque; 1:Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth; 2:A thin continuos band of plaque (up to one mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth; 3: A band of plaque wider than one mm but covering less than one-third of the crown of the tooth; 4:Plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth; 5: Plaque covering two-thirds or more of the crown of the tooth. An index for the entire mouth is determined by dividing the total score by the number surfaces ( a maximum of 2 x 2 x 14 = 56 surfaces) examined.lower values means that the agent has better plaque inhbiting effect</description>
