  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed project will investigate whether a variable or a stable sleep schedule will be&#xD;
      more effective in minimizing neurobehavioural and metabolic deficits when total sleep&#xD;
      opportunity across two weeks is below the recommended sleep duration. In this&#xD;
      laboratory-based, stay-in study, 60 young adults will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups. After&#xD;
      2 nights of 8-h time-in-bed (TIB) that simulate longer sleep opportunities typical of&#xD;
      weekends, the stable short sleep group will have a 6-h TIB in each of the following 5&#xD;
      'weeknights' (8866666). The variable short sleep group (8884846) will also have a total TIB&#xD;
      of 30h during the 'weeknights', although TIB varies across the 'weeknights'. The nightly TIB&#xD;
      of the well-rested control group will be 8h (8888888). These manipulations will repeat in the&#xD;
      second week, enabling the tracking of outcome measures during recurrent weeks of sleep&#xD;
      restriction on 'weekdays' and extension on 'weekends'. A test battery assessing basic&#xD;
      cognitive functions and mood will be administered 5 times a day. A long-term memory encoding&#xD;
      task will be administered after week 1. A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain&#xD;
      scan, and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) will be conducted after the second 'weekend'&#xD;
      night and after the last 'weeknight' each week. Continuous glucose monitoring will be&#xD;
      conducted throughout the experiment. Sleep will be measured every night with polysomnography.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposed project will investigate whether a variable or a stable sleep schedule will be&#xD;
      more effective in minimizing neurobehavioural and metabolic deficits when total sleep&#xD;
      opportunity across two weeks is below the recommended sleep duration. This project involves&#xD;
      young adults aged 21 - 35. For the two weeks leading up to the stay-in study, participants'&#xD;
      sleep-wake patterns will be assessed via actigraphy and sleep diary. For the first week,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to follow their habitual sleep schedule, while in the following&#xD;
      week, the participants will be instructed to follow a specific sleep schedule with an 8-h&#xD;
      sleep opportunity each night during the 7-night period with no napping allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two weeks of actigraphy, participants will begin the 16-day in-lab protocol.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised into 1 of 3 groups. All the participants will have an 8-h&#xD;
      sleep opportunity during the first two nights (baseline nights) that simulate longer sleep&#xD;
      opportunities typical of weekends. During the next 5 'weeknights', the participant's sleep&#xD;
      opportunities will be manipulated depending on their assigned group. The stable short sleep&#xD;
      group will have a 6-h TIB in each of the following 5 'weeknights' (8866666). The variable&#xD;
      short sleep group (8884846) will also have a total TIB of 30h during the 'weeknights',&#xD;
      although TIB varies across the 'weeknights'. The nightly TIB of the well-rested control group&#xD;
      will be 8h (8888888). The same sleep schedules will be implemented in the second week. The&#xD;
      protocol will end with an 8-h sleep opportunity on night 15. For each participant, wake times&#xD;
      will remain the same (i.e., participant's own habitual wake time derived from self-report and&#xD;
      actigraphy) for all the TIBs. Thus, bedtimes will be delayed progressively with decreasing&#xD;
      TIBs for the short sleep groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A battery of cognitive tests and psychological scales (approximately 30 minutes) will be&#xD;
      administered 5 times a day at 3-hourly intervals, starting from 1.5 hours since awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A memory encoding task will be administered on Day 8 to determine whether a variable/stable&#xD;
      short sleep schedule is less disruptive to the acquisition of long-term memory. During the&#xD;
      task, participants will be presented with 160 images containing a stimulus (e.g. landscapes)&#xD;
      or no stimulus on a computer screen. Each image will be displayed for 2500ms followed by a&#xD;
      response screen to prompt participants to indicate if a stimulus was previously presented. On&#xD;
      Day 10, a randomized set of 240 images consisting of the 160 images previously shown (i.e.&#xD;
      &quot;old&quot; images) and 80 &quot;new&quot; images will be presented to participants. Participants are tested&#xD;
      on their recognition of the &quot;old images&quot; by selecting on a 5-point scale: (1) definitely did&#xD;
      not see, (2) probably did not see), (3) unsure, (4) probably saw, (5) definitely saw. The two&#xD;
      tasks will take approximately 25 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An OGTT and fMRI brain scan will be performed after the second baseline night 2 (Day 3) and&#xD;
      the last 'weeknight' each week (Day 8 and 15). Participants will be asked to perform 8 hours&#xD;
      of overnight fasting before each OGTT. On the morning of the OGTT, an intravenous catheter&#xD;
      will be inserted into the forearm of participants. Thereafter, 6 mL of blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn in a lying/sitting position. Participants will then be given a 75-g glucose solution to&#xD;
      finish drinking within 7-10mins. 6 mL of blood samples will be collected again at time 15,&#xD;
      30, 60, and 120 minutes to measure for changes in glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to OGTT, the investigators will be using continuous glucose monitoring to measure&#xD;
      glucose responses to the various sleep schedule throughout the 16-day study via a glucose&#xD;
      sensor applied to the back of the participants' upper arms. To ensure the validity of the&#xD;
      continuous glucose data, the investigators will provide three main meals each day to the&#xD;
      participants, except on the OGTT days when only lunch and dinner will be provided. The&#xD;
      portion of the food provided each day will ensure that each participant will consume the&#xD;
      daily calorie and macronutrient requirement, and thus, the participant will not gain or lose&#xD;
      weight during the study. Participants will be required to finish all the food provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the fMRI brain scans, resting-state and task-related brain activity will be recorded.&#xD;
      During part of the scan, participants will be required to perform the gradual onset&#xD;
      continuous performance task (Esterman et al., 2013) wherein participants will be presented&#xD;
      with grayscale photographs of different scenes (e.g. mountain and city scenes) in a random&#xD;
      manner. Each scene is presented for 1600ms with a 800ms overlap with an interpolated&#xD;
      transitions. Participants will then be instructed to press a button if a particular scene is&#xD;
      identified (e.g. city scene), and withhold their responses to other scenes. Before the task,&#xD;
      participants will be given the opportunity to get familiarised with the images and have a&#xD;
      1-minute practice session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep macro-structure (i.e., the duration of various sleep stages) and micro-structure (such&#xD;
      as SWA) will be measured with polysomnography (PSG) every night. Electrodes will also be&#xD;
      affixed to the participant's scalp for electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, around the&#xD;
      eyes for electrooculographic (EOG) recording, under the chin for electromyographic (EMG)&#xD;
      recording, and on the chest for electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Pulse oximetry, a&#xD;
      non-invasive method that employs a light sensor on a finger cuff, is used in the first&#xD;
      baseline night for oxygen saturation measurement to verify that the participants do not&#xD;
      suffer from sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 16-day in-lab protocol, participants will not be allowed to leave the lab&#xD;
      premises or engage in any strenuous exercise. When there are no research procedures being&#xD;
      carried out, participants are free to spend their spare time on any activity, with the&#xD;
      exception of napping, exercising, or activities that requires the participants to leave the&#xD;
      lab premises. Participants will be under constant supervision by the research staff.&#xD;
