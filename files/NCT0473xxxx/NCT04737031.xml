      The main purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;nudges&quot; to&#xD;
      clinicians, to patients, or to both in increasing Tobacco Use Treatment Service (TUTS)&#xD;
      referral and engagement; and to explore clinician, patient, inner setting (e.g., clinic), and&#xD;
      outer setting (e.g., payment structures) mechanisms related to TUTS referral and engagement.&#xD;
      The investigators will employ rapid-cycle approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to&#xD;
      clinicians and patients prior to initiating the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual&#xD;
      factors and mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a four-arm pragmatic cluster randomize clinical trial to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both in&#xD;
      increasing TUTS referral and engagement in cancer patients who smoke, vs. usual care (UC).&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that each of the implementation strategy arms will&#xD;
      significantly increase TUTS referral and engagement compared to UC and that the combination&#xD;
      of nudges to clinicians and to patients will be the most effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continued tobacco smoking negatively impacts survival among patients with cancer. Routinely&#xD;
      delivered evidence-based tobacco use treatment (TUT) would minimize cancer-specific and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, reduce treatment-related toxicity, and improve quality of life. About&#xD;
      50% of cancer patients who smoked prior to their diagnosis continue to smoke after diagnosis&#xD;
      and during treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology, and American Association for Cancer Research, call for implementation of TUT within&#xD;
      oncology care. In 2015, TUT received an &quot;A&quot; recommendation from the US Preventive Services&#xD;
      Task Force, given the high level of certainty of resulting benefit. The approval specifically&#xD;
      focused on clinicians asking all adults about smoking, prescribing FDA-approved cessation&#xD;
      medications for smokers, and offering appropriate behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the importance of TUT, only half of cancer centers consistently identify patient&#xD;
      tobacco use, and few cancer centers employ systematic mechanisms to refer patients to&#xD;
      evidence-based cessation services. Acknowledging this gap, the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) launched the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) as part of the Moonshot to help&#xD;
      centers develop effective ways to identify and engage patients who smoke. Penn ISC3 MPI Dr.&#xD;
      Schnoll was a member of the NCI advisory board that developed this initiative, and Penn&#xD;
      Medicine's Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) was in the first funded cohort. Because clinician&#xD;
      expertise in TUT is a known barrier, the initial strategy used an automatic &quot;default&quot;&#xD;
      electronic medical record (EMR) referral to the ACC Tobacco Use Treatment Service (TUTS).&#xD;
      Engagement increased, but clinicians turned off the default 60% of the time, implicating&#xD;
      additional important barriers to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to produce dramatic change within oncology by refining and testing&#xD;
      implementation strategies informed by behavioral economics. The investigators' work has&#xD;
      identified specific cognitive biases among clinicians and patients that prevent TUTS referral&#xD;
      and engagement, including clinician pessimism regarding the ability to help patients stop&#xD;
      using tobacco, misconceptions about patient resistance to treatment, and implicit biases&#xD;
      regarding the capacity for patients to volitionally alter the course of illness. These&#xD;
      motivators are related to clinician willingness to invest effort in help giving and may&#xD;
      prevent acquisition of new knowledge and skills. From the patient perspective, several&#xD;
      studies identify unique challenges that individuals with cancer face when engaging in tobacco&#xD;
      cessation efforts, including low self-efficacy, low perceived benefits of quitting, and&#xD;
      perceived risk of treatment. Thus, this study focuses on addressing these barriers, in a&#xD;
      pragmatic and innovative way, to increase TUTS referral and engagement in cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;nudges&quot; to clinicians, to&#xD;
      patients, or to both in increasing in TUTS referral and engagement; and to explore clinician,&#xD;
      patient, inner setting (e.g., clinic), and outer setting (e.g., payment structures)&#xD;
      mechanisms related to TUTS referral and engagement. The investigators will employ rapid-cycle&#xD;
      approaches to optimize the framing of nudges to clinicians and patients prior to initiating&#xD;
      the trial and mixed methods to explore contextual factors and mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct this study with 100 clinicians and 900 smokers across Penn&#xD;
      Medicine's ACC. They expect the study to yield essential insights into the effectiveness of&#xD;
      nudges as an implementation strategy to speed the uptake of high value evidence-based TUT&#xD;
      within cancer care, and to advance the understanding of the multilevel contextual factors&#xD;
      that drive response to these strategies. These results will lay the foundation for how cancer&#xD;
      care settings can ensure that patients with cancer who smoke are engaged with evidence-based&#xD;
      TUT and may lead to a future R01 focused on scaling-up this approach across other cancer&#xD;
      centers involved in the C3I.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will use the Best Practice Alert functionality within the EMR as the conduit to the point of decision-making. Epic currently &quot;fires&quot; a BPA for each new patient presenting to ACC within the Medical Assistant check-in and vital sign workflow, requiring that medical assistants assess tobacco use status within the past 30 days and satisfy the alert with one of three possible answers. Upon opening the Epic Order tab at a patient's next Repeat Visit after the Index Visit, clinicians will receive the implementation strategy, placed directly over the order interface. The clinician will be required to &quot;acknowledge&quot; or &quot;opt-out&quot; when presented with the order. Opting-out will require clinicians to acknowledge a reason for opt-out using a checklist or free text. Upon a clinician's decision to opt-out, the BPA will fire at up to two subsequent Repeat Visits.</description>
