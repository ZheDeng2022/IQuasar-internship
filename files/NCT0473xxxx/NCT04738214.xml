      This study is aimed to develop a genome-based platform to predict patients who can achieve&#xD;
      pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
      The main treatments for locally advanced rectal cancer is surgical removal such as lower&#xD;
      anterior resection after neoadjuvant CCRT. About 10-40% of patients showed pathologic&#xD;
      complete response after neoadjuvant CCRT. Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG) is used to&#xD;
      grade the histologic tumor response after neoadjuvant treatment. TRG 1 represents the&#xD;
      pathologic complete response and TRG2 as histologically small group of cancer cells.&#xD;
      Accordingly, TRG1 and 2 are expressed as good responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the surgery is being performed as an essential treatment, there are various&#xD;
      surgery-related sequelae such as colostomy. Also, in some patients, surgery may be refused or&#xD;
      surgery may not be performed due to an underlying disease. About 15-20% of local recurrence&#xD;
      was reported in patients who did not undergo surgery and the 3-year survival rate was 96.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer genetically can be divided into 4-subtypes. With the recent development of&#xD;
      genome testing technology, genome analysis has been actively conducted in colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      The most commonly known genetic subtype of colorectal cancer is classified into a total of 4&#xD;
      types as consensus molecular subtype (CMS); CMS1, CMS2, CMS3, CMS4. However, this was&#xD;
      analyzed in colorectal cancer patients who did not undergo radiotherapy. There is no data&#xD;
      regarding the response to radiation therapy according to each genetic subtype. Therefore,&#xD;
      classifying the subtypes through genomic analysis and studying the responsiveness to&#xD;
      radiotherapy in each subtype is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to develop a platform that predicts pathologic tumor response after&#xD;
      CCRT based on genomic information. Furthermore, being able to select patients who can&#xD;
      wait-and-see without surgery using platform.&#xD;

      The treatment in this study is one of the standard treatments suggested by the NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines. The patients received operation after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      and pathologic tumor response is evaluated. Before neoadjuvant treatment, the following are&#xD;
      obtained; Medical history and physical examination, Tissue acquisition through colonoscopy,&#xD;
      Blood Test (CBC), Chemistry Test (SMA), staging through pelvic CT or MRI, PET-CT or chest CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either 5-FU/leucovorin and Capecitabine based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is conducted. The&#xD;
      target delineation is performed in 3mm simulation CT for radiotherapy. GTV includes primary&#xD;
      lesions ,lymph nodes and mesorectum based on diagnostic CT, MRI, and PET-CT. CTV covers the&#xD;
      perirectal and internal pelvic lymph node with microscopic margin of GTV. PTV1 is defined as&#xD;
      extending 0.3cm from the GTV. PTV2 is defined as extending 0.5 from CTV. Radiotherapy is&#xD;
      performed using 3D conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric&#xD;
      modulated Arc therapy. Radiotherapy is administered daily, five times a week according to the&#xD;
      NCCN guidelines. Each treatment is performed with full bladder and prone positioning.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is performed 25 fractions with simultaneous integrated boost method. 2.00Gy is&#xD;
      administered for PTV1 while 1.8 Gy is administered for PTV2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation is performed 5-12 weeks after CCRT. If the patients refuse, physicians do not&#xD;
      perform surgery and undergo wait-and-see. The treatment response is evaluated based on&#xD;
      standard treatment process. During the treatment, the regular check up is conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the acute toxicity regarding treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acquired specimens are used for RNA sequencing and organoid construction. The RNA&#xD;
      sequencing is used to analyze the differentially expressed based on treatment response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

        Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer are subject to this trial. The patients&#xD;
        undergo endoscopic biopsy and receive neoadjuvant CCRT and surgery. In case that pathologic&#xD;
        CR status obtained after CCRT, no additional treatment is performed. Patients without&#xD;
        pathologic CR status are treated with adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
