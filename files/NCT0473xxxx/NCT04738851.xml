  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the cerebral activation during Classic Mirror&#xD;
      Therapy (TMC) and especially during Virtual Mirror Therapy (TMV) in healthy subjects. It&#xD;
      seems that the precuneus is involved in the effectiveness of mirror therapy. One goal of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if there is a better activation of the precuneus during TMV than during&#xD;
      TMC. Others goals are to compare cerebral activation during three different tasks (TMV, TMC&#xD;
      and a simple motor task), to study the intra-subjects reproducibility of the measurement and&#xD;
      the correlation between cerebral activation and feelings of the participants about the&#xD;
      efficacity of the tasks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mirror therapy is a rehabilitation technique that has been shown to be effective in restoring&#xD;
      upper limb motor skills in patients with stroke. However, it comes up against certain&#xD;
      constraints of clinical use such as installation difficulties or the obligation of&#xD;
      symmetrical bilateral work. These constraints can be limited by the use of so-called 2nd&#xD;
      generation virtual mirror therapy technologies. It is therefore likely that these new&#xD;
      technologies will improve the feasibility and effectiveness of mirror therapy in&#xD;
      rehabilitation. While the brain mechanisms involved in mirror therapy are not yet fully&#xD;
      understood, the involvement of the precuneus has been demonstrated by a booming imaging&#xD;
      method: fNIRS (functional Near Infra Red Spectroscopy). This method allows (like fMRI) to&#xD;
      study cerebral neurovascular coupling. It is based on the fact that an activated region of&#xD;
      the brain increases its local blood flow. Oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR)&#xD;
      absorb infrared light and it is then possible to identify the cortical regions of the brain&#xD;
      involved in a given task. This technique therefore makes it possible to study brain&#xD;
      activation under more ecological conditions than fMRI and is therefore particularly suitable&#xD;
      for exploring rehabilitation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to study and compare in healthy subjects, using a fNIRS apparatus, the&#xD;
      brain regions involved in the performance of a classic mirror therapy task and a virtual&#xD;
      mirror therapy task with the IVS3 (Intensive Visual Simulation) apparatus (Dessintey&#xD;
      Technology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigations will be carried out by the principal investigator or by specialized&#xD;
      technicians from the neurology functional exploration department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each acquisition has a duration of 620 seconds, it begins with a rest period of 120 seconds,&#xD;
      which corresponds to the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each condition the movements are performed at a frequency of 0.5 Hz which seems to be the&#xD;
      optimal frequency for observing cortical activation using a metronome. Each movement is&#xD;
      therefore performed 10 times per block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of placing the various conditions will be balanced. Between periods of movement,&#xD;
      the subject is in a resting position for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;movement&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; instructions are given at the start of each phase. The entire test&#xD;
      will be repeated one week apart to assess the reproducibility of the measurements in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has 3 conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A virtual TM task (TMV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A classic TM task (TMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control task (TC) Healthy subjects participating in the study will have two different&#xD;
           acquisition times, each comprising 3 conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruiting the subjects, the study investigator will check the inclusion and&#xD;
      non-inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject can integrate the protocol, the two acquisition stages will then be scheduled&#xD;
      one week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the first acquisition, the subject will present to the neurology department at&#xD;
      the time of his appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of the 3 conditions will then be randomized to avoid potential biases linked to the&#xD;
      sequence of conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the fNIRS acquisition headset (Brite 24) will be installed by a specialized technician&#xD;
      and the procurement instructions will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acquisition under the 3 conditions is then carried out: TC1, TMC1, TMV1 with a rest time&#xD;
      of 10 minutes between each condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's feelings after the TMC and TMV conditions will be evaluated using the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS). 0 corresponding to a zero feeling and 10 to a very important feeling.&#xD;
      The subject will be explained that the feeling could correspond to tingling sensations, a&#xD;
      desire to mobilize the hand which is behind the mirror, a &quot;disturbing&quot;, &quot;bizarre&quot; sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The helmet is only removed at the end of the 3 spots The subject returns a week later for the&#xD;
      2nd acquisition phase during which the same acquisitions as during the 1st meeting are&#xD;
      carried out and then participation in the study is terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will therefore be 6 tests for each healthy subject.&#xD;
