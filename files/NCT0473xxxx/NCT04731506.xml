    <textblock>
      Addressing childhood obesity risk factors like home environment, parental roles, excess&#xD;
      weight, physical activity, and healthy eating among Latinos/Hispanic (L/H) families living in&#xD;
      rural communities is an important priority. This study proposes to use cultural adaptation&#xD;
      and implementation science frameworks to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a culturally&#xD;
      appropriate family-based childhood obesity (FBCO) program via an automated telephone system&#xD;
      (IVR) to L/H families living in rural Nebraska. We will conduct a mixed-methods feasibility&#xD;
      trial for L/H families with overweight or obese children. In Aim 1, we will first&#xD;
      collaboratively adapt all intervention materials to better fit the rural L/H community&#xD;
      profile, including translation of materials to Spanish, inclusion of culturally relevant&#xD;
      content and images, and use of health communication strategies to address different levels of&#xD;
      health literacy. Then, we will evaluate the cultural relevance, suitability, and usability of&#xD;
      the adapted intervention materials and mode of delivery. In Aim 2, we will randomly assign&#xD;
      participant dyads (parent and child) to either Family Connections (n=29) or a waitlist&#xD;
      standard-care group (n=29) and determine overall study reach, preliminary effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing child BMI z- scores, potential for program adoption, implementation, and&#xD;
      sustainability through local health departments (RE-AIM outcomes). We will also evaluate&#xD;
      health department perceptions of i-PARIHS constructs (innovation, context, recipient&#xD;
      characteristics), and Family Connections participants' view of the intervention (i.e.,&#xD;
      relative advantage, observability, trialability, complexity, compatibility). In conclusion,&#xD;
      the study will answer three important questions: (1) Is a telephone delivered FBCO program in&#xD;
      rural Nebraska culturally relevant, usable and acceptable by L/H families? (2) Is a telephone&#xD;
      delivered FBCO program effective at reducing BMI z-scores in L/H children living in rural&#xD;
      Nebraska? and (3) What real-world institutional and contextual factors influence the impact&#xD;
      of the intervention and might affect its potential ability to sustainably engage a meaningful&#xD;
      population of L/H families who stand to benefit? This project will generate locally and&#xD;
      globally relevant evidence on a culturally appropriate technology-delivered FBCO intervention&#xD;
      for L/H families in rural communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos/Hispanics are the fastest growing population group in rural areas and their childhood&#xD;
      obesity rate is 60% higher than their non-Hispanic neighbors. Family-based childhood obesity&#xD;
      (FBCO) interventions targeting parents have shown promising results for reducing weight among&#xD;
      children. However, these interventions are developed and evaluated with culturally&#xD;
      homogeneous samples of patients and have been poorly accessed by L/H families living in rural&#xD;
      communities. The majority of FBCO programs have been based in large urban areas and do not&#xD;
      address geographically underserved audiences or settings and might not be optimal for&#xD;
      patients who are culturally diverse. There are a number of barriers to accessing these&#xD;
      interventions in rural communities. Health departments in rural Nebraska have reported&#xD;
      increasing health disparities and limited available resources, shortage of available health&#xD;
      professionals, and the existence of demographically and geographically segregated communities&#xD;
      as barriers to offer these programs. Community members have reported that family and work&#xD;
      responsibilities, lack of public transportation, language and cultural relevance have kept&#xD;
      them from engaging in these programs. Interactive technologies may provide a possible&#xD;
      solution to these challenges in that they offer an avenue for the delivery of FBCO&#xD;
      interventions at times and places convenient to participants. Our team has found that a&#xD;
      technology-assisted FBCO intervention can lead to significant weight loss among children and&#xD;
      that over 82% of L/Hs in our studies have mobile devices and use it regularly for telephone&#xD;
      usage and access information. Given the growing usage of mobile technologies by all&#xD;
      populations, including L/Hs, and the potential promise of technology-assisted interventions,&#xD;
      it is surprising that to date there have been no reports of FBCO interventions using mobile&#xD;
      technology targeting L/H families living in rural areas. Thus, telephone systems that provide&#xD;
      automated (i.e., interactive voice response (IVR) system) FBCO messages may be practical&#xD;
      methods for delivering culturally appropriate health information and engaging L/Hs families&#xD;
      in rural communities. Family Connections (FC) is a scalable intervention that uses IVR to&#xD;
      deliver FBCO content; however, it was not specifically developed for rural L/H families. The&#xD;
      goal of this application is to culturally adapt and determine the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      FBCO content using IVR technology to L/H families in rural Nebraska. This study is&#xD;
      significant by addressing risk factors with a high burden among L/H children, where knowledge&#xD;
      regarding efficacious interventions and adaptations is substantial; yet have not demonstrated&#xD;
      the ability to attract a large representative sample of L/H families and be sustained in&#xD;
      rural communities. It builds on our team's extensive experience in (1) the use of interactive&#xD;
      technologies to deliver FBCO content and promote healthy behaviors and weight control; (2)&#xD;
      culturally adapting interventions; (3) working collaboratively with stakeholders in a variety&#xD;
      of settings. Building on this experience and guided by implementation science models (RE-AIM&#xD;
      and i-PARIHS) we will use a mixed-method collaborative process to culturally adapt and test&#xD;
      FC. This proposal is innovative by using cultural adaptation and implementation science&#xD;
      models to evaluate the feasibility of delivering FBCO content via an IVR system to L/H&#xD;
      parents of obese children in rural Nebraska. This application allow us to address existing&#xD;
      participation and setting barriers while capitalizing on the preferences of our target&#xD;
      population. Our primary specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To culturally adapt and determine the relevance, acceptability, and usability of a&#xD;
      culturally adapted technology-delivered FBCO intervention for L/H families in rural Nebraska.&#xD;
      Applying an iterative collaborative process, we will use a mixed-methods approach to&#xD;
      culturally adapt FC to better fit the rural L/H community profile. A Community Workgroup&#xD;
      facilitated by our rural partner organizations in Nebraska with a high population of L/H&#xD;
      residents and theory-and data-driven approach using structured community input adaptation&#xD;
      process will be conducted to develop and evaluate the relevance (ecological validity and&#xD;
      equivalence), acceptability, and usability of all the adaptations made. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      this process will lead to a program that is relevant, acceptable, and usable by L/H families&#xD;
      in rural communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a technology-delivered&#xD;
      FBCO intervention for L/H families in rural Nebraska using RE-AIM and i-PARIHS. We will&#xD;
      randomly assign participants to either FC (n=29) or a waitlist standard-care (SC) group&#xD;
      (n=29) and determine overall study reach, preliminary effectiveness in reducing child BMI&#xD;
      z-scores, potential for program adoption, implementation, and sustainability through local&#xD;
      health departments (RE-AIM outcomes). SC participants will receive a workbook. FC&#xD;
      participants will receive a workbook, 2 in person group sessions followed by 10 IVR calls&#xD;
      over a period of 6 months. We hypothesize that a culturally adapted FC program will lead to a&#xD;
      higher engagement (reach, retention and completion), significant higher proportion of L/H&#xD;
      children reducing their BMIz scores at 6 months when compared to SC group, align (social&#xD;
      validity) with health department perceptions of i-PARIHS constructs (Innovation, context,&#xD;
      recipient characteristics), and that FC participants will view the intervention positively&#xD;
      (i.e. relative advantage, observability, trialability, complexity, compatibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will generate locally and globally relevant evidence on culturally appropriate&#xD;
      technology- delivered FBCO intervention for L/H families in rural communities. Given the&#xD;
      rapidly growing population of L/Hs in the USA, it is also immediately relevant to the health&#xD;
      of the US population.&#xD;
