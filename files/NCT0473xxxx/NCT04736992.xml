      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the health problems of patients presenting in primary care is crucial to&#xD;
      understanding the health of the general community for the planning and allocation of health&#xD;
      care resources. Practice-based morbidity studies conducted in primary care settings have&#xD;
      proven to be helpful in documentation of disease prevalence and for service planning. With&#xD;
      the change in morbidity pattern and the aging population, our study will help to inform&#xD;
      primary health care policy and guide work force and service planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective practice-based study of health problems presenting in primary care.&#xD;
      Doctors who agree to participate in the study will record the health problem and type of&#xD;
      management performed in consecutive patient encounters for one of the designated weeks during&#xD;
      each season over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will be analysed by descriptive statistics, comparison with data from previous&#xD;
      morbidity study, and by non-linear mixed effects for factors associated with morbidity and&#xD;
      management patterns in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will will 1) provide evidence to support the allocation of resources to continue and&#xD;
      to expand primary care initiatives that support the provision of quality chronic disease care&#xD;
      in private sector, 2) enable continued surveillance of the morbidity trends in Hong Kong by&#xD;
      providing data for comparison with past and future studies, and 3) inform the content of&#xD;
      educational curricula for medical and health care students and practitioners to prepare them&#xD;
      to better meet the needs of the community.&#xD;
