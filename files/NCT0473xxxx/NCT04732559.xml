      The primary aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - investigate the general attitudes towards surrogacy among Polish population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the differences in attitudes towards traditional vs. gestational surrogacy among&#xD;
           Polish population,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the cognitive concerns about issues related to surrogacy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the acceptance of surrogate parenthood,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the attitude towards the surrogate mother,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify factors that influence the attitudes towards surrogacy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine if there are differences in attitudes among members of the general public,&#xD;
           health care professionals, students (health/medical studies vs. non-medical studies) and&#xD;
           people with infertility diagnosis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General attitudes towards surrogacy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>General attitudes towards surrogacy survey was constructed on the basis of a literature review and other existing questionnaires or surveys. The survey consists of 20 items. The opinion is indicated by using seven-point Likert-type scale (1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). For most items a higher score indicates a more positive attitude towards surrogacy. To prevent acquiescence response bias, 5 items were reversed. Total score was obtained by summing the items, ranging from 20 to 140. The cut off point is 80, the score below 80 indicates more negative attitude towards surrogacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Attitudes to Surrogate Parenthood Questionnaire (ASPQ) constructed by Constantinidis D., Roger Cook (2012). The opinion was indicated by using seven-point Likert-type scale (1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree). One item included yes/no answer.</description>

    <measure>The Cognitive Concerns About Issues Related to Surrogacy Scale (CCAIRSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Attitudes to Surrogate Parenthood Questionnaire (ASPQ) constructed by Constantinidis D., Roger Cook (2012). The Cognitive Concerns About Issues Related to Surrogacy Scale (CCAIRSS) was used in order to examine the level of concerns and different complications associated to traditional and gestational surrogacy. Participants use five-point Likert-type scale to express how much they agree with each statement. Total score was obtained by summing the items, ranging from 15 to 75. High scores reflected smaller surrogacy-related concers and low scores reflected greater surrogacy-related concerns (Constantinidis, Cook, 2012).</description>
