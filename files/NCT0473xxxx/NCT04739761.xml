  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is open-label, multicenter, international study, assessing the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in participants with or without brain metastasis (BMs), with&#xD;
      previously-treated advanced/metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer whose disease has&#xD;
      progressed on prior anti-HER2-based regimens and who received no more than 2 lines/regimens&#xD;
      of therapy in the metastatic setting (excluding tucatinib).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 500 eligible participants will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts (250&#xD;
      participants in each cohort) according to the presence or absence of BMs at baseline. Cohort&#xD;
      1 will include participants without BM at baseline and Cohort 2 will consist of participants&#xD;
      with BM at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study intervention discontinuation, all participants will undergo an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit (within 7 days of discontinuation) and will be followed up for safety assessments 40 (+&#xD;
      up to 7) days after the discontinuation of all study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed up for survival status and duration of treatment on&#xD;
      subsequent therapies after intervention discontinuation every 3 months (± 14 days) from the&#xD;
      date of the safety follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, as&#xD;
      per defined in the protocol.&#xD;
