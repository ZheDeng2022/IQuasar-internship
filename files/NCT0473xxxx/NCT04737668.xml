      The aim of the current study is to explore the effect of virtual reality on pain in children&#xD;
      who undergo an intrathecal pump refill compared to usual care and distraction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) is a technological rehabilitation tool that allows the user to&#xD;
      experience the interaction with a computer-generated environment. It may provide some&#xD;
      advantages over conventional care: it allows the simulation of realistic environments and&#xD;
      patients feel more motivated by this kind of virtual environment. VR constitutes an enriched&#xD;
      environment with augmented multiple sensory feedbacks (auditory, visual, tactile VR enriched&#xD;
      environment) that has already shown some efficiency in reducing chronic pain. There is&#xD;
      mounting evidence from acute pain conditions, such as wound care, that VR could play a role&#xD;
      as an additional treatment method to relieve pain A possible explanation for its mechanism of&#xD;
      action is provided by &quot;the gate-theory of attention&quot;. VR reduces the perception of pain by&#xD;
      diverting attention away from the pain. Most children experience pain and fear when receiving&#xD;
      a medical treatment; two feelings which are closely related and affecting one another.&#xD;
      Moreover, children often describe procedures involving needles as the most stressful portion&#xD;
      of the hospital experience. Children who have been implanted with an intrathecal baclofen&#xD;
      (ITB) pump, need to come to the hospital for a refill approximately every 3 months, depending&#xD;
      on the exact dose. During the refill, the physician places a needle directly into the&#xD;
      reservoir to refill the pump. To alleviate the pain and fear with these refill procedures, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that VR could alleviate pain and make these refills more feasible. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to evaluate whether VR is reducing pain during a refill procedure,&#xD;
      in children receiving intrathecal drug delivery compared to usual care.&#xD;
