    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the antalgic effect of Puressentiel Joints and Muscles -&#xD;
      Gel with 14 essential oils for 12 weeks on knee joint pain in 45 patients suffering from&#xD;
      chronic pain related to arthritis of the knee. The evaluation of the puressentiel antalgic&#xD;
      effect Joints and Muscles - Gel with 14 essential oils will be done by an algo-functional&#xD;
      score of WOMAC based on items of pain, joint stiffness and locomotor function (main&#xD;
      criterion), a visual analog scale EVA (graduated from 1 to 10) of the pain by self-assessment&#xD;
      of the patient during the consultation and the number of daily analgesics and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (secondary criteria).&#xD;

      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the antalgic effect of Puressentiel Joints and Muscles -&#xD;
      Gel with 14 essential oils for 12 weeks on knee joint pain in 45 patients suffering from&#xD;
      chronic pain related to arthritis of the knee. The patients included in the study will be&#xD;
      consultants from the Department of Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Sports Trauma at&#xD;
      Foch Hospital in Suresnes and will have to present chronic pain related to arthritis of the&#xD;
      knee either with or without antalgic and anti-inflammatory treatment. The evaluation of the&#xD;
      puressentiel antalgic effect Joints and Muscles - Gel with 14 essential oils will be&#xD;
      evaluated by an algo-functional score of WOMAC based on items of pain, joint stiffness and&#xD;
      locomotor function (main criterion), a visual analog scale EVA (graduated from 1 to 10) of&#xD;
      the pain by self-assessment of the patient during each visit and the number of daily antalgic&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory drugs (secondary criteria).&#xD;
