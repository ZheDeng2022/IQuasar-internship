      This study aims to study, in patient with Parkinson's disease, mild to moderate stage&#xD;
      (according to Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's Disease,&#xD;
      Postuma et al., 2015):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the evolution of oculomotricity markers over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation between neurological evaluations (motor and non-motor scores),&#xD;
           neuropsychological evaluations (cognitive disorders) and oculomotricity evaluation, over&#xD;
           a follow-up period of 7 years.&#xD;
