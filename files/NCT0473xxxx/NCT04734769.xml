  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most remarkable improvements in trophoectoderm cells biopsy is the robustness of&#xD;
      diagnosis as result of analyzing multiple cells. However, there is a proportion of embryos&#xD;
      that lack of diagnosis due to amplification failure or inconclusive results ranging between&#xD;
      0,4% and 6%. Information about embryo repeated biopsy after an inconclusive result in a first&#xD;
      biopsy is very scarce. No specific conclusions can be drawn, due to the limited information&#xD;
      currently available concerning reproductive outcomes for patients who had embryo transfer&#xD;
      after a second biopsy, due to a first one having an inconclusive result. Investigators&#xD;
      purpose a multicenter retrospective observational study with the aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      reproductive potential of re-biopsied blastocyst with inconclusive results on preimplantation&#xD;
      genetic screening for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using the implantation rate (IR) and ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy rate (OPR) as principal variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) is to achieve a healthy live&#xD;
      newborn. The selection of an euploid embryo using PGT-A, offers theoretical advantages&#xD;
      including increased implantation rate, reduced abortion rate, and reduces the time to achieve&#xD;
      an ongoing pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain advances in ART such as vitrification or improvement in culture media makes safer the&#xD;
      PGT-A procedure. As a result of these improvements, embryo biopsy has been driven from&#xD;
      blastomere to trophectoderm biopsy at blastocyst stage for preimplantional genetic testing&#xD;
      for aneuploidy analysis (PGT-A 2.0) and it is now the method of choice for PGT-A in many&#xD;
      centers. Trophectoderm biopsy presents advantages over the use of blastomere biopsy: 1. It&#xD;
      allows obtaining around 6-10 cells without reducing the potential for pre-embryo development&#xD;
      or its ability to implant. 2. Greater strength in the results, since it reduces false&#xD;
      diagnoses associated with factors such as mosaicism. 3. It allows a combined study for&#xD;
      monogenic mutations, aneuploidy screening and / or structural alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of inconclusive results in PGT-A varies depending on the embryonic stage used,&#xD;
      with values of 9-10% of the total embryos analyzed for single blastomere biopsy and between&#xD;
      2-6% when trophectoderm cells are biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These inconclusive results, mainly in couples without euploid embryos available to transfer,&#xD;
      cause them uncertainty and disappointment. In these situations, it is advisable to guide&#xD;
      patients in making decisions about what to do with these pre-embryos through genetic&#xD;
      counselling. Patients must decide if they wish to reject them, to transfer them without the&#xD;
      certainty of a reliable diagnosis or to re-analyze them. Scientific literature reporting&#xD;
      these types of inconclusive results and that give advice about its possible etiology are&#xD;
      scarce. There is no clear evidence about the impact of double biopsy, double&#xD;
      vitrification-warming or if transferring embryos with inconclusive results, is safe for&#xD;
      achieving a healthy newborn. The objective of this review is to learn from the published&#xD;
      studies about the safety of embryo re-analysis and its potential reproductive outcome when&#xD;
      there are embryos with inconclusive results after PGT, in order to offer adequate counselling&#xD;
      for patients.&#xD;
