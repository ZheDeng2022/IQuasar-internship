  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab when given in&#xD;
      combination with nab-paclitaxel as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with muscle-invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (MIBC) prior to cystectomy or complete TURBT. Patients will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment with tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      3 treatment cycles over 9 weeks followed by standard radical cystectomy or complete TURBT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suitable and planned for complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical&#xD;
             cystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Histopathologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma. Patients with mixed histologies&#xD;
             are required to have a dominant (i.e. 50% at least) urothelial cell pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;

             T2-4aN1-3M0, it must be judged by the investigator. If it is judged that radical&#xD;
             surgery can still be performed, it can be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             mutation burden, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
