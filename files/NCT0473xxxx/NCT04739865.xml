  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent open label study of the effects of psilocybin in participants with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) showed rapid significant decrease of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      after treatment with psilocybin coupled with psychological support. Over 40% of participants&#xD;
      sustained response at 3 months. In this study, the aim is to explore effectiveness of 25 mg&#xD;
      of psilocybin as an adjunctive therapy in participants with TRD.&#xD;
