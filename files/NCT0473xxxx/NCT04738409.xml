      The objective was&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to check whether serum androgen levels and concomitant metabolic changes, oxidative&#xD;
           stress and inflammation in adolescent girls with hyperandrogenism may be related to&#xD;
           diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify the factors that increase the risk of being overweight and of obesity among&#xD;
           adolescents with clinical features of PCOS, related to diet and DEA (Disordered Eating&#xD;
           Attitudes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the relationships between markers of oxidation and markers of Systemic&#xD;
           Inflammation and macronutrients intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to assess the relation between oral health of girls with PCOS (including condition of&#xD;
           periodontium and dental caries) and their dietary habits, hormonal, metabolic and&#xD;
           oxidative and inflammatory status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperandrogenism in women is a state of increased androgen production, manifested by&#xD;
      irregular menstrual cycles, a more frequent incidence of infertility, metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as acne and hirsutism. In addition to ovulation&#xD;
      disorders and the multifollicular ovaries structure in an ultrasound examination,&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism is a typical clinical feature of the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which&#xD;
      is diagnosed in approximately 8.6% of adolescent girls. Excessive body weight makes it&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose at an early stage of the disease and intensifies metabolic and hormonal&#xD;
      disorders, as well as those related to oxidative stress and inflammation of the body. Some&#xD;
      research studies suggest that PCOS may negatively affect oral health of women, increasing the&#xD;
      risk of periodontal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this research was to check whether serum androgen levels and concomitant&#xD;
      metabolic changes, oxidative stress and inflammation in adolescent girls with&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism may be related to diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to identify the factors that increase the risk of being overweight&#xD;
      and of obesity among adolescents with clinical features of PCOS, related to diet and&#xD;
      DEA(Disordered Eating Attitudes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective was also to investigate the relationships between markers of oxidation and&#xD;
      markers of Systemic Inflammation and macronutrients intake, such as carbohydrates and fiber,&#xD;
      protein (animal, plant), fats and cholesterol in normal and overweight/obese girls with&#xD;
      clinical features of PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators would like to evaluate the relation between oral health of&#xD;
      girls with PCOS (including condition of periodontium and dental caries) and their dietary&#xD;
      habits, hormonal, metabolic and oxidative and inflammatory status.&#xD;
