  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of sugary beverages with&#xD;
      adverse health effects, experimental studies have demonstrated that the metabolic response of&#xD;
      the human body to fruit juice as compared to artificial beverages is substantially different.&#xD;
      Fruit juices do not just provide sugars and related calories, but they are rich sources of&#xD;
      bioactive compounds especially of flavonoids. Flavanones constitute a class of flavonoids&#xD;
      that are specifically and abundantly found in citrus fruits, with hesperidin being the major&#xD;
      compound in orange. From prospective cohort studies, higher intakes of flavanones are&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of mortality by cardiovascular disease (CVD). This relation&#xD;
      is supported by results from a number of animal studies demonstrating a slowdown in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis development and vascular protective effects in dietary interventions with&#xD;
      flavanones. Randomized, controlled clinical trials to corroborate the suggested&#xD;
      vasculo-protective effects of orange juice presumably mediated by the flavanones are scarce&#xD;
      and available data do not allow to draw firm conclusions about their efficacy. To fill this&#xD;
      gap, the &quot;HESPER-HEALTH study&quot; conducted in humans will assess the vascular protective&#xD;
      effects of 100% orange juice consumption and evaluate the contribution of hesperidin in these&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This human dietary intervention study is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      cross over trial with 3 arms, carried out on subjects with predisposition to cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD) based on age and overweight. This study aims to demonstrate the vascular&#xD;
      protective effects (with Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) as main criteria) of the consumption&#xD;
      of a flavanone rich orange juice or of orange flavanones by comparison with a control sugary&#xD;
      drink alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 42 recruited participants will receive the 3 drinks in a random order. For each subject,&#xD;
      the study is divided into 3 identical experimental periods of 45 days (period 1,2,3):&#xD;
      including 3 days prior to the beginning of the product intake, during which specific dietary&#xD;
      guidelines, samplings and measures will be asked to be performed at home followed by a 6&#xD;
      weeks period of consumption of each of the 3 beverages). A period of 4 to 6 weeks of wash-out&#xD;
      is planned between each experimental period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize: Visit 1 (D-14) = inclusion, Visit 2 (D1: baseline) to 3 (D42) = period 1, Visit&#xD;
      3 (D42) to 4 (D70) = wash out 1, Visit 4 (D70) to 5 (D111) = period 2, Visit 5 (D111) to 6&#xD;
      (D139) = wash out 2, Visit 6 (D139) to 7 (D180) = period 3. The wash-out periods (minimum&#xD;
      duration: 4 weeks) may be extended until 6 weeks for the convenience of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes a total of 7 visits to PIC/CIC Inserm 1405 of the Clermont-Fd&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study will be between 28 and 34 weeks&#xD;
