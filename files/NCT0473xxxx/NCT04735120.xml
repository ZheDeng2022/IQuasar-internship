      Effectiveness of lasers in reducing pain during and after root canal treatment for mandibular&#xD;

      AIM : To assess the intraoperative and postoperative pain incidence for single visit root&#xD;
      canal treatment for mandibular molar teeth with acute irreversible pulpitis following laser&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study will account the patients who are referred to the Department&#xD;
      of Endodontics,both male and female patients,with pain due to acute irreversible pulpitis&#xD;
      from carious mandibular first and second molar teeth requiring root canal treatment. Subjects&#xD;
      of age 13 to 70 years who met the inclusion criteria and responded positively to cold test&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single visit root canal treatment with 2.5 mL of 2% lignocaine containing 1:80,000 adrenaline&#xD;
      for an inferior alveolar block injection will be administered for each individual. After&#xD;
      achieving anesthesia, patients who exhibit pain following access opening will be subjected to&#xD;
      diode laser application on the pulp canal orifices. With regard to intraoperative pain, pre&#xD;
      laser and post laser intraoperative pain incidence will be recorded. Once when the&#xD;
      intraoperative pain incidence is reduced, patients will be reassessed for the need of&#xD;
      additional anesthesia. If fully anesthetised, root canal procedure will be completed.&#xD;
      Preoperative, intraoperative( before and laser application) pulse rate will also be measured.&#xD;
      The levels of preoperative and post-operative pain at 24 hrs and 48 hrs for each patient will&#xD;
      be recorded using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
