  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study in which a total of 1000&#xD;
      subjects in need of a single, multiple or full arch restoration in any region of the mouth&#xD;
      (healed or extracted) will be treated in up to 30 study centers. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of all NobelBiocare TiUltra implants to historic data&#xD;
      from NobelActive TiUnite coated implant in terms of marginal bone level change over 5 years&#xD;
      after final prosthetic delivery. Eligible subjects who provide their informed consent for&#xD;
      participation will be enrolled into one of four groups, each sized to 250 individuals. They&#xD;
      will be treated with the corresponding implant system assigned to the group. The allocation&#xD;
      into a certain group is only driven by the subject's clinical and restorative requirement and&#xD;
      standard of care at the enrolling study clinic. Each subject will be followed for 5 years&#xD;
      after definitive prosthetic placement&#xD;

      Primary Objective: The primary endpoint is to evaluate the change in the marginal bone level&#xD;
      from definitive prosthetic placement (baseline) to the 5-year follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:The secondary objectives of this clinical investigation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the change in the marginal bone level from definitive prosthetic placement&#xD;
           (baseline) to 1-year and 3-years follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate cumulative implant survival and success rates from definitive prosthetic&#xD;
           placement to 5 years follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate cumulative prosthetic survival and success rates to 5 years follow-up&#xD;
           visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate soft tissue outcome (as measured by bleeding index, plaque index and&#xD;
           gingival index) to 5 years from definitive prosthetic placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate SADE, USADE, ADE and DD from implant insertion until 5 years follow-up&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study in which a total&#xD;
      of 1000 subjects in need of a single, multiple or full arch restoration in any region of the&#xD;
      mouth (healed or extracted) will be treated in up to 30 study centers. The study devices are&#xD;
      divided into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (G1): NobelActive TiUltra implants (3.0, NP, RP, WP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (G2): NobelParallel CC TiUltra implants (NP, RP; WP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (G3): NobelReplace CC TiUltra implants (NP, RP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 (G4): Nobel Biocare N1 TiUltra TCC implants (NP, RP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consecutively included provided they meet all of the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects who provide their informed consent for&#xD;
      participation will be enrolled into one of four groups, each sized to 250 individuals. They&#xD;
      will be treated with the corresponding implant system assigned to the group. The allocation&#xD;
      into a certain group is only driven by the subject's clinical and restorative requirement and&#xD;
      standard of care at the enrolling study clinic. Each subject will be followed for 5 years&#xD;
      after definitive prosthetic placement . Possible dropouts and withdrawals, as well as&#xD;
      possible serious adverse (device) events, will be carefully monitored during the entire study&#xD;
      period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence of treatment: As part of the screening process each subject will undergo a&#xD;
      pre-treatment standard of care examination to record demographic characteristics and medical&#xD;
      history. The subjects will be informed of the treatment possibilities according to clinic&#xD;
      standard of care and about the study. Depending on the clinical indication, clinician&#xD;
      preferences and desired esthetic solution the subject will be enrolled into one of the four&#xD;
      previously described groups (G1 to G4). Implant surgery-, bone and tissue regenerative- and&#xD;
      prosthodontic procedures shall be performed according to IFU and standard of care. Implants&#xD;
      may be placed in either healed or extraction sites utilizing one-stage or two-stage surgical&#xD;
      protocol with immediate, early or delayed loading to restore single missing tooth, partial or&#xD;
      fully edentulous jaws. The treating clinician should decide individually when definitive&#xD;
      prosthesis installation is suitable for each subject. Standard of care follow-up visits&#xD;
      should be scheduled as close as possible to 1-, 3- and 5- years after definitive prosthetic&#xD;
      placement, to ascertain a homogenous data set. Deidentified periapical radiographs from each&#xD;
      subject visit shall be uploaded to the study eCRF. All images will be forwarded to the core&#xD;
      lab for independent analysis. As part of the screening process each subject will undergo a&#xD;
      pre-treatment standard of care examination to record demographic characteristics and medical&#xD;
      history. The subjects will be informed of the treatment possibilities according to clinic&#xD;
      standard of care and about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the clinical indication, clinician preferences and desired esthetic solution the&#xD;
      subject will be enrolled into one of the four previously described groups (G1 to G4). Implant&#xD;
      surgery-, bone and tissue regenerative- and prosthodontic procedures shall be performed&#xD;
      according to IFU and standard of care. Implants may be placed in either healed or extraction&#xD;
      sites utilizing one-stage or two-stage surgical protocol with immediate, early or delayed&#xD;
      loading to restore single missing tooth, partial or fully edentulous jaws. The treating&#xD;
      clinician should decide individually when definitive prosthesis installation is suitable for&#xD;
      each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Once the subject has provided written informed consent and fulfilled all&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, he/she is considered enrolled. Subject&#xD;
      enrolment period is expected to take 7 months from time of initiation at each site. Enrolment&#xD;
      in each group will stop once the total group size of 250 subjects has been met. The clinical&#xD;
      investigation will continue until each subject has been followed for 5-years after final&#xD;
      prosthetic delivery.&#xD;
