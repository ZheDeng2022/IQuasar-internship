    <textblock>
      The investigators want to test in this non-randomized clinical trial a new method of&#xD;
      administrating Pilocarpine medicine into the skin during the Sweat testing process that does&#xD;
      not use any electrical current.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sweat collection tests are done when a patient is suspected of having cystic fibrosis. This&#xD;
      procedure for collection of sweat samples is called the Sweat Test and the measurement of&#xD;
      sweat chloride concentration from the collected sweat sample is the gold standard for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the sweat test is performed for patients in a hospital lab, the standard method uses a&#xD;
      small electrical current to push pilocarpine medicine into the skin of the forearm, after&#xD;
      which sweat is collected for testing. However, many people do not make enough sweat during&#xD;
      this standard method of testing and have to come back for repeated testing. The investigators&#xD;
      want to test a new method of putting Pilocarpine medicine into the skin during the Sweat&#xD;
      testing process that does not use any electrical current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing will be done once for every participant and no further follow up or additional&#xD;
      testing is needed. The study team plans to invite healthy adults who are not taking any&#xD;
      medicines to participate through a flyer posted in Emory Children's Center bulletin board.&#xD;
      For those interested in participating, the study will be explained to them in detail and an&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. The subjects will be asked to sit for 45 minutes on a&#xD;
      chair as the study related procedures are completed on their arms. The right forearm will be&#xD;
      used for pilocarpine iontophoresis method and the left forearm will be used for&#xD;
      microneedle-based stimulation method for a period of 5 minutes. An additional microneedle&#xD;
      control patch (without any Pilocarpine) will be placed on the left forearm to make sure that&#xD;
      there are no skin changes from the microneedles. After the first 5 minutes, the sweat&#xD;
      collection devices (Macroduct) will be placed on both forearms to collect sweat samples from&#xD;
      each site. After the completion of this 30-minute collection phase, the Macroduct collectors&#xD;
      will be removed by the study team and the subject testing will be complete. The study team&#xD;
      will store the sweat samples to measure their chloride concentration at the end of the&#xD;
      enrollment phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in a research room at Emory Children's Center and no&#xD;
      compensation will be provided to the participants. At the end of the study, the research team&#xD;
      will compare the two methods based on how much sweat was produced in each individual's arms&#xD;
      with either of these methods. The results of this study will help to improve the current&#xD;
      technique of sweat testing and help reduce the need for repeated testing in patients being&#xD;
      evaluated for Cystic Fibrosis.&#xD;
