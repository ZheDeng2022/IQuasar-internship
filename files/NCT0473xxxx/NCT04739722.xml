      This study will be a prospective analysis conducted by Geneoscopy Inc. to evaluate the&#xD;
      ColonoSight test, which is a multi-target stool RNA test for colorectal screening.&#xD;

      Patients who are eligible for a colonoscopy (i.e., asymptomatic, average risk individuals&#xD;
      45-84 years of age who are not up-to-date with screening guidelines) will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Stool samples returned to Geneoscopy's Laboratories by the participant will be&#xD;
      subjected to the ColonoSight test system, and a result will be generated. The result will be&#xD;
      compared to an optical colonoscopy to determine: 1) sensitivity for colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      advanced adenomas, and other precancerous adenomas and 2) specificity for hyperplastic polyps&#xD;
      and no findings on a colonoscopy. This study will be used for the clinical validation of the&#xD;
      ColonoSight test.&#xD;

Patients who are eligible for a colonoscopy (i.e., asymptomatic, average risk individuals between 45-80 who are not up-to-date with screening guidelines) will be enrolled in the study. Stool samples returned to Geneoscopy's Laboratories by the participant will be subjected to the ColonoSight test system, and a result will be generated.

    <description>The ColonoSight Collection Kit provides information on how to collect a stool swab using a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and how to collect a stool sample using the ColonoSight Collection Kit. After a stool sample is produced, patients will swab the stool sample using the FIT tube according to instructions and return the stool sample via mail courier to Geneoscopy's Laboratories. Patients will then be directed to receive a colonoscopy. If a lesion is removed during the colonoscopy, the tissue sample will be sent for histopathology review. The colonoscopy report and the histopathology report will be reported to Geneoscopy. Stool samples returned to Geneoscopy's Laboratories will be subjected to the ColonoSight test system, which includes targeted nucleic acid enrichment and biomarkers quantification via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The FIT returned in the ColonoSight Collection Kit will also be read by laboratory technologists at Geneoscopy.</description>
