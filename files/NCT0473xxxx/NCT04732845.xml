  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to treat relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      lymphoid malignancies (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia) with a new type of T cell-based immunotherapy (therapy that uses the&#xD;
      immune system to treat the cancer).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the safety of the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell&#xD;
      lymphomas, relapsed/ refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and relapsed/refractory acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19 and to find the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose for this cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections. This treatment&#xD;
      uses T cells already present within the body that have been modified outside of the body by a&#xD;
      lentivirus and then returned to the participant by an infusion to target the cancer.&#xD;
      Lentivirus is a family of viruses that can be used by scientists to alter cells, which then&#xD;
      could be used to change the course of a disease. This type of treatment is sometimes referred&#xD;
      to as adoptive cell transfer (ACT). In this study the specific type of cells that will be&#xD;
      used is called human chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells). The CAR-T cells that&#xD;
      will be reinfused to the body are modified using a lentivirus that is no longer active. The&#xD;
      CAR-T cells will be returned to the body through an intravenous (IV) infusion. Another&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to learn about the side effects and toxicities related to this&#xD;
      treatment. Human CAR-T cell therapy is investigational (experimental) and works by removing T&#xD;
      cells from the blood and modifying them to be able to target the cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (Group A - NHL/CLL),&#xD;
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Group A - NHL/CLL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
             (Group B - ALL) treated with at least two lines of therapy. Disease must have either&#xD;
             progressed after the last regimen or presented failure to achieve complete remission&#xD;
             with the last regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant's lymphoid malignancy must be cluster of differentiation antigen 19&#xD;
             (CD19) positive, either by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry analysis on the last&#xD;
             biopsy available or peripheral blood for circulating disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 2 X the institutional upper limit of normal unless bilirubin rise&#xD;
             is due to Gilbert's syndrome (maximum 2 times normal) or of non - hepatic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate pulmonary function as defined as pulse oximetry ≥ 92% on room air.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate cardiac function as defined as left ventricular ejection fraction≥&#xD;
             40% in the most recent echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute Lymphocyte Count &gt;100/microliter (uL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants (or legal guardians) must have the ability to understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%&#xD;
             per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the human&#xD;
             anti-CD19 CAR-T cell infusion. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential&#xD;
             if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (&lt; 12 continuous&#xD;
             months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not&#xD;
             undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of&#xD;
             contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation,&#xD;
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The&#xD;
             reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of&#xD;
             the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined&#xD;
             below: With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or&#xD;
             use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
             human anti-CD19 CAR-T cell infusion. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this&#xD;
             same period. With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom&#xD;
             during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the human antiCD19 CAR-T&#xD;
             cell infusion to avoid potential embryonal or fetal exposure. The reliability of&#xD;
             sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical&#xD;
             trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autologous transplant within 6 weeks of planned CAR-T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allogeneic stem cell transplant within 3 months of planned CAR-T cell infusion and&#xD;
             patients must be off immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active graft versus host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma or leukemia.&#xD;
             Subjects with untreated brain metastases/central nervous system (CNS) disease will be&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of CNS or meningeal involvement must be in a documented&#xD;
             remission by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation and contrast-enhanced MRI imaging&#xD;
             for at least 90 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g.&#xD;
             cervix, bladder, breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed between prior treatment with investigational&#xD;
             agent(s) and the day of lymphocyte collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV seropositivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR-T cell&#xD;
             therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of myelodysplasia or cytogenetic abnormality indicative of myelodysplasia on&#xD;
             any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of clinically relevant CNS pathology such as epilepsy,&#xD;
             seizure disorders, paresis, aphasia, uncontrolled cerebrovascular disease, severe&#xD;
             brain injuries, dementia and Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus) with requirement of immunosuppressive medication within 6 months.&#xD;
