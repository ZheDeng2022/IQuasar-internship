      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis (OA) affects articulating tissues secondary to&#xD;
      inflammation resulting in intracapsular pain. This prospective, double-blind randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will evaluate the relative efficacy of TMJ arthrocentesis with a&#xD;
      supplementation of platelet-rich growth factors (PRGF) compared to TMJ arthrocentesis with a&#xD;
      steroid supplementation (a known effective therapy) for patients with TMJ OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are musculoskeletal disorders that are commonly&#xD;
      encountered, with pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and jaw closing muscles. Pain&#xD;
      that involves the temporomandibular joint includes inflammatory pathologies such as&#xD;
      arthritides, painful disk displacements and many times have an overlay of psychosocial&#xD;
      comorbidities due to the uncontrolled pain. TMJ osteoarthritis is an intracapsular condition&#xD;
      affecting the temporomandibular joint and presents with remodeling of the TMJ articulating&#xD;
      tissues including the condyle and articular eminence secondary to inflammation resulting in&#xD;
      intracapsular pain. There is a paucity of information regarding the relative effectiveness of&#xD;
      different therapies for the treatment of patients with TMJ osteoarthritis. The identification&#xD;
      of the least invasive and most efficacious therapy is vital to proper management of these&#xD;
      patients with temporomandibular joint pain and disability. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      establish the relative efficacy of TMJ arthrocentesis with steroid supplementation (a known&#xD;
      effective therapy) compared to TMJ arthrocentesis with a supplement of plasma rich in growth&#xD;
      factors (PRGF) for patients with TMJ osteoarthritis. Plasma rich in growth factors is&#xD;
      isolated from the patient's own blood and injected into the temporomandibular joint to&#xD;
      activate stem cells that may restore some of the articulating tissues that were lost during&#xD;
      degeneration changes within the joint secondary to osteoarthritis. Pain and disability will&#xD;
      be assessed using standard pain and physical measures that are recorded before and after&#xD;
      treatment. Patients enrolled into the study will be examined and treated at the Department of&#xD;
      Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Faculty/Resident clinic. At the first appointment, they will&#xD;
      be examined following standard procedures (medical history, physical exam, imaging by cone&#xD;
      beam computerized tomography (CBCT)) to determine their diagnosis(es) and if they would&#xD;
      potentially benefit from the TMJ arthrocentesis procedure. If the patient meets the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the study and with their informed consent on the day of their TMJ arthrocentesis&#xD;
      procedure, they will be required to have a pregnancy test if below age 60 and complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their physical and pain symptoms and undergo a standardized clinical&#xD;
      exam. The patients will then undergo the standard clinical protocol for TMJ arthrocentesis&#xD;
      followed by either a 2 cc steroid/bupivacaine hydrochloride supplementation (standard&#xD;
      treatment group) or a 2 cc PRGF supplementation (experimental group) into the TMJ. Follow-up&#xD;
      appointments will be conducted at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months when the pain VAS measures&#xD;
      and a clinical exam will be assessed. If patients have not experienced improvement in their&#xD;
      primary outcome measure (TMJ pain) at the 3 month evaluation, the patient will have a second&#xD;
      TMJ arthrocentesis procedure that will be supplemented with the alternative medication/growth&#xD;
      factors (steroid or PRGF) using a cross-over design. Data from these patients will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately from patients that complete the six month study. Also at 6 months, a&#xD;
      second CBCT image of the temporomandibular joints will be obtained to determine the extent of&#xD;
      bone remodeling within the TMJ. The results of this study should provide new information on&#xD;
      the efficacy of PRGF supplementation for management of temporomandibular joint&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
