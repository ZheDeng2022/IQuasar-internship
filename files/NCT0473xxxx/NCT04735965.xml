      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine for the&#xD;
      prevention of postoperative shivering in the patients undergo elective coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      graft, and to compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the incidence of&#xD;
      shivering in the patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is one of the common complications during the perioperative period.The incidence of&#xD;
      shivering is high in the patients undergo CABG. Previous studies showed that the incidence&#xD;
      could be up to 50％. Shivering could make the patients feel distressed. Moreover, shivering&#xD;
      could also cause a significant increase in oxygen consumption of patients,which might affect&#xD;
      the balance of oxygen supply and demand of the vital organs, such as heart and brain. There&#xD;
      are few studies of pharmacological interventions for the prevention of shivering following&#xD;
      CABG,and the gold standard prophylactic and therapeutic medicine have not been determined.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that both dexmedetomidine and meperidine can reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of shivering after intrathecal anesthesia and general anesthesia. However, only a few studies&#xD;
      have indicated that meperidine can reduce the incidence of shivering in patients undergo&#xD;
      off-pump CABG. But meperidine may increase the incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for the prevention of postoperative shivering in the patients undergo&#xD;
      elective CABG, and to compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the&#xD;
      incidence of shivering in the patients undergo CABG.&#xD;
