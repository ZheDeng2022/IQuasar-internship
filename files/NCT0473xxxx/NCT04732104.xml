    <textblock>
      Different anesthetic techniques are used for achieving pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth.&#xD;
      Recently tetracaine and oxymetazoline were used as local anesthetic agents in the form of an&#xD;
      intranasal spray to achieve pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth. However tetracaine has its&#xD;
      share of demerits, therefore we in our study have used lidocaine with xylometazoline in the&#xD;
      form of an intranasal spray to achieve local anesthesia of maxillary anterior and premolar&#xD;
      teeth for restorative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4% lidocaine and 0.1%&#xD;
      xylometazoline intranasal spray solution as compared to injectable 2% lidocaine with&#xD;
      1:100,000 epinephrine solution in anesthetizing maxillary anterior &amp; premolar teeth for&#xD;
      dental restorative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the study. Consecutive sampling was done for the&#xD;
      study participants who met the inclusion criteria. 30 patients were randomized each to&#xD;
      lidocaine/Xylometazoline or control local anesthesia group. Group A participants received 4%&#xD;
      Lidocaine and 0.1% Xylometazoline solution as intranasal spray while Group B participants&#xD;
      received injectable local anesthesia. Group 'A' participants received two doses of intranasal&#xD;
      spray anesthesia four minutes apart. Local anesthesia was then assessed by probing soft&#xD;
      tissues adjacent to the tooth and reading was taken on the Visual Analog Scale. If the&#xD;
      reading was '0' the cavity preparation was performed. If the VAS reading was more than '0' a&#xD;
      third dose of intranasal spray anesthesia was delivered. Local anesthesia was again assessed&#xD;
      after ten minutes. If profound local anesthesia was still not achieved the case was labeled&#xD;
      as failure of intranasal spray anesthesia and local anesthesia was achieved by conventional&#xD;
      infiltration anesthesia. For Group B participants, local anesthesia was achieved by means of&#xD;
      conventional infiltration anesthesia. Data were recorded on a designed proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test and Fischer exact test were applied to see the difference of efficacy among&#xD;
      the two groups and any influence of variables (age group, gender, tooth location, cavity&#xD;
      classification, ICDAS score or the number of sprays required to produce local anesthesia) on&#xD;
      the efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Different anesthetic techniques are used for achieving pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth.&#xD;
      The most commonly used technique is the infiltration anesthesia that currently is the gold&#xD;
      standard. However, infiltration uses a dental needle that is associated with its de merits&#xD;
      also. This led to the discovery of novel methods to anesthetize teeth with smaller diameter&#xD;
      needles or computerized delivery of local anesthesia. Recently tetracaine and oxymetazoline&#xD;
      were used as local anesthetic agents in the form of an intranasal spray to achieve pulpal&#xD;
      anesthesia of maxillary teeth. However tetracaine has its share of demerits, therefore we in&#xD;
      our study have used lidocaine with xylometazoline in the form of an intranasal spray to&#xD;
      achieve local anesthesia of maxillary anterior and premolar teeth for restorative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

      dental restorative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label randomized controlled trial was performed at the Department of Operative&#xD;
      Dentistry, Dr.Ishrat Ul Ebad Khan Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Dow University of Health&#xD;
      Sciences Karachi between July 2018 and June 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the study. Consecutive sampling was done for the&#xD;
      study participants who met the inclusion criteria. 30 patients were randomized each to&#xD;

      conventional infiltration anesthesia. Data were recorded on a designed proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS v16 was used to analyze the data with level of significance set at p&lt;0.05. Demographic&#xD;
      data were analyzed upon the basis of frequency and percentages. Chi-square test and Fischer&#xD;
      exact test were applied to see the difference of efficacy among the two groups and any&#xD;
      influence of variables (age group, gender, tooth location, cavity classification, ICDAS score&#xD;
      or the number of sprays required to produce local anesthesia) on the efficacy.&#xD;
