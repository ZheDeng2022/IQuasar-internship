      The main objectives of this study are to confirm the long-term safety, performance and&#xD;
      clinical benefits the Avenir Complete™ femoral stem and its instrumentation when used in&#xD;
      primary total, hemi, and revision hip arthroplasty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined by the survival of the implant system at 10 years, which is&#xD;
      based on the removal or intended removal of the &quot;study device and determined using Kaplan&#xD;
      Meier method. The safety of the system will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events. Relation of the events to implant, instrumentation and/or&#xD;
      procedure should be specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording&#xD;
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs) as well as radiographic outcomes (if&#xD;
      available).&#xD;

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Functional outcomes are measured with the Harris Hip Score, including range of motion, pain level, activity levels and patient satisfaction. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).</description>

    <description>This is another self-assessment by means of the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol) score, which measures the patient's perceived quality of life.&#xD;
EQ VAS: Score between 0 and 100 recorded by an individual, 100 being the highest.&#xD;
EQ 5D Value: &quot;The value attached to an EQ-5D profile according to a set of weights that reflect, on average, people's preferences about how good or bad the state is. Values are anchored at 1 (full health) and 0 (a state as bad as being dead)&quot; https://euroqol.org/support/terminology/</description>

    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a joint-specific, patient-reported outcome measure tool designed to assess disability in patients undergoing total hip replacement.&#xD;
The score is measured on a scale of 0 to 48 with 48 being the best outcome.</description>
