  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenvatinib with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and to establish a safe and effective systemic treatment regimen for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) / poorly differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
      (PDTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is an anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative drug used in differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. It blocks proliferative genes such as RET and PDGFR and further inhibits major&#xD;
      proliferation pathways such as VEGF receptor signaling and FGFR1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets PD-1 located on lymphocytes. The&#xD;
      response to pembrolizumab treatment is associated, among other things, with increased&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1, as well as with the frequency of somatic mutations in the respective&#xD;
      tumors. Patients with ATC / PDTC show high expression of PD-L1.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab)&#xD;
                with a multikinase inhibitor (lenvatinib) using an objective response rate (ORR) in&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the efficacy of the investigator's choice of chemotherapy plus PD-1&#xD;

               -  Abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, bowel obstruction, or&#xD;
                  intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to inclusion. Note: Complete&#xD;

&#xD;
             D) Interstitial lung lesions or known manifestations of endobronchial disease. F)&#xD;
             Lesions invading the main pulmonary blood vessels.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  History of solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Major surgery (such as gastrointestinal surgery and removal or biopsy of brain&#xD;
             metastases) within 8 weeks prior to inclusion. Complete wound healing from major&#xD;
             surgery should occur 4 weeks before the study treatment, and after minor surgery (eg,&#xD;
             simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the study treatment.&#xD;
             Patients with clinically significant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Adjusted QT interval calculated by Fridericia formula (QTcf)&gt; 500 ms for 28 days prior&#xD;
             to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If a single ECG displays a QTCf with an absolute value&gt; 500 ms, two additional&#xD;
             ECGs at approximately 3 min intervals must be performed within 30 minutes of the&#xD;
             initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results will be used to assess&#xD;
             eligibility for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Pregnant (test must be done no later than 7 days before the start of the study) or&#xD;
             lactating mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Received any live vaccine = &lt;30 days prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Inability to swallow pills and lack of gastrostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to the components of the&#xD;
             investigational dosage forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Diagnosis of other malignant neoplasm within 3 years prior to study treatment, with&#xD;
             the exception of superficial skin cancer or localized low-grade tumors that are&#xD;
             considered cured and untreated by systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERION FOR COHORT 1 (pembrolizumab + lenvatinib): The presence&#xD;
             of invasion (germination) of the tumor into the major great vessels or the presence of&#xD;
             clinically significant blood clots in the arteries or veins.&#xD;
