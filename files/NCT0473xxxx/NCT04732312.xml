  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective monocenter observational study is to assess the impact of the&#xD;
      first introduction of formal home help (personalized autonomy allowance for seniors) on the&#xD;
      quality of life of home caregivers of elderly patients with neurocognitive impairment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An aging population is leading to an increase in neurodegenerative disorders that are&#xD;
      responsible for loss of autonomy. In order to keep patients with neurocognitive impairment at&#xD;
      home, the availability of home caregivers is essential. The neurocognitive deterioration of&#xD;
      elderly patients is a significant burden for home caregivers and can affect their quality of&#xD;
      life. The implementation of formal home help (personalized autonomy allowance for seniors)&#xD;
      can relieve home caregivers and improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients followed in the geriatric department of the Mulhouse French hospital, and&#xD;
      for whom a formal home help (personalized autonomy allowance for seniors) is initiated will&#xD;
      be recruited. The evolution of home caregiver's quality of life, burden and vulnerability,&#xD;
      will be assessed during three months.&#xD;
