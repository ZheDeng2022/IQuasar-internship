    <textblock>
      Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a disease of children, particularly affecting the brain&#xD;
      and the skin. There is a close link between AGS and increased amounts of a chemical called&#xD;
      interferon. Normally humans only produce interferon when they are infected with a virus. In&#xD;
      AGS, there is no viral infection. Instead, the cells in the cells of affected patients are&#xD;
      confused into thinking that their own genetic material is coming from a virus. As a result&#xD;
      they produce interferon all the time, which acts as a poison that damages the cells. The&#xD;
      Investigators wish to treat AGS patients with drugs called reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (RTIs), used to fight the HIV-1 virus that causes AIDS. The investigators will monitor the&#xD;
      effect of treatment on interferon levels, and look at other markers which might give us clues&#xD;
      to how the drugs are working. The trial is funded by the Medical Research Council, and&#xD;
      involves experts based in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester and Great Ormond Street Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe childhood disease of the brain associated with&#xD;
      very high levels of a chemical called type I interferon. Normally humans only produce&#xD;
      interferon when they are infected with a virus. In AGS, there is no obvious viral infection.&#xD;
      Instead, due to changes (mutations) in the genetic code in these individuals, it is believed&#xD;
      that the cells in the body are fooled into thinking that the person's own DNA is viral - that&#xD;
      is to say, there is a confusion in telling 'self' from 'non-self'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, a large amount of our own DNA is made up of ancient virus (called 'endogenous&#xD;
      retrovirus' and sometimes also referred to as 'junk DNA'), that have been included into our&#xD;
      own genetic material over millions of years. These endogenous retroviruses can still act like&#xD;
      a virus coming from outside of the body, so that they need to be controlled. The&#xD;
      Investigators have wondered if the genetic changes causing AGS mean that these normal control&#xD;
      mechanisms don't work. If that is true, the endogenous retroviruses could start to make&#xD;
      copies of themselves which might be recognised by our immune system as 'non-self' ('foreign'&#xD;
      i.e. viral), leading to the continuous production of interferon which then damages the cells&#xD;
      in our body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since humans cannot repair the genetic code in every cell, the investigators wish to treat&#xD;
      AGS patients with drugs called reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). RTIs are used to&#xD;
      fight the HIV-1 virus that causes AIDS. In the case of AGS, it is not treating HIV-1, but the&#xD;
      investigators wonder if the same drugs might be able to control endogenous retroviruses that&#xD;
      are driving interferon production. Indeed, in a recently completed study the investigators&#xD;
      gathered early information to suggest that treatment of patients with AGS with RTIs for one&#xD;
      year did lead to a reduction in interferon, with levels increasing again when we stopped the&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will involve three treatment arms, and an assessment of interferon status&#xD;
      and other markers which we think will give us information about AGS, and about how RTIs may&#xD;
      work in the treatment of AGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is of potential importance for patients with AGS and their families since there&#xD;
      are no licenced drugs for this disorder at the present time. Scientifically, the project will&#xD;
      be of considerable interest if the results support the possibility that 'junk DNA' can be&#xD;
      associated with human disease. RTIs are very safe drugs, that have been used in millions of&#xD;
      people with HIV-1 around the world. If the results turn out to be convincing, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that it might be worth thinking about using RTIs to treat other&#xD;
      diseases that have also been linked to increased levels of type I interferon, for example the&#xD;
      relatively common immune condition called systemic lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
