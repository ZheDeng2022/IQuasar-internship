      The purpose of this study is to better understand how people feel after a radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation standard of care surgery using a different type of needle (multi-tined expandable&#xD;
      electrode/MEE) in comparison to receiving conventional medical management (CMM) techniques.&#xD;

    <description>Radiofrequency ablation involves a minimally invasive procedural technique. It uses radiofrequency waves to burn the nerve causing pain. This nerve will no longer be able to send pain signals to your brain. For this study, the multi-tined expandable electrode needle will be used. This needle will result in a larger treatment area. This may result in better pain relief and longer lasting pain relief. If you undergo the radiofrequency ablation procedure you will have pain medication injected where the ablation will be done. The procedure will take about 20 mins to complete. You will be allowed to go home afterward.</description>
