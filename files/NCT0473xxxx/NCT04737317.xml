      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of the current diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
      cardiac sarcoidosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory condition rarely affecting the heart, exhibiting fluctuating&#xD;
      disease activity and eventually leading to ventricular fibrosis. Clinical presentation ranges&#xD;
      from no symptoms at all to life-threatening arrhythmias, heart failure and death in severe&#xD;
      cases. The heart lesions show patchy distribution and can mimic virtually any other type of&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, which poses significant challenges for the accurate and eary diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are four diagnostic tools and recomendations for diagnosis of cardiac&#xD;
      sarcoidosis (CS) that utilize clinical, ECG, laboratory, imaging and biopsy criteria.&#xD;
      Recently, it was demonstrated that there is a significant diagreement between these four&#xD;
      diagnostic tools. On the other hand, earlier identification of patients with active&#xD;
      inflammatory process is necessary, as they are those who will most likely benefit from&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of the current&#xD;
      clinical, ECG, laboratory, imaging and biopsy criteria for diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis based on clinical symptoms will recieve elaborate&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up consisting of: evaluation of symptoms, family history, occupational&#xD;
      hazards, ECG, chest X-ray, laboratory markers for sarcoidosis, positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as well as endomyocardial biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance to the recomendations of the current guidelines, the patients will be devided&#xD;
      into 3 groups: 1) patients with proven CS; 2) patients with probable CS; and 3) unlikely CS&#xD;
      that will serve as a reference group. The patients in first two groups will be treated with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy, mainly glucocorticoids (GC). The follow-up at 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months will consist of evaluation of the symptoms using dedicated King's Sarcoidosis&#xD;
      Questionaire (KSQ), fatigue assessment scale (FAS), Holter-ECG, pacemaker interrogation,&#xD;
      laboratory findings, imaging with PET and CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes will be defined as: 1) improvement of symptoms (FAS score, heart failure&#xD;
      class, AV block, ventricular arrhythmias, and KSQ score) and 2) improvement of imaging&#xD;
      parameters ( left ventricular ejection fraction, PET activity, myocardial edema, scar in&#xD;
      CMR). The outcomes between the groups will be compared using group 3 as reference.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients with improvement with GC (successful therapy) will be compared with&#xD;
      those without improvement (unsuccessful therapy) and the predictive value of each diagnostic&#xD;
      criterion will be evaluated. Finally, the odds ratios (OR) for each parameter will be used to&#xD;
      calculate a diagnostic and predictive score which will be used prospectively to evaluate&#xD;
      patients with suspected CS and to guide the therapy.&#xD;
