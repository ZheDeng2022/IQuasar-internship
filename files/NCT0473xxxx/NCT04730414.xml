  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In westernized societies, acne vulgaris is nearly a universal skin disease afflicting 79% to&#xD;
      95% of the adolescent population; older than 25 years - 40% to 54% have facial blemishes and&#xD;
      persists into middle age in 12% of women and 3% of men. Standard treatment modalities present&#xD;
      with high risk morbidities. Charlotte's Web hemp blemish product is predicted to&#xD;
      significantly reduce the risks mentioned above, while improving efficacy as well as imparting&#xD;
      other skin benefits.&#xD;

      Charlotte's Web Full spectrum hemp blemish product will contain a mere 0.018% THC and will&#xD;
      therefor not impart a psychotic affect. Hemp has been shown to be well tolerated in humans&#xD;
      and has a very acceptable dosage, efficacy and safety profile when topically applied. The FDA&#xD;
      has labeled hemp as Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) and as such reduces the risk of severe&#xD;
      adverse reactions to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of hemp blemish 'cream&quot; is that it has been formulated in such a way as to promote&#xD;
      natural skin balance, and may eliminate skin dryness, inflammation, hyperpigmentation, and&#xD;
      scaring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective and endpoint of the study is to obtain total eradication of the blemish&#xD;
      eruptions. The secondary objective and endpoints is the continued use of the hemp product&#xD;
      will continue to prevent further blemish eruptions and provide other skin benefits especially&#xD;
      reducing the propensity to scar.&#xD;
