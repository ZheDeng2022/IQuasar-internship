  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors sometimes treat chronic pain with devices that send mild electrical currents into the&#xD;
      spinal cord. This type of treatment is referred to as neurostimulation. A common form of&#xD;
      neurostimulation therapy is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). In this study, researchers want to&#xD;
      learn more about how SCS affects pain processing and relieves pain. The researchers will&#xD;
      examine multiple forms of SCS in chronic pain patients who are receiving SCS from their own&#xD;
      doctors as part of their standard of care. During the study, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a variety of evaluations at certain time points.&#xD;

    <masking_description>There will be two research teams. One team will be unblinded (e.g., clinical care provider/company representative, study coordinator) and will perform stimulator programming/adjustment, and the other team will be blinded (e.g., research personnel) and will perform clinical testing and collect study outcome measures.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SCS-induced changes in temporal summation (TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (At randomization) and at the end of each seven-day treatment</time_frame>
    <description>TS refers to an increased perception of pain in response to sequential stimuli of equal physical strength. At the end of each treatment period, TS scores will be calculated by subtracting the average pain rating of the single-stimulus trials from the average pain rating of the ten-stimuli trials. If the difference is a positive number, the researchers will conclude that there was pain summation, where larger numbers will indicate increased pain summation or TS. If the difference is zero or a negative number, the researchers will conclude that there was no pain summation or TS.</description>
