  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study on the CNS&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic effects of CST-103 co-administered with CST-107 in 4 subject populations&#xD;
      with Neurodegenerative Disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) with REM Sleep Behavior Disorder&#xD;
      (RBD) and Depressive Symptoms, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with Depressive Symptoms,&#xD;
      Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) with Cognitive Fluctuations, and Parkinson's Disease Dementia&#xD;
      (PDD) with Cognitive Fluctuations will be enrolled in a 2 period, 2-way crossover design&#xD;
      following study eligibility confirmation during the screening period. The number of subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in each cohort may change as emerging data are reviewed from this and other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment period, subjects will receive daily doses of CST-103 co-administered&#xD;
      with CST-107 or matching placebo for 14 days. Each treatment period will be separated by a&#xD;
      washout period of 14 days (+5-day window).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete clinical and pharmacodynamic assessments during each treatment&#xD;
      period and PK blood samples will be collected prior to, during and after study medication&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
