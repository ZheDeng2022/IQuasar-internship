  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (HF) is a common complication of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) associated&#xD;
      with poor prognosis. Diagnosis of congestive HF in patients with initial, non-severe symptoms&#xD;
      and signs may be challenging and early stages of this complication may be missed. To assess&#xD;
      severity of HF in patients with ACS Killip classification is widely used but it does not take&#xD;
      into account mild manifestations of HF. Thus, patients without rales in the lungs and/or S3&#xD;
      will be labelled as Killip class 1. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency, risk&#xD;
      factors, abilities for early diagnosis using routine medical evaluation and clinical&#xD;
      significance of subclinical and mildly symptomatic congestive HF in patients with ACS without&#xD;
      persistent ST-segment elevation (NSTEACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 200 patients with NSTEACS without history of severe HF and overt signs&#xD;
      of congestion at presentation. Presence and severity of dyspnea (according to Likert ans&#xD;
      Visual analog scales), physical signs of heart failure (respiratory rate, distention of&#xD;
      jugular veins, S3), peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, heart rate and signs of&#xD;
      ischemia on ECG, signs of congestion according to lung and vena cava inferior ultrasound and&#xD;
      chest X-Ray/CT as well as levels of NT-proBNP, hsTn, CRP and FABP at presentation will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Presence and severity of dyspnea, physical signs of heart failure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, heart rate and signs of ischemia on ECG, lung and vena cava inferior ultrasound&#xD;
      will be re-assessed after 6, 12 and 24 hours. During hospitalization occurrence or worsening&#xD;
      of clinical HF. Clinical events will be followed up to 12 months after hospitalization.&#xD;
