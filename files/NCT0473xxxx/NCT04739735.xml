      Background: Exodontia poses a psychological threat for children, increasing the need for&#xD;
      profound local anesthesia to assure painless extraction and maintain child cooperation on the&#xD;
      dental chair. Computer-controlled Intraligamentary anesthesia (CC-ILA) affects only the tooth&#xD;
      to be treated with minimal pressure, eliminating the side effects of other conventional&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study: To evaluate the effectiveness of CC-ILA injection in eliminating pain&#xD;
      during extraction of mandibular primary molars compared to inferior alveolar nerve block&#xD;
      (IANB) technique. The null hypothesis is there will be no difference in the pain experience&#xD;
      with the use of CC-ILA compared to the IANB in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study will be a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, parallel&#xD;
      design. A total of 50 healthy children aged 5-7 years, will be selected from Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University,&#xD;
      Egypt. Children will be selected with scores 3 or 4 Frankl behavioral rating scale. Each&#xD;
      child selected will have at least one mandibular primary molar that is indicated for&#xD;
      extraction. Written informed consent will be obtained from guardian. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two groups according to the technique of anesthesia that will be&#xD;
      used. Group I (test group) will receive CC-ILA, while group II (control group) will receive&#xD;
      IANB. Heart rate will be used as vital parameter of pain, and will be recorded at base line,&#xD;
      during injection and during extraction procedure. Pain reaction will be assessed objectively&#xD;
      by two investigators using Sensory, Eye, Motor (SEM) scale, while subjectively the pain will&#xD;
      be evaluated by asking the child to express his experience using a modified face scale from&#xD;
      the Maunuksela scale.&#xD;

      AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the effectiveness of computer - controlled Intraligamentary Anaesthesia in&#xD;
      eliminating pain during extraction of primary mandibular molars compared to Inferior Alveolar&#xD;
      Nerve Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the pain experience during Local Anaesthesia injection of&#xD;
           mandibular primary molars between computer - controlled Intraligamentary Anaesthesia and&#xD;
           conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the pain experience during extraction of mandibular primary molars&#xD;
           when using the two different anaesthesia techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record the occurrence of any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial. It will be setup and&#xD;
      reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. The PICOT question will be: do pediatric&#xD;
      patients aged from 5-7 years (Population; P) assigned to receive CC-ILA (Intervention; I) in&#xD;
      comparison to inferior alveolar nerve block conventional injection (Control; C) show less&#xD;
      pain during injection and extraction of mandibular primary molars (outcome; O) in twenty-four&#xD;
      hours (time; T)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and location Participants will be recruited from Pediatric Dentistry and Dental&#xD;
      Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation The sample size was calculated based on results obtained from previous&#xD;
      studies of similar nature. Sample size was estimated assuming alpha error= 5% and study&#xD;
      power= 80%. Tekin et al reported mean ± SD Sound, Eye and Motor (SEM) score = 3.93 ± 1.223&#xD;
      when intraligamentary anesthesia (ILA) was used, and 5.17 ± 1.891 when inferior alveolar&#xD;
      nerve block (IANB) was used. Based on comparison of means, sample size was calculated to be&#xD;
      25 per group, and the total sample size required to compare the effectiveness of CC-ILA&#xD;
      technique versus IANB during extraction of primary mandibular molars = number of groups ×&#xD;
      number per group= 2 x 25 = 50. The sample size was calculated using powerandsamplesize.com&#xD;
      calculator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants complying with the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      using a computer-generated list of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child included in the study will be given a serial number that will be used in the&#xD;
      allocation. These numbers will be written in identical sheets of paper with the group to&#xD;
      which each child is allocated and placed inside opaque envelopes carrying the respective&#xD;
      names of the children. A trial independent personnel will be assigned to the role of keeping&#xD;
      the envelopes and unfolding them only at the time of the local anesthesia injection session&#xD;
      so that the group the child is allocated to is concealed from the outcome evaluator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping Participants will be randomly and equally allocated to one of the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: (experimental group n = 25) assigned to CC-ILA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: (control group n = 25) assigned to conventional injection by IANB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher (operator) who will perform all the injections and extractions as well as&#xD;
      record heart rate measurements cannot be blinded to the type of intervention; a second&#xD;
      impartial observer (evaluator) will record the Sensory, Eye, Motor (SEM) scale independently.&#xD;
      The statistician will be blinded to the treatment groups. Since the participants will also be&#xD;
      blinded, therefore, the study will be triple-blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiner reliability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For standardization, all clinical procedures will be performed by a single operator, who&#xD;
           will be trained and calibrated for the Wand - STA system via training sessions by an&#xD;
           expert through the manufacturing company, as it is too complex to be applied effectively&#xD;
           without more appropriate training. Especially, the coordination between the foot pedal&#xD;
           handling and the syringe has shown to be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training on heart rate measurement using the pulse oximeter will be also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second observer will be trained separately to assess pain using (SEM) scale by&#xD;
           observing children undergoing dental procedures and classifying the child's behavior on&#xD;
           videotapes. After a 7-day interval, the exercise will be repeated in order to develop an&#xD;
           acceptable degree of examiner reliability. Intra-examiner reliability will be tested by&#xD;
           Intraclass correlation (ICC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Full medical and dental history will be carried out to select patients. Those patients&#xD;
      whose parents will give their consent to participate will be examined. Proper diagnosis with&#xD;
      thorough clinical examination, and intraoral periapical radiograph of the tooth to be&#xD;
      extracted will be taken to ensure that the patient will match the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The child's dental visit will be a mean of introducing dentistry and acquainting the child&#xD;
      to the dental unit and dental instruments using 'Tell Show Do' technique. No treatment will&#xD;
      be done to the child in order to build a strong patient-dentist relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological child preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The children will be told that their teeth will be put to sleep after placing some jelly&#xD;
           and feeling a little pinch, in order to get rid of germs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Audible sounds will be heard while using STA in group I, so they must be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects in Group II (IANB) will be told that their cheek will feel big and funny for&#xD;
           some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure will be videotaped as a method of motivation to document their good&#xD;
           behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be positioned in supine position with the head and chest parallel to the&#xD;
           floor and the feet slightly elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouth props may aid in maintaining a wide mouth opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For both groups, soft tissues will be dried using (2 x 2 cm) gauze to enhance the&#xD;
           absorption of the topical anaesthetic. Twenty percent Benzocaine topical anaesthetic gel&#xD;
           will be used to obtund the discomfort associated with needle insertion. It will be&#xD;
           applied at the site of needle penetration and left in contact with the soft tissues for&#xD;
           one minute to optimise its effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Anaesthesia Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wand-STA system:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the experimental group, CC-ILA will be administered using the Wand-STA system&#xD;
                according to the manufacturer instructions, which is also concurrent with Mittal&#xD;
                and Chopra (2019). It works with standardised 1.8 mL local anaesthetic carpules.&#xD;
                The distalingual and mesiolingual line angles are the most effective for&#xD;
                multi-rooted mandibular teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The injection is initiated by activating the STA mode when the foot control is&#xD;
                tapped. A 30-gauge ultra-short disposable dental needle will be inserted in the PDL&#xD;
                through the gingival sulcus at the distolingual line angle of the target tooth&#xD;
                first, guided by constant audible tones and visual feedback. The needle should be&#xD;
                directed approximately 30° angle to the long axis of the tooth and the bevel facing&#xD;
                the alveolar bone. A total of 0.9 mL Articaine hydrochloride 4% with 1:100,000&#xD;
                epinephrine will be injected for each root as shown on a special indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the anaesthetic solution delivery, the visual pressure indicator will be&#xD;
                observed as the pressure is increasing from the red into the green zone. Tissue&#xD;
                blanching may occur, which suggests that enough LA has been delivered. Injection&#xD;
                will be stopped by lightly tapping the foot pedal again. The dentist will wait 5&#xD;
                seconds before needle withdrawal. Same steps will be repeated at the mesiolingual&#xD;
                line angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conventional technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the control group, a standard technique for the Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block&#xD;
                (IANB) will be used supplemented with long buccal infiltration for the buccal&#xD;
                gingiva. While the mouth is open as wide as possible, the index finger palpates the&#xD;
                injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A 27-gauge disposable dental needle will be used to inject Articaine hydrochloride&#xD;
                4% with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The needle will be directed between the two primary&#xD;
                molars on the opposite side of the arch, entering the tissues at the level of the&#xD;
                occlusal plane or slightly lower until bony resistance is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The needle is withdrawn 2mm to aspirate. Once negative aspiration is checked, the&#xD;
                remainder of the solution is slowly deposited. The lip and/or cheek will be shaken&#xD;
                as a method of distraction. Approximately 1.0 mL of LA will be delivered near the&#xD;
                inferior alveolar nerve. Two-thirds the needle length should be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The needle is withdrawn, then 0.5 ml as a long buccal infiltration distal to the&#xD;
                second primary molar is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The operator will wait for 3-5 minutes before commencing dental treatment. Numbness&#xD;
                will be tested with a dental probe on the gingiva immediately following the&#xD;
                injection, and after each 10 seconds in case of CC-ILA and each 30 seconds in case&#xD;
                of IANB till full numbness is declared and the time of onset of the anaesthetic&#xD;
                effect will be noticed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In both groups, extraction will be accomplished according to AAPD guidelines.Lower&#xD;
                full crown forceps will be used to apply slow continuous palatal/lingual and buccal&#xD;
                force allowing for the expansion of the alveolar bone to accommodate the divergent&#xD;
                roots and reduce the risk of root fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Care will be taken to support the mandible with the non-extraction hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the patient suffered pain at any given time in the experimental group, the&#xD;
                procedure will be abandoned immediately, IANB will be administered, and extraction&#xD;
                will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post extraction instructions will be given to the patient. They will be instructed&#xD;
                to bite on gauze with firm pressure against the surgical site for 30 minutes. They&#xD;
                should not disturb the surgical site or rinse vigorously on the day of extraction.&#xD;
                According to the technique used, avoid scratching, or injuring the cheek, lips, or&#xD;
                tongue if numbness is felt. They should avoid any physical exercise on the day of&#xD;
                extraction. Cold soft food is recommended, as well as drinks to keep the child&#xD;
                hydrated but without using a straw.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analgesics and/or antibiotics will be prescribed if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Planning for space maintenance will be considered as well. All dental injections&#xD;
                and extractions will be administered by the same operator, who will be assisted by&#xD;
                a trained dental assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Following extraction, follow up after 24-hours will be planned via telephone calls&#xD;
      to assess any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study will be conducted following the ethical principles for&#xD;
      medical research involving human subjects in Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval will&#xD;
      be obtained from the Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University&#xD;
      before commencing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives, risks and benefits of the study will be explained to parents/ guardians and a&#xD;
      signed informed consent will be obtained prior to treatment. Verbal consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from the children before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and children will be given age-appropriate oral hygiene instructions including proper&#xD;
      teeth brushing twice a day especially before bedtime, as well as flossing if indicated. These&#xD;
      measures will be demonstrated on a model. A fluoridated toothpaste and a brush will be&#xD;
      provided to each participant on the day of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All needed treatment will be provided to the child including any restorations, space&#xD;
      maintainers and fluoride application. Post extraction instructions will be explained well to&#xD;
      the parents and patients to ensure good wound healing. All the possible clinical and/or&#xD;
      adverse outcomes will be explained to the parents and they will be asked to report&#xD;
      immediately if any of them occurs.&#xD;
