  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      belatacept is a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker that was approved by Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. This treatment is indicated as an alternative to Calcineurin&#xD;
      Inhibitors (CNIs) for prophylaxis of graft rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
      Long term efficacy and safety outcomes of a kidney transplant population converted to a&#xD;
      belatacept regimen after transplant have not been yet reported.&#xD;

      belatacept is a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker that was approved by Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. This treatment is indicated as an alternative to Calcineurin&#xD;
      Inhibitors (CNIs) for prophylaxis of graft rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
      Major studies evaluating belatacept showed that de novo kidney transplant patients treated&#xD;
      with belatacept presented an improved renal function with a higher average estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared to ciclosporin (CsA) regimen in patients.&#xD;
      Conversion to belatacept after transplant seems to be safe even in highly sensitized&#xD;
      patients. However, long term efficacy and safety outcomes of a kidney transplant population&#xD;
      converted to a belatacept regimen after transplant and compared to a matched control group&#xD;
      under a CNIs regimen have not been yet reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter cohort of kidney transplant patients, will be use to match patients converted&#xD;
      to a belatacept immunosuppressive regimen to a control group under CNIs immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

    <description>Graft loss is defined as either functional loss or physical loss (nephrectomy). Functional loss is defined as an eGFR&lt; 15 ml/min/1.73m2 or consecutive days of dialysis. For patients who died with a functioning graft, graft survival will be censored at the time of death as a survived or functional graft.</description>
