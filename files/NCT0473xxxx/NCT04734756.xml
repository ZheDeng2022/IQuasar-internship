    <textblock>
      To confirm the effectiveness and safety of the Dragonfly transcatheter mitral valve repair&#xD;
      system for the treatment of symptomatic moderate-to-severe(3+) or severe(4+) degenerative&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation (DMR) in high surgical risk subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, objective performance criteria design. Patients are&#xD;
      clinically symptomatic patients with chronic moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) organic&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation (DMR) who were assessed as high risk for surgical procedures by the&#xD;
      cardiac team at the local clinical trial site. After signing an informed consent form,&#xD;
      subjects are enrolled and treated with the DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair&#xD;
      System. All subjects receive clinical follow-up immediately after the procedure, before&#xD;
      discharge, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success at 12 months is used as the primary endpoint, with the definition as&#xD;
      freedom from death, valve dysfunction surgery, and moderately severe or severe mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation (MR &gt;2+) at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include acute procedural success, acute device success, and surgery&#xD;
      for valve dysfunction, NYHA class I or II at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and the&#xD;
      improvement in the quality of life change from baseline as assessed by the Kansas City&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score at 12 months after the procedure. The safety&#xD;
      endpoints include major adverse events (MAEs), all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality at&#xD;
      30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Valgen Medtech DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral&#xD;
      Valve Repair System in the treatment of patients with clinically significant chronic moderate&#xD;
      (3+) or severe (4+) degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) who have been evaluated by the&#xD;
      local heart team as being at high surgical risk, and to evaluate the product performance.&#xD;
