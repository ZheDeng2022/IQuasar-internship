  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the future, we plan to conduct an 8-week diet intervention to investigate whether a&#xD;
      healthy Nordic diet improves depression symptoms. The present pilot study tested whether the&#xD;
      planned meals and diets were well-liked and accepted by participants (both depressed and&#xD;
      non-depressed) in order to ensure that the future diet intervention will be feasible and&#xD;
      successful. We also investigated whether any changes in health occurred after 8 days of this&#xD;
      diet intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After providing their written informed consent, participants were randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a healthy Nordic diet or a control diet for 8 days. All meals were provided and&#xD;
      minimal food preparation was required. Participants picked up their food outside the study&#xD;
      kitchen every 3 days. Before and after the intervention, health-related self-rated&#xD;
      questionnaires were completed. For every meal during the intervention, participants completed&#xD;
      a questionnaire on their perceptions of the meal. Every evening a questionnaire was completed&#xD;
      to assess dietary adherence. At the end of the study, a final evaluation questionnaire was&#xD;
      completed to assess participants' perceptions of the diet and study as a whole.&#xD;
