  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the improvement of health system, the life span of Asians has increased tremendously&#xD;
      especially in Malaysia. As an early preparation to be an 'aging country' in 2023, Malaysia&#xD;
      needs to prepare infrastructure and policy to improve quality of life (QoL) in older adults.&#xD;
      Glaucoma is an aging related chronic disease that cause progressive optic neuropathy and&#xD;
      visual field defect1. The main aim of glaucoma treatment is to slow down disease progression&#xD;
      and preserve patient's QoL2. Modification of intraocular (IOP) is believed to be the mainstay&#xD;
      of treatment but may not prevent progression of the disease. Modification of lifestyle has&#xD;
      been found to change the prognosis of many chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      However, there is minimal evidence on the effect of lifestyle modification on glaucoma.&#xD;
      Although constricted visual field almost asymptomatic especially in primary open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma but many domestic injuries such as fall has been reported. Glaucoma patients&#xD;
      reported greatest restriction with mobility especially driving compared to the other&#xD;
      domains3,4. Reduction of walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was also found in&#xD;
      those with bilateral visual field loss5. Progressive constriction of visual field has been&#xD;
      found to increase dependency, reduce mobility, pleasure of reading and QoL of glaucoma&#xD;
      patients6. This will lead to psychological and emotional disturbance, in certain cases even&#xD;
      resulted in depression. On the other hand, being physically active is found to have some&#xD;
      protective effect against development and severity of glaucoma8,9. Thus, identifying problems&#xD;
      related to physical activities in constricted visual field is important for improvement of&#xD;
      rehabilitation and exercise regime for glaucoma patients. An exercise regime must be&#xD;
      effective without causing major changes to IOP, safe in patients with constricted visual&#xD;
      field and sensitive to social culture of Malaysians. Addressing these issues will lessen&#xD;
      dependency and promotes healthy living among older adults. Improvement in navigation perhaps&#xD;
      may increase the physical activities in glaucoma. Reading is another important pleasure in&#xD;
      life. Visual field defect in glaucoma patients has been reported to associate with slower&#xD;
      reading speed, saccade rate and visual span10,11. Identification of factors associated with&#xD;
      difficulty in reading among glaucoma patients and development of rehabilitation regime in&#xD;
      reading may improve the happiness index in literate patients. Nevertheless, there is no&#xD;
      specific rehabilitation program to improve reading abilities among glaucoma patients. A&#xD;
      combination of visual rehabilitation of low vision therapy and occupational therapy is ideal.&#xD;
      Although, there is improvement in reading ability and mobility post low visual aid&#xD;
      rehabilitation but there is no evidence on glaucoma patients specifically12. Improvement in&#xD;
      daily living and dependency may improve their QoL. Happiness perhaps may improve the balance&#xD;
      between oxidative stress damage and antioxidant level. Many previous studies discovered that&#xD;
      various biomarkers of oxidative stress are elevated in people with depression, and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders13. Similarly, oxidative stress has been implicated in pathogenesis of glaucoma and&#xD;
      accelerates retinal ganglion cell damage in glaucoma14. Indirectly, improvement of QoL will&#xD;
      help in halting the progression of visual field defect. Based on the previous research&#xD;
      project on Malays in Malaysia, navigation and mobility has been identified to be mostly&#xD;
      affect in primary glaucoma patients based on QoL questionnaires. Physical activities have&#xD;
      potential protective effect against progression and severity of glaucoma9. Improvement in&#xD;
      navigation, physical activities and reading ability, perhaps may improve their QoL. The main&#xD;
      problem is how do we improve their navigation, physical activities and reading ability&#xD;
      despite their constricted visual field. The most important step is to understand the problem&#xD;
      and issues pertaining to the navigation, physical activities and reading faced by patients&#xD;
      with glaucoma.&#xD;

      Kedah, Malaysia Hospital Melaka, Melaka, Malaysia Study population Reference population:&#xD;
      Primary glaucoma patients-primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure&#xD;
      glaucoma (PACG) Target population: Primary glaucoma patients (POAG and PACG) who attended&#xD;
      glaucoma clinic in HUSM, HRPZII, HSB and Hospital Melaka Source population: Patients aged 40&#xD;
      to 70 years old diagnosed with POAG or PACG who are attending the glaucoma clinic, HUSM,&#xD;
      HRPZII, HSB and Hospital Melaka from June 2020 until February 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling frame: Glaucoma database in eye clinic of HUSM, HRPZII, HSB and Hospital Melaka&#xD;
      Sampling method and subject recruitment The sampling method is based on the specific&#xD;
      objective and phases of the study For objective 1: a simple random sampling will be used. For&#xD;
      objective 2: convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For objective 3, 4 and 5: randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted. Using block&#xD;
      randomization method with sequentially numbered in opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE), the&#xD;
      eligible patients will be randomized into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Intervention group Group B: Non-intervention group Primary investigators&#xD;
      (Postgraduate students) will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definition Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG): A chronic, progressive optic&#xD;
      neuropathies that characterised by structural changes in the optic nerve head and/ or with&#xD;
      visual field defect without identifiable causes (Asia Pacific Glaucoma guidelines, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG): An eye with an occludable drainage angle and features&#xD;
      indicating that trabecular obstruction by the peripheral iris has occurred, such as&#xD;
      peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure and optic neuropathy (Foster et&#xD;
      al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Intraocular pressure: Target intraocular pressure throughout this study is dependent&#xD;
      on severity of the disease based on threshold IOP (Sihota et al., 2018). In this study,&#xD;
      target intraocular pressure will be personalized accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lens status: Phakic is defined as patients with an intact natural lens without visually&#xD;
      significant cataract. A person with visually significant cataract was defined by having, in&#xD;
      either eye: any LOCS II grading of ≥2, best-corrected visual acuity of &lt;6/12 in the&#xD;
      cataractous eye, cataract as primary cause of vision impairment in that eye, and patient&#xD;
      report that general vision was fair, poor, very poor, or blind (Ritcher et al, 2009).&#xD;
      Pseudophakic refers to patients who have underwent lens extraction procedure with&#xD;
      implantation of artificial intraocular lens for more than 3 months prior to recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to treatment: Patients who adhere and persistent to instillation of topical&#xD;
      intraocular pressure lowering medications as recommended by their physician throughout follow&#xD;
      up (Robin et al, 2011). Adherence is defined as less than 3 times missed their medication in&#xD;
      a week. Persistence is defined as continuously on prescribed medication for more than 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual rehabilitation: The process of treatment and education that helps individuals who are&#xD;
      visually disabled to attain maximum function, a sense of wellbeing, a personally satisfying&#xD;
      level of independence, and optimum quality of life (American Optometric Association, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reading speed: rate at which a person reads written text (printed or electronic) in a&#xD;
      specific unit of time (Muñoz B et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the definition of reading speed will differ according to the task of reading&#xD;
      and the reading material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reading speed in reading the Bahasa Malaysia reading chart: number of words read per&#xD;
           minute&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reading the newspaper print and pharmacy label print: time taken to finish a reading&#xD;
           task in minute&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reading book: number of pages read per hour/day Eye movement during reading: movement of&#xD;
           the eye between the start of first saccade and the end of final saccade during the&#xD;
           reading (Muñoz B et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head movement during reading: all head movement during reading including of&#xD;
      modulatory-velocity component with eye saccades and constant-velocity component independent&#xD;
      of eye saccades (Muñoz B et al, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life: The term &quot;quality of life (QoL)&quot; is defined by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      as individuals' perception of their position in life in the context of culture and value&#xD;
      systems in which they live in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns&#xD;
      (World Health Group, 1995). Total scoring and each domain score of Bahasa Malaysia version&#xD;
      GlauQoL -36 questionnaires will be used to determine the QoL. It has been translated and&#xD;
      validated and piloted in 96 samples. All 36 translated questions were retained as the&#xD;
      Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.85 (Chandramohan et al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression: a feeling of depressed mood or loss of interest with at least five out of nine&#xD;
      symptoms present for a diagnosis of major depression. The mGDS 14 questionnaire was used in&#xD;
      this study to assess depression among primary glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bump: body contact above the knee, excluding the hands-on adjacent objects. Stumble: a change&#xD;
      in posture or gait due to contact with an object below the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be divided into three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1: identification factor affecting navigation, physical activities &amp; reading&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2: development and validation of rehabilitation for navigation, physical&#xD;
           activities &amp; reading&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3: evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation on clinical parameters,&#xD;
           quality of life and oxidative stress Phase 1 A case control study will be conducted&#xD;
           involving POAG and PACG patients with different severity according to Esterman binocular&#xD;
           visual field. An age-matched control subjects will also be recruited. We estimated a&#xD;
           sample size of 40 glaucoma subjects and 40 age-matched controls. Selected patients must&#xD;
           be physical and mentally fit. Simple random sampling will be applied to patients who&#xD;
           attend ophthalmology clinic for other ophthalmological conditions except for glaucoma&#xD;
           especially those who were on follow-up for dry eye, non-visually significant cataract,&#xD;
           pseudophakic patients. Patients that fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
           selected during their follow up. These patients will be grouped as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular examination: Baseline examination will be conducted in all subjects including visual&#xD;
      acuity assessment, contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity and Esterman binocular visual field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigation &amp; physical activities: A stimulated area will be created using the existing&#xD;
      facility in occupation rehabilitation unit, HUSM. Similar set up will be conducted in HRPZII,&#xD;
      Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah and Hospital Melaka. Glaucoma patients and age-matched control&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to navigate in the stimulated area and several areas will be equipped&#xD;
      with closed circuit television (CCTV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A predefined obstacle course navigation will be used to measure mobility performance among&#xD;
      glaucoma and control groups. Subjects will be instructed to walk through the course as&#xD;
      quickly and safely as possible while avoiding all obstacles in their path. The course will be&#xD;
      constructed in a maze form, 30m length in total and seeded with obstacles made with styrofoam&#xD;
      that represent objects in a patient's home environment. The illumination along the path range&#xD;
      from 100 to 300 lux. Before walking through the course, participants will be given&#xD;
      instructions and directions to ensure that they understood the path.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility performance will be assessed by the time required to complete the obstacle course&#xD;
      and the number of mobility incidents, which included bumps, stumbles, and orientation&#xD;
      problems. A bump will be defined as a body contact above the knee, excluding the hands. A&#xD;
      stumble will be defined as a change in posture or gait due to contact with an object below&#xD;
      the knee. An orientation problem will be defined as a change in direction that was not&#xD;
      consistent with the instructions. A trained observer will be following the participants&#xD;
      closely behind to record time and bumps. Surveillance system comprising video camera to&#xD;
      record the activities will be implemented as well. Errors are quantified on a 3 point scale,&#xD;
      where errors were scored as 1 point if the subject made contact with an obstacle but was able&#xD;
      to correct in ≤ 5 sec, 2 points if the subject took 5-15 sec to correct errors, and 3 points&#xD;
      if the subject took &gt; 15 sec to self-correct or required the assistance of one of the&#xD;
      research assistants to correct the error. Travel time will be converted into walking speed&#xD;
      (meters per second) by dividing the distance of established travel path by the time to&#xD;
      complete the course. The converted measure permits a direct comparison of mobility&#xD;
      performance across other routes and studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special exercise: A special exercise will be designed that is safe for person with&#xD;
      constricted visual field; combination of isometric and aerobic exercise. IOP will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and at certain phases of the exercise. If there is an increase of more than 20% from&#xD;
      baseline IOP at certain phase of the exercise, that phase will be excluded or replaced&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reading: Subject will be asked to read at 40cm (reading distance) with the reading material&#xD;
      on a special pedestal. Reading materials include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Universiti Teknologi Mara -Malay related words (UiTM-MrW)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Universiti Teknologi Mara- Malay unrelated words (UiTM-MuW)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Different sizes of text of common reading materials (Bahasa Malaysia):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pharmacy label print (0.131° print)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Newspaper print size (0.26° print)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Small newspaper headline/heading size (0.525° print)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Large newspaper headline size (1.71° print)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A book in Bahasa Malaysia will be selected Reading speed will be assessed using Matlab&#xD;
           version 8.3 programme. Eye and head trackers will be used (Polhemus Visiontrak Desktop&#xD;
           300) to document the head and eye movement. Reading will be done in a fix light&#xD;
           intensity (500-600lux). A rehabilitation reading regime with or without low vision aid&#xD;
           will be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      From phase 1 findings, a special rehabilitation device and programme will be designed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Navigation and mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reading A user friendly and inexpensive device and program with minimal usage of low&#xD;
           vision aid will be designed and piloted for 30 glaucoma patients and 30 controls. Simple&#xD;
           random sampling will be applied on the patients and control subjects recruited for phase&#xD;
           1 study. An advertisement is also attached here(phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices will include wearable body sensor vibrator and special smartphone apps for&#xD;
      recognition of objects. The control subject will be using the special glasses (available in&#xD;
      the department) that simulated constricted visual field. For the pilot study, the&#xD;
      effectiveness will be considered based on the evaluation conducted for phase 1. The recruited&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to practice according to the rehabilitation protocol for 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Improvement will be made based on the outcome of the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After development or modification of the program, the recruited subjects will be trained and&#xD;
      asked to perform it at home for two weeks. They will be provided with a dairy (to ensure that&#xD;
      they have conducted it daily). They will be seen after two weeks and the rehabilitation&#xD;
      method will be assessed using specific questionnaire. Tentative questionnaire is attached&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigation and physical activities- Any step of the program will be eliminated from the&#xD;
      program if it is deemed dangerous (20% of the subjects reported bumping, stumbling, fall or&#xD;
      near fall), difficult to manoeuvre (20% of the subjects have difficulty or expressed&#xD;
      difficulty in performing the step) and impractical (20% of the subjects expressed infrequent&#xD;
      of performing the step at home). Assessment will be made based on simple questionnaire, which&#xD;
      will be made once the rehabilitation program has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise - IOP will be obtained from the patients before and 10min after performing each&#xD;
      important step of the exercise using tonometer. If any step of the exercise cause elevation&#xD;
      of IOP of more than 2mmHg from the baseline IOP will be eliminated and replaced (if deem&#xD;
      necessary). Patients will also be asked on the feasibility and practicality using the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reading- if the reading material (book) is found to difficult, the material will be replaced.&#xD;
      Any new movement of the eye or head that is scored difficult to manoeuvre or impractical will&#xD;
      be removed. A questionnaire with Likert score scoring will be developed after completion of&#xD;
      phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of acceptable rehabilitation regime are as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigation and physical activities- reduction of at least 40% of bumping or stumbling to&#xD;
      objects or fall in simulated area. An increase of 40% of total step per day based on&#xD;
      accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise - An increase of 30% of based on accelerometer. Reading -An increase of 20% of&#xD;
      reading task and reading speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized single blinded control trial study will be conducted using the newly developed&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme from phase 2. A known case of POAG and PACG patients who are&#xD;
      compliance to treatment and follow up will be selected. Patients involved in phase 1 will not&#xD;
      be recruited into this study. A total of 300 patients will be involved (100-navigation and&#xD;
      mobility, 100- exercise and 100-reading). Based on the most recent reliable Humphrey visual&#xD;
      field, only those who has more than 10 degree from fixation using Estermann binocular&#xD;
      analysis will be selected. Other selection includes best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 on&#xD;
      the better seeing eye, pseudophakic or phakic (without visually significant cataract) and&#xD;
      without history of surgical intervention 3 months prior to recruitment. Those with severe&#xD;
      hearing impairment, physical disabilities such as stroke, limbs amputation, macular and&#xD;
      retinal pathology, and on low vision aids will be excluded. Using block randomization method&#xD;
      with sequentially numbered in opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE), the eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Intervention group Group B: Non-intervention group In both groups, their usual&#xD;
      topical treatment will be continued. They will be advised to be compliance to the existing&#xD;
      treatment. This study will take 6 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment An introductory session will be conducted to all selected subjects. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study will be explained, and compliance will be emphasized. Venesection will&#xD;
      be conducted and 3cc of blood will be obtained. The blood will be kept in the plain bottles&#xD;
      and analysed for the level of total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (in group A &amp; B) will be given the GlauQol-36 and mGDS-14 questionnaire in Bahasa&#xD;
      Malaysia (Appendix A &amp; B) and be given adequate time to read and answer the questionnaire. If&#xD;
      the patient does not understand the questionnaire, they can obtain clarification from the&#xD;
      primary investigators (SMCM &amp; NS). The GlauQoL-36 questionnaire consists of 36 questions&#xD;
      grouped into 7 domains (daily life, driving, psychological well-being, self-image, anxiety,&#xD;
      burden of treatment and confidence in healthcare). Each question was given 4- and 5- point on&#xD;
      the Likert scale. The total score from each domain was summed and the score calculated. The&#xD;
      mGDS-14 questionnaire consists of 14 questions. It has a yes/no answer and is scored 1 or 0&#xD;
      for each question. Patients with the score of 8 and above are considered depressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometer will be given to the patients with the instruction to wear it all day long&#xD;
      except for sleeping and bathing. A baseline reading speed, visual span, eye and head movement&#xD;
      will be obtained in those involved in reading rehabilitation program using the reading&#xD;
      charts, newspaper and pharmacy label print. These assessments will be conducted twice; before&#xD;
      the rehabilitation program and after 6 months of the program. Reading materials in Bahasa&#xD;
      Malaysia (a book to read) will also be given. Clinical parameters including IOP and ONH&#xD;
      imaging to assess the RNFL thickness and ONH parameters will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation regime&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.Navigation &amp; mobility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation sessions will be conducted in the Rehabilitation Medicine Unit of HUSM,&#xD;
      HRPZII and Hospital Melaka provided by the Occupational Therapy division. The patient is&#xD;
      expected and encouraged to come with a carer (who live together with the patient) during the&#xD;
      early part of the sessions. After randomization, patients in the group A will be assessed&#xD;
      using modified Barthell index, the patient's limitations in daily activities with special&#xD;
      attention to the components related to restricted visual field. An introductory session will&#xD;
      be conducted by the occupational rehabilitation therapist (baseline), patients will be asked&#xD;
      to practice it at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the respective limitations the patient will be taught of ways to get around the&#xD;
      problems, emphasizing on the Visual Perception and Sensory Motor Ability as outlined by the&#xD;
      Chessington Occupational Therapy Neurological Assessment Battery to maximize function, health&#xD;
      and wellbeing. A set of realistic goals will be established together with the patient whether&#xD;
      using the restorative or compensatory methods to promote motivation and enhance confidence.&#xD;
      Restorative method includes restorative visual field training, optokinetic training and and&#xD;
      search task training focussed at improving the loss in visual field or disability arises from&#xD;
      the loss of patient's eye field. Interventions involve compensation which are strategies to&#xD;
      minimize mismatch in the patient's ability with task difficulty; and substitution which can&#xD;
      include environmental modifications to enhance vision such as adjustment of lighting.&#xD;
      Subsequent sessions will involve consolidation of the concepts with supervised practices&#xD;
      comprising indoor and outdoor activities to enhance patients' understanding and confidence&#xD;
      and encourage participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation education and activities include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dressing Light closet to improve acuity. Hang matching clothes together. Pin socks&#xD;
           together when placing them in the washer so they will stay matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feeding Provide high contrast. Ensure that plates contrast with table surface. Avoid&#xD;
           patterned table clothes. Arrange food on the plate in a clockwise fashion and orient the&#xD;
           person to the arrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Personal hygiene and grooming activities Reduce clutter in bathroom and kitchen&#xD;
           cabinets. Use high contrast bathmat and minified mirrors&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Communication and environmental hardware adaptations Use talking watches or clocks to&#xD;
           tell time and high contrast doorknobs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional mobility Mobility is eased with the clearing of pathways and the minimizing&#xD;
           of clutter and furniture. Lighting in hallways and entryways is also needed. The person&#xD;
           with constricted visual field needs to optimize visual scanning abilities by learning to&#xD;
           turn and position the head frequently when mobile or participating in an activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Scanning activity or search task While focusing on a point central to the visual axis,&#xD;
           the patient is asked to arrange wooden cubes forming vertical and horizontal lines one&#xD;
           at a time. The instruction will be given to arrange from left to right, then right to&#xD;
           left, top to bottom and lastly bottom to the top. Patient's visual field is estimated&#xD;
           and described to the patient. Patient is advised on the 'danger area' outside the visual&#xD;
           field that can pose various risks to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Room orientation and memory This is applied to a small area such as a bedroom or a&#xD;
           toilet. The patient is asked to stand inside a simulated room in the Rehabilitation Unit&#xD;
           and describe the names of the objects that he/she can see. Emphasizing on the location&#xD;
           of the objects and their directions from the patient (right, left, in front, behind),&#xD;
           patient is trained to systematically orientate himself in the room relative to those&#xD;
           objects. Certain objects are highlighted to the patient as a precaution to avoid&#xD;
           stumbles and falls. For safety, cleaning supplies should be placed separately from food&#xD;
           supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Orientation and mobility This activity covers a larger area that the patient will be in&#xD;
           which is the patient's home. Patient will be instructed regarding room familiarisation&#xD;
           according to the house's structure as described by patient's carer with the help of a&#xD;
           drawing. For example, the patient is taught to memorize the number of steps needed to be&#xD;
           made to get to the toilet from his room, and in what direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Reading (this is not part of the reading rehabilitation) Patient will be taught to label&#xD;
           the things that are of importance to them at home to aid recognition, for example&#xD;
           bottles of spice. The letters should be of appropriate size deemed legible by the&#xD;
           patient according to the patient's field of view, and of high contrast. For patients on&#xD;
           medications, they are advised to use medication organizer to get them organized.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Eye-hand coordination To enhance hand-eye coordination, a pegboard is used as a form of&#xD;
           exercise for the patient. Patient is asked to match coloured pegs into its corresponding&#xD;
           holes according to a reference template. This training also allows the patient to get&#xD;
           used to the extent of field of view that he possesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Optokinetic training programme This programme is built based on the knowledge that eye&#xD;
           and body movements are coordinated by the same parts of the brain, which is important in&#xD;
           maintaining stability and balance. Repeated training helps to re-teach the body of its&#xD;
           responsible actions, by the means of precise eye movements. This is done via optokinetic&#xD;
           eye programme to accelerate physical and mental fitness. Fortunately, the high&#xD;
           functional adaptability of the brain permits positive training and learning as the&#xD;
           person ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational therapist will conduct a home visit if necessary. A diary will be given to&#xD;
      assess their compliance. Reassessment will be done for every 2 weeks for 2 months and every&#xD;
      month for the next 2 months. Another home visit will be conducted if the patients show poor&#xD;
      understanding or compliance during the re-assessment evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group B will also be given a diary to record their activities. In both groups,&#xD;
      their usual topical treatment will be continued. They will be advised to be compliance to the&#xD;
      existing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Special exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An instruction course will be conducted and a CD (with step by step exercise demonstration)&#xD;
      will be given to the patients in group A. They will be asked to come for another session in 2&#xD;
      weeks. Then they will be asked to conduct the exercise for at least three times a week.&#xD;
      Exercise diary and accelerometer will also be given to patients of both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Reading regime:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A briefing will be given to all the patients involved in this regime. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a reading task (reading the given book) a day; number of pages&#xD;
      completed in an hour per day, and time taken to complete a page in the given book. They will&#xD;
      be asked to record the time they have completed the task in their reading diary. Any extra&#xD;
      reading task will also be recorded this include reading Quran and newspaper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final assessment At 6 months post recruitment, patients in group A and B will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the Malay version of Glau-QOL 36 and MGD14. Accelerometer reading will also be&#xD;
      documented. The number of pages read for the given task will be compiled. The reading diary&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Reading speed will be calculated daily and the mean reading speed will be&#xD;
      used for analysis. Another venesection will be conducted to examine the level of TAC.&#xD;
      Clinical assessment including IOP, RNFL thickness and ONH parameters will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum TAC analysis Level of TAC analysis will be conducted using using QuantiChromTM&#xD;
      Antioxidant Assay Kit (DTAC-100). It will be centrifuged 10 min at 14000 rpm, the plasma will&#xD;
      be used as sample for calculation of total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Plasma can be stored&#xD;
      in a freeze at -80°C in the laboratory (stable for 1 month) for future analysis if required.&#xD;
      After preparing the reagent provided from the test kit (DTAC-100), patient plasma will be&#xD;
      mixed with the diluted reagent in a plate which will be read at optical density of 570nm. The&#xD;
      result obtained will be plotted against the standard concentration and a standard curve is&#xD;
      obtained. By using the graph plotted and a formula provided in the test kit, the serum TAC&#xD;
      will be calculated. Serum total antioxidant capacity will be calculated at baseline and at&#xD;
      six months post recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Statistical Analysis The data entry and analysis will be performed by using&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 licensed to USM. For numerical&#xD;
      data, paired t-test will be used to compare the changes at baseline and 6 months post&#xD;
      intervention. Multivariate analysis will also be conducted&#xD;
