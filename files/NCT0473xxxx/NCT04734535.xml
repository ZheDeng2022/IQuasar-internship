  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation in open, elective, spine surgery is to collect&#xD;
      data to support the removal of the neurosurgical exclusion from the currently approved&#xD;
      indication for the use of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows. This study is primarily designed to assess&#xD;
      safety of the device for use in spine surgery, although efficacy information will also be&#xD;
      captured and reported.&#xD;
