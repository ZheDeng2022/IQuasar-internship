  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cochlear implant users perceive mainly sound amplitude modulation cues. Processing of these&#xD;
      amplitude modulations can be subject to interferences, so that the perception of a modulation&#xD;
      in a target sound can be impaired by a superimposed sound if this sound contains a similar&#xD;
      modulation. Such phenomenon, which is observed both in subjects with normal-hearing and in&#xD;
      cochlear-implant users, could be explained by difficulties to direct attention to relevant&#xD;
      information in complex sound signals. Selective auditory attention also plays a crucial role&#xD;
      in speech comprehension in cocktail-party situations where the speech of multiple talkers get&#xD;
      mixed at the ear of a listener. Cochlear implant users typically struggle in these&#xD;
      cocktail-party situations and report intense listening effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial aims at evaluating the contribution of selective auditory&#xD;
      attention for sound modulations to the listening effort of patients with cochlear implants&#xD;
      and of healthy volunteers with normal-hearing during speech perception under&#xD;
      cocktail-party-like conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective auditory attention abilities of patients and controls will be assessed using a&#xD;
      psychoacoustical test whereby their ability to detect a target sound amplitude modulation&#xD;
      will be measured both in the absence and in the presence of an interfering (i.e. distracting)&#xD;
      amplitude modulation occurring in a distant spectral region from that of the target. The&#xD;
      effect of this distractor's presence on modulation detection performance will serve as a&#xD;
      behavioural index of the subject's auditory attention capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attentional capacity index will then be tested as a predicting factor for the listening&#xD;
      effort of the subject during a speech-in-noise consonant identification task. Listening&#xD;
      effort will be measured from the pupil dilation response to the presented speech units&#xD;
      (pseudowords).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enhance our understanding of cochlear implant user's perception and listening&#xD;
      effort and will serve as a basis for prognostic tests of listening effort and of implantation&#xD;
      success for cochlear implant candidates, based on a simple measurement of auditory&#xD;
      attentional abilities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants to this trial will be adult patients with cochlear implants (experimental group)&#xD;
      and adults with normal-for-the-age hearing (healthy volunteers or controls), recruited in a&#xD;
      single center (Reference Centre for Cochlear Implants in Adults, Otorhinolaryngology Service,&#xD;
      Auditory Implants Functional Unit, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital Group). All patients&#xD;
      followed-up at the clinical center and satisfying the inclusion criteria will be addressed a&#xD;
      mail informing them about the study. They will be contacted by phone after a reflexion delay&#xD;
      of 15 days to check their understanding of the study and probe their agreement or refusal to&#xD;
      participate. Healthy controls will be recruited by a call broadcasted through mailing lists&#xD;
      dedicated to volunteers for scientific experiments. Those who answer the call by phone or&#xD;
      email will be convoked by order of contact, according to the study's needs, and given&#xD;
      information about the study. Signed informed consent will be collected from all participants&#xD;
      prior to participation, on the day of inclusion, as well as their demographic data,&#xD;
      educational level and, for patients with cochlear implants, the date of implantation and&#xD;
      hearing loss etiology. Each subject will be identified by a unique series of 9 alphanumerical&#xD;
      characters. Healthy volunteers will undergo tonal audiometry and will be definitively&#xD;
      included in the study only after normal hearing for the age is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire participation is planned to take place in a single session lasting 1 hour and 40&#xD;
      minutes, on the day of inclusion, including consent collection, preliminary measurements (CT&#xD;
      thresholds for patients, audiometry for controls), material calibration, psychoacoustic tests&#xD;
      and speech recognition tests with oculometry. Only as an exception in cases where the entire&#xD;
      session could not be completed in the allocated time, participants will be invited to come&#xD;
      back for a second session on a different day to finish incomplete tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be performed in a soundproofed booth. Participants will sit in front of a&#xD;
      screen displaying a visual fixation point during trials, as well as relevant information (end&#xD;
      of trial, response alternatives, performance feedback). Pupil diameter will be recorded&#xD;
      during the tests using an eye-tracker device (Tobii TX300). Prior to the tests, ambient&#xD;
      luminosity will be adjusted so that the subject's pupil be at the center of its measured&#xD;
      dynamics. Cochlear implant patients will be equipped with an implant processor dedicated to&#xD;
      the experiment (reference processor), ensuring their own processor's settings won't be&#xD;
      modified and that the tests be performed with a well-functioning processor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychoacoustic tests will consist in an amplitude modulation detection task with a&#xD;
      3-interval, 3-alternative forced choice design. In each trial, participants will be presented&#xD;
      with 3 successive sounds in a random order, only one of which constrains the target amplitude&#xD;
      modulation and which the participant must report. All presented sounds will contain two&#xD;
      superimposed sinusoidal carriers (e.g. 500 Hz and 4000 Hz). The target amplitude modulation&#xD;
      will be applied to only one these two carriers (the target carrier), in only one of the three&#xD;
      presented sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The settings of the reference processor during these tests will deactivate all electrodes&#xD;
      instead of two, making sure that the stimulation is maximally focused in two, well separated&#xD;
      regions of the cochlea. The acoustic frequency of these active electrodes might be modified&#xD;
      compared to the usual processor, so as to guarantee that they will each be maximally&#xD;
      activated by one of the two stimulus carriers. The dynamics of the active electrodes will be&#xD;
      set with the own C and T thresholds of the patient, and sound calibration will ensure that&#xD;
      the average stimulation level correspond to 50% of the CT dynamics. Stimuli will be presented&#xD;
      to patients through the analogic input of the reference processor and through headphones, on&#xD;
      a single, randomly-drawn side (left or right), at an average level of 70 decibel Sound&#xD;
      Pressure Level, to the healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will comprise two conditions presented alternately. In the first condition, there&#xD;
      will be no other modulation than the target. In the second condition, a distracting&#xD;
      modulation will be applied to the non-target carrier, in the three intervals. Both target and&#xD;
      distracting modulations will have the same 8-Hz rate. Performance in these two conditions&#xD;
      will be assessed the measurement of amplitude modulation detection thresholds (AMDT) using an&#xD;
      adaptive procedure, repeated twice per condition. The difference in performance between the&#xD;
      two conditions will serve as an index of the auditory attentional capacity of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a training followed by the AMDT measurements, as well as tests with&#xD;
      constant modulation levels and joint pupil diameter measurement, all of which will be&#xD;
      distributed in blocks meant to last between 5 and 8 minutes and interleaved by breaks for a&#xD;
      total of about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final, speech recognition tests will consist in a consonant identification task. The&#xD;
      settings of the processor in these tests will be identical to the patient's processor usual&#xD;
      settings, and sounds will be presented in free field through loudspeakers, at a comfortable&#xD;
      level (65 decibel Sound Pressure Level for target speech and 55 decibel Sound Pressure Level&#xD;
      for interfering speech). In each trial, participants will be presented with the recording of&#xD;
      a pseudoword, pronounced by a female voice, of the form [aCaCa] where [C] is a consonant to&#xD;
      identify among 16 alternatives. This test will be performed once in silence and a second time&#xD;
      in the presence of interfering pseudospeech pronounced by a different voice, with a&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratio of +10 decibel. There will be 48 trials in each condition. Pupil&#xD;
      diameter will be recorded during the test so as to measure listening effort in each condition&#xD;
      as the mean pupil dilation response with reference to a pre-stimulus baseline. The difference&#xD;
      of this pupil dilation response between the two conditions will serve as a measurement of the&#xD;
      amount of listening effort induced by the presence of interfering speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During data analysis, the linear correlation between the auditory attention capacity index&#xD;
      (from the psychoacoustic test) and the interference-induced listening effort measurement&#xD;
      (from the speech recognition test) will be tested by means of a Pearson test, separately for&#xD;
      each of the two subject groups (cochlear implant patients and normal-hearing healthy&#xD;
      volunteers), with a 0.05 p-value significance threshold.&#xD;
