    <textblock>
      In this study, patients taking pyrrolitinib alone or combined with pyrrolitinib were&#xD;
      recruited (170 cases of secondary prevention and 300 cases of non-secondary prevention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-secondary prevention: Explore the recovery time of oral loperamide 4mg T.I.D. for&#xD;
      pyrrolitinib induced diarrhea of 1-2 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary prevention: To explore the incidence of grade 3 and above diarrhea during&#xD;
      c1D1-C1D22 in patients with oral loperamide 4 mg, T.I.D. (D1-7) →4 mg, B.I.D. (D8-21).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study can only be formally carried out with the written approval of the ethics committee.&#xD;
      Investigators regularly submit annual research reports to the ethics committee. Investigators&#xD;
      will inform the ethics committee in writing when the study is discontinued and / or&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were required to sign informed consent before entering the group. All updated&#xD;
      versions of informed consent and written information will be provided to the subjects during&#xD;
      the participant's participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental design stage, the statistical principle was used to make reasonable and&#xD;
      effective arrangements for the relevant factors. Employ statistical experts to calculate the&#xD;
      sample size and data statistics, and participate in the design process. Data collection and&#xD;
      follow-up were conducted by specially assigned personnel, professional doctors were assigned&#xD;
      to conduct data review regularly, and special data management personnel were provided. They&#xD;
      will ensure the authenticity, reliability and security of data throughout the process.&#xD;
