      Phase 2A single-arm exploratory clinical study in up to 12 adult subjects aged 18 and older&#xD;
      with primary glioma, IDH1 mutation, and uncontrolled focal-onset seizure activity to&#xD;
      determine the potential efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ES-481 as adjunctive therapy&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects greater than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with brain tumour-related epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a history of uncontrolled seizures (at least three focal-onset seizure&#xD;
             per month over the last 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects currently being treated with at least one appropriate AED&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have had a brain MRI performed in the last three months preceding the&#xD;
             signing of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with primary brain tumour with an IDH1 mutation (to be determined during the&#xD;
             screening period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with satisfactory hematologic, renal and liver function, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject with a Karnofsky performance scale index (KPD) of &gt; 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. An expected survival time &gt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant by serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test, not breastfeeding, and at least 1 of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not of childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (documented&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or&#xD;
                  postmenopausal (no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A&#xD;
                  high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be&#xD;
                  used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception&#xD;
                  or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of&#xD;
                  amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Of childbearing potential and agrees to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
                  contraception consistently during the 4-week dose escalation, 16-week treatment,&#xD;
                  and 4-week washout periods; and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A male patient with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to&#xD;
             participate if he agrees to use acceptable contraception during 4-week dose&#xD;
             escalation, 16-week treatment, and 4-week washout periods; and for at least 30 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study treatment and refrains from donating sperm during this&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Factors that significantly affect oral drug absorption, such as inability to swallow,&#xD;
             chronic diarrhoea, short bowel syndrome, and/or intestinal obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hypertension that cannot be reduced to normal range with antihypertensive medication&#xD;
             (systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concurrent active cancer that requires non-surgical treatment (e.g., chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, adjuvant therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of severe cardiovascular disease: myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction&#xD;
