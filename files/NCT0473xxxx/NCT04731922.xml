  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that TAK-510 will help people with symptoms of feeling sick (nausea) or being&#xD;
      sick (vomiting). The main aims of the study are to check if healthy adults have side effects&#xD;
      from TAK-510 and to check how much TAK-510 they can receive without getting side effects from&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be in 3 parts. Participants will take part in only 1 of the 3 parts of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. For those who&#xD;
      can take part, they will be placed in 1 of many small groups. The 1st groups will join Part 1&#xD;
      of the study, the 2nd groups will join Part 2 and the 3rd groups will join Part 3. They will&#xD;
      receive an injection under the skin of either TAK-510 or placebo. In this study, a placebo&#xD;
      will look like the TAK-510 injection but will not have any medicine in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, the 1st group of participants will receive 1 injection of either TAK-510 or&#xD;
      placebo. Different participants within this group will receive lower to higher doses of&#xD;
      TAK-510. The participants in this group will stay in the clinic for 4 days after their&#xD;
      injection for some tests and check for any side effects from their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the 2nd group of participants will receive an injection of either TAK-510 or&#xD;
      placebo, once a day for 5 days. Different participants within this group will receive lower&#xD;
      to higher doses of TAK-510. The participants in this group will stay in the clinic for 9 days&#xD;
      after their 1st injection for some tests and check for any side effects from their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, the 3rd group of participants will visit the clinic 2 times. At the 1st visit,&#xD;
      they will receive an injection either of TAK-510 or placebo, once a day for 7 days. Each&#xD;
      participant in this group will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-510. They will stay in&#xD;
      the clinic for 8 days after their 1st injection for some tests and check for any side effects&#xD;
      from their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 2nd clinic visit, each participant will receive 1 single injection of TAK-510 or&#xD;
      placebo. This will happen 7 days after their last injection from the previous clinic visit.&#xD;
      They will receive the same dose as their previous dose. They will stay in the clinic for 3&#xD;
      days for some tests and check for any side effects from their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, all participants in the study will return to the clinic for a weekly&#xD;
      check-up visit for up to 3 weeks.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-510. The study will look at the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of TAK-510 in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to approximately 160 healthy participants. Participants in each&#xD;
      cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-510 or matching placebo which will&#xD;
      remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an&#xD;
      urgent medical need). The study consists of 3 parts and up to 20 cohorts as mentioned below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-510, Part 1: SRD design to assess the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK&#xD;
           of TAK-510&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-510, Part 2: MRD design to assess the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK&#xD;
           of TAK-510&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-510, Part 3: Dose titration and redosing design to assess the safety,&#xD;
           immunogenicity, tolerability, and PK of TAK-510&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 57 days. Participants will be followed up for 7 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Continuous nonsmoker who has not used nicotine- and tobacco-containing products for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to dosing and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 18.0 and less than or equal to&#xD;
             (&lt;=) 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             antibody, or human immunodeficiency antibody/antigen, at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Had major surgery or donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 milliliter&#xD;
             [mL]) within 4 weeks before the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unable to refrain from or anticipates using all medications including herbal medicines&#xD;
             beginning approximately 7 days before administration of the first dose of study drug,&#xD;
             throughout the study until 2 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unable to refrain from or anticipates using marijuana or cannabis-containing products&#xD;
             beginning approximately 7 days before administration of the first dose of study drug,&#xD;
             throughout the study until after the last PK dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has had a previous major psychotic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has an average semirecumbent blood pressure (BP) less than 90/60 millimeter of mercury&#xD;
             (mmHg) or greater than 140/90 mmHg from screening to predose, inclusive. Any&#xD;
             assessments on Day -1 that do not meet this criterion must be discussed with the&#xD;
             medical monitor for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has orthostatic hypotension defined as a decrease in systolic BP &gt;=20 mmHg or a&#xD;
             decrease in diastolic BP &gt;=10 mmHg at approximately 3 minutes of standing when&#xD;
             compared with BP from the semirecumbent position, at screening to predose assessments,&#xD;
             inclusive. In asymptomatic participants, any assessments after screening that do not&#xD;
             meet this criterion may be repeated after the participant has remained in the&#xD;
             semirecumbent or supine position for 15 minutes. If the repeat assessment is&#xD;
             exclusionary based on the above criterion, the participant will not be eligible. If&#xD;
             the repeat assessment is not exclusionary, the participant will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has postural orthostatic tachycardia, defined as an increase of greater than (&gt;) 30&#xD;
             beats per minute (bpm) or heart rate (HR) &gt;120 bpm at approximately 3 minutes, of&#xD;
             standing, at screening to predose assessments, inclusive. Any assessments after&#xD;
             screening that do not meet this criterion may be repeated with the participant&#xD;
             remaining standing for up to a total of 5 minutes, provided that the participant&#xD;
             remains asymptomatic. If the repeat assessment occurring within 5 minutes is&#xD;
             exclusionary based on the above criterion, the participant will not be eligible. A&#xD;
             confirmed orthostatic increase of &gt;30 bpm, but less than (&lt;) 40 bpm, on 1 or more Day&#xD;
             -1 assessments may not be considered exclusionary if not considered clinically&#xD;
             significant by the investigator and the medical monitor. Such assessments must be&#xD;
             discussed with the medical monitor before determination that the participant is&#xD;
             eligible to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a known or suspected current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or is&#xD;
             at risk of COVID-19 infection as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
