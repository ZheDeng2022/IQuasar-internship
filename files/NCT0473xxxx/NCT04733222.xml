  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel, randomized, controlled trial aims to quantify the effects of slip- and&#xD;
      trip-perturbation training on fall rates collected over 12 months, compared to time-matched&#xD;
      treadmill walking, among community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation estimated that 128 older community-dwelling older adults (≥65&#xD;
      years) are needed. Following baseline measures, the recruited participants will randomly be&#xD;
      assigned to either the perturbation or the walking group. The participants in the&#xD;
      perturbation group will be assigned to four perturbation training sessions. The walking group&#xD;
      will perform four treadmill walking matching the exercise time of the perturbation training.&#xD;
      Assessment of the primary outcome, fall rates, will be conducted continuously in 12 months&#xD;
      from randomization. When a fall is reported in the fall calendar, a telephone interview will&#xD;
      be conducted to assess the circumstances and consequences (e.g., fall-related fractures,&#xD;
      fall-related hospital admissions) of the falls. Moreover, assessment of physical, cognitive,&#xD;
      and social-psychological outcomes will be made at baseline, post-test, six-month, and&#xD;
      12-months reassessment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of older adults fall at least once a year, and about 10% of these&#xD;
      falls cause serious injuries such as head injuries and fractures. In fact, falls are the most&#xD;
      frequent cause of injuries among older adults and often lead to disability,&#xD;
      institutionalization, and premature death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple fall prevention interventions have been examined to reduce the fall rate, and&#xD;
      physical exercise has continuously been proven as an effective and cost-effective approach.&#xD;
      However, traditional exercise approaches, such as balance and muscle-strengthening training,&#xD;
      have only shown a moderate 20-25% decrease in falls and encounters issues such as poor&#xD;
      compliance. Recently, task-specific perturbation training using an overground walkway has&#xD;
      been shown to produce quick motor adaptations resulting in improved pro- and reactive&#xD;
      stability. Additionally, perturbation training delivered on such walkways has decreased both&#xD;
      laboratory-induced and real-life falls. However, overground walkways with moveable platforms&#xD;
      and trip-board are expensive and immobile; thus, limiting the clinical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrarily, perturbation training delivered on computer-controlled treadmills may serve as a&#xD;
      more implementable substitute. Preliminary studies have shown that treadmill perturbation&#xD;
      training produces similar dynamic stability adaptations to overground perturbation training.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a single session of treadmill perturbation decreases the rate of&#xD;
      laboratory-induced falls, and the ergogenic effects were retained for up to six months.&#xD;
      However, the effects of a brief treadmill perturbation training intervention on real-life&#xD;
      falls in community-dwelling older adults still vastly unknown.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After the pre-training tests, participants will be randomly allocated to either the perturation or control group. To produce groups of similar size a permuted block randomization will be used. Allocation concealment will be maintained using random block sizes (4, 6, or 8) and by the randomization code only being available for non-blinded research staff.&#xD;
The perturbation group will undergo three initial training sessions on two days within a week, and a &quot;booster&quot;-session after six months. The active control group will perform treadmill walking at a preferred speed to match the training dose of the perturbations group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The treadmill perturbation training will be performed on a computer-controlled treadmill. The perturbation will be induced by fast forward (slip) or backward (trip) accelerations of the treadmill at specific gait cycle timings. The perturbations will be delivered randomly to enhance the unpredictability. A ceiling-mounted body-harness ensures the safety of the participants.&#xD;
Participants will be assigned to three initial sessions of treadmill slip- and trip-perturbation training on two days separated by a week and a &quot;booster&quot;-session after six months. On day 1, participants will first undergo a session 1 with 40 slip perturbations and then a session 2 with 40 trip perturbations. On day 2, participants will undergo a session 3 with 20 slip and 20 trip perturbations in random order. The &quot;booster&quot;-session after six months will be similar to session 3 (20 of each perturbation in random order).</description>
