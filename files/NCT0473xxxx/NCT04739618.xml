  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-ablative Cryosurgical Freezing (limited to 1.5 cm diameter single freeze within the&#xD;
      cancer (up to two cancer sites selected and treated)) will release intact antigens to prime&#xD;
      the immune system. The study treatment immunotherapeutic drugs (PD-1 inhibitor monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab), anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab, and GM-CSF)&#xD;
      will then be sequentially injected directly into each of the treated cancer sites immediately&#xD;
      following Non-ablative Cryosurgical Freezing. Daily subcutaneous GM-CSF injections will also&#xD;
      be administered subsequently. It is speculated that neoantigens released from the cryo-frozen&#xD;
      necrotic cancer will be available in the vicinity of the Non-ablative Cryosurgical Freezing&#xD;
      field immediately following the procedure. Immature dendritic cells attracted to the&#xD;
      injection site will internalize neoantigens to become activated to recognize cancer-specific&#xD;
      antigenic proteins. The activated dendritic cells will recruit killer T-cells to the&#xD;
      injection site to attack cancer cells, and then migrate through the lymphatic system to sites&#xD;
      of metastases, targeting cancer-specific neoantigens and recruiting more killer T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      to destroy other cancer cells harboring the precise antigenic epitopes (abscopal (bystander)&#xD;
      effect). In this way, dendritic cells are capable of initiating cell-mediated systemic immune&#xD;
      response in combination with cytotoxic killer T-cells. Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have&#xD;
      been implicated in dampening or halting cell-mediated, antigen-specific immune responses,&#xD;
      will be selectively depleted by anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, intra-tumoral GM-CSF, and&#xD;
      GM-CSF. Intra-tumoral injection of the immunotherapeutic medications assists in stimulating&#xD;
      and harnessing the local and systemic immune response. GM-CSF prolongs the immune response.&#xD;
      Using this combination of therapies, referred to as YourVaccxTM, it is thought that a&#xD;
      clinically significant systemic anti-cancer immune response might be elicited. Intra-tumoral&#xD;
      injection of drugs will likely offer fewer side effects than systemic therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0-2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy of 6 months or more as determined by treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have exhausted all other standard therapies; Have failed available therapy or are not&#xD;
             a candidate for, or refuse available therapy (i.e. concerned with high adverse events&#xD;
             rate in available therapy or outcome worse than disease); or failure of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-documented solid cancer. All subjects must submit their primary tumor&#xD;
             or metastatic pathology specimens and laboratory and imaging reports to ImmunSYS where&#xD;
             they will be centrally reviewed. Central ImmunSYS pathologic review is not required&#xD;
             for screening but rather for confirmation of diagnosis and histologic subtype of&#xD;
             cancer. Local pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined using iRECIST criteria and identified by radiographic&#xD;
             imaging (Imaging should be current within the past three months of subject entering&#xD;
             the study; if not repeat imaging must be done prior to enrollment.). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible, the patient must have at least one metastatic bone and/or metastatic soft&#xD;
             tissue site, lymph node site, and/or bone site with cancer mass measuring 1.5 cm or&#xD;
             more in diameter based on soft tissue, lymph node, and/or bone lesions as defined by&#xD;
             any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any soft tissue lesion defined by imaging deemed by the physician to be&#xD;
                  consistent with distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET&#xD;
                  (prostate cancer patients only), only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI&#xD;
                  correlate consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic lymph node disease defined by imaging. Any lymph node ≥1 cm in&#xD;
                  shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone metastases defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan&#xD;
                  and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases;&#xD;
                  both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry.&#xD;
                  For patients undergoing PSMA PET (prostate cancer patients only), only PSMA-avid&#xD;
                  lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of&#xD;
                  metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the medications in this protocol on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. Any subject treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study&#xD;
             participation, and for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their partners will also be encouraged to use proper method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;

        1.5 x ULN (unless documented Gilbert's disease) SGOT (AST) ≤ 2.5x ULN, or &lt;5x ULN in&#xD;
        patients with documented liver metastases SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5x ULN or &lt;5x ULN in patients with&#xD;
        documented liver metastases Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)&#xD;
        ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within&#xD;
        therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving&#xD;
        anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of&#xD;
        anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Deviation from these values is allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: Women of child-bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy (which must be&#xD;
