      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmaco-economics of&#xD;
      Lacosamide Tablet as first add-on therapy for uncontrolled focal onset epilepsy ,invetigating&#xD;
      effects of lacosamide Tablet on cognitive function of children and anxiety and depression of&#xD;
      adults with focal onset seizures In real-world clinical setting&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many real world, lacosamide as the first add-on therapy can significantly improve the&#xD;
      seizure freedom rate. Moreover, many pharmacoeconomic studies in Sweden and the United States&#xD;
      have confirmed that lacosamide is a more cost-effective option.This is a real-world study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of Generic lacoxamide tablets in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with focal epilepsy. During the trial, patients with focal epilepsy&#xD;
      were treated with lacosamide for the first time after the failure of the original&#xD;
      antiepileptic drug. At the same time, the cost-effectiveness of Generic lacosamide was&#xD;
      evaluated from the perspective of economics, in order to provide the basis for the clinical&#xD;
      choice for Chinese epilepsy patients.&#xD;
