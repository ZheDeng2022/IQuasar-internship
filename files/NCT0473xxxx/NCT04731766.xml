  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2 different varnishes will be used to test their effectiveness in controlling teeth&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in adult patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-vivo part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each varnish will be applied separately on different teeth according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions and the VAS will be measured according to a specific timeline: T0 (baseline,&#xD;
      before application of varnish), T1 (1 week after application), T2 (4 weeks after application)&#xD;
      and T3 (4 weeks after application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-situ part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentin specimen will be prepared from extracted teeth from the orthodontic department in our&#xD;
      college, sterilized and prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it will be bonded to an orthodontic wire and bonded to upper first molar. Dentinal occlusion&#xD;
      will be measured using scanning electron microscope following the same timeline.&#xD;

    <description>Nano-silver fluoride (NSF) is a solution which has been introduced as an experimental formulation in which it's stability for three years has been proved by Santos et al. The laboratory synthesis of concocted NSF was carried out in a nano-technology center; Several trials were done until we have reached a successful end product.</description>
