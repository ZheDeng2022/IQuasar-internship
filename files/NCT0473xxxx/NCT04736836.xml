      Aims and Objectives: To determine the safety and efficacy of rifaximin plus lactulose as&#xD;
      secondary prophylaxis of HE compared to lactulose alone. To evaluate the effect of long-term&#xD;
      administration of rifaximin on development of resistant mutants and investigating its&#xD;
      correlation with its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: An open label parallel, prospective interventional study was conducted. One hundred&#xD;
      patients experienced at least one attack of hepatic encephalopathy were included in the&#xD;
      study. Patients were randomly allocated either to receive rifaximin plus lactulose or&#xD;
      lactulose alone for 6 months. Conn score, Model of End stage Liver Disease (MELD) score,&#xD;
      asterixis grade, complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, kidney function tests,&#xD;
      urine and stool analysis and abdominal ultrasonography were compared in both groups. The&#xD;
      primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the first breakthrough. The secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint was the time to the first hospitalization involving HE. Safety assessment was done&#xD;
      by reporting any adverse events, serious adverse events and by repeating biochemical&#xD;
      evaluation every 2 weeks. Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of&#xD;
      rifaximin for lactose fermenter isolates was done for the entire patients before starting&#xD;
      treatment and at the end of treatment.&#xD;

      Methodology Inclusion and exclusion criteria Fully conscious patients were enrolled from the&#xD;
      National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI), Cairo, Egypt between&#xD;
      January 2015 and December 2018. The inclusion criteria were cirrhosis due to HCV infection,&#xD;
      age 18 to 75 years, experiencing at least one episode of OHE, and a MELD score ≤ 25.13&#xD;
      Patients with neurological or communication problems, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, active infection, serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl, Hg &lt; 8 g/dL, serum Na &lt; 125 mmol/L or&#xD;
      serum K &lt; 2.5 mmol/L were excluded. Patients with previous intake of rifaximin as prophylaxis&#xD;
      or any antibiotic within the last month were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The protocol of this open label, parallel, prospective interventional study was&#xD;
      approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of NHTMRI and that of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Pharmacy, Cairo University (CL(1173)). All patients and/or patients' caregivers for those&#xD;
      with weak/impaired cognitive and/or thinking ability due to previous episode of HE were&#xD;
      consulted and explained for provided written informed consent before study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned into either intervention group (rifaximin group) or&#xD;
      control group (lactulose only group). Both groups received lactulose syrup 30-45 ml three&#xD;
      times daily while rifaximin 400 mg three times daily was added to the intervention group for&#xD;
      6 months. Other conventional therapy including diuretics, proton pump inhibitors,&#xD;
      ursodeoxycholic acid and silymarin were given to the patients in both groups according to the&#xD;
      hospital protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Follow-up All recruited patients were assessed clinically and biochemically at baseline&#xD;
      and every 2 weeks for 6 months. Conn score, asterixis grade, complete blood picture with&#xD;
      differential, serum bilirubin (total and direct), serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and&#xD;
      alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), serum&#xD;
      albumin, prothrombin time and concentration, urea and serum creatinine, serum sodium (Na) and&#xD;
      potassium (K), urine and stool analysis were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy outcomes The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the first breakthrough&#xD;
      episode of OHE (defined as the time from the first dose of the study drug to an increase from&#xD;
      a baseline Conn score of 0 or 1 to a score of 2 or more or from a baseline Conn score of 0 to&#xD;
      a Conn score of 1 plus a 1-unit increase in the asterixis grade.13 The secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint was the time to the first hospitalization involving HE (defined as hospitalization&#xD;
      because of the disorder or hospitalization during which an episode of HE occurred).14 The&#xD;
      percentage of patient's survival during the study was also considered a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Outcomes All recruited patients were requested to report any adverse event(s)&#xD;
      experienced during the study period. Clinic visits occurred every 2 weeks till end of the&#xD;
      treatment period. On weeks with no clinical visits, patients were followed-up by phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin Microbial Resistance Isolation of Gram negative bacteria from clinical stool&#xD;
      samples Stool samples were collected from all the participants before commencing treatment&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. One gram of stool was suspended in 10 ml saline and vortexed&#xD;
      vigorously. One ml aliquot of the stool suspension was streaked on the surface of MacConkey&#xD;
      agar plates to isolate Gram-negative lactose-fermenters. The plates were then incubated at&#xD;
      37⁰C for 24 hours. Pink colonies were picked and re-streaked one more time then suspended in&#xD;
      30% glycerol (vol/vol) in Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) and stored at -80 ⁰C till further&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rifaximin for lactose&#xD;
      fermenter isolates A sequential two-fold serial dilution broth procedure was adopted&#xD;
      according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.15 Ten&#xD;
      dilutions of rifaximin were prepared starting from 256 μg/ml in Muller Hinton broth (MHB) and&#xD;
      aliquoted in 200 μl aliquots in the wells of a round bottom 96-well plate. A control well was&#xD;
      included that was prepared using 200 μl MHB inoculated with 20 μl of the prepared bacterial&#xD;
      inoculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inoculum was prepared by adjusting cells from an overnight culture to match the McFarland&#xD;
      standard 0.5 (OD600 = 0.125). The suspension was further diluted 1:20 in MHB and 20 μl of the&#xD;
      adjusted inoculum were added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24&#xD;
      hours. The experiment was repeated twice and the lowest concentration of rifaximin that&#xD;
      resulted in complete inhibition of visible growth represented the MIC value. The MIC values&#xD;
      were considered different if they differed by more than a two-fold dilution.16&#xD;
