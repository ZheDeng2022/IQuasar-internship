      Pilot study looking at the Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) for various headache&#xD;
      types in patients with post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Twenty-six subjects with symptoms&#xD;
      lasting &gt;3 months were enrolled and were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 13) and&#xD;
      a control group (n = 13).&#xD;

      Evidence shows the effectiveness of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) for various&#xD;
      headache types, with limited evidence of its use for headaches related to mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (MTBI). No studies were found regarding OMT for headaches in patients with&#xD;
      post-concussion syndrome (PCS), defined as symptom persistence &gt;3 months after MTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate OMT for headaches in patients with PCS. Methods: A controlled pilot&#xD;
      study was conducted of patients with PCS who presented to an outpatient interdisciplinary&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinic. Twenty-six subjects with symptoms lasting &gt;3 months were enrolled and&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 13) and a control group (n = 13). Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures were 1) immediate change in headache scores with a visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      and 2) change in the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      visits. 10 control participants completed HIT-6 between baseline and follow-up visits but did&#xD;
      not receive OMT and did not complete VAS. After OMT, immediate VAS changes in treatment group&#xD;
      and the improvements in HIT-6 scores for both groups between baseline and follow-up were&#xD;
      analyzed for statistical significance.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the headache scores, defined as the different pain pre and post treatment using the visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
VAS is widely used to capture pain, the scale ranges from 0-10 with 0 (best outcome) being no pain and 10 being the worst pain possible (worst outcome).</description>

    <description>HIT-6 was completed at baseline and competed to HIT-6 completed post treatment at follow up visit.&#xD;
Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) is a measure of headache severity and provides information regarding the effect of headache on other domains related to functional participation. The HIT-6 has six questions and the range goes from 36 (best outcome) to a maximum score of 78 (worst outcome). Higher HIT-6 scores indicate increased headache severity and greater functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a non-pharmacological, noninvasive form of manual medicine. Osteopathic practitioners use a wide variety of therapeutic manual techniques to improve physiological function and help restore homeostasis in the body. There is a structural assessment is to identify possible abnormalities of tissue texture. Areas of asymmetry and misalignment of bony landmarks are also evaluated, along with the quality of motion, balance, and organization. These asymmetries, also known as somatic dysfunctions, are then treated by a variety of manual treatments, administered by osteopaths.</description>

Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy: Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a non-pharmacological, noninvasive form of manual medicine. Osteopathic practitioners use a wide variety of therapeutic manual techniques to improve physiological function and help restore homeostasis in the body. There is a structural assessment is to identify possible abnormalities of tissue texture. Areas of asymmetry and misalignment of bony landmarks are also evaluated, along with the quality of motion, balance, and organization. These asymmetries, also known as somatic dysfunctions, are then treated by a variety of manual treatments, administered by osteopaths.</description>

Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) is a measure of headache severity and provides information regarding the effect of headache on other domains related to functional participation. The HIT-6 has six questions and the range goes from 36 (best outcome) to a maximum score of 78 (worst outcome).
