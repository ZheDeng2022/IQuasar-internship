    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the cocoa supplementation and aerobic exercise on central pressure and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness parameters in physically inactive middle-aged individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      500mg capsules will be offered to all patients. Of these, half will offer the content of&#xD;
      500mg of cocoa per capsule or placebo capsules. The placebo will contain a pharmacologically&#xD;
      inert substance (microcrystalline cellulose) of the same color. A half will start 50' aerobic&#xD;
      training 3 times/week while the other half will continue without exercise.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death in the world: more people&#xD;
      die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. The arterial hypertension is one of the&#xD;
      main predictors of CVDs. The number of adults with high blood pressure increased from 594&#xD;
      million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015( WHO, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the great increase in Hypertension around the world, new technological ways of&#xD;
      assessing pressure have been discussed in the clinical setting, not only peripheral, but also&#xD;
      central.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, the applanation tonometry of different arteries (carotid and radial), the&#xD;
      analysis of pulses by various algorithms and the ability to estimate the shape of the pulse&#xD;
      wave in the descending aorta root has been gaining prominence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flavonoids are a group of polyphenol compounds found in plants. The possible benefits from&#xD;
      these compounds are related to cardiovascular health through specific actions on the artery&#xD;
      wall. Prospective studies have shown that flavonoids can improve arterial stiffness, measured&#xD;
      by Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise can intensifies organic functioning in different systems oh human body,&#xD;
      including the cardiovascular. Studies has shown that chronic adaptations of pshysical&#xD;
      exercise can improve arterial stiffness and central blood pressure parameters.&#xD;

    <description>The assessment of arterial stiffness will be carried out using the non-invasive method of PWV , which is obtained by dividing the carotid-femoral distance by the systolic wave travel time (in the unit of m / s) It will be checked by the Complior Analyzer equipment, with the volunteer in a supine position in an air-conditioned environment and controlled lighting in a LIC room, with the sensors placed over the right carotid and femoral arteries. The distance between the two points is measured by an infantometer and the data of pressure, total body weight and distance between the points of the sensors in the carotid artery and in the femoral artery are entered in the software to calculate the PWV. This analysis will be carried out before and after the intervention period.</description>
