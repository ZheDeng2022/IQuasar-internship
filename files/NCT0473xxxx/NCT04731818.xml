  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early Phase 1 study to establish proof-of-concept by determining whether an&#xD;
      intravaginal film containing a human contraceptive antibody (ZB-06) shows promise to provide&#xD;
      contraceptive efficacy using the post-coital test, a surrogate measure of efficacy. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of ZB-06.&#xD;
