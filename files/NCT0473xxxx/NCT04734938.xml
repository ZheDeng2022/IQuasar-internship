      This project will assess the effect of Huel Food replacement on the micronutrient status of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers over a 4-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, 30 (non-smoking) generally healthy volunteers will be recruited to attend&#xD;
      the study centre on three separate occasions. Volunteers will be asked to consume their&#xD;
      normal diet for one week whilst recording what they eat. They will then be asked to only&#xD;
      consume Huel Powder and water for 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Study Protocol The effect on Micronutrient Status of a diet of 100% Huel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study This project will assess the effect of Huel Powder on 30 generally healthy&#xD;
      individuals over 4 weeks on the volunteer's micronutrient status. The aim is to identify any&#xD;
      changes in the micronutrient status of volunteers in any of the 20 micronutrients to be&#xD;
      monitored. Micronutrient status will be measured at the start of the study, after one week of&#xD;
      their habitual diets and again after four weeks of consuming Huel powder as their single food&#xD;
      source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huel Powder is a nutritionally complete powdered food that is high in protein and fibre,&#xD;
      essential fats, carbohydrates, rich in phytonutrients and all 26 essential vitamins and&#xD;
      minerals, with further information on Huel's website&#xD;
      https://huel.com/pages/what-people-ask-about-huel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures of BMI, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and body composition will&#xD;
      also be taken to observe any changes over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All researchers will be trained in GCP and phlebotomy. Potential volunteers will sent a&#xD;
      health and activity questionnaire to assess their energy consumption and expenditure. This&#xD;
      can be discussed over a Zoom call (or similar platform) if required. This will be used to&#xD;
      screen the volunteers to see if they are suitable for the study. The energy intake&#xD;
      information will also be verified from the first week of the study when they are consuming&#xD;
      their habitual diet and completing their food diaries on my fitness pal. The energy&#xD;
      requirements will inform the researcher how much Huel the volunteers will require over the&#xD;
      course of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will come to the study centre at Newcastle on three separate occasions. The&#xD;
      first, at the start of the study they can have any further questions answered and if they are&#xD;
      happy to take part in the study, they will be asked to complete a written consent form. They&#xD;
      will also have their height, weight, body composition, waist and hip circumferences, measured&#xD;
      as well as giving a blood sample (30ml) for micronutrient analysis. The second visit, at the&#xD;
      end of the first week, will also measure the weight, body composition, waist circumference&#xD;
      and take a blood sample. The final visit will be at the end of the study taking weight, body&#xD;
      composition, waist circumference and a blood sample for micronutrient analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The micronutrients and blood markers to be measure are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers to be tested; Haemoglobin Sodium Calcium HbA1c Cholesterol status Iron status Vitamin&#xD;
      A Vitamin D Vitamin E Vitamin C Folate Vitamin B12 Choline Magnesium Potassium Zinc Copper&#xD;
      Manganese Selenium Iodine (TSH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan Although this trial is a pilot study, changes in BMI, weight, body composition,&#xD;
      waist circumference, and micronutrient/blood marker will be compared between 0 and 1 week, as&#xD;
      well as 1 week and 5 weeks, will be assessed. A one-way ANOVA will be used to assess&#xD;
      differences for individual volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test conditions Each volunteer will be asked to continue to consume their habitual diet for&#xD;
      the first week and record their food intake in food diary app, myfitnesspal. At the end of&#xD;
      the first week volunteers will be asked to consume only the Huel Powder provided and water.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked not to consume any other food or drinks during these four weeks but&#xD;
      still record their Huel intake in myfitnesspa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100% Huel - Only a diet comprising of Huel powder must be consumed for the last four&#xD;
           weeks of the trial. No other snacks/food are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Energy intake - Daily calorie requirements varies from person to person and is&#xD;
           determined by weight, height, gender, age and activity levels. The researchers will help&#xD;
           estimate individual calorie requirements. Once you have your calorie requirements,&#xD;
           manipulate your Huel serving sizes to reflect daily calorie intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Huel products - Only Huel powder - as well as Huel Flavour Boosts, if desired - must be&#xD;
           consumed as part of this study. Huel Granola or Huel Bars cannot be consumed during this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid intake - Only plain water, herbal tea (excluding citrus teas), black tea or coffee&#xD;
           must be drunk. No additions must be made to fluid, i.e. no additional sugar, sweeteners,&#xD;
           milk or honey are permitted during the length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol intake - No alcohol must be consumed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise/Activity- Participants are able to continue with normal exercise and activity&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers Thirty generally healthy volunteers, males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females&#xD;
      aged over 18 years will be recruited for the study. Volunteers will be recruited by posters&#xD;
      and word of mouth from Newcastle University staff and their associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be assigned a 'Participant Identification Number', which volunteers will use&#xD;
      to complete questionnaires and researcher will use to label volunteers blood samples. Ony one&#xD;
      documents will contain volunteers names and Participant Identification Number, and this will&#xD;
      be destroyed after the final volunteer has completed the study or once the study has been&#xD;
      concluded, which ever occurs first. Consent forms will not contain Participant Identification&#xD;
      Numbers and will be kept for 12 months after the completion of the study.&#xD;
