      Background: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of thoracic computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) which is a noninvasive method making the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material-Method: The data of 816 patients who received endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS)&#xD;
      for mediastinal lymph node sampling and were subjected to other methods were retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzed. 192 patients (sarcoidosis: 62, non-sarcoidosis) were included in the study. The&#xD;
      thoracic CT findings of the patients were compared in terms of mediastinal lymph node and&#xD;
      pulmonary parenchymal involvement.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Sarcoidosisis a multisystemic granulomatous disease whose etiology is unknown.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of sarcoidosisis made by exclusion of other causes in addition to compatible&#xD;
      clinical, radiological and histopathological findings (1,2). Its most frequently encountered&#xD;
      form of stage-I sarcoidosis characterized by bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (3). Symmetrical&#xD;
      hilar lymphadenopathy (LAP) is a significant characteristic that distinguishes sarcoidosis&#xD;
      from disease that may progress with mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes such as lymphoma,&#xD;
      fungal infection and tuberculosis (4,5). Unilateral hilar LAP is seen in only about 3-5%of&#xD;
      sarcoidosis cases (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue biopsy is required to show granulomas that does not histopathologically contain&#xD;
      caseification necroses (7). However, in stage-I patients, sarcoidosis can be diagnosed&#xD;
      without tissue sampling after excluding other causes (8). The 2019 sarcoidosis guideline of&#xD;
      BTS (British Thoracic Society) also stated that, in patients with Lofgren syndrome (Bilateral&#xD;
      hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, fever, arthritis) with a low probability of&#xD;
      alternative diagnosis, biopsy is required only when radiologically atypical findings are&#xD;
      revealed during follow up (9). However, in this case, the suspicion of whether or not the&#xD;
      correct decision is made remains a highly disturbing issue for both the physician and the&#xD;
      patient. Biopsy should be performed if the clinical condition is not typical, and other&#xD;
      causes could not be excluded. Bronchoscopy, which is frequently used for biopsy, is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure although its complication rate is low. In relation to bronchoscopy,&#xD;
      complications such as pneumothorax, hemorrhage and infection may be experienced&#xD;
      (10,11).Therefore, it is important to investigate if it is possible to prevent patients from&#xD;
      unnecessary invasive procedures. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of&#xD;
      thoracic computerized tomography image characteristics in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis&#xD;
      without pathological sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL-METHOD The study was planned by retrospectively analyzing the data of patients who&#xD;
      received EBUS for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes and were subjected to other diagnostic&#xD;
      methods such as mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy in the case of non-diagnostic results of EBUS&#xD;
      at the Department of Pulmonology at the Faculty of Medicine at KTÜ between 1 January 2013 and&#xD;
      1 July 2019. The study was started after obtaining local ethics board approval, and only&#xD;
      included patients with definitive histopathological diagnosis. The patients whose&#xD;
      computerized thoracic tomography images at first admission were not available in the archives&#xD;
      of our hospital were excluded (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computerized thoracic tomography images were examined in terms of characteristics as&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph node localization, size, density, homogeneity, necrosis, calcification and&#xD;
      hilar symmetry. Parenchymal lesions were compared in terms of nodule, ground-glass, reticular&#xD;
      opacity, consolidation and the distributions of these lesions. For computerized thoracic&#xD;
      tomography imaging, the Somatom (Siemens, Forchhim, Germany) device at our hospital was used.&#xD;
      For EBUS imaging and sampling, an Olympus EVIS EXERA II CV-180 device was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of lymph node localization was made based on the lymph node map by Wang (2R,&#xD;
      2L, 4R, 4L, etc.). Measurements of lymphadenopathy density were made by considering the&#xD;
      largest lymph node and by the Hounsfield Unit (HU) in a rectangular region determined in the&#xD;
      axial plane contacting the LAP borders from four corners in the tomography cross-section with&#xD;
      the lymphadenopathy showing the broadest area. The maximum, minimum and mean densities&#xD;
      measured at the marked region were recorded. The measurements were made by the same person in&#xD;
      all patients (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normal distribution of the&#xD;
      continuous variables. The data characterized by a normal distribution are expressed as&#xD;
      mean±standard deviation. Student's t-tests was used for the comparison of the data which had&#xD;
      a normal distribution. Mann-Whitney-U test was used for the comparison of the non-normally&#xD;
      distributed data. The discrete variables were compared using Chi-squared test. The parameters&#xD;
      that were potential predictors of sarcoidosis were analyzed using logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used as a stepwise backward LR method&#xD;
      from predictive factors with a significance of ≤0.05 in the univariate analysis. The&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracies of the parameters for identifying sarcoidosis were assessed using the&#xD;
      area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (AUC). P &lt;0.05 was considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software&#xD;
      (version 13.01, serial number 9069728, SPSS Inc., Chicago).&#xD;
