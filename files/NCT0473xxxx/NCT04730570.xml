  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a text message-based program called Essential&#xD;
      Coaching for Every Mother which sends daily text messages during the immediate six-week&#xD;
      postnatal period. Essential Coaching for Every Mother consists of standardized text messages&#xD;
      that provide evidence-based information that women should be aware of related to caring for&#xD;
      their newborn and maternal mental health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-group parallel arm randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      into either the intervention or a control group, stratified by parity. No changes to&#xD;
      in-person care will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers in the intervention group will receive daily text messages from enrollment after&#xD;
      birth until six-weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers in the control group will receive no content messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be recruited both antenatally and postnatally through social media and study&#xD;
      posters. All recruitment and participant engagement will occur remotely via text message.&#xD;
      Women who are 37+ weeks pregnant up to 10 days postpartum will be eligible to send a text to&#xD;
      a study specific number and complete an eligibility screening. If determined eligible once&#xD;
      they deliver, the participant will be randomized into the intervention or control group and&#xD;
      they will be asked to complete an electronic consent form and the baseline survey.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will start receiving the Essential Coaching for Every&#xD;
      Mother program based on their delivery date up to six weeks postpartum. Mothers in the&#xD;
      control group will only receive reminder texts to complete the follow-up surveys. Both groups&#xD;
      will be asked to complete an online survey at enrolment, six-weeks and six-months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruitment 140 participants in total, 70 per group.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Blinding is not possible for participants and thus participants will be informed of their group allocation.&#xD;
To minimize personnel blinding related to data collection, no hospital staff (nurse midwives, physicians, other healthcare providers) are required to be aware of participant's involvement in the study. This is possible as Essential Coaching for Every Mother is sent to the participant's personal cell phone with no intervention occurring in person.&#xD;
The PI will be aware of participant allocation and will be responsible for collecting data but will not be involved in the randomization procedure which occurs directly in the TextIt platform. Additionally, there is no interaction with the participants from the PI or anyone on the research team as everything occurs remotely via a previously set up process, reducing any risk of influencing participant response and influencing outcome assessment.</masking_description>
