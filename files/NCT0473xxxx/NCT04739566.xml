  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy with dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib (anti-BRAF and anti-MEK inhibitors) in the neoadjuvant treatment of&#xD;
      BRAF-positive anaplastic thyroid cancer. The prognosis in patients with ATC is poor due to&#xD;
      the rapid and invasive tumor growth and the rapid development of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib is an antineoplastic agent, a selective RAF kinase inhibitor that competes with&#xD;
      ATP. Oncogenic substitutions of the amino acid valine at position 600 (V600) BRAF lead to&#xD;
      constitutive activation of the RAS / RAF / MEK / ERK pathway and stimulation of tumor cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of the activation of&#xD;
      mitogen-activated, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 (MEK1) and 2 (MEK2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and trametinib inhibit two kinases in the signaling pathway, BRAF, and MEK. The&#xD;
      combination of the two drugs provides effective inhibition of proliferative signal&#xD;
      conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination treatment with these two drugs -&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib - can improve the response rate in the neoadjuvant mode in ATC&#xD;
      without significant regimen-limiting toxicity and with better follow-up locoregional control.&#xD;

      Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective Response Ratio (ORR) Evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
           dabrafenib and trametinib using an objective response rate (ORR) for BRAF-mutated&#xD;
           anaplastic thyroid cancer in neoadjuvant mode 7, 14, 28 days, 12, and 24 weeks after the&#xD;
           start of treatment. Includes patients with a confirmed partial (PR) and complete&#xD;
           response (CR) as the best response according to RECIST v 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of R0 resections after 3 months of neoadjuvant combination therapy with anti-BRAF&#xD;
           and MEK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the proportion of complete surgical resection (surgical resection R0 or R1)&#xD;
      with historical controls of 5%. The R0 / R1 ratio will be determined by the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who successfully undergo thyroidectomy with clear (R0) or microscopically positive&#xD;
      (R1) resection margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety Profile (Number / Severity of Serious Adverse Events, SAEs) Number of serious&#xD;
           adverse events classified by severity as assessed by CTCAE v 5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage of patients who received a complete response 3 months after the first dose of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health-related quality of life Changes in health-related quality of life will be&#xD;
           measured using the European Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D&#xD;
           consists of a description and a health assessment. The health description consists of&#xD;
           five dimensions (mobility, self-care, normal activities, pain/discomfort, and&#xD;
           anxiety/depression), with each dimension identifying five levels of severity [best (1) -&#xD;
           worst (5)]. Health assessment is assessed using a visual analog scale ([worse (0) -&#xD;
           better (100)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Median progression-free survival (mPFS) is defined as&#xD;
           the time from the date of inclusion to the date of the first documented progression of&#xD;
           disease or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be determined based on&#xD;
           the tumor score (RECIST criteria version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Overall Survival (OS) Median overall survival (mOS) at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months are&#xD;
           calculated as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of death for any reason at&#xD;
           the specific time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD)&#xD;
      for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months during years&#xD;
      1-2, every 6 months during years 3-4, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

               -  History of solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major surgery (such as gastrointestinal surgery and removal or biopsy of brain&#xD;
             metastases) within 8 weeks prior to inclusion. Complete wound healing following major&#xD;
             surgery should occur 4 weeks before the study treatment, and after minor surgery (eg,&#xD;
             simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the study treatment.&#xD;
             Patients with clinically significant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adjusted QT interval calculated by Fridericia formula (QTcf)&gt; 500 ms for 28 days prior&#xD;
             to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If a single ECG displays a QTCf with an absolute value&gt; 500 ms, two additional&#xD;
             ECGs at approximately 3 min intervals must be performed within 30 minutes of the&#xD;
             initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results will be used to assess&#xD;
             eligibility for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant (test must be done no later than 7 days before the start of the study) or&#xD;
             nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Received any live vaccine = &lt;30 days prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inability to swallow tablets/capsules and lack of gastrostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to the components of the&#xD;
             investigational dosage forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of previously diagnosed retinal vein occlusion, central serous retinopathy,&#xD;
             uncontrolled glaucoma, or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Diagnosis of another malignant neoplasm within 3 years prior to study treatment, with&#xD;
             the exception of superficial skin cancer or localized low-grade tumors that are&#xD;
             considered cured and untreated by systemic therapy.&#xD;
