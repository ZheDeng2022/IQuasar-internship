  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility is a crucial factor for independence and quality of life in older people. However,&#xD;
      the majority of those in retirement homes are not physically active to maintain mobility and&#xD;
      independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the cluster randomized controlled bestform trial in 20 retirement homes (1:1&#xD;
      randomization) is to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal exercise program for older people&#xD;
      living in retirement homes in comparison to usual care over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the intervention facilities, the participants will take part in a physical activity&#xD;
      program over 6 months (2 times a week à 45 min) consisting of machine-based strength,&#xD;
      coordination and endurance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of effectiveness are changes in physical function (primary endpoint: Change of Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery Score after 6 months) and the following secondary endpoints:&#xD;
      mobility and balance, rate of falls, cardiometabolic risk factors, myocard function, quality&#xD;
      of life and lifestyle factors (nutrition, physical activity), assessed by medical&#xD;
      assessments, physical performance tests and various questionnaires after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
      Follow-up data will be collected after 18 and 30 months (questionnaire).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobility is a crucial factor for independence and quality of life at old age. Particularly&#xD;
      those in retirement homes have a reduced physical activity status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the bestform trial is the integration of an exercise concept comprising&#xD;
      resistance, coordination and endurance training in retirement homes to promote mobility and&#xD;
      independence as well as to reduce the risk of falling in older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is organized and conducted as a multi-center, two-armed cluster randomized study in&#xD;
      20 retirement homes (1:1 randomization in intervention retirement homes and control&#xD;
      retirement homes with usual care) in the area of Munich, Germany. A total of at least 400&#xD;
      older people will subsequently be recruited. It is expected to recruit n≥20 older people per&#xD;
      participating retirement home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will participate in an exercise training for 6 months, which will take&#xD;
      place in the period from March 2020 to October 2021. The multimodal intervention consists of&#xD;
      a machine-based resistance, coordination and endurance training, which is performed 1-2 times&#xD;
      per week for 30-45 minutes with increasing amount of training. Age and disability adapted&#xD;
      pneumatic resistance training machines are used targeting large muscle groups. The endurance&#xD;
      training is performed on upright-bicycle and recumbent bicycle ergometers. Coordination is&#xD;
      exercised statically on the floor or a balance pad and dynamically on a balance-platform&#xD;
      according to the individual training plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the bestform trial is to examine the efficacy of this multimodal training on&#xD;
      physical function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (primary&#xD;
      endpoint) over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the impact of the training on mobility and balance, physical capacity&#xD;
      (6-min-walk test), rate of falls, anthropometric parameters, cardiometabolic risk parameters&#xD;
      (echocardiography, blood parameters), fear of falling, quality of life and other life style&#xD;
      factors (nutrition, physical activity) assessed by medical assessments, physical performance&#xD;
      tests and various questionnaires will be investigated after 3 and 6 months. Follow-up data&#xD;
      will be collected after 18 and 30 months (questionnaire).&#xD;
