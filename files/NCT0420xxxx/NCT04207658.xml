      Purpose :To determine the impact of directed Valsalva's's versus spontaneous pushing&#xD;
      techniques during second stage of labour on postpartum maternal fatigue. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The control group participants have an onset of spontaneous pushing when the&#xD;
      cervical dilatation was 6cm while the directed pushing group carried out the Valsalva's&#xD;
      manoeuvre.The data of the study are obtained by utilizing Baseline Obstetric Data Form and&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Fatigue Scale (VAFS). The investigators have done postpartum tests on&#xD;
      perineal tear, hemorrhagia, haemoglobin level, vital findings, blood pH, pO2 and pCO2, and&#xD;
      lactate level for the mother while the neonatal tests of APGAR score for 1st and 5th minutes,&#xD;
      umbilical artery blood pH, pO2 and pCO2 levels are done for the newborn.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears&#xD;
      that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third- and fourth-degree tears) can cause serious&#xD;
      problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision&#xD;
      (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the&#xD;
      baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm&#xD;
      compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth&#xD;
      attendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer program designed by an independent group of the clinical research centre is&#xD;
      creating the randomisation list, in blocks of four to six (randomly chosen by the electronic&#xD;
      system and well balanced by centre) and stratified by maternity ward and within maternity&#xD;
      wards by both parity (nulliparous vs multiparous) and epidural analgesia use at&#xD;
      randomisation. The randomisation and the data collection will be performed at a website&#xD;
      available 24 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the midwives-investigators have verified the inclusion and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      collected the signed informed consent, the randomisation will take place. There is no&#xD;
      conceivable way to conduct this study on either a double-blinded or single-blinded basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The population of our study consists of primigravida hospitalized at Erciyes&#xD;
      University Training and Research Hospital. In line with data in the literature, the&#xD;
      computations are done considering the fulfilment rate of Valsalva's Manoeuvre pushing as 20%&#xD;
      and 50% in spontaneous pushing for fewer interventions through wellness of baby and the&#xD;
      mother. Thus, sample volumes to represent the population are p1= 0.20 (control group), p2=&#xD;
      0.50 (experimental group), %95 confidence interval, α= 0.05, β = 0.20, power = 0.80 (1-β) for&#xD;
      each group n=82 women, and in total 164 mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of primigravida in the study; Women are accepted in the study on condition that they&#xD;
      are aged 18 and more, primigravida, bearing single foetus between 2500 and 3999gr of birth&#xD;
      weight in vertex position, in 38-42 gestation weeks, expected to have spontaneous vaginal&#xD;
      labour with no or little risk factors, without obstetrical or medical complications during&#xD;
      labour, with a cervical dilatation of 6cm and an amnion sack opening at 3cm of cervical&#xD;
      dilatation, and they must also accept to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practices on Spontaneous Pushing Group The gravitas are informed about spontaneous pushing at&#xD;
      the active phase of dilatation (6cm) in second stage of labour and they are encouraged for&#xD;
      spontaneous pushing just at the onset of pushing. Just after feeling the push, the gravitas&#xD;
      are requested perform pushing as follows; Breathe normally until participants feel the push&#xD;
      when contractions start, pull back muscles surrounding the uterus while breathing. Start&#xD;
      pushing gradually and breathe out smoothly by minimizing lips. Push between breaths for 5-6&#xD;
      seconds while pushing downwards by breathing out. Breathe normally when contractions weaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practices on Valsalva's Style Pushing Group The gravitas are informed about spontaneous&#xD;
      pushing at the active phase of dilatation (6cm) in second stage of labour and they are&#xD;
      encouraged for spontaneous pushing just at the onset of pushing. At the expulsion phase&#xD;
      (baby's head is visible in vulva), they are encouraged to perform the Valsalva's manoeuvre&#xD;
      that they have practised in routines of delivery; When contractions start, breathe twice&#xD;
      normally. Take a deep breath and hold. Compress the air with the help of diaphragm and&#xD;
      abdominal muscles. Push strongly and long (for 10-15 sec). Breathe out and take another deep&#xD;
      breath, hold it and push as strongly as possible for another 10-15 seconds. Stop pushing when&#xD;
      contractions are mild. Breathe 2-3 times in normal style. Relax and have a rest until the&#xD;
      next contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools and forms The data of the study is collected by using Baseline&#xD;
      Obstetric Data Form in which demographic, obstetric, and first stage features of labour with&#xD;
      features of 2nd, 3rd and 4th stages of pregnancy are registered, and Visual Analogue Fatigue&#xD;
      Scale (VAFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Management of Data Collection Tools and Forms Randomization of gravitas participated in the&#xD;
      study is done with the help of computers. The second stage of labour is defined as the time&#xD;
      passed after the cervical dilatation reaches 10cm. The expulsion stage is the time between&#xD;
      the sight of baby's head in the vulva and the end of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pushing is initiated; when the servical dilatation is 10cm along with strong uterus&#xD;
      contractions until foetal head rotation is over and when the foetal head is at least &quot;+1&quot; in&#xD;
      the pelvis. In addition, at the onset of pushing in spontaneous group, woman's desire to push&#xD;
      is not ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practices on gravids of our study (spontaneous and Valsalva's pushing) are applied as&#xD;
      follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The participants are given information about the study after self introduction of each&#xD;
      gravid is done for completing baseline obstetric data forms by midwives. Also, blood samples&#xD;
      for pre and postpartum haemoglobin level changes are collected. The perineal area is examined&#xD;
      for postpartum tears through pad checks. Vital findings (respiration, pulse and TA) are&#xD;
      evaluated prior to their transfer to the delivery room. Just after the birth, mothers are&#xD;
      tested for pH, pO2, pCO2 and lactate levels in blood while the newborns are tested for pH,&#xD;
      pO2 (mmHg) and pCO2 levels through umbilical artery along with 1st min and 5 min APGAR&#xD;
      analysis. The visual scale is utilized for determination of first 24-hour fatigue and they&#xD;
      are recorded in follow-up forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Assessment The obtained data is assessed through SPSS 22.0 (Statistical Package of&#xD;
      Social Science). While assessing these data, along with descriptive statistical methods,&#xD;
      tests that are appropriate for data distribution in comparison of quantitative data (mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation or median) are utilized. The results are assessed in 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and p&lt;0.05 meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Data Analysis Shapiro-Wilk's test was used, histograms and q-q plots were also assessed&#xD;
      to test the data normality. Levene test was used to assess variance homogeneity. For&#xD;
      comparisons, either two-sided independent samples t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for&#xD;
      continuous variables and chi-square analysis were used for categorical variables. Values are&#xD;
      expressed n(%), mean±SD or median(25th-75th percentiles). All analysis were performed using R&#xD;
      3.2.1 (www.r-project.org) software. A p value less than 5% was considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant&#xD;
