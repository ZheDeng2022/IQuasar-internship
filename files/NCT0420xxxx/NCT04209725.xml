  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to be done at multiple sites in participants with advanced acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) that have a mutation in Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem&#xD;
      duplications (FLT3-ITD). This study is to learn more about an investigational drug,&#xD;
      quizartinib, being tested with the anti-cancer medicine CPX-351 (also called Vyxeos™), which&#xD;
      is approved and widely used to treat AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and survival of patients&#xD;
      receiving the combination of CPX-351 and quizartinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-part Phase II clinical trial in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory FLT3-ITD mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability as well as the efficacy of administering CPX-351&#xD;
      (cytarabine:daunorubicin liposome complex) with quizartinib. CPX-351 is a formulation of two&#xD;
      drugs, cytarabine and daunorubicin, that is administered as the first part of treatment to&#xD;
      get rid of as many leukemia cells in your bone marrow as possible. Quizartinib is an&#xD;
      investigational drug made of a protein that inhibits FLT3 and will be given after CPX-351 has&#xD;
      been given. The plan for administration is divided into three phases: induction,&#xD;
      consolidation, and maintenance.&#xD;
