      This study investigates whether intravenous (IV) iron [Feraheme (ferumoxytol) injection)] is&#xD;
      a better treatment than oral iron pills (ferrous sulfate) for correcting anemia in women who&#xD;
      have heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia. Investigators will study whether women's blood&#xD;
      counts respond better, respond more quickly, and if women prefer the IV treatment or the oral&#xD;
      treatment. Women who have heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive treatment with either oral iron pills or IV iron infusions. Investigators will then&#xD;
      check whether and how quickly the anemia improves, and survey participants on how satisfied&#xD;
      they were with the treatment.&#xD;

      Screening: All potential participants will be screened. Screening may take place via a phone&#xD;
      call if possible. Menstrual history will be reviewed to ensure potential participants meet&#xD;
      study definition of heavy menstrual bleeding (self-described bothersome heavy periods, or &gt;7&#xD;
      bleeding days per month). If the participant is a current or former patient in the Jefferson&#xD;
      system, the electronic medical record (EMR) will be reviewed as part of screening. If records&#xD;
      are available in the EMR that allow confirmation of anemia via the criteria below, screening&#xD;
      may be considered complete, and the potential participant may move to an enrollment visit. If&#xD;
      the potential participant does not have any records available to review to confirm anemia,&#xD;
      they will be seen for an in-person screening visit. If patient has had evaluation as&#xD;
      described immediately below completed elsewhere, that is not accessible in the Jefferson EMR&#xD;
      or Care Everywhere system, participant will be asked to provide those records for review, and&#xD;
      will be seen for an in-person screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records will be reviewed to determine if patient has a recently documented diagnosis of&#xD;
      anemia. Records will be reviewed to determine if there has been an appropriate clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of AUB, generally considered a pelvic ultrasound within the last 12 months and&#xD;
      possibly endometrial biopsy within the last 12 months. Standard clinical criteria will be&#xD;
      applied to consider whether an endometrial biopsy is needed to rule out malignancy or&#xD;
      hyperplasia prior to enrollment. An endometrial biopsy within 12 months will be required for&#xD;
      all women over age 40 who have &gt;7 bleeding days per month. An endometrial biopsy will be&#xD;
      required for women under age 40 who have &gt;7 bleeding days per month who have at least one&#xD;
      additional risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia: obesity with BMI&gt;30, use of any hormone&#xD;
      therapy other than standard contraceptive formulations, reported history of polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian syndrome, family history of gynecologic or colon cancers in a first degree relative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient has known anemia (hgb &lt;11.5 documented within 60 days) and is not on any current&#xD;
      corrective iron therapy and has had appropriate clinical evaluation, participant will move to&#xD;
      the enrollment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient does not meet above criteria, further evaluation will be done to ensure enrollment&#xD;
      criteria. Any patient who needs any evaluation that involves a procedure as described below,&#xD;
      will undergo informed consent for the study at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will be targeted to address what is lacking in screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient has no confirmed anemia, or has been on therapy for anemia since the most&#xD;
           recent complete blood count (CBC), will have a blood draw for CBC to confirm anemia. If&#xD;
           anemia is confirmed and there is no other evaluation needed will move to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient has not had an ultrasound within the last 12 months it will be scheduled to&#xD;
           be performed in our obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound unit or by a study&#xD;
           investigator. When this is complete, if no further evaluation is needed she will move&#xD;
           onto the enrollment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient has not had an endometrial biopsy within 12 months to evaluate AUB, and meets&#xD;
           criteria for needing this as listed above, an endometrial biopsy will be performed by a&#xD;
           study investigator. When these results confirm no concern for malignancy or other&#xD;
           condition requiring specialist referral or urgent intervention, participant will move to&#xD;
           the enrollment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any patient is found to have findings on ultrasound or biopsy that are determined by the&#xD;
      study PI or the patient's primary provider to concerning for endometrial hyperplasia or any&#xD;
      form of uterine malignancy, they will not be offered enrollment in the study and will be&#xD;
      referred for appropriate care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and randomization and baseline bloodwork: If a patient meets all screening&#xD;
      criteria for the study, and needs no further testing, they may proceed to the enrollment and&#xD;
      randomization process at the screening visit. If any further testing is required, or patient&#xD;
      declines to proceed with enrollment at that time, she will return for a future visit for&#xD;
      enrollment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained for any participant who has not yet had this (if no&#xD;
      additional procedures such as blood draw, ultrasound or biopsy were needed to complete&#xD;
      screening). Baseline demographics and medical information will be entered into the study&#xD;
      record. Randomization will be done via the use of sequentially-numbered sealed envelopes. A&#xD;
      member of the study team who will not be involved in the enrollment process will use an&#xD;
      online generator to develop a randomization scheme with randomly permuted blocks of 4, 6 and&#xD;
      8. Randomization cards will be created and placed in opaque envelopes. After consent and&#xD;
      creation of enrollment study record, the next sequential envelope will be opened, and&#xD;
      participant will be assigned to either IV iron or oral (standard) care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups: participant will complete baseline Duke Health Profile Quality of Life scale.&#xD;
      (Appendix 1 in protocol) Participant will be issued a menstrual diary (Attachment B) and be&#xD;
      instructed on completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in the standard care group: CBC will be drawn for baseline level. (If&#xD;
      screening CBC was within 7 days of enrollment, that value may be used for baseline). Oral&#xD;
      iron tablets (ferrous sulfate 325mg) will be dispensed; a sixty day supply will be given. The&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to take one tablet daily, starting that day. Participant will&#xD;
      be instructed to bring pill bottles and remaining pills to future visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in the IV iron group: date will be selected for patient to present to the&#xD;
      Jefferson Clinical Research Unit (JCRU) for ferumoxytol injection. If that date is within 7&#xD;
      days of this enrollment visit, baseline CBC will be drawn now. If the date is &gt;7 days from&#xD;
      enrollment, baseline CBC will be deferred and it will be drawn on the date of the initiation&#xD;
      of ferumoxytol treatment. If the screening CBC is within 7 days of the planned initiation of&#xD;
      treatment, that screening CBC may be used as the baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the oral iron group will not have treatment visits, as they will&#xD;
      self-administer iron at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention (ferumoxytol) group will present to the Jefferson Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit (JCRU) for ferumoxytol injection. If needed, a baseline CBC will be drawn at&#xD;
      the OB-GYN research unit immediately prior to the patient presenting to the JCRU. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive 510mg of ferumoxytol 50mL diluted in 200mL of 0.9% sodium chloride,&#xD;
      infused over 15minutes while in a seated position. Injection will be administered by the JCRU&#xD;
      clinical/research staff. A member of the research team will be present for data collection.&#xD;
      Each participant will be observed for any signs of hypersensitivity for 30 minutes. Each&#xD;
      participant will have vital signs checked at 15 minutes and 30 minutes after injection, prior&#xD;
      to discharge from the clinic. Any hypersensitivity reaction or adverse event will be&#xD;
      documented in the study chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will return for a second ferumoxytol injection, following the same protocol, 3-8&#xD;
      days (per participant availability) later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All follow up visits will take place at the OB-Gyn clinical research office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit 1: 12-16 days after initiation of treatment. Participant will present to the&#xD;
      research clinic site. CBC will be drawn. Participant will hand in menstrual diary and be&#xD;
      issued a new one. Participant will complete Duke quality of life scale. Participant will&#xD;
      complete a scale indicating current satisfaction with treatment (Appendix 2 in protocol).&#xD;
      Participant will complete questionnaire assessing side effects or interval adverse events&#xD;
      related to treatment (Appendix 4 in protocol). Participants in the standard care (oral iron)&#xD;
      group will self-report compliance with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit 2: 28-32 days after initiation of treatment Participant will present to the&#xD;
      research clinic site. CBC will be drawn. Participant will hand in menstrual diary and be&#xD;
      issued a new one. Participant will complete Duke quality of life scale. Participant will&#xD;
      complete a scale indicating current satisfaction with treatment. Participant will complete&#xD;
      questionnaire assessing side effects or interval adverse events related to treatment.&#xD;
      Participants in the standard care (oral iron) group will self-report compliance with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit 3: 55-65 days after initiation of treatment Participant will present to the&#xD;
      research clinic site. CBC will be drawn. Participant will hand in menstrual diary.&#xD;
      Participant will complete Duke quality of life scale. Participant will complete a scale&#xD;
      indicating overall satisfaction with treatment (Appendix 3 in protocol). Participant will&#xD;
      complete questionnaire assessing side effects of interval adverse events related to&#xD;
      treatment. Participants in the standard care (oral iron) group will self-report compliance&#xD;
      with therapy. Complete pill counts to assess compliance will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, participants may continue whatever treatment has been initiated by their&#xD;
      primary provider for the condition of AUB. Participants may initiate new treatment of AUB&#xD;
      through their provider throughout the course of the study. Data on initial, ongoing, or new&#xD;
      treatments initiated will be collected. Participants who undergo surgical AUB treatment&#xD;
      (dilation and curettage, endometrial ablation, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization,&#xD;
      hysterectomy) will still be followed with the above study protocols for the expected 60-day&#xD;
      duration. For participants who are planning possible surgical intervention at the time of&#xD;
      study enrollment investigators will query whether correction of anemia was identified by&#xD;
      their provider as a reason to delay surgery. Expected time to surgical intervention will be&#xD;
      collected, and if surgical intervention happens during the 60-day study period, actual time&#xD;
      to surgical intervention will be noted. Details of the surgical procedure, and impact on&#xD;
      bleeding will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participant who receives a blood transfusion, or any oral therapy patient who receives an&#xD;
      IV iron or similar treatment outside of the study session will be terminated from the study&#xD;
      at the time of that procedure, due to the potential to confound the primary study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participant who become pregnant during the study will be terminated from the study at the&#xD;
      time that diagnosis is made, as physiologic changes of pregnancy may confound the primary&#xD;
      study outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any patient terminated from the study, data collected to that point will be included in&#xD;
      final analysis.&#xD;
