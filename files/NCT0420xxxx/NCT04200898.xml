  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 3-phase, 12-months, prospective,single arm, multicenter, open-label,&#xD;
      non-comparative, clinical investigation conducted at up to 7 sites. Up to 20 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in phase I, up to 30 subjects in phase II, and up to 200 subjects in phase 3 to&#xD;
      achieve up to 350 treated eyes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I will be used to evaluate performance (safety, ease of lenticule removal, procedure&#xD;
      workflow, and software settings). During phase I (limited to partially sighted eyes as&#xD;
      defined in the inclusion section), one eye of each subject will undergo iLEX treatment and&#xD;
      the fellow eye may undergo a commercial refractive correction at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator, provided there is at least 1.00 D of sphere refractive error based on manifest&#xD;
      refraction. During phase I, treatment will be up to -11.00 D sphere with no astigmatism&#xD;
      correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will be used to evaluate initial safety and effectiveness. During phase II, no&#xD;
      astigmatism correction will be performed unless cyclotorsion correction after docking is&#xD;
      available. For the first 10 subjects in phase II, iLEX treatment will be performed on one eye&#xD;
      (worse eye) and approximately 1 week later, if treatment is warranted, on the fellow eye.&#xD;
      Prior to second eye treatment in the first 10 subjects, subjects will be asked if they have&#xD;
      any eye disturbances and whether they are willing to have their second eye treated in the&#xD;
      study. Following eligible second eye treatment of the first 10 consecutive phase II subjects&#xD;
      with no operative concerns by the investigator and medical monitor, subsequent phase II&#xD;
      subjects may undergo iLEX treatment in both eyes on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III will be used to evaluate long term safety and effectiveness (i.e., 12 months).&#xD;
      During phase III, subjects may undergo iLEX treatment in both eyes on the same day.&#xD;
