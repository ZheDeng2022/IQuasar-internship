  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is the formative observation stage of behavioral intervention development.&#xD;
      Sedentary adults with type 1 diabetes will be given access to a mobile application that&#xD;
      incorporates biosensor feedback, teleconsultation, and online group exercise classes. The&#xD;
      first aim is to quantify the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      application. The second aim is to evaluate predictors and mechanisms of physical activity&#xD;
      behavior change among these adults. The possible predictors the investigators are monitoring&#xD;
      include usage of specific application features, momentary internal factors (e.g.,&#xD;
      pre-activity fear of hypoglycemia), momentary external factors (e.g., location), and latent&#xD;
      external factors (e.g., mental health traits). These results will be used to develop a&#xD;
      refined mobile application utilizing the most popular application features, as well as an&#xD;
      algorithm that uses the identified predictors of physical activity to advise adults with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes when to engage in physical activity (i.e., context-aware physical activity&#xD;
      coaching) and when to make related diet and insulin adjustments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with type 1 diabetes (T1D), which includes ~1 million American adults, have an 8-fold&#xD;
      higher risk of mortality attributable to cardiovascular disease than those in their decade&#xD;
      cohort. Current evidence-based T1D self-management interventions target cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      by improving glycemic control, but do not effectively address other modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      prevalent in T1D such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Thus, T1D interventions that&#xD;
      are effective for a broader range of health targets than glycemic control are urgently&#xD;
      needed. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) interventions could provide a novel&#xD;
      solution, but only if they can attenuate the unique barriers to MVPA posed by T1D: 1)&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge of insulin pharmacokinetics to self-manage and prevent unpredictable&#xD;
      blood glucose fluctuations during MVPA; 2) fear of MVPA-induced hypoglycemia; and 3) lack of&#xD;
      perceived social support for T1D. The present study is conducting formative research to guide&#xD;
      the development of such an intervention incorporating the latest advances in diabetes&#xD;
      science: 1) continuous glucose monitors; 2) teleconsultation; 3) peer group MVPA classes; and&#xD;
      4) context-aware diabetes self-management coaching algorithms. The study represents stage #0&#xD;
      (basic science) of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct a longitudinal, observational study in people with T1D who&#xD;
      receive a 10-week mobile intervention that incorporates biosensor feedback, teleconsultation,&#xD;
      and online group PA classes. Participants will be followed for 10 weeks to evaluate&#xD;
      intervention acceptability and identify potential mechanisms of PA behavior change. The&#xD;
      expected outcome of this study is preliminary data for the investigators' future direction of&#xD;
      an NIH Small Business Technology Transfer grant application to refine this intervention (NIH&#xD;
      Stage Model Stage 1). Specifically, the investigators will utilize the most popular&#xD;
      components from the observational study and also develop an algorithm that uses identified&#xD;
      predictors of PA to advise patients on timing and preparation for PA. This refined&#xD;
      intervention will be pilot tested, then optimized and tested for efficacy using an advanced&#xD;
      trial design (such as multiphase optimization strategy) among a larger sample (NIH Stage&#xD;
      Model Stage 2).&#xD;
