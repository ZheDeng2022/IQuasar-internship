    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult subjects diagnosed with any form of an advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors including urothelial carcinoma for which standard therapy is no&#xD;
      longer effective or is intolerable. This is a phase 1, multi-center, open label study&#xD;
      designed to assess safety and tolerability of IK-175 as a single agent and in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab, to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Disease response,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and response biomarkers will also be assessed.&#xD;
