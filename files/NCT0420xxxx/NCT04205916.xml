  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and ocular efficacy of Dextenza in combination with an intracameral&#xD;
      antibiotic and NSAID in controlling post-operative ocular pain and inflammation compared to&#xD;
      standard of care topical therapy in patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, self-controlled prospective clinical study. On initial consultation&#xD;
      within one month of scheduled cataract surgery, each study subject will be randomized by a&#xD;
      random number generator to receive one of two treatment groups, either experimental or&#xD;
      control in the first eye. The second eye will undergo cataract surgery 2 weeks later and will&#xD;
      be treated with the other treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group: A total of 50 study subjects (50 eyes) will receive Dextenza&#xD;
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert placed in the lower punctum of their scheduled surgical&#xD;
      eye at the time of surgery and will receive intracameral ketorolac during the procedure and&#xD;
      50 micrograms of intracameral moxifloxacin at the conclusion of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: A total of 50 study subjects (50 eyes) will receive topical moxifloxacin 0.5%&#xD;
      qid 1 day prior to surgery and for ten days postoperatively, ketorolac 0.5% qid 1 day prior&#xD;
      to surgery and for 1 month postoperatively, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% qid starting at the&#xD;
      conclusion of cataract surgery for 2 weeks and bid for 2 weeks in their scheduled surgical&#xD;
      eye.&#xD;
