      Background Recent novel surgical techniques for resection of low rectal cancer have been&#xD;
      introduced and these approaches have the potential to overcome anatomical limitations like&#xD;
      obesity, narrow male pelvis and bulky and low tumours. Two of these procedures are robotic&#xD;
      low anterior resection (RLAR) and transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both approaches have distinct advantages and limitations however there have been no head to&#xD;
      head trial comparing RLAR and TaTME for patients with mid to low rectal cancer undergoing&#xD;
      surgery by experienced surgeons. Previous studies looking at the oncological outcomes of&#xD;
      either TaTME or robotic TME included many centres where the surgeons were on a learning curve&#xD;
      and hence the true oncological outcomes and clinical benefits cannot be measured accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to conduct a multicentre prospective trial to&#xD;
      investigate clinical outcomes, in particular disease free survival (DFS) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing RLAR and TaTME. The additional goal is to investigate other efficacy measures,&#xD;
      complications rates, recruitment feasibility and protocol refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be a prospective, observational, case-matched, two -cohort, multicentre&#xD;
      designed to investigate the oncological and clinical outcomes of patients with mid-to-low,&#xD;
      non-metastatic rectal cancer undergoing low anterior resection (LAR) using robot-assisted&#xD;
      surgery ( RLAR), or transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria consist of experienced surgeons defined as 60 prior procedures with&#xD;
      RLAR or TaTME to meet the enrolment criteria for the RLAR and TaTME arm, respectively.&#xD;
      Successful oncological and clinical outcomes are defined as circumferential resection margin&#xD;
      (CRM) ≥1 mm with minimal postoperative morbidity (absence of Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV&#xD;
      complications within 30 days after surgery). Local and distal recurrence rates with DFS over&#xD;
      3 years will be measured as primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and exploratory endpoints will include length of hospital stay, intraoperative&#xD;
      time, intraoperative blood loss, harvested lymph nodes, distal resection margin,&#xD;
      incompleteness of mesorectum, CRM involvement, unplanned conversion rates, 30-days&#xD;
      postoperative complications and overall recurrence rate. The Quality of life assessment&#xD;
      questionnaires will be performed preoperatively, 6 months and 12 months after reversal of&#xD;
      ileostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propensity score matching will be used to minimize bias from the nonrandomized treatment&#xD;
      assignment. The RLAR and TaTME cohorts will be matched by propensity scores accounting for&#xD;
      factors significantly associated with either undergoing robotic surgery or TaTME occurrence&#xD;
      on logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and Dissemination The medical ethical committees of all the participating countries&#xD;
      will be involved in approving the study protocol. Results of the primary and secondary end&#xD;
      points will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;

      Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common malignant disease with over 1&#xD;
      million new cases each year worldwide (1) The outcome of surgery for rectal cancer has&#xD;
      improved substantially during the past two decades due to TME, which involves complete&#xD;
      removal of the mesorectum with preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Local recurrence&#xD;
      rate of rectal cancer has fallen sharply because radially spread cancer cells in the&#xD;
      mesorectum are removed by complete resection of this tissue.(2)(3)(4) Minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery (MIS) is slowly taking over as the preferred operative approach for colorectal&#xD;
      diseases. Recently published randomized clinical trials (RCTs), such as COLOR II, COREAN and&#xD;
      CLASICC, have shown better results for laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (in terms of&#xD;
      short-term and long-term outcomes), when compared with open TME(5)(6)(7) However the utility&#xD;
      of laparoscopic TME is limited in patients with low rectal cancer, who require surgeons with&#xD;
      experience in ultra-low sphincter-saving laparoscopic surgery, which has a high risk of&#xD;
      leaving a positive circumferential resection margin (CRM). In addition, narrow pelvic&#xD;
      anatomy; male sex and high body mass index (BMI) are also unfavourable patient&#xD;
      characteristics for a laparoscopic approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to overcome these challenges has motivated surgeons to adopt alternative techniques.&#xD;
      The two more recent procedures that have been introduced to surgical management of rectal&#xD;
      cancer are robotic low anterior resection (RLAR) and Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision&#xD;
      (TaTME). These two new procedures have the potential to overcome anatomical limitations like&#xD;
      obesity, narrow male pelvis and bulky and low tumours to improve surgical treatment and&#xD;
      thereby potentially oncological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TaTME combines the TAMIS ( transanal minimally invasive surgery ) and trans-abdominal&#xD;
      approaches in order to achieve TME.Transanal TME (TaTME) typically starts with the rectal&#xD;
      resection and progresses to the splenic flexure/sigmoid colon mobilization in a &quot;bottom-up&quot;&#xD;
      manner (8). A single-incision laparoscopic surgery port is introduced into the anal canal to&#xD;
      gain endoscopic access to the rectum, pneumorectum is established, A purse-string suture is&#xD;
      applied below the tumor, and this ensures an adequate oncological distal margin (9).&#xD;
      Transanal excision is subsequently performed using laparoscopic instruments Rectal distension&#xD;
      with CO2 combined with magnified optics permits excellent visualization of tissue planes.&#xD;
      Easier access to the low rectum aid the surgeon with better quality TME and precise selection&#xD;
      of the distal resection margin under direct visualization helps ensure an adequate margin.&#xD;
      TaTME may potentially aid to a safer anastomosis by avoiding the multiple stapler firings&#xD;
      often required in the laparoscopic approach and may result in higher rates of sphincter&#xD;
      preserving surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic approach has been subject to much interest in recent years from its potential&#xD;
      learning benefits to the operating surgeon and clinical benefits to the patients. Some of the&#xD;
      clinical benefits include shorter hospital stay and improved functional outcomes compared to&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery (10) The other advantages provided by the robotic platform hold the&#xD;
      potential to provide improved clinical outcomes, (11)(12) (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of the new procedures have been compared retrospectively to open and conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery in various trials, which show that these methods are safe and feasible&#xD;
      (9)(14). However, data on direct comparison of these two techniques are still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits of robotic rectal resections Technical Benefits The potential benefits of&#xD;
      robotic systems over laparoscopic TME include superior three-dimensional vision, seven&#xD;
      degrees of freedom of movement replicating the surgeon's hand movements, lack of tremor and&#xD;
      potential superior ergonomics, suggesting potential application in both routine and more&#xD;
      difficult cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator Learning Benefits The main criticisms of robotic TME are the longer operating times&#xD;
      and notable trends of higher costs, compared to laparoscopic TME(14). Greater use of and&#xD;
      familiarity with the robotic system has led to significant improvements operation time, rates&#xD;
      of conversion to open surgery and the number of harvested lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bokhari et al (15) suggested that the learning curve of robotic colorectal surgery was&#xD;
      achieved at 15 to 25 cases with 3 learning phases after analysing 50 patients by using&#xD;
      cumulative sum (CUSUM ) method. The author suggested that Phase 3 was achieved after 25 cases&#xD;
      and this represented a mastery phase in which more challenging cases can be managed. Kim et&#xD;
      al showed that the learning curve plateaued after 65 cases for early Laparoscopic TME as&#xD;
      opposed to after 32 cases for Robotic TME (16) Most studies to date about RLAR were done&#xD;
      using the da Vinci Si system or older models. With the newer systems X or Xi, and once the&#xD;
      surgeons have achieved at least 60 procedures we believe that the outcomes and operating time&#xD;
      is less, that has been recently published by the ROLAR trial (12). Similarly to achieve good&#xD;
      clinical and oncological outcomes with TaTME surgeons are required to have performed at least&#xD;
      60 cases. Hence we decided to choose 60 procedures as an arbitrary number to select our&#xD;
      surgeons experience involved in this trial. Selecting this number suggest that the surgeons&#xD;
      are in a mastery period and hence are expected to have good clinical and oncological outcomes&#xD;
      Considering the paucity of evidence on direct comparison of these two procedures we aim to&#xD;
      directly compare both procedures for the disease free survival and other clinical and&#xD;
      oncological outcomes in the hands of experienced surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits of TaTME rectal resections TaTME offers better access to the lower rectum&#xD;
      even in a difficult pelvis and also ensure a clear distal margin with insertion of a distal&#xD;
      to the tumour purse string under direct vision. This ensures an end-to-end anastomosis&#xD;
      without the need of multiple stapler firings. This approach also allows two-team synergy with&#xD;
      an abdominal and perineal surgeon operating simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique however still requires significant surgical skills and the abilty to operate in&#xD;
      a confined space and concerns have been expressed about the spillage of tumour cells with&#xD;
      direct handling and instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis Design This is an observational prospective, multicentre trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned either RLAR or TaTME depends on the chosen centres.The centres would be&#xD;
      doing either TaTME or RLAR for rectal cancer management. The study will include 330 patients&#xD;
      from UK and Denmark. This study has no impact on staging investigations, timing of surgery or&#xD;
      any other aspect of the patients' pre, peri or post-operative care. All decisions remain with&#xD;
      the local clinician multi-disciplinary team including when to discharge from hospital.&#xD;
      However, the biostatisticians performing the analysis will be blinded to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Outcome Measures Time point(s) of evaluation of this outcome measure (if&#xD;
      applicable) Primary Objective The primary aim of the study is to compare the 3 year disease&#xD;

      The Number of Participants The primary study end point, DFS is defined as the time following&#xD;
      successful surgery to the first date of local, regional/distant relapse or death due to&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (patients with secondary malignancy will be censored). Overall survival is&#xD;
      defined as the time following successful surgery to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the TaTME, it is assumed that the DFS is 92% and in the RLAR arm 95% at 3 years. A&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin of 90% is selected. Based on this estimation, sample size calculation&#xD;
      has been done with a one-sided level of significance of 20% and a power of 80%. A total&#xD;
      number of 330 patients is needed, 165 patients in the RLAR arm and 165 patients in the TaTME&#xD;
      are required with a 10% loss to follow-up assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFS will be analysed on an intent-to-treat (per protocol) basis using a log-rank test after&#xD;
      propensity matching analysis has been conducted; a secondary analysis of DFS will also&#xD;
      performed be using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with the unmatched cohort&#xD;
      (without adjustment of baseline characteristics, i.e. propensity score match) that allowed&#xD;
      for the effect of treatment and include lists of covariate with a statistical interaction of&#xD;
      alpha level of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Case report forms (CRFs) will be entered in a secured online page. Only&#xD;
      authorized staff at sites will have access via an individual secure login username and&#xD;
      password to enter the data. All paper CRFs must be completed, signed/dated and returned to&#xD;
      the investigator. Data reported on each CRF should be consistent with the source data or&#xD;
      discrepancies should be explained. If information is not known, this must be clearly&#xD;
      indicated on the CRF. All missing or ambiguous data will be queried. All sections are to be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial records will be archived and securely retained for at least 25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination The trial will be performed in accordance with the recommendations&#xD;
      guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects, adopted by the 18th World&#xD;
      Medical Association General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland and stated in the respective&#xD;
      participating countries laws governing human research, and Good clinical Practice. The&#xD;
      medical ethical committees of all participating countries will have to approve the study&#xD;
      protocol prior to enrolling patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date studies on TaTME and robotic TME have focused mainly on short term outcomes and&#xD;
      oncological endpoints such as specimen quality, circumferential resection margin involvement&#xD;
      and the free distal margin(14,17,18) In a recent study comparing TaTME and Robotic TME, there&#xD;
      were no differences in the incidence of poor quality resection including incomplete quality&#xD;
      of TME and positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) in both groups. However the&#xD;
      authors noted that distal resection margin (DRM) involvement was higher in the TaTME&#xD;
      group.(17) They attributed this to the learning curve effect of TaTME. As discussed earlier,&#xD;
      previous reports have noted that the learning curve for robotic TME was less than&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery, which in effect TaTME is still a laparoscopic &quot;bottom up &quot;approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the long term oncological parameters for both procedures , including overall&#xD;
      survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence, are yet to be clarified. Secondly,&#xD;
      there have been significant concerns in regards to an increased recurrence rate after TaTME&#xD;
      (19).The Norwegian group have noted an unexpected increase in local recurrence after TaTME of&#xD;
      9.5 % after a median of 11months after surgery(19).The reasons for their observations were&#xD;
      unclear , despite that fact that their surgeons performing TaTME were experienced and were&#xD;
      proctored and trained in England and Spain for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1980 Knight and Griffen (20)publised their stapling technique for low rectal cancer&#xD;
      anastomosis using linear and circular stapler.This has lead to the introduction of the double&#xD;
      stapling technique(21). The advantage is that the distal segment of the bowel is not opened&#xD;
      and this avoids spillage from the rectal stump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility of increased local recurrences in TaTME may be related to the rectal&#xD;
      transection and air flow during dissection from the perineum. The rectal purse-string suture&#xD;
      is never completely air tight and this will invariably lead to shredding of microscopic&#xD;
      cancer cells in the pelvis and hence this may lead to an increase rate of local&#xD;
      recurrence.During a robotic TME and the use of the articulating robotic stapler ,the rectal&#xD;
      transection is precise and there are no leakage of microscopic cancer cells in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these current issues in mind, we aim to compare the 3 year disease free survival and&#xD;
      local recurrence rate of the two procedures performed by experienced surgeons who are beyond&#xD;
      their learning curve . Only surgeons who have peformed more than 60 procedures in either&#xD;
      TaTME or robotic TME will be selected .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTA study will be the first multicentre prospective trial comparing RLAR and TaTME in&#xD;
      regards to disease free survival (DFS) and other clinical trials Applications for funding,&#xD;
      ethics approval and protocol amendments will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions There is an urgent need to assess the long oncological outcomes of newer surgical&#xD;
      techniques for TME (TaTME &amp; RLAR) This will allow recommendations to be made for tailor made&#xD;
      treatment of RC.&#xD;
