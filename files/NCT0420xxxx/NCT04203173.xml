    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to answer the questions: 1) Are financial incentives&#xD;
      layered upon nurse education and home telemonitoring superior to nurse education and home&#xD;
      telemonitoring alone in improving metabolic control long term? 2) Are the effects of&#xD;
      financial incentives on metabolic control sustained once the incentives are withdrawn? and 3)&#xD;
      Are financial incentives efficacious within and consistent across racial/ethnic groups? This&#xD;
      study provides a unique opportunity to address these gaps in the literature. Investigators&#xD;
      propose a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a Financial Incentives And&#xD;
      Nurse Coaching to Enhance Diabetes Outcomes (FINANCE-DM) intervention comprised of: 1) nurse&#xD;
      education, 2) home telemonitoring, and 3) structured financial incentives; compared to an&#xD;
      active control group (nurse education and home telemonitoring alone). The study also will&#xD;
      evaluate whether intervention effects are sustained 6 months after the financial incentives&#xD;
      are withdrawn (i.e. 18 months post randomization); and whether the intervention is&#xD;
      differentially efficacious across racial/ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To test the efficacy of the FINANCE-DM Intervention on glycemic control at 12&#xD;
      months (long-term effect) and 18 months (sustainability effect) for Adults with poorly&#xD;
      controlled T2DM (overall efficacy across combined racial/ethnic groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Patients randomized to FINANCE-DM intervention will have significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c) at 12 months (long-term effect) and 18 months&#xD;
      (sustainability effect) of follow-up compared to the active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: To test whether the effect of FINANCE-DM on glycemic control at 12 and 18&#xD;
      months is consistent across three racial/ethnic groups (Whites, AAs, HAs) and, if&#xD;
      differential effect of the intervention is found, to estimate magnitude and direction of&#xD;
      effect for the three racial/ethnic groups (efficacy within racial/ethnic groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: While all racial/ethnic groups (Whites, AAs, HAs) will have greater&#xD;
      improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c) at 12 months (long-term effect) and 18 months&#xD;
      (sustainability effect) of follow-up compared to the active control group, the effect on the&#xD;
      FINANCE-DM intervention will be significantly greater among ethnic minority patients (AAs and&#xD;
      HAs) compared to Whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the FINANCE-DM intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. The FINANCE-DM intervention will be more cost-effective in improving glycemic&#xD;
      control (HbA1c) at 12 months (long-term effect) and 18 months (sustainability effect),&#xD;
      compared to an active control group, as measured by differences in program costs and resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To test the efficacy of the FINANCE-DM intervention on secondary endpoints&#xD;
      including BP, LDL, QOL and self-care behaviors (diet, exercise and medication adherence) at&#xD;
      12 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Patients randomized to the FINANCE-DM intervention will have significantly&#xD;
      greater improvements in BP, LDL, QOL and self-care behaviors at 12 months (long-term effect)&#xD;
      and 18 months (sustainability effect) of follow-up compared to an active control group.&#xD;

      Study Overview. The overarching aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy of structured&#xD;
      financial incentives intervention (FINANCE-DM) comprised of: 1) nurse education, 2) home&#xD;
      telemonitoring, and 3) structured financial incentives; compared to an active control group&#xD;
      (nurse education and home telemonitoring alone) on glycemic control. The study also will&#xD;
      evaluate whether intervention effects are sustained 6 months after the financial incentives&#xD;
      are withdrawn (i.e. 18 months post randomization); and whether the intervention is&#xD;
      differentially efficacious across racial/ethnic groups. Equal number of patients from three&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups (150 Whites, 150 AAs and 150 HAs, total sample of 450) will be&#xD;
      randomized to FINANCE-DM intervention (n=225) or an active comparator group (n=225), so that&#xD;
      within each racial/ethnic group, half (75 patients) will be randomized to the FINANCE-DM&#xD;
      intervention group and the other half (75 patients) will be randomized to the active&#xD;
      comparator group. Primary aims are to test overall efficacy across combined racial/ethnic&#xD;
      groups; efficacy within racial/ethnic groups and cost effectiveness for the primary endpoint&#xD;
      (glycemic control). Secondary aim is to test efficacy on secondary endpoints including BP,&#xD;
      LDL, QOL and self-care behaviors. Each patient will be followed for 12 months (long-term&#xD;
      effect) and 18 months (sustainability effect), with study visits at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and&#xD;
      18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Randomization. A permuted block randomization method will be used to assign subjects&#xD;
      to one of the two intervention groups: (a) FITNESS intervention; and (b) Active Comparator.&#xD;
      This method will ensure a balance between treatment arms in the temporal recruitment&#xD;
      sequence. Block size will be varied to prevent selection bias and to protect blinding. The&#xD;
      randomization will be carried out separately for each racial/ethnic group, and additionally&#xD;
      stratified by clinical site (MCW, VA and Community), baseline HbA1c levels (8-10% vs. &gt;10%)&#xD;
      and income level (&lt;$50,000 vs $50,000+). Using REDCap, RAs will collect eligibility&#xD;
      information and enter the information into the study database via the secured study website.&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, intervention assignment will be made by a pre-programmed&#xD;
      randomization scheme. All subjects who are randomized will be entered into the study database&#xD;
      and analyzed according to CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the FINANCE-DM Intervention. The FINANCE-DM intervention is comprised of: 1)&#xD;
      nurse education, 2) home telemonitoring, and 3) structured financial incentives (see appendix&#xD;
      for manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nurse delivered diabetes education and skills training: Trained nurses educators will&#xD;
           deliver the manualized diabetes education and skills training intervention via&#xD;
           telephone. Subjects will receive 8 weekly sessions of diabetes education and skills&#xD;
           training and monthly booster sessions from months 3-12. Each session will last for ~30&#xD;
           minutes and comprise of 15 minutes of a previously tested diabetes education&#xD;
           intervention based on ADA guidelines and 15 minutes of diabetes-tailored skills training&#xD;
           intervention using motivational enhancement approaches. The skills training sessions&#xD;
           will stress individualized problem-solving and self-monitoring strategies in adopting&#xD;
           lifestyle modifications and will be focused on 4 behaviors-physical activity, diet,&#xD;
           medication adherence, and glucose self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FORA 2-in-1 home telemonitoring system: To support behavioral skills training, patients&#xD;
           will be assigned the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System and provided glucose test strips to&#xD;
           allow testing at least once a day. The device automatically uploads readings to a secure&#xD;
           server as they are performed. The nurse educators will have access to the secure server&#xD;
           to which the uploaded measurements are stored in real time. The glucose and BP readings&#xD;
           will be used to tailor and reinforce behavior change during weekly telephone-delivered&#xD;
           diabetes education and skills training sessions and subsequent booster sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training on Device Use and Run-in Period Participants will receive detailed training on&#xD;
           the use of the FORA system and how to problem solve around common issues with home&#xD;
           monitoring devices by the study nurse educators. Investigators have identified common&#xD;
           issues that patients experience with set up and ongoing use of the system from our prior&#xD;
           studies and will incorporate that into the training process for participants. In&#xD;
           addition, participants will have a two week run-in period to familiarize themselves with&#xD;
           the FORA system and work with study nurse educators to address connectivity issues and&#xD;
           other concerns that may arise. After the initial two week run-in period, participants&#xD;
           will continue to have access to the nurses to address technology-related issues that&#xD;
           arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High Frequency Financial Incentive: In addition to nurse delivered diabetes education&#xD;
           and skills training, participants will receive high frequency financial incentives based&#xD;
           on the structure tested in our pilot RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentive Structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a reward for: 1) uploading glucose measurements; 2) participating&#xD;
      in telephone delivered educational sessions; and 3) absolute percentage drops in HbA1c from&#xD;
      baseline at each 3-month follow-up intervals as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each week participants can receive up to $10 for uploading glucose measurements and&#xD;
           having good glucose control throughout the week. For each day participants upload at&#xD;
           least one glucose measurement, participants will receive $1 (up to $7 at the end of the&#xD;
           week). If participants upload measurements every day of the week and the participants&#xD;
           average glucose measurements at the end of the week are 150 or below participants will&#xD;
           receive an additional $3. Up to $10 per week for each 3-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants can also earn $5 each week if participating in the telephone delivered&#xD;
           educational session. Educational sessions will last for 8 weeks, so participants can&#xD;
           receive up to $5 per week for 8 weeks. Participants can also earn $5 for attending&#xD;
           monthly booster sessions from months 3-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After each 3-month interval, if their HbA1c has dropped 2% from baseline, or absolute&#xD;
           HbA1c is &lt;7%, participants will receive a reward of $130; for a 1% drop, or an absolute&#xD;
           HbA1c between 7 and 8 participants will receive a reward of $65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, over the 12 months duration of the intervention each subject can receive a maximum&#xD;
      of $520 for uploading daily glucose readings, $85 for participating in telephone delivered&#xD;
      educational sessions, and $520 for 2% absolute drop in HbA1c or maintaining HbA1c below 7%,&#xD;
      for a maximum incentive of $1,125.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Comparator Group (TIDES Intervention). Patients randomized to the active comparator&#xD;
      group will be assigned the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System and provided glucose test strips to&#xD;
      allow testing at least once a day. BG and BP will be measured daily and results will be&#xD;
      uploaded to a secure server. A nurse educator will review the glucose and BP readings and use&#xD;
      them to tailor and reinforce behavior change during weekly telephone-delivered diabetes&#xD;
      education and skills training session. In essence, the active comparator group will receive&#xD;
      the same nurse education and home telemonitoring intervention as the FINANCE-DM group, on the&#xD;
      same schedule, and for the same duration (see appendix for manual). The only difference is&#xD;
      that participants will not receive structured financial incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contents of Individual Treatment Sessions. After enrollment, randomization, and baseline&#xD;
      assessment, each subject will come in for a face-to-face meeting with the nurse diabetes&#xD;
      educators. The primary purpose of the face-to-face visit is for the nurse educators to&#xD;
      establish rapport, go over the study in detail, obtain patient contact information, primary&#xD;
      and alternate telephone numbers, and establish guidelines for follow-up calls. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will receive information specific to their group.&#xD;
