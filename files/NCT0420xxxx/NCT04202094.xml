    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective comparative interventional cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of young adults (≥18 years) cured of childhood cancer or&#xD;
      hematological disorders for which they received high-risk gonadotoxic treatment (with an ≥80%&#xD;
      risk of later fertility problems) during childhood. In order to preserve their fertility,&#xD;
      these patients were proposed to store their testicular tissue at a young age. These young&#xD;
      adults will be invited by e-mail/letter/telephone to evaluate their fertility status (Tanner&#xD;
      stage, testicular volume, hormones, semen analysis) at adult age and at least one year after&#xD;
      the last received gonadotoxic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective analysis of data on their fertility status will be performed in order to&#xD;
      identify differences between young adults who underwent a testicular tissue biopsy procedure&#xD;
      (which is performed to harvest testicular tissue) at a young age and those who did not. The&#xD;
      results of this prospective analysis will also be compared to the reproductive health of&#xD;
      spontaneously conceived young adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients and patients suffering from hematological disorders require gonadotoxic&#xD;
      treatments (like chemo- and radiotherapy) and/or total body irradiation as a conditioning&#xD;
      therapy before bone marrow transplantation. One of the possible side effects of these&#xD;
      therapies is life-long sterility or subfertility. Currently, the only option for pre- and&#xD;
      peripubertal boys (who do not yet produce mature spermatozoa) is to bank testicular tissue&#xD;
      before gonadotoxic treatment, followed by auto-transplantation at adulthood. While evidence&#xD;
      shows that immediate surgical complications of such a biopsy procedure are rare (2-3%), only&#xD;
      limited data is available on the potential long-term adverse events. Hence, it is important&#xD;
      to assess these patients' fertility status at adult age to ensure that there are no late&#xD;
      effects related to the biopsy procedure. Therefore, this prospective comparative&#xD;
      interventional cohort study was designed to investigate the effects of a testicular tissue&#xD;
      biopsy at a young age on the future fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population for this project consists of young adult (≥18 years) patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer or hematological disorders during childhood for which they received&#xD;
      high-risk gonadotoxic treatment (with ≥80% risk of facing fertility problems in adult life).&#xD;
      These patients were offered to undergo a testicular tissue biopsy at a young age in the&#xD;
      context of fertility preservation. Both patients who did and those who did not undergo the&#xD;
      biopsy procedure will be included in this study. A prospective analysis of data on their&#xD;
      fertility status will be performed to identify differences between the young adults who&#xD;
      underwent a testicular tissue biopsy procedure at a young age and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At adult age and at least one year after the last received gonadotoxic treatment, the&#xD;
      patients will be invited by e-mail, by letter, or by telephone to evaluate their fertility&#xD;
      status. The results will be discussed during a consultation with a fertility specialist and a&#xD;
      psychologist (if necessary). Only in case of infertility (azoospermia) or subfertility&#xD;
      (oligo-, astheno- or teratozoospermia), the semen analysis will be repeated one year later as&#xD;
      the recovery of spermatogenesis with the return of sperm production may occur several years&#xD;
      after oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the patient's fertility status, the following examinations and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination where the patient's age, weight, height, body mass index, blood&#xD;
           pressure, testes volumes using a Prader orchidometer, and Tanner stage (to score the&#xD;
           patient's pubertal maturation) will be determined. The start, duration, and the&#xD;
           prescribed dose of hormonal substitution treatment will also be noted if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scrotal ultrasound to measure the patient's testes volumes and to identify potential&#xD;
           abnormalities in the testicular parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A morning blood sample will be collected to evaluate the serum levels of LH, FSH, IGF1,&#xD;
           TSH, FT4, PRL, T, E2, cortisol, ACTH, and INHB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A semen analysis after a 48 hours' abstinence period (according to the WHO criteria) to&#xD;
           evaluate the ejaculate volumes, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm&#xD;
           morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An anti-sperm antibody test: (in)direct mixed anti-globulin reaction testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sperm DNA fragmentation test: sperm chromatin dispersion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the following data will be collected from the patient's medical records:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's diagnosis and age at that moment, the type of treatment received, and the&#xD;
           cumulative dose (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, total body irradiation, bone marrow&#xD;
           transplantation, type and frequency of surgery, …), and the time since the last received&#xD;
           gonadotoxic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether or not a testicular tissue biopsy procedure was performed at a young age,&#xD;
           specifying the biopsy size (orchiectomy, hemi-orchiectomy, or smaller portion) and&#xD;
           location (left or right), the patient's age at the time of biopsy, and why the patient&#xD;
           and his parents accepted or refused the testicular tissue banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be compared between the young adult patients who did and those who&#xD;
      did not undergo the testicular tissue biopsy procedure at a young age. In addition, these&#xD;
      results will be compared to the WHO reference values and published data from a control group,&#xD;
      consisting of spontaneously conceived young adults from previous ICSI offspring follow-up&#xD;
      studies conducted at the UZ Brussel. In this way, a possible association between the biopsy&#xD;
      procedure and the patient's fertility could be identified.&#xD;
