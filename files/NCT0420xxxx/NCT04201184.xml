  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop, adapt and evaluate an intergenerational&#xD;
      prevention intervention, named &quot;Wa'Kan Ye'Zah (Little Holy One),&quot; with Native American&#xD;
      caregivers on a Northern Plains reservation and the caregivers' 3-to-5-year-old children. The&#xD;
      intervention aims to: 1) reduce symptoms of historical trauma and everyday stress among&#xD;
      parents/caregivers, 2) improve parenting, and 3) improve children's emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      developmental outcomes to reduce future risk for suicide and substance use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific premise of this work is rooted in understanding that high rates of historical&#xD;
      and current trauma in Native communities compromise caregivers' mental health and parenting,&#xD;
      which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems and adverse events that increase&#xD;
      children's risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wa'Kan Ye'Zah will combine adapted elements of: 1) Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA),&#xD;
      an evidence-based intervention proven effective to reduce stress, depression and&#xD;
      trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based parent training program to&#xD;
      promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3) cultural&#xD;
      components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance&#xD;
      abuse identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of 12 weekly individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 3 to 5) at Head&#xD;
      Start facilities by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to&#xD;
      enhance participant engagement, local acceptability and sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized control trial (RCT) with an embedded single-case&#xD;
      experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on mental&#xD;
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically exploring&#xD;
      the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. on mental&#xD;
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while exploring the added&#xD;
      benefit of cultural components on parent outcomes. The study plan is situated within a&#xD;
      well-established trust relationship with tribal communities, innovative formative research&#xD;
      that led to this proposal, and an experienced, multi-disciplined study team led by an&#xD;
      Indigenous Principle Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supplement has been added to this clinical trial, the goal of the supplement is to add to&#xD;
      our understanding of opioids and other substance use and suicide risk in Native communities&#xD;
      by analyzing individual social network data to understand the relational factors that may&#xD;
      increase both risk of suicide and opioid use and the relational characteristics of networks&#xD;
      that act as protective factors for suicide and opioid use.&#xD;
