  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMN-001 is an autologous, tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cell immunotherapy. The active&#xD;
      components of CMN-001 are autologous, matured dendritic cells, which have been&#xD;
      co-electroporated with both in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA from an autologous tumor specimen&#xD;
      and CD40L RNA. CMN-001 is indicated for treatment of intermediate/poor risk patients with&#xD;
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in combination with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first&#xD;
      line therapy and in combination with lenvatinib plus everolimus as 2nd line therapy post 1st&#xD;
      line failure.&#xD;
