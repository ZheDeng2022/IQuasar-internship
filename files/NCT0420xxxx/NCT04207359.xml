      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that creatine will accelerate adaptations&#xD;
      associated with exercise in breast cancer survivors recently completing chemotherapy.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of creatine supplementation&#xD;
      in modulating strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors that have recently&#xD;
      completed chemotherapy. The primary hypothesis for this objective is that creatine will lead&#xD;
      to significantly greater gains in strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      compared to exercise alone. The secondary objective is to determine if supplemental creatine&#xD;
      can increase intramuscular storage of creatine and alter energy storage. The hypothesis for&#xD;
      this objective is that creatine supplementation will significantly increase intramuscular&#xD;
      concentrations of creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in&#xD;
      the vastus lateralis (VL) compared to controls. The secondary hypothesis for this objective&#xD;
      is that the creatine group will have significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area and&#xD;
      significantly lower intramuscular fat compared to controls. The final objective for this&#xD;
      study is to test the hypothesis that creatine supplementation will improve body composition&#xD;
      in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study plans to enroll 30 breast cancer patients who have completed chemotherapy within 6 months prior to consenting for this study. Patients eligible to participate in this study will be allocated to either the creatine group or the control group (1:1) based on a pre-determined randomization list. Each arm will have 15 participants. One arm will receive creatine and the other will serve as the control group with no creatine.</intervention_model_description>
