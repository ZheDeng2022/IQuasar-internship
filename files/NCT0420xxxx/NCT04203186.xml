    <textblock>
      A comparison of Malaria events (symptoms and signs of malaria) experienced by subjects&#xD;
      infected with PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) vs. PfSPZ Challenge (7G8).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The single center study is designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled CHMI&#xD;
      trial with 2 parallel test groups to directly compare clinical and laboratory characteristics&#xD;
      of the NF54 and 7G8 strains of PfSPZ Challenge. This study will also evaluate signatures of&#xD;
      and time to parasitemia by multiple methods and evaluate physiologic status data collected by&#xD;
      non-invasive wearable monitors before and during Plasmodium falciparum infection to&#xD;
      characterize and trend physiologic changes appearing prior to the onset of parasitemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PfSPZ Challenge (aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      sporozoites) or normal saline will be administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) by&#xD;
      25-gauge needle and syringe to healthy malaria naïve adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data generated from samples collected for biomarker assay analysis will be useful for&#xD;
      developing predictive models to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates.&#xD;
