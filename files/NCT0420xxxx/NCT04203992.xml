  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness of an interactive doping education&#xD;
      videogame among student athletes. Specifically, the game will teach athletes aged 13-16 years&#xD;
      about the risks of doping and will foster the values, motivation, and behavioural skills&#xD;
      needed to avoid temptation and pressure to dope. The investigators hypothesize that student&#xD;
      athletes who play the intervention game will have lower use of banned substances and sport&#xD;
      supplements, greater intentions to stay clean, and will also show improvements in the&#xD;
      cognitive and motivational antecedents to doping when compared to a control condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      284 student athletes will be enrolled in this two-arm quasi-experimental study. The&#xD;
      participants will be boys and girls, aged 13 to 16 years who compete in any sport.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited and enrolled through partnerships with their school physical&#xD;
      education and/or sport programs. Participants will complete baseline questionnaires assessing&#xD;
      demographics, history of sport participation, and psychological variables related to doping&#xD;
      prevention including knowledge, doping self-regulatory efficacy, motivation, attitudes,&#xD;
      intentions, perceived norms, doping refusal, substance use behaviours, and doping related&#xD;
      protective behaviours (e.g., checking the list of ingredients on medications). Participants&#xD;
      will then be assigned to either an intervention group (n = 142; the doping videogame the&#xD;
      investigators are developing) or a comparison group (n = 142). The comparison group will be&#xD;
      given printed educational materials about doping education, developed by an accredited source&#xD;
      (e.g., UNESCO). Assignment to the intervention or comparison group will be conducted at the&#xD;
      level of the school to reduce the potential for contamination that could occur if&#xD;
      intervention and comparison students were interacting in their school environment and sharing&#xD;
      information they learned from the game. Participants from the intervention group will play&#xD;
      five, 60-minute sessions over the course of one month (5 hours of total gameplay). Before the&#xD;
      gameplay sessions begin, the Project Director and research assistants will orient the&#xD;
      intervention group participants to the use of the intervention videogame. Players will be&#xD;
      given a tutorial on an iPad demonstrating the mechanics of the game and how to use the iPad.&#xD;
      Each player will have their own dedicated iPad that they will use during each game play&#xD;
      session (this will be provided by the research team). Shortly after the last gameplay session&#xD;
      is completed, participants from both groups will be asked to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      assessing the same psychological variables assessed at baseline as well as their gameplay&#xD;
      experience. The psychological variables will also be assessed at three, six, and 12 month&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
