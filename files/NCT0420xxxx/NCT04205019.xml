      Mono-center, open label study to investigate the safety of Neuro-Cells in 10 end stage&#xD;
      (chronic) traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients, when administered once intrathecally.&#xD;
      TSCI is a rare disease without cure perspectives and Neuro-Cells is an autologous fresh stem&#xD;
      cells containing product (one batch / one patient).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical study is an open clinical trial to investigate the safety of the&#xD;
      intrathecal application of Neuro-Cells in the treatment of end stage (chronic), traumatic&#xD;
      complete (AIS grade A) and incomplete (AIS grade B/C) SCI patients. To that purpose, after&#xD;
      inclusion in this study &gt;1 year and less than 5 years after their SCI-event, 10 patients will&#xD;
      be included. All patients are invited to visit the trial hospital every month during this&#xD;
      3-months study for appreciation of their possible (S)AEs and/or SUSARs, for physical&#xD;
      examination and a biochemical analysis of their blood/urine. Day 0 and day 90 they also&#xD;
      undergo a comprehensive neurological examination, the AISIAms, ASIAss and Pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the participants are also invited to undergo neurological examinations at day 360&#xD;
      and 720. The purpose of this neurological assessment is to explore in patients if a late&#xD;
      administration of Neuro-Cells may have some beneficial effects on the neurological condition&#xD;
      of the chronic SCI patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo a BM harvesting at the start of their participation in the study and&#xD;
      will undergo one LP, performed to administer Neuro-Cells. The study is open and descriptive,&#xD;
      and no randomization takes place. All patients are followed up until approximately 3 months&#xD;
      after the time of administration. After these 3 months, the safety part of this study ends.&#xD;
      Patients are invited for a neurological assessment 9 months later (day 360) to explore if&#xD;
      Neuro-Cells may have a beneficial effect when given to end stage patients with a traumatic&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety part of the study is completed when the last patient finishes his/her visit at day&#xD;
      90. The explorative part of the study ends approximately one year after the time of inclusion&#xD;
      at day 720.&#xD;
