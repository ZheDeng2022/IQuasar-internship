  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate potential beneficial&#xD;
      effects of leukocyte-poor platelet rich plasma and bone marrow concentrate on the healing and&#xD;
      health of critical joint tissues in the knee following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      reconstruction. Bone marrow contains stem cells which can change into cells of various&#xD;
      different tissue types, while platelet rich plasma contains growth factors. This trial will&#xD;
      compare the two procedures against placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      three groups: Concentrated Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC), Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or&#xD;
      Placebo. BMC subjects will have bone marrow aspirated from the subjects iliac crests and the&#xD;
      cellular rich portion will be concentrated and subsequently injected into the subjects'&#xD;
      symptomatic knee during ACL reconstruction surgery. PRP subjects will have a venous blood&#xD;
      draw and the resulting PRP will be injected into the symptomatic knee during ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery. Follow-up visits in person will take place at 2 weeks, 6 months and&#xD;
      12 months after the ACL reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate potential beneficial effects of leukocyte-poor&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) on the healing and health of&#xD;
      all critical joint tissues (grafts/ligaments, meniscus and cartilage) in the knee following&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Key aspects of this proposal include our&#xD;
      well-developed methodologies to quantify and correlate cytokines, chemokines, growth factors&#xD;
      in PRP and progenitor cells in BMC, clinical outcomes and imaging following ACLR. The&#xD;
      overarching goal of this randomized control trial is to establish a biological signature of&#xD;
      PRP and BMC that will be indicative for optimal recovery after ACLR. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      our research is to better understand the efficacy of orthobiologic approaches to improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, enhance graft healing and mitigate post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in&#xD;
      a cohort of patients that have undergone ACLR.&#xD;
