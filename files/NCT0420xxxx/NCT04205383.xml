  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy generates an increased thrombotic risk, and placental-mediated diseases are a risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular diseases, in particular: pre-eclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth&#xD;
      retardation (IUGR), retroplacental hematomas (HRP), late intrauterine fetal deaths (LIFD) of&#xD;
      placental origin and preterm deliveries of vascular origin. They are responsible for&#xD;
      significant maternal-fetal morbidity/mortality. Data published in 2007 by the Haute Autorité&#xD;
      de Santé (HAS) show that hypertension and pre-eclampsia are, in France, at the origin of 3 to&#xD;
      8% of the risk of perinatal mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pregnancy, a transitional organ of foetal origin, the placenta, is established, which&#xD;
      is essential for the maintenance and harmonious development of the pregnancy. The chorionic&#xD;
      villus, in contact with maternal blood in the intervilleous chamber, is the structural and&#xD;
      functional unit of the placenta. After the initial implantation phase, the trophoblastic cell&#xD;
      constituting the main part of the placental villi differs in two ways: (A) into &quot;citrus&#xD;
      cytotrophoblasts&quot; whose cells will fuse to generate the multinucleated outer layer giving the&#xD;
      syncytiotrophoblast that ensures fetal-maternal exchanges and endocrine functions of the&#xD;
      placenta; (B) into &quot;invasive extra-city cytotrophoblasts&quot; essential for the effective&#xD;
      anchoring of the placenta in the decidualized uterine mucosa and for the remodelling of the&#xD;
      terminal uterine spiral arteries, whose resistance to blood flow must collapse to allow&#xD;
      effective oxygenation of the villi. Extra-city trophoblasts change from an epithelial&#xD;
      phenotype to an endothelial phenotype. They may thus be exposed to pro-thrombotic factors&#xD;
      such as endothelial cells. A lack of trophoblastic invasion and incomplete remodelling of the&#xD;
      spiral uterine arteries are responsible for placental hypo-perfusion, hypoxia and the&#xD;
      occurrence of placenta-mediated pathologies (pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation,&#xD;
      retroplacental hematoma, fetal loss and fetal death in utero). The most common&#xD;
      placental-mediated disease is pre-eclampsia (5% of births). It corresponds to a complication&#xD;
      occurring from the second trimester of pregnancy and which is clinically characterized by&#xD;
      high blood pressure, oedema and proteinuria. It is responsible for premature deliveries and&#xD;
      is a major cause of intrauterine growth restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no specific and early biomarker for the occurrence of placental vascular&#xD;
      pathologies. Recent developments raise, for example, the question of circulating angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitory factors (sFlt1, sEng) in pre-eclampsia. With regard to treatment, early&#xD;
      administration of low-dose aspirin before 16 weeks of pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, hence the importance of having very early markers of the disease. Discovering&#xD;
      such markers is therefore one of the major challenges in strengthening women's follow-up and&#xD;
      avoiding subsequent complications. For fetal losses and retroplacental hematoma, the&#xD;
      administration of low molecular weight heparin has been shown to be effective. However, these&#xD;
      treatments are not specific to placental vascular pathologies. Thus, understanding and&#xD;
      exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular-placental interface dysfunctions&#xD;
      remains necessary to enable targeted management of patients feeding the general principle of&#xD;
      precision medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the concentrations of (i) circulating histones involved in inflammation,&#xD;
      proliferation, migration or cell differentiation (H3-citrullinated histone, acetylated&#xD;
      histones (Pan-histones), H1 histone) and (ii) free HMGB1 protein between the three patient&#xD;
      groups (&quot;GrossN&quot;, &quot;GrossC&quot;, &quot;VolS&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histones H3-citrullinated, acetylated histones (Pan-histones), H1 histone as well as the&#xD;
      free HMGB1 protein will be quantified. This choice corresponds to the histones involved in&#xD;
      inflammation, proliferation, migration or cell differentiation and can be quantified to date.&#xD;
