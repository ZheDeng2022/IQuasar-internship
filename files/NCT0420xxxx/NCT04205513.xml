  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a common diagnosis with high prevalence, reduced life expectancy and a&#xD;
      significant clinical and economic burden. Large-scale randomized controlled trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated that combination drug therapy, optimized to maximal tolerated doses, improves&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in HF patients. However, evidence suggests that in clinical practice many&#xD;
      patients never achieve target doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to medication titration include provider and patient-related factors, as well as&#xD;
      limited time and support facilities to enable regular monitoring. Telemonitoring is a&#xD;
      potential component in the management of HF that can provide reliable and real-time&#xD;
      physiological data for clinical decision support, alerting, and patient self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      implementation of telemonitoring to facilitate HF medication titration. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of the experience of clinicians and HF patients&#xD;
      taking part in the remote titration program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre (PMCC), University Health&#xD;
      Network, in Toronto. It will be based on a mixed methods effectiveness-implementation hybrid&#xD;
      design and incorporate process evaluations alongside assessment of clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness research component will be assessed via a 2-arm randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT), which will enroll 108 patients in total. The RCT will compare a predefined remote&#xD;
      titration management strategy, which will utilize data from a smartphone-based telemonitoring&#xD;
      system, with a standard titration management strategy consisting of regular in-office visits,&#xD;
      and assess the efficacy and safety of the telemonitoring system in facilitating titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation research component will consist of a qualitative study based on&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of clinicians and patients, and assess the&#xD;
      factors that can positively impact the implementation and effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Heart failure (HF) is a common diagnosis affecting at least 26 million people&#xD;
      worldwide. Based on available data from the US and Europe, the overall prevalence of HF&#xD;
      ranges from 1% to 12%. The lifetime risks of developing HF, assessed and reported based on a&#xD;
      large, diverse, multi-cohort group of 39,578 participants, was shown to be about 30% to 42%&#xD;
      in white men, 20% to 29% in black men, 32% to 39% in white women, and 24% to 46% in black&#xD;
      women. Survival rates reported in studies also varied, with data from the US and Europe&#xD;
      indicating a 1-year survival rate of 89% to 70%, and 5-year survival rates ranging from 59%&#xD;
      to as low as 35%, reflecting a significant increase in the risk of death compared to the&#xD;
      general age and gender matched population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discrepancies in the estimates can most likely be attributed to differences in patient&#xD;
      selection, as well as ascertainment and adjustment approaches, however, irrespective of the&#xD;
      precise rates, several trends are congruent across studies, including high prevalence,&#xD;
      reduced life expectancy, worsening profile with aging and, at best, stagnant incidence rates&#xD;
      over the last several decades. These trends have tremendous implications since HF patients&#xD;
      are major consumers of healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large-scale randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists all&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes in HF patients, suggesting that their combination could translate&#xD;
      to a 60-70% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality, and clinical guidelines recommend&#xD;
      up titrating the treatments to maximal tolerated doses. However, in clinical practice,&#xD;
      evidence from 12,440 HF patients of the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure&#xD;
      Long-Term Registry, showed that about 30% of patients were on target doses of ACEIs, 18% were&#xD;
      on target doses of beta-blockers, and approximately one-third had no documented reason for&#xD;
      the failure to up-titrate. Barriers to medication titration include health-provider&#xD;
      knowledge, self-efficacy and attitudes, patient-related factors and limited time and support&#xD;
      facilities to enable regular monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote patient monitoring is a potential component in the management of HF that can provide&#xD;
      reliable and real-time physiological data for clinical decision support, alerting, and&#xD;
      patient self-management. Telemonitoring enables patients to track their vital signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, and also to receive automated instruction and clinical intervention during&#xD;
      &quot;teachable moments&quot; (i.e., clear actions are provided when the context is most appropriate).&#xD;
      The automated instructions are based on current physiological measurements, self-monitored&#xD;
      symptoms, and can be readily analyzed. Automated real-time alerts and frequently collected&#xD;
      and analyzed physiological/symptom data can also support clinical decisions by healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Several previous studies, including 2 studies conducted by the same research team,&#xD;
      have shown that the use of telemonitoring interventions for the management of chronic&#xD;
      conditions can lead to positive health outcomes and significant reductions in healthcare&#xD;
      costs if the intervention is designed and implemented appropriately. Telemonitoring for HF&#xD;
      patients has been shown to be particularly beneficial, demonstrating reduced mortality (risk&#xD;
      ratio=0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.85), reduction in the use of health services, and&#xD;
      similar or improved quality of life and satisfaction compared with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to this evidence, Medly, a telemonitoring program for patients with Heart Failure&#xD;
      (HF) has been launched at the University Health Network (UHN). This program is integrated&#xD;
      into the Ted Rogers Centre of Excellence in Heart Function at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre&#xD;
      (PMCC) as part of the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      the implementation of telemonitoring to facilitate HF medication titration and its impact on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telemonitoring titration management strategy will be compared to the standard titration&#xD;
      management program consisting of regular in-office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying the primary objective of the study is that both management&#xD;
      strategies will enable a comparable proportion of patients to reach optimal doses of HF&#xD;
      medications, within similar timeframes, but that telemonitoring will significantly reduce the&#xD;
      cost of healthcare resource utilization and patient burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to obtain a deeper understanding of the experience&#xD;
      of clinicians and HF patients taking part in the remote titration program, in order to&#xD;
      develop better awareness of the factors that can positively impact the implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile phone-based telemonitoring system (Medly) enables patients with HF to take&#xD;
      clinically relevant physiological measurements with wireless home medical devices in addition&#xD;
      to answering symptom questions on the mobile phone. The measurements are automatically and&#xD;
      wirelessly transmitted to the mobile phone and then to a data server. Specifically, patients&#xD;
      monitor daily weight, blood pressure/heart rate, symptoms, and some patients monitor their&#xD;
      activity as determined by their cardiologist. Automated self-care instructions/messages that&#xD;
      have been carefully developed with healthcare specialists are sent to the patient based on&#xD;
      the readings and reported symptoms. If there are signs of their status deteriorating, an&#xD;
      alert is sent to a clinician at the Heart Function Clinic. Through a secure web portal,&#xD;
      clinicians receive all relevant patient data, thereby granting them access to current trends&#xD;
      and historic data reported by their patients. Clinicians will use information provided by&#xD;
      Medly to facilitate remote titration of HF medication doses. A predefined titration&#xD;
      management strategy will be established during the initial clinic visit, in accordance with&#xD;
      HF management guidelines. Subsequently, telephone contacts will take place at 2-week&#xD;
      intervals to titrate medication doses, based on patient-reported data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT DATA ACQUISITION Patients will be followed for the duration of their time in the&#xD;
      Medly Titrate Program. Data acquisition will include telemonitoring data, patient lab test&#xD;
      and examination results, application usage data, data regarding healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomized into the study group will also be invited to participate in&#xD;
      individual interviews intended to assess their experiences and perceptions regarding the&#xD;
      Program upon titration completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROVIDER AND PROGRAM STAFF DATA ACQUISITION Healthcare providers and program staff will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in interviews to determine their perceptions of the Medly Titrate&#xD;
      Program and of its implementation within existing clinic services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics will be run regularly on all patient outcome measures to&#xD;
      monitor the program for quality improvement purposes. Parametric and non-parametric tests&#xD;
      will be performed to compare data at baseline and titration completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using the statistical software application SPSS.&#xD;
      Interview data will be analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Two&#xD;
      evaluators will analyze the transcripts independently and discuss their findings until a&#xD;
      consensus is reached. The software program NVivo will be used to help organize the transcript&#xD;
      data for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying assumption is that both remote titration and standard in-office visits will&#xD;
      yield similar clinical outcomes, but that the remote management strategy will significantly&#xD;
      reduce healthcare resource utilization. Therefore, non-inferiority and superiority analyses&#xD;
      will be performed. The intention-to-treat-population, which will include all randomized&#xD;
      patients, shall be the study population used for the non-inferiority analysis. The&#xD;
      per-protocol-population, which will include all patients who have been treated according to&#xD;
      protocol, excluding those who: (a) demonstrated inadequate compliance, or (b) withdrew&#xD;
      randomized therapy prematurely without cause, shall be the study population used for the&#xD;
      superiority analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION STRATEGY Results will be shared with Medly Program and HF Clinic&#xD;
      decision-makers as they become available, as they will be used for quality improvement&#xD;
      purposes. In addition, as these results will be of interest to other clinical settings&#xD;
      intending to implement similar telemonitoring programs, the investigators plan to disseminate&#xD;
      findings through publications in appropriate scientific journals and through presentations at&#xD;
      scientific conferences, as well as other relevant media avenues (e.g., news reports).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to provide informed consent to participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (age 18 years or older)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with HF and followed by a cardiologist at the PMCC Heart Function Clinic,&#xD;
             who has primary responsibility for management of the patient's HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40% or less, based on echocardiography,&#xD;
             determined within 3 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable HF defined as no hospitalization within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not yet at target doses of guideline directed medical therapy (ACE&#xD;
             inhibitor, and/or angiotensin receptor blocker, and/or b-blocker, and/or&#xD;
             mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at sub-optimal doses), and hence qualifies for&#xD;
             up-titration. At the physician's estimate, the patient will require a minimum of about&#xD;
             2 months to achieve target doses of all HF medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or their informal caregiver speaks and reads English adequately to participate&#xD;
             in the program and understand the alerts/prompts in the Medly application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comply with using Medly (e.g., able to stand on the weight scale, able to&#xD;
             answer symptom questions, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physicians at the clinics will ultimately determine which patients they believe may benefit&#xD;
        from participating in the Medly Titrate Program. For these patients, the Titrate program&#xD;
        will be offered in addition to their usual care at the UHN, which includes Medly&#xD;
        telemonitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study based on the clinical judgment of their healthcare&#xD;
        provider. In addition, the following criteria will exclude patients from participation in&#xD;
        the Medly Titrate Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active acutely decompensated heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Already on target doses of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).&#xD;
&#xD;

             major cardiovascular surgery, PCI, or carotid angioplasty within 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obstructive or restrictive cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second or third degree atrioventricular block without a pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;

             mitral regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of other hemodynamically significant obstructive lesions of the LV outflow&#xD;
             tract, including aortic and subaortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatic impairment defined as ALAT or ASAT value &gt;three-fold the upper&#xD;
             normal limit. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at&#xD;
