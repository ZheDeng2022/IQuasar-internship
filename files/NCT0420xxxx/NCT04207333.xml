  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged sitting may pose a public health risk through its effects on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system, and may lead to impaired whole-body cardiovascular health, which includes both&#xD;
      vascular and cerebrovascular function. These effects may interact with other environmental&#xD;
      variables, such as stress. However, no study has investigated the combined effect of a mental&#xD;
      stressor and prolonged sitting on vascular and cerebrovascular function. The combined effect&#xD;
      of prolonged sitting and mental stress may lead to an exacerbated effect on vascular,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular, and executive function. The investigators hypothesize that mental stress&#xD;
      with the addition of prolonged sitting [PS] will result in a greater increase in peripheral,&#xD;
      central and cerebral arterial stiffness and elicit a decrease in cerebral perfusion, total&#xD;
      blood flow to the brain, middle cerebral artery velocity and executive function, compared to&#xD;
      mental stress without prolonged sitting [CON]. The findings from this study may result in a&#xD;
      public health message regarding sedentary behavior and stress, and will help elucidate the&#xD;
      mechanisms behind acute vascular, cerebrovascular, and cognitive dysfunction during prolonged&#xD;
      sitting.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-visit (three in total) randomized crossover trial. During a single&#xD;
      familiarization session, the research team will obtain informed consent, and will describe to&#xD;
      participants the purposes and procedures of this study. They will then be exposed to all&#xD;
      experimental devices on in a quiet, dimly lit and environmentally controlled room.&#xD;
      Participants will return to the same location for two experimental conditions following these&#xD;
      pre-assessment guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasted (&gt; 12 hours), consuming only water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No caffeine consumption 12 hours prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No vigorous exercise 24 hours prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No alcohol consumption 24 hours prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will arrive to the Applied Physiology Laboratory between 6:00 and 10:00 a.m.&#xD;
      fasted (for Visit 3: 2-5 days following the Visit 2). Participants will be fasted and refrain&#xD;
      from caffeine intake for at least 12 hours, and alcohol and strenuous physical activity for&#xD;
      at least 24 hours prior to arrival. Upon arrival, height and weight will be recorded followed&#xD;
      by 10 minutes of quiet rest in the supine position. During these 10 minutes, the subject will&#xD;
      be fitted with a Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy probe on the prefrontal cortex and medial&#xD;
      gastrocnemius. The non-invasive continuous blood pressure, transcranial doppler, and Vicorder&#xD;
      arterial stiffness devices will also be affixed to the participant during this time period&#xD;
      during this time. Sitting periods will begin for both conditions once all devices are&#xD;
      attached to the participant, the subject is shifted to an upright seated position, and at&#xD;
      least 10 minutes of supine rest has been recorded. During the control (CON) visit, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a brief 20 minute sitting period. For the prolonged sitting (PS) condition,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to sit still and quietly for 2 hours while watching a non-stimulating&#xD;
      documentary. Each condition will receive the mental stress at the conclusion of the sitting&#xD;
      periods in both CON and PS. After exposure to the mental stress in both conditions, data&#xD;
      collection procedures for this protocol will be completed. Arterial stiffness measurements&#xD;
      will be made immediately after the mental stress, and then every 5 minutes, up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Brain blood flow will be assessed by ultrasound after completion of the arterial stiffness&#xD;
      measures. Finally, a battery of cognitive tests (Verbal Fluency Test and Trails A+B tests)&#xD;
      will be administered to the participant.&#xD;

Following the 10 minutes quiet rest the participants will be subjected to a 5 minute mental arithmetic test.&#xD;
Mental Arithmetic Test: The researcher will call out a four-digit number and ask the participant to subtract either 7 or 13. Each minute, a new four-digit number will be called out and the participant must subtract the 7 or 13 from the number. The test will last approximately 5 minutes</description>
