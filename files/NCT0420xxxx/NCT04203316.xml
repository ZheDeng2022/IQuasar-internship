    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of enasidenib and to see how well it works in treating&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or has&#xD;
      been difficult to treat with chemotherapy (refractory). Patients must also have a specific&#xD;
      genetic change, also called a mutation, in a protein called IDH2. Enasidenib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking the mutated IDH2 protein, which is needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of treatment with enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) administered at&#xD;
      continuous daily oral dosing for a 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      IDH2-mutant relapsed/refractory (R/R)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of enasidenib in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with IDH2-mutant R/R-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of oncogenic metabolite&#xD;
      2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) to enasidenib treatment in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant&#xD;
      R/R-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the clinical activity of enasidenib in pediatric patients with IDH2-mutant&#xD;
      R/R-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enasidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically&#xD;
      up to 1 year.&#xD;
