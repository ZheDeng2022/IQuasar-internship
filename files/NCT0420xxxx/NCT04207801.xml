  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, randomized study&#xD;
      to evaluate efficacy and safety of AUR101 (RORgamma inhibitor) in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized&#xD;
      to the 2 dose groups of AUR101 and one group of Placebo. The patients will receive the&#xD;
      treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;

      This will be a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, randomized study&#xD;
      to evaluate efficacy and safety of two doses of AUR101 in patients with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 90 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (defined as&#xD;
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) involved ≥10%) will&#xD;
      be randomized to the 2 dose groups of AUR101 and placebo in the ratio of 1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in each arm will receive AUR101 of 400 mg twice daily or AUR101 600 mg twice&#xD;
      daily or matching placebo twice daily for 12 weeks in a double blind, double dummy fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will receive 12 weeks of treatment. All the patients will be followed up for 14&#xD;
      ± 2 days of their last dose for safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of approximately 25 patients, who consent, will be asked to come for plasma PK&#xD;
      assessment in week 4 of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation will be done by PASI, DLQI and BSA assessment. Safety assessment will be&#xD;
      done by AEs and regular lab assessment.&#xD;
