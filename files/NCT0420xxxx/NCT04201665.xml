      Studies found conflicting results on efficacy of uterotonic agents used to prevent and treat&#xD;
      uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine EMG can be used to&#xD;
      objectively assess myometrial contractility and, consequently, efficacy of different&#xD;
      uterotonics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning a single-center, randomized, open-label trial to compare&#xD;
      uterine EMG parameters in women receiving oxytocin vs. those receiving carbetocin after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery.&#xD;

      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. In the Western&#xD;
      world the estimated risk of life threatening postpartum hemorrhage is 2 on 1000 births. Most&#xD;
      frequently (up to 90% of cases of postpartum hemorrhage) it is a consequence of uterine atony&#xD;
      or inappropriate uterine contraction. In clinical practice preventing postpartum hemorrhage&#xD;
      is key and routinely, different prophylactic uterotonic drugs are used. The first-line&#xD;
      recommended drug for postpartum hemorrhage prevention is oxytocin. However, a recent Cochrane&#xD;
      meta-analysis concluded that the most effective drugs (compared to oxytocin) to prevent&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage of 500 ml or more are ergometrine with oxytocin, misoprostol with&#xD;
      oxytocin and carbetocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbetocin is a synthetic heat-stable analogue of oxytocin, with a longer half-life. It&#xD;
      shares the same mechanism of action and the same side-effects as oxytocin. The recommended&#xD;
      dose of carbetocin is 100 μg, which is equivalent to 10 μg (5 IU) of oxytocin. In the WHO&#xD;
      carbetocin multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, the intramuscular administration of&#xD;
      100 μg of heat-stable carbetocin was discovered to be noninferior to the administration of 10&#xD;
      IU of oxytocin for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal birth. Some studies&#xD;
      have found carbetocin to be an effective prophylactic agent with a favourable side effect&#xD;
      profile for the third stage of labour in caesarean sections, reducing the use of additional&#xD;
      uterotonic agents, blood and recovery time. Moreover, carbetocin was found to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing the need for additional uterotonic use and postpartum blood transfusion in women at&#xD;
      increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage undergoing cesarean delivery. In one study,&#xD;
      carbetocin was also found to be more effective than oxytocin in preventing postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage in twin pregnancies delivered by cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine contractions in pregnancy, labour and postpartum can be detected using&#xD;
      electromyography. Myometrial contractility can be objectively and non-invasively assessed in&#xD;
      vivo by monitoring uterine electromyography (EMG), as uterine contractions are the result of&#xD;
      the electrical activity generated and propagated in the myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has reported oxytocin or carbetocin effects using postpartum&#xD;
      electromyography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The objective of the study is to compare efficacy and objectively quantify the&#xD;
      effect of carbetocin (Pabal ®) with electromyography compared to the standard uterotonic&#xD;
      oxytocin (Syntocinon ®) for postpartum hemorrhage prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Single-center, randomized, open-label trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signed informed consent, the cesarean section will be performed. All the patients will&#xD;
      receive 5 IU of oxytocin bolus and a single oxytocin infusion (10 IU). Subsequently patients&#xD;
      will be transferred to high dependency unit and allocated randomly into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Carbetocin group Patients will receive a single dose of carbetocin 100 mcg (Pabal ®). An&#xD;
           electromyogram of the uterus will be performed and a blood sample will be obtained.&#xD;
           After 2-3 hours another electromyogram will follow, as well as a visual and quantified&#xD;
           estimation of blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oxytocin group Patients will receive 5 IU of oxytocin (Syntocinon ®) as a 250 ml 0.9%&#xD;
           NaCl infusion. An electromyogram of the uterus will be performed and a blood sample will&#xD;
           be obtained. After 2-3 hours another electromyogram will follow, as well as a visual and&#xD;
           quantified estimation of blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another blood sample will be routinely obtained 24 hours after the caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous EMG studies, there has been reported difference in means of EMG PS peak&#xD;
      frequency in labor vs. non-labor patients of (0.56 - 0.44 = 0.12 Hz), and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 0.15 Hz. Using power of 0.80, and an α - 0.05, with t-test, gives a desired&#xD;
      sample size of 26 per group minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed according to a pre-established statistical plan. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed with SPSS software (version 24.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, New&#xD;
      York).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered as numerical or categorical, as appropriate. Shapiro-Wilk test will be&#xD;
      used to assess normality of distribution. Parametric statistics will be carried out for&#xD;
      normally distributed variables; for non-normal distribution, nonparametric statistics will be&#xD;
      used. Data with normal distribution will be described using minimum, maximum and mean with&#xD;
      standard deviation. Data with non-normal distribution will be shown using minimum, maximum,&#xD;
      median, and interquartile range (IQR). Comparisons will be carried out between the study&#xD;
      groups using independent Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous and with&#xD;
      Chi-square test for categorical variables.&#xD;
