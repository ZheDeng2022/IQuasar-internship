  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new drug combination of Pembrolizumab and Defactinib&#xD;
      followed by surgical resection possible treatment for resectable Malignant Pleural&#xD;
      Mesothelioma (MPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defactinib&#xD;

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defactinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered&#xD;
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have Malignant&#xD;
      Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), not everyone who participates in this research study will receive&#xD;
      the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who&#xD;
      have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug, pembrolizumab, will not change no matter when the participant is&#xD;
      enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which the participant is enrolled to the study will determine the cohort&#xD;
      assigned to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Run-In Cohort: Pembrolizumab only followed by surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion Cohort: Pembrolizumab and defactinib at the maximum dose as determined from&#xD;
           the previous cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved defactinib as a treatment&#xD;
           for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
           specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
