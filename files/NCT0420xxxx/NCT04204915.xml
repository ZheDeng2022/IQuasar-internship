  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) affects approximately 5% of individuals &gt;65 years old, with ~3% of&#xD;
      people &gt;75 years having moderate to severe disease. The prevalence of AS is rising rapidly&#xD;
      due to an ageing population and is projected to double in the next two decades. Increasingly&#xD;
      clinicians face the dilemma of how to best manage this growing population of mainly elderly&#xD;
      patients, many of whom are asymptomatic but have been identified as having severe AS, often&#xD;
      as an incidental finding. Reduced aortic valve opening progresses over decades without any&#xD;
      apparent symptoms because the heart compensates for the AS. Ultimately, compensatory&#xD;
      mechanisms fail resulting in angina, syncope or heart failure. If these symptomatic patients&#xD;
      with severe AS remain untreated, they have a dire prognosis. In this situation the only&#xD;
      effective treatment is AVR, either surgically or using TAVI. Conversely, conventional&#xD;
      teaching and clinical practice in cardiology has been that, in the absence of symptoms, the&#xD;
      prognosis is usually excellent and, except in a few very specific circumstances, conservative&#xD;
      management and regular review (expectant management) is recommended. This advice is reflected&#xD;
      in current international guidelines but is based largely on historical precedent. There has&#xD;
      never been a randomised controlled trial to address the relative benefits of early AVR versus&#xD;
      expectant management in patients with severe asymptomatic AS. The relative benefits of a&#xD;
      strategy of early AVR/TAVI versus expectant management in patients with asymptomatic severe&#xD;
      AS are unclear. There is clinical equipoise but it remains one of the few areas of&#xD;
      cardiovascular medicine where no randomised controlled trials (RCT) have been performed. The&#xD;
      EASY-AS study will provide crucial data on the relative merits of these differing approaches&#xD;
      to management, in terms of important patient orientated outcomes, conventional cardiovascular&#xD;
      end-points and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a major pragmatic multi-centre prospective parallel group open RCT. It will be&#xD;
      conducted in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, funding is being sought in several countries&#xD;
      to expand recruitment internationally. The study is in 2 phases: the vanguard and main phase.&#xD;
      Therefore the study will run an internal pilot to prove recruitment of the relevant number of&#xD;
      participants during the initial 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over-arching aim is to determine whether early AVR results in better clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness than a strategy of expectant management in asymptomatic patients with&#xD;
      severe AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that early AVR or TAVI in asymptomatic patients with severe AS will&#xD;
      result in a reduction in the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular (CV) death and&#xD;
      hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) when compared to the conventional approach of&#xD;
      expectant management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified by a member of the clinical care team following&#xD;
      diagnosis with severe AS. Participants will be screened for eligibility using pre-specified&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible participants will be provided with a written version&#xD;
      of the participant information sheet detailing the exact nature of the study, what it will&#xD;
      involve for the participant and any risks involved with taking part. Participants will be&#xD;
      given at least 24 hours to consider the information and decide whether or not to take part.&#xD;
      The study will randomise up to 2844 patients with severe asymptomatic AS to either allocated&#xD;
      expectant management OR aortic valve replacement. Participants randomised to AVR will be&#xD;
      placed on a waiting list with the aim that surgery will be performed within 3 months,&#xD;
      dependent on local hospitals' waiting lists. Participants randomised to AVR will undergo&#xD;
      routine tests/procedures which may include coronary angiography. If the outcome of the&#xD;
      coronary angiography reveals coronary heart disease, the decision to perform CABG or PCI will&#xD;
      be made by the responsible cardiac surgeon and cardiologist, in consultation with the&#xD;
      patient. All analyses will be undertaken using the principles of intention-to-treat with&#xD;
      participants analysed in the group they were randomised regardless of treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EASY-AS is collaborating with the EVoLVeD study (Early Valve Replacement guided by Biomarkers&#xD;
      of Left Ventricular Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis,&#xD;
      Clinical Trials.gov NCT03094143). In centres where both EASY-AS and EVoLVeD are running,&#xD;
      participants in EASY-AS will be offered the opportunity to take part in EVoLVeD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding has been granted by the British Heart Foundation (UK), Medical Research Future Fund&#xD;
      (Aus) and Heart Foundation (NZ). The UK sponsor is the University of Leicester. Additional&#xD;
      support and resources for the study will be provided by the participating Trusts and their&#xD;
      corresponding Clinical Research Networks in the UK. The central co-ordination centre is the&#xD;
      University of Leicester Clinical Trials Unit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6, 12, 24 and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing disability-free survival during the period of active recruitment.&#xD;
Scores assigned to each of the items - &quot;none&quot; (0), &quot;mild&quot; (1) &quot;moderate&quot; (2), &quot;severe&quot; (3) and &quot;extreme&quot; (4) - are summed. The simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional limitations.&#xD;
Step 1 - Summing of recoded item scores within each domain. Step 2 - Summing of all six domain scores. Step 3 - Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 = no disability; 100 = full disability).</description>

    <time_frame>6, 12, 24 and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing quality of life during the period of active recruitment.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L has 2 components: health state description and evaluation. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of 5 dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a 5-level scale.</description>
