  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, for patients with stage I or II disease, surgery provides the best chance for&#xD;
      cure.EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs)are standard first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC.Afatinib was a 2nd-generation EGFR TKI that covalently bound and irreversibly&#xD;
      blocked signaling through activated EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),&#xD;
      and ErbB4 receptors, and the FDA has approved afatinib for first-line treatment of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations.The treatment of stage III NSCLC&#xD;
      remains a matter of debate. Current multimodality treatment options for stage III included&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiation, surgery followed by adjuvant therapy,or neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      followed by surgical resection.Previous studies have revealed that adjuvant EGFR-TKI could&#xD;
      significantly prolong disease free surivival, and have less toxicity than adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy for early resectable EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.EMERGING-CTONG1103&#xD;
      regarding neoadjuvant erlotinib vs chemotherapy (Gemcitabine plus cisplatin) for stage III&#xD;
      NSCLC reveal that erlotinib has improved ORR (54%), major pathological response, operation&#xD;
      rate, R0 resection and lymph node downstaging, and progression-free survival (PFS).A phase II&#xD;
      trial (ASCENT) of neoadjuvant afatinib for stage III EGFR-mutation NSCLC concludes that&#xD;
      afatinib yields the highest ORR (75%) up to now and verifies the feasibility of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      EGFR TKIs for stage III NSCLC. However, no more studies are available so far to confirm the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant afatinib in the treatment of resectable stage III EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive NSCLC, and there is a lack of studies based on the Chinese population.&#xD;
      Given that the neoadjuvant therapy has delayed the operation time and there is a potential&#xD;
      risk of cancer progression, more data are needed to perform evaluation.&#xD;

②Surgical treatment stage: the patients who respond to alfatinib treatment (CR+PR) and the patients who do not respond to alfatinib therapy but could still undergo surgery (SD and PD) will receive radical lung lobectomy+systematic lymph node dissection three weeks (22 days) later.&#xD;
