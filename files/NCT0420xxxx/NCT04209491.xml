  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on the assumption that the nurse coordinators of the centres have&#xD;
      common missions at each of the key stages of patient care. These missions make the care plan&#xD;
      more fluid and improve the quality and safety of care as well as the patient's prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypothesis is that co-follow-up by a doctor and a nurse coordinator reduces time between&#xD;
      referral to treatment, average lengths of stay, unscheduled readmissions or early emergency&#xD;
      visits, compared to follow-up that does not involve a nurse coordinator.&#xD;

      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the roles and missions of professionals dedicated to the coordination of care&#xD;
      pathways for patients with HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the indicators of quality of care in HCC centres with a nurse coordinator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Timeframe in treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  timeframe between the first contact with the HCC centre and the first&#xD;
                interventional radiology treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  timeframe between the first contact with the centre and the first presentation at a&#xD;
                multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time between the first contact with the centre and the diagnostic consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  timeframe between the first contact with the centre and discharge from the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  timeframe between the first interventional radiology procedure and the next for the&#xD;
                subgroup of patients who have multiple procedures during the follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  timeframe between the first contact with the nurse coordinator of the centre and&#xD;
                discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The average length of stay of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The number of visits to the emergency unit during the first month following the&#xD;
           radiology intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of unscheduled readmissions during the first month following the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the feasibility of collecting the above-mentioned timeframe and variables and the&#xD;
      patients and carers feedback on the coordination of the care pathway Describe the&#xD;
      organization of care pathways for patients with HCC in centres with or without a nurse&#xD;
      coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research method: This is a retrospective descriptive pilot study. It aims to describe the&#xD;
      organization of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patient with a diagnosis of localized hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility questionnaires will be sent by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interviews will be transcribed and coded with NVivo® software&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient data will be collected in the ecrf&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data processing from anonymized files by the authors of the research only. All data will&#xD;
           be centralized at Bichat Hospital (URC Paris Nord) for statistical analysis.&#xD;
