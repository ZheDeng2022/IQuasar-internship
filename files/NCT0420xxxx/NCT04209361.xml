  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaining information about the knowledge, attitude and practice of dentists regarding child&#xD;
      abuse and neglect will help identifying the points of weakness, improving their knowledge and&#xD;
      assessing the need for additional training in relation to child protection. Thus,&#xD;
      highlighting the importance of reporting cases of suspected child abuse which in turn may&#xD;
      improve the status of abused children and save them from horrible situations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children are considered to be more vulnerable than other society members because of their&#xD;
      young age and lack of adequate skills. The annual report of United Nations Children's Fund&#xD;
      (UNICEF) stated that a number of children have lost their lives as a result of maltreatment&#xD;
      and violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child abuse is a meaningful problem that exists among different cultural and socio-economic&#xD;
      groups. Child abuse includes several conditions that threaten and harms lives of children. It&#xD;
      is considered to be one of the largest causes of pediatric mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) defines CAN as 'Every kind of physical, sexual, emotional&#xD;
      abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, commercial or other exploitation resulting in actual&#xD;
      or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development, or dignity in the context of&#xD;
      a relationship of responsibility, trust or power'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) defined dental neglect, as 'willful&#xD;
      failure of a parent or guardian to seek and follow through with whatever treatment is&#xD;
      necessary to ensure a level of oral health essential for adequate chewing function and&#xD;
      freedom from pain and infection'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Child Abuse Committee of the Council on Clinical Affairs developed that definition and it&#xD;
      was approved in 1983.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In West and Central Africa, children are susceptible to various hazards since birth including&#xD;
      human trafficking, child labor, child marriage, conflict and other emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, abusive injuries comprise the face and oral cavity thus, dental providers may be&#xD;
      the first to encounter these injuries. Many surveys revealed that 50 -77% of child abuse&#xD;
      cases involving head and neck regions, consequently placing oral health care workers in an&#xD;
      important position to detect, diagnose, document, and report to convenient authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As approximately 50% of injuries due to child abuse occur in head and neck region, medical&#xD;
      and dental professionals are in a good position for early detection and diagnosis of physical&#xD;
      child abuse. Almost 15% of child abuse related injuries are confined to the head region&#xD;
      Therefore, dentists have a significant role in improving the status of abused children and&#xD;
      saving them from their dire situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that guardians or parents who abuse their children regularly change their&#xD;
      child's physicians, but very rarely change their dentists, thus dentists are considered to be&#xD;
      in the most ideal position for detection of physical abuse in children. The American Dental&#xD;
      Association reported the first documented evidence of dentists failing to report child&#xD;
      maltreatment in 1967, declaring that none of 416 reported cases of child abuse was reported&#xD;
      by a dentist in New York State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, few studies have discussed the problem of child abuse. Cases in most of these&#xD;
      studies were collected from emergency, clinical departments, social welfare, criminal records&#xD;
      or autopsies. Child abuse among Egyptian primary-school children was studied in 1994 and&#xD;
      1999. No data were collected regarding the prevalence of abuse among older preparatory-school&#xD;
      and secondary school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also few data are available about the knowledge, attitudes and practices of primary health&#xD;
      care professionals toward prevention and treatment of childhood unintentional injuries.&#xD;
