  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obtain real world, post market data to confirm the clinical improvement and safety in&#xD;
      patients treated with a single injection of MONOVISC for the symptomatic relief of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis in the hip joint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) multi-center, open-label study&#xD;
      to evaluate the residual risk of injections of MONOVISC for relief of pain in patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of an osteoarthritic hip joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in this study will be patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritic (OA) joint who&#xD;
      the investigator determines are appropriate candidates for treatment with a viscoelastic&#xD;
      injection of MONOVISC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled at up to 20 investigational sites in the EU. Subject&#xD;
      participation will last approximately 6 Months, with visits scheduled at Screening, Baseline,&#xD;
      1 month, 3 month and 6 months.&#xD;

             grade I to III) to be treated with MONOVISC injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Failed conservative treatment for joint osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. NRS pain on walking ≥4 and ≤ 9 in index joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject must be willing to abstain from other treatments of the index joint for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
