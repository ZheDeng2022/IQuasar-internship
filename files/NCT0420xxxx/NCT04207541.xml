  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delay in commencing insulin among type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients is common. One of&#xD;
      the reasons is patients' psychological insulin resistance (PIR), which is particularly&#xD;
      prevalent in Chinese patients. The Chinese Attitudes to Starting Insulin Questionnaire&#xD;
      (Ch-ASIQ) is the shortest locally validated questionnaire which is developed to understand&#xD;
      the condition of PIR in T2DM patients while brief motivational interviewing has been shown to&#xD;
      improve patients' collaborations and satisfactions, the alliance between patients and&#xD;
      doctors, and the treatment adherence. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of a one-session educational intervention targeting psychological insulin resistance guided&#xD;
      by Ch-ASIQ in promoting the insulin acceptance and initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental study will be conducted on 130 insulin-naïve T2DM patients recruited&#xD;
      from a primary care setting. Eligible participants in the intervention group will be treated&#xD;
      with one 15-minute brief motivational interviewing guided by Ch-ASIQ while those in control&#xD;
      group will be treated with usual care. Both groups will be further followed up for 6 months&#xD;
      to observe for their insulin initiation. The primary outcomes: i. the proportion of patient&#xD;
      referral to insulin clinic (insulin acceptance), and ii. the proportion of patient with&#xD;
      insulin initiation (actual start of insulin therapy).&#xD;

      Background Information According to the American Diabetes Association ADA (2018), insulin&#xD;
      treatment should not be delayed in patients with T2DM who fail to control their glycemic&#xD;
      level with OHAs. Delay in insulin therapy for such type of patients leads to excess glycemic&#xD;
      burden. A retrospective analysis of data showed that between 2005 and 2010, the time from&#xD;
      T2DM diagnosis to insulin initiation increased by approximately 2 years in the primary care&#xD;
      practices in Europe with increase in the percentage of patients with at least one&#xD;
      macrovascular complication. As known, once the developed macrovascular complications cannot&#xD;
      be reversed with tight glycemic control by any treatment. However, the initiation of the&#xD;
      insulin therapy is often delayed. This may be due to the reluctance among people with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About half of the diabetic patients who are having suboptimal glycemic control for 3-5 years&#xD;
      and living with different extent of complications delay insulin therapy initiation. One of&#xD;
      the reasons is patients' psychological insulin resistance (PIR), which is describing the&#xD;
      reluctance to initiate insulin therapy, particularly prevalent in Chinese patients. In Hong&#xD;
      Kong, a local study has revealed a similarly high PIR prevalence of 72.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective educational programmes are needed for insulin-naive patients to enhance their&#xD;
      understanding of the disease and treatment; and increase the acceptance and adherence of&#xD;
      insulin therapy. This calls for effective educational programmes to help those patients in&#xD;
      achieving better glycemic control in order to decrease risk of diabetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Motivational Interviewing is an adaptation of motivational interviewing skills, which&#xD;
      is designed to apply in a time-constraint clinical care environment and has been shown to&#xD;
      improve patients' collaborations and satisfactions, the alliance between patients and&#xD;
      doctors, and the adherence to treatment. Although this is an effective communication style,&#xD;
      it has never been applied to educational programmes of insulin acceptance among T2DM patients&#xD;
      with sub-optimal glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives and Purpose This trial is to examine the effectiveness of brief motivational&#xD;
      enhancement education programme in addition to usual care versus usual care only in improving&#xD;
      insulin acceptance and insulin initiation among T2DM patients with sub-optimal glycemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design To achieve the objectives, a quasi-experimental study on brief motivational&#xD;
      enhancement education programme will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be included in the trial if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosed with T2DM for more than six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chinese patients who can speak Cantonese/Mandarin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chinese patients who can read Chinese&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aged ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Suboptimal glycemic control whose latest HbA1c ≥ 7.5% with maximum oral dosage of OHAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Never used insulin before and prescribed to start insulin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will be excluded if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical or mental ill that hindered them from completing the questionnaire or&#xD;
           communicate, e.g., dementia, deafness, and severe visual problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gestational diabetic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      People has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time without any impact on the current&#xD;
      medical services and legal rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in one of the primary care setting of Hospital Authority, Ap Lei&#xD;
      Chau GOPC. Potential participants will be invited to participate when they are attending the&#xD;
      clinic for their regular follow-up appointment. Eligible participants will first be explained&#xD;
      the information sheet regarding the study. They will then be asked to sign the consent if&#xD;
      they are willing to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects The study target to recruit two groups of eligible cases. The two&#xD;
      groups will be recruited one by one. The first group recruited will act as control in&#xD;
      comparison. In this group, all eligible participants will be invited to complete the 13-items&#xD;
      Chinese Attitudes to Starting Insulin Questionnaire (Ch-ASIQ) before they see nurses. After&#xD;
      having completed the questionnaires, they will be treated as usual care. The complications of&#xD;
      suboptimal diabetic control will be told, at the same time, diet control and importance of&#xD;
      regular exercise will also be reinforced as usual care. At the end of the session, they will&#xD;
      be asked if they accept the referral to the insulin clinic for insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional group of eligible cases will be recruited after the control group reached&#xD;
      the pre-set numbers. In the interventional group, the eligible participants will be also&#xD;
      invited to complete the Ch-ASIQ before they see nurses. Besides the usual care, all the&#xD;
      participants in this group will also be treated with structured intervention. The information&#xD;
      gathered through the questionnaires will be used in the intervention for this group of&#xD;
      patients. The information will be delivered to the patients in the format of one 15-minute&#xD;
      session of brief motivational interviewing. Pre-set script will be used for the brief&#xD;
      motivational interviewing. At the end of the session, they will be asked if they accept the&#xD;
      referral to the insulin clinic for insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 10 cases in the intervention group will act as pilot. Intervention will be revised&#xD;
      if there are logistics problem seen.&#xD;
