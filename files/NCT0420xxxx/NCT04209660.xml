      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drugs, lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, are&#xD;
      effective in treating advanced Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) or other salivary gland cancers&#xD;
      that have come back and/or spread to other parts of the body. Researchers are also doing this&#xD;
      study to test the safety of the study drugs in participants.&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
