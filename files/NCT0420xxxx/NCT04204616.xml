    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 192 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of AEs including AEs of Special Interest (AESIs), Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) by severity as mild, moderate or severe will be reported. An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with relevant investigational product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose may results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product. TEAE is an AE that occurs on or after the first date of study drug(s) administration until the date of last study visit. An AESI is a noteworthy treatment-emergent event for the study drug that should be monitored closely and reported promptly.</description>
