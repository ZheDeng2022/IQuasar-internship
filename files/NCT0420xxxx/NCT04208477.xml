  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow through the brain is reduced after brain damage. Secondary brain ischemia caused&#xD;
      by hypoxia and hypotension, further increase the susceptibility of the ischemically&#xD;
      compromised brain to secondary impairment during this period. In order to determine whether&#xD;
      and to what extent blockage of the stellate ganglion (BSG) affects the blood flow to the&#xD;
      injured brain, the investigators will measure the variables of brain blood flow before and&#xD;
      after BSG using computed tomography angiography (CTA), trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      (TCD), intracranial pressure (ICP) and perfusion computed tomography (PCT) of the brain. At&#xD;
      the same time, the investigators would like to evaluate whether and to what extent BSG&#xD;
      affects the aseptic inflammatory brain injury response and the biochemical indicators of&#xD;
      brain damage in patients with moderate and severe brain injury.&#xD;

      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stellate ganglion blockade in patients with moderate and severe brain damage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increases the diameter of the brain arteries and blood flow through the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do not interfere with intracranial pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduces aseptic inflammatory reaction of the damaged brains measured by IL-6 and reduces&#xD;
           damage of the brain tissue measured by protein S100B (S100B), neuron specific enolase&#xD;
           (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and method description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 40 subjects of both sexes (18-70 years old) with moderate and severe&#xD;
      head injury who will be treated surgically and/or conservatively at the Intensive Care Center&#xD;
      (CIT) of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care UKC Ljubljana. The study will&#xD;
      include patients who underwent computed tomography angiography of the brain (CTA) and&#xD;
      received an intra-parenchymal intracranial pressure monitor electrode (ICP) at admission to&#xD;
      the UKC Ljubljana Emergency Center or during CIT treatment. After primary conservative or&#xD;
      surgical care, the subjects will be transferred for further treatment at CIT. Subjects will&#xD;
      be sedated and mechanically ventilated. To maintain target cerabral perfusion pressure (CPP),&#xD;
      the investigators will give an infusion of noradrenaline as needed. The study will not&#xD;
      include subjects with primary decompression craniectomy and radiological signs of progression&#xD;
      of intracranial hematomas, subjects in a barbiturate coma, and subjects with a norepinephrine&#xD;
      dose greater than 0.2 mcg/kg/min. The study will not include pregnant women, children,&#xD;
      patients with known hypersensitivity to iodine contrast media and local anesthetics, and&#xD;
      patients with poor renal function (estimated glomerular filtration below 30ml / min /&#xD;
      1.73m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted during patient treatment at CIT. The investigators will begin&#xD;
      the investigation after positive positive opinions from the Medical Ethics Commission of the&#xD;
      Republic of Slovenia, and obtained written consent form patient's family members or official&#xD;
      legal representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of BSG on brain blood flow and the diameter of brain vessels will be evaluated by&#xD;
      CTA, PCT, TCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BSG will be done during the first week after admission at CIT on the same patient's side of&#xD;
      the ICP position. One hour after BSG, control CTA in PCT will be done. TCD od the left and&#xD;
      right middle brain artery (ACM) will be performed one hour before and after BSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCD will be used to measure the rate of blood flow through ACM in systole-Vs in diastole-Vd&#xD;
      and pulsatility index (PI). The investigators will compare Vs, Vd values and PI before and&#xD;
      after BSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible changes in the diameter of large brain vessels after BSG will be compared between&#xD;
      CTA done at the emergency center or during CIT treatment and a control CTA after BSG. For&#xD;
      standard diameter measurement sites, the investigators will take the middle third of M1 and&#xD;
      the proximal part of the M2 segment of the ACM, the middle third of the A1 and A2 segments of&#xD;
      the anterior brain artery (ACA), the P1 segment and the first part of P2 segment of the&#xD;
      posterior brain artery (ACP), the terminal part of the interior carotid artery (ACI), the&#xD;
      middle third of the intradural part of the vertebral artery and middle third of the basilar&#xD;
      artery. Changes in the diameter of the brain vessels will be presented numerically and&#xD;
      descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With PCT-produced color maps beside qualitative evaluation od the possible changes of the&#xD;
      brain blood flow on the left and right brain hemisphere after BSG, the investigators will&#xD;
      also evaluate changes in regional brain blood volume (rCBV), regional brain blood flow&#xD;
      (rCBF), mean transition time (MTT). Outside the contusion regions, the investigators will&#xD;
      mark the region of interest (ROI) of 500 mm2 for ACA, ACM and ACP perfusion areas. Siemens&#xD;
      SyngoVia software will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCT and CTA will be done by the helical CT tomogram (Somatom, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A&#xD;
      40 ml non-ionic low-osmolar iodine contrast medium, 370 mg/ml iopromide (Ultravist; Bayer&#xD;
      HealthCare, Berlin, Germany) will be used. It will be injected at a flow rate of 5 ml/s into&#xD;
      a cubital vein. Perfusion imaging will be initiated 7 seconds after the injection of&#xD;
      contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for the determination of IL6, NSE, S100B in GFAP will be drawn from the right&#xD;
      external jugular vein and peripheral artery (radial or femoral artery) one hour before and 1,&#xD;
      6, 12, 24 hours after BSG. The investigators will compare IL6, NSE, S100B, GFAP values in&#xD;
      venous blood from right jugular vein before v after BSG. A comparation of the values of IL6,&#xD;
      NSE, S100B, GFAP in venous blood from the right internal jugular vein in arterial blood taken&#xD;
      from the peripheral artery will be done as well. Blood samples will be sent for analysis to&#xD;
      the central laboratory of UKC Ljubljana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain oxygenation will be measured with a non-invasive method on both fronts using Near&#xD;
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS measurement values will be measured immediately before BSG&#xD;
      and within 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes after BSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BSG will be done ipsilaterally to the inserted ICP electrode. BSG will be done under&#xD;
      ultrasound control at the C6-C7 level, with a lateral approach with a Stimulplex Ultra 360&#xD;
      5cm needle (B.Brown). A 6-15 MHz high frequency probe will be used. BSG will be done always&#xD;
      by the same anesthesiologist. The injection site and the ultrasound probe will be aseptically&#xD;
      prepared. The ultrasound probe will be placed transversely to the neck axis at the height of&#xD;
      the sixth cervical vertebra. After preliminary verification of the needle tip position over&#xD;
      the long cervical muscle and under the prevertebral fascia and after negative aspiration, 8&#xD;
      ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine will be injected. Because het investigator's subjects will be&#xD;
      sedated, onset of the BSG will be confirmed 10 minutes after the blockade, by the onset of&#xD;
      three signs of Horner's syndrome (ptosis, myosis, enophthalmus, anhydrosis, conjunctival&#xD;
      hyperemia): enophthalmus, anhydrosis, conjunctival hyperemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP in CPP will be continuously measured before and after BSG. The data will be analyzed in&#xD;
      graphical display using IBM SPSS Statistics statistical programs, ver. 25 and Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel. The variables will be presented as mean values with standard deviation or as median&#xD;
      with interquartile range. Using the paired t-test, the investigators will compare the average&#xD;
      values of the sample's numerically variables. Significant differences will be defined as&#xD;
      p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      When investigating the effect of BSG on the brain circulation and inflammatory response in&#xD;
      subjects with moderate and severe brain damage, the investigators expect a significant&#xD;
      increase in the diameter of the large brain arteries, and thus a positive effect of BSG on&#xD;
      the brain circulation of the injured brain (decreased mean blood transition time, increased&#xD;
      blood volume in the brain, and increased blood flow through the brain). The investigators&#xD;
      estimate that BSG will not change the intracranial pressure. The investigators expect NIRS&#xD;
      values to be significantly higher after the blockade than before the blockade. Due to the&#xD;
      positive effects of BSG on the aseptic inflammatory response of non-injured brain, BSG is&#xD;
      expected to have the same effect in the injured brain. The investigators also expect BSG will&#xD;
      decrease the concentration of biochemical indicators of inflammation and damage to neurons&#xD;
      and glia.&#xD;
