      Phase I/II, single center, prospective, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized,&#xD;
      interventional, cohort study in which low risk living donor liver transplant (LDLT)&#xD;
      recipients who are between 1 and 3 years after transplantation and meet specific criteria (no&#xD;
      positive crossmatch, no clinically treated rejection within 2 years preceding enrollment,&#xD;
      permissive liver function tests (LFTs) within 30 days preceding enrollment, no prior liver&#xD;
      biopsy showing significant fibrosis or ductopenia*) will be enrolled and will undergo a&#xD;
      protocol liver biopsy unless they have had a permissive liver biopsy** within 90 days of&#xD;
      anticipated immunosuppression weaning. Those patients with permissive liver biopsy** will&#xD;
      then receive a single infusion of donor-derived DCreg and will remain on their current&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) immunosuppression. One week after DCreg infusion, immunosuppression&#xD;
      weaning will be initiated. Recipients will be slowly weaned off immunosuppression.&#xD;
      Successfully weaned participants who remain rejection-free will undergo 3 years of follow-up&#xD;
      after the last dose of immunosuppression. They will undergo a liver biopsy at 1 yr and 3 yrs&#xD;
      after immunosuppression withdrawal. Participants who are removed from the study protocol at&#xD;
      any time will return to standard of care but will continue to be followed by the study team&#xD;
      and will undergo a liver biopsy at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Permissive LFTs are defined as ALT, AST and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
      normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **A permissive biopsy is based on 2016 Comprehensive Update of the Banff Working Group on&#xD;
      Liver Allograft Pathology (the criteria detailed in Table 8, Demetris et al. 2016).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Long-term immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation is associated with&#xD;
      life-threatening side effects that include infection, malignancy, diabetes and increased risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease. In addition, use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) causes&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity and a significant rate of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) at 5 years after&#xD;
      orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Many patients with CRI after OLT require renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation) and are at increased mortality risk.&#xD;
      A large study based on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and the&#xD;
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) ESRD Program database showed an ESRD&#xD;
      incidence of 15 per 1000 patient years, implying that in 20 years, ~30% of patients require&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy. Patients demonstrating progressive loss in functional nephron mass&#xD;
      are also at risk of progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is known to confer &gt; 4&#xD;
      fold increase in mortality risk. Immunosuppression (CNI) withdrawal, particularly before&#xD;
      significant renal injury has set in, may preserve renal function and prevent morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with CKD/CRI and renal replacement therapy. Immunosuppression withdrawal&#xD;
      may also mitigate the increased risk of infection, malignancy, diabetes, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease directly associated with conventional immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to develop a novel, safe cell therapy approach that, when used in liver&#xD;
      transplantation would facilitate the safe complete withdrawal of immunosuppression without&#xD;
      jeopardizing allograft function or histology. Recent evidence suggests that, by exploiting&#xD;
      inherent mechanisms of immune regulation, it may be possible to achieve this goal. Rare,&#xD;
      naturally-occurring regulatory immune cells, either innate or adaptive, critically regulate&#xD;
      immunity, promote antigen (Ag)-specific T cell hyporesponsiveness and prevent adverse immune&#xD;
      reactions in the healthy steady-state. In addition to Treg, being evaluated for cell-based&#xD;
      therapy in organ transplantation, a compelling rationale has emerged for clinical testing of&#xD;
      regulatory DC modified ex vivo to promote their regulatory properties (DCreg). Thus, in&#xD;
      rodents, infusion of donor-derived DCreg before transplantation, including their combination&#xD;
      with conventional IS, promotes indefinite (&gt; 100 day) organ allograft survival. There is also&#xD;
      evidence that infusion of donor- or recipient- derived DCreg post-transplant can promote&#xD;
      indefinite allograft survival. More importantly and uniquely, using a robust,&#xD;
      clinically-relevant, non-human primate (NHP) model with minimal IS, we have shown that&#xD;
      infusion of DCreg, one week before transplantation, significantly and safely prolongs renal&#xD;
      allograft survival, with no evidence of host sensitization. Equally significant, is our&#xD;
      demonstration that prolongation of allograft survival is associated with selective&#xD;
      attenuation of donor-reactive Tmem responses, an important barrier to improving long-term&#xD;
      graft survival and achieving operational tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of safe and effective approaches that improve long-term graft survival while&#xD;
      reducing the burden of conventional immunosuppressive drugs, will have a significant impact&#xD;
      on the health, as well as costs, of thousands of organ transplant recipients. Extensive&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies conducted by Dr. Thomson (IND Sponsor) and others in rodents and&#xD;
      humanized mouse models are persuasive regarding the potential of regulatory immune cell&#xD;
      therapy to enhance long-term allograft survival and in many instances, promote donor-specific&#xD;
      tolerance. The case for evaluation of DCreg generated ex vivo is particularly compelling.&#xD;
      First, DC are inherently tolerogenic, uniquely well-equipped, professional Ag-presenting&#xD;
      cells (APC) that potently regulate innate and adaptive immunity. Second, in many animal&#xD;
      studies, DCreg adoptively transferred to allograft recipients before or after transplant&#xD;
      induce Ag-specific tolerance and promote indefinite graft survival. Moreover, this&#xD;
      therapeutic effect does not appear to depend on the in vivo persistence of intact DCreg.&#xD;
      Independence of efficacy and underlying regulatory mechanisms on persistence of intact donor&#xD;
      DCreg may be a distinct advantage over other cell therapy approaches, where costly repeated&#xD;
      infusion of large numbers of cells and their sustained viability/stability/replication may be&#xD;
      required to achieve a therapeutic effect. Third, an important attribute of DCreg is their&#xD;
      ability to regulate preformed Tmem responses, that, due to molecular mimicry, cross-react&#xD;
      with HLA Ags [66], representing a major barrier to long-term graft survival in humans.&#xD;
      Fourth, in normal humans, adoptive transfer of monocyte-derived DCreg induces Ag-specific&#xD;
      inhibition of effector T cell function. Fifth, using minimal IS in a robust, NHP model, we&#xD;
      have reported that a single infusion of 3.5-10.106/kg donor-derived DCreg pre-transplant&#xD;
      safely prolongs renal allograft survival, without host sensitization. Importantly, this&#xD;
      effect is associated with attenuation of donor-specific, alloreactive Tmem responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCreg approach could be readily applied in the clinic since a single infusion of a&#xD;
      relatively small number of DCreg (3.5-10.106/kg) in NHP is sufficient to achieve a salutary&#xD;
      therapeutic effect. Therefore, neither expensive expansion of the cell product over several&#xD;
      weeks (compared with Treg), nor repeated infusion appears necessary. It is also likely that&#xD;
      DCreg will have broader clinical application to encompass recipients of organ transplants&#xD;
      from deceased donors as rodent studies have shown that delay of DCreg infusion to 7 or 14 d&#xD;
      after transplant is still effective in prolonging graft survival and promoting tolerance,&#xD;
      providing ample time to prepare DCreg from deceased donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility that DCreg administration could enable early withdrawal of immunosuppression&#xD;
      (&lt; 3 years) after liver transplantation carries the potentially great advantage of sparing&#xD;
      patients the cardiovascular, infectious, neoplastic, and renal side effects of long-term&#xD;
      immunosuppression, particularly with CNI. Liver transplantation provides a particular&#xD;
      opportunity to achieve this goal because liver grafts are more tolerated by the recipient's&#xD;
      immune system than other solid organ grafts, with immunosuppression withdrawal possible in&#xD;
      ~20% of patients overall (in the absence of any experimental, immunomodulatory therapy)&#xD;
      compared to &lt;5% in renal transplant recipients. Increasing the proportion of liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients who can be withdrawn from immunosuppression through the administration of DCreg&#xD;
      around the time of transplantation could reap significant health benefits to this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
