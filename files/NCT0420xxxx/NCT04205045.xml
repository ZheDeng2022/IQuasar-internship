      This study aims to explore digestibility of lactose and milk proteins, gut permeability,&#xD;
      microbiota composition and psychological wellbeing status in healthy subjects who are&#xD;
      non-habitual milk consumers due to milk-related gastro-intestinal discomfort in comparison&#xD;
      with healthy and habitual milk consumers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individuals reporting digestive disorders associated to milk and dairy products consumption&#xD;
      increase worldwide, but in many cases this condition is not associated with a well documented&#xD;
      diagnosis of lactose intolerance or casein allergy. Some investigators hypothesize that these&#xD;
      disorders (in the absence of any diagnosis of disease) may be due to certain peptides forming&#xD;
      during milk digestion. Further evidence support the hypothesis that other factors, such as a&#xD;
      lacking activity of intestinal brush border enzymes, an altered gut permeability, and/or a&#xD;
      specific gut microbiota composition, may be involved in the onset of gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      discomforts induced by milk consumption. Indeed, all these factors could modulate the amount&#xD;
      and type of peptides and lactose skipping digestion and passing through the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa, leading to effects on GI motility and gastro-intestinal hormone secretion. Similarly,&#xD;
      due to its implications in homeostatic and non-homeostatic regulation of eating behaviour as&#xD;
      well as in pain-regulating processes, a role of endocannabinoid system (ECs) in the evolution&#xD;
      of GI symptoms post-milk consumption could be hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the digestibility of lactose and milk proteins will be explored in healthy&#xD;
      subjects who are non-habitual milk consumers (NHMC) because of gastro-intestinal discomforts&#xD;
      induced by milk ingestion, in comparison with healthy and habitual milk consumers (HMC). The&#xD;
      gut permeability, the composition of intestinal microbiota and the psychological wellbeing&#xD;
      status of subjects will be also investigated and compared in the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design, after the enrollment of participants based on pre-recruitment&#xD;
      questionnaires and a lactose breath test, includes a gut permeability test and a milk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential eligibility of subjects to participate in this study will be assessed through&#xD;
      pre-recruitment questionnaires, collecting personal and socio-demographic data of volunteers,&#xD;
      information about milk consumption habits and associated symptoms, general information about&#xD;
      health (anthropometry, health status, smoking and alcohol consumption habits), household&#xD;
      environment, information on volunteer's consideration about milk product and its consumption,&#xD;
      and food habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential eligible subjects who will sign the informed consent form, will be assessed for&#xD;
      final eligibility by mean of a lactose breath test, performed according to the protocol&#xD;
      approved during the Rome Consensus Conference (2009). GI symptoms will be also recorded by&#xD;
      subjects, in parallel with H2 measurements in breath samples and up to 24 hours from the&#xD;
      beginning of the test, by mean of Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lactose breath test, subjects will be asked to fill out the physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire (short version of the IPAQ), questionnaires on quality of life, on depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and stress (DASS), a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the King's&#xD;
      Stool Chart, to evaluate frequency and consistency of feces, and the Three Factor Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire (TFEQ) to evaluate individual eating behaviour. Anthropometric data of weight&#xD;
      and height will be measured as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall symptoms evolved during and after the lactose breath test will be assessed&#xD;
      together with the H2 concentrations measured in breath samples; a cut-off value of 20 ppm&#xD;
      over the baseline will be used to identify lactose malabsorbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This selection procedure will identify as eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjects who are negative to breath test (BT-) and do not refer any GI symptom (lactose&#xD;
           absorber) or refer some minor gastro-intestinal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjects who are positive to breath test (BT+) but without any symptom (lactose&#xD;
           malabsorbers without symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, subjects will be excluded from the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  they are positive to breath test (BT+) and report GI symptoms (lactose intolerant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  they are negative to breath test (BT-) but report severe GI symptoms such as &quot;vomiting&quot;&#xD;
           and &quot;Loose, mushy or watery stools&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment will be concluded when 2 groups of subjects will be constituted as follow&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1, habitual milk consumers (HMC): 20 subjects who are regular milk consumers (&gt;700&#xD;
           mL/week), do not experience GI discomfort after milk intake and are lactose tolerant or&#xD;
           lactose malabsorber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2, non-habitual milk consumers (NHMC): 20 subjects who are not regular milk&#xD;
           consumers (&lt; 150 mL/week), because of GI discomforts after milk intake and are lactose&#xD;
           tolerant or lactose malabsorber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects from both groups the gut permeability test and the milk test will be&#xD;
      performed. These tests will be scheduled after one week from the lactose breath test and with&#xD;
      one week in between. Subjects will be also asked to collect a fecal sample under usual&#xD;
      dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For gut permeability test, subjects will receive instruction about drug consumption and will&#xD;
      be asked to follow a controlled diet for 2 days before the test (avoiding milk and dairy&#xD;
      products, and food products containing polyols).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting subjects will collect a baseline urine sample, before drinking a solution containing&#xD;
      5 g lactulose, 2 g mannitol and 2 g sucralose in 100 ml of water. Urines will be collected&#xD;
      for time periods 0-5 h and 5-24 h in two containers added with 1 mL of a chlorhexidine&#xD;
      solution at 1 ppm. Urine samples collected over 24 h and delivered the day after to the study&#xD;
      centre will be aliquoted (1.5 ml) and frozen at -20°C until analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the week before the milk test, subjects will fill a food diary. Moreover they will be&#xD;
      instructed to not drink any milk, dairy product and any food product containing milk proteins&#xD;
      during the 2 days before the milk test. On the day of milk test, fasting subjects will fill&#xD;
      out questionnaires about their actual appetite and GI symptoms, baseline urine and blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected, and fasting glycaemia by finger-prick will be measured.&#xD;
      Subsequently, subjects will drink 250 ml of milk within 10 min and thereafter, glycaemia,&#xD;
      symptoms and appetite questionnaires, as well as blood samples and urine will be collected at&#xD;
      specific time points. After the last blood drawing subjects will be offered a lunch and,&#xD;
      before leaving the study centre, they will be instructed to fill out GI symptoms and appetite&#xD;
      questionnaires, to collect urine, to fill out a food diary, and to consume a fixed dinner.&#xD;
      Questionnaires, diaries and 6-24h urine samples will be delivered to the laboratory on the&#xD;
      next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples, stored at -40°C will be analyzed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gastro-intestinal hormones (insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon-like&#xD;
           peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucagon, c-peptide, ghrelin, leptin) in plasma samples pre-treated&#xD;
           with aprotinin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  endocannabinoids and N-acyl-ethanolamines (ECs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  casein digestion-derived peptides (beta-casomorphins and all known peptides derived from&#xD;
           milk proteins);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aminoacid profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DPPIV activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline DPPIV concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples, aliquoted (1.5 ml) and frozen at -40°C, will be used to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lactose, galactose + glucose, and indican excretion levels (for urines collected over 24&#xD;
           h after milk test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lactulose, mannitol and sucralose excretion levels (for urines collected over 24 h after&#xD;
           gut permeability test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples, stored at -40°C, will be used for DNA extraction according to the standard&#xD;
      operating procedures of the International Human Microbiome Consortium&#xD;
      (http://www.human-microbiome.org/). Statistical analysis will be carried out by the most&#xD;
      appropriate methods in order to infer the associations between specific microbiota signatures&#xD;
      and clinical, dietary and metabolomic parameters.&#xD;
