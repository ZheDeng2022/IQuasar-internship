      The patients will be randomly assigned into two equal groups Group : OneShape Group:&#xD;
      ProtaperNext&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontics procedure steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be anesthetized by using infiltration local anesthesia or nerve block according&#xD;
      to the tooth location in mandibular or maxillary arch respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All caries will be removed, then isolation using rubber dam, the crown and surrounding&#xD;
      structures will be disinfected with 30% H2O2( hydrogen peroxide) for 30 seconds, followed by&#xD;
      2.5% NaOCl for the same period of time and then inactivated with 5% sodium thiosulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- For the access cavity preparation, a sterile/apyrogenic high-speed diamond bur will be&#xD;
      used in conjunction with manual irrigation with sterile saline. Before entering the pulp&#xD;
      chamber, the access cavity will be disinfected according to the protocol described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- Root canal length will be determined, by preoperative radiograph then (S1) will be taken&#xD;
      by introducing a sterile/apyrogenic paper point #15/ 20 (5paper points) into the full length&#xD;
      of the canal and left there for 1 minute. Then, the sample will be placed in an apyrogenic&#xD;
      glass and stored in -20°. Then canal length will be confirmed by apex locator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Cleaning and shaping will be done using either One shape or Protaper next rotary&#xD;
      instruments in crown down preparation technique with the use of in an endodontic motor&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer instructions, the canals will be thoroughly irrigated using 3ml&#xD;
      of 2.5% Sodium hypochlorite between every subsequent instrument.&#xD;

      4-After root canal preparation, NaOCl will be inactivated with 5 mL of sterile 5% sodium&#xD;

      solution., which then will be removed with 5 mL of sterile/apyrogenic saline solution. second&#xD;
      endotoxin sample (S2) will be taken from the root canals. (5 paper point size of the master&#xD;
      cone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- After completion of instrumentation and irrigation, obturation will be done using size 30/&#xD;
      0.4 taper gutta-percha cones and auxiliaries as needed using the modified single cone&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Endotoxin Concentration Human endotoxin (ET) ELISA Kit will be used to&#xD;
      measure endotoxin concentrations in the root canals before and after chemomechanical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
