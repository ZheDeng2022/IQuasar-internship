      INTRODUCTION The treatment of OA is mostly symptomatic and includes the use of analgesics,&#xD;
      NSAIDs, exercise and even surgery. However, the use of long-term NSAIDs is associated with&#xD;
      potentially serious side effects. As a result, the use of alternative and complementary&#xD;
      therapies (CAM), such as nutritional therapies in patients with OA, is extremely frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a dietary supplement&#xD;
      based on curcumin, polydatin and beta-caryophyllene, on the reduction of pain and&#xD;
      inflammatory component in individuals with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD Study design Intervention study with two parallel arms, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Participants in the study will be recruited at the Santo Stefano&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Institute. The first group will be treated with curcumin-based supplement for&#xD;
      6 weeks; the second group will be treated with placebo for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of osteoarthritis of the knee. Traditional American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
           criteria, which are based on the presence of pain (knee pain) plus at least three of the&#xD;
           following characteristics, will be used for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt; 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stiffness in the morning &lt; 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of articular rusting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Painfulness of the bones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumefaction of the bones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of palpable heat Knee pain in this study is defined as having experienced at&#xD;
           least moderate pain in the most affected knee (a score of 30 mm or more on an analog&#xD;
           visual scale - VAS - as assessed by the patient) for at least 25 of the previous 30&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy and breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other specific contraindications/intolerances to the compound&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Gonarthrosis is the most common disorder of the musculoskeletal system, with an&#xD;
      age-related prevalence varying between 12-55%. The treatment of OA is mostly symptomatic and&#xD;
      includes the use of analgesics, NSAIDs, exercise and even surgery. However, the use of&#xD;
      long-term NSAIDs is associated with potentially serious side effects, with a high risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization and death. As a result, the use of alternative and complementary therapies&#xD;
      (CAM), such as nutritional therapies in patients with OA, is extremely frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a dietary supplement&#xD;
      based on curcumin, polydatin and beta-caryophyllene (FENOXIDOL™-Mivell), on the reduction of&#xD;
      pain and inflammatory component in individuals with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD Study design Intervention study with two parallel arms, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled to assess the effectiveness of the dietary supplement in&#xD;
      reducing perceived pain, will also be evaluated secondarily the improvement of joint&#xD;
      function, changes in serum levels of PCR, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and&#xD;
      nitrates / nitrites at the level of saliva and any change in the use of painkillers when&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Intervention group: the study involves the intake of two capsules per day, one&#xD;
      capsule to be taken before breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FENOXIDOL™ supplement and its placebo (visually identical capsules, but without active&#xD;
      ingredients) will be supplied by the company Mivell Srls participating in the PrIntAge&#xD;
      project. For the composition of the placebo, see the declaration attached to this document by&#xD;
      Mivell Srls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FENOXIDOL™ is a natural anti-inflammatory supplement designed to counteract, without any&#xD;
      known side effects, acute and chronic inflammatory phenomena, especially those associated&#xD;
      with joints, muscles and bones. The product has been formulated using naturally derived&#xD;
      extracts in the quantities shown in the table below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHENOXIDOL CAPSULE COMPOSITION active substances for 1 capsule for 2 capsules Bio Curcumin&#xD;
      200 mg 400 mg Polydatin 50 mg 100 mg Beta-Caryophyllene 24 mg 48 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that the product FENOXIDOL™ and its components have not been associated to&#xD;
      date with any side effects, the active ingredients of the formula are all listed in Annex 1&#xD;
      of the Italian Ministry Decree of 10 August 2018 governing the use in food supplements of&#xD;
      herbal substances and preparations as updated by Decree 9 January 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should also be noted that the FENOXIDOL™ product has no Gluten Free certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group: the study involves taking two capsules per day of placebo, one capsule before&#xD;
      breakfast and one before dinner for a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will consist of capsules with no active ingredients containing cellulose, fatty&#xD;
      acid magnesium salts, and silicon dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be allowed to use anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen up to 400 mg per&#xD;
      2/day) to control pain, if needed. The patient will, however, be required to avoid / suspend&#xD;
      the use of anti-inflammatory at least 12 hours before the visit to baseline and subsequent&#xD;
      checkups and to record the use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment, randomisation and blinding kits Mivell Srls will prepare patient kits containing&#xD;
      treatment capsules in proportion to the time of administration and sample size considered and&#xD;
      will send them by courier to the Pharmacy of the Istituto di Riabilitazione Santo Stefano. In&#xD;
      order to carry out the double-blind study, these kits will be assigned, by Mivell Srls,&#xD;
      identification codes based on the randomization lists generated by a statistical software.&#xD;
      Blinding will be maintained for the entire duration of the study, until the analysis of the&#xD;
      data and, possibly, interrupted only at the time of highlighting potential adverse winds in&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's compliance with the treatment will be calculated on the basis of the percentage&#xD;
      of residual doses at the end of the study and on the basis of the compilation of a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples and data collection Data will be collected on age, gender, educational&#xD;
      level, BMI, employment, physical activity at work and in leisure time (IPAQ Questionnaire),&#xD;
      tobacco habits, presence of comorbidity, type of diet (food frequency questionnaire related&#xD;
      to the last week, with particular regard to the intake of substances with anti-inflammatory /&#xD;
      antioxidant power, eg: seeds and dried fruit, dark chocolate, bananas, avocado, soya&#xD;
      products, leafy vegetables, fish, garlic, curry, rosemary, ginger, saffron, (see Cavicchia,&#xD;
      2009), use of drugs (with particular regard to the frequency of taking painkillers and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs in the previous six weeks) and supplements. The following will also&#xD;
      be evaluated: duration of the disease, presence of osteoporosis, orthopaedic-neurological&#xD;
      comorbidity, trauma, type of work, obligatory postures, use of special shoes/touches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective examination will allow the evaluation of the degree of joint impairment, the&#xD;
      completion of the WOMAC questionnaire, the pVAS scale (Visual Analogue Scale for pain), knee&#xD;
      height from the ground, A diary of the frequency of use of pain control drugs (ibuprofen up&#xD;
      to 400mg 2/day), to be completed by the patient or care-giver, will also be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of blood collected will be 5 ml, as part of the blood sample performed for&#xD;
      chemical and clinical tests provided for in normal clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample testing will be performed immediately after collection at GSS Laboratories,&#xD;
      using standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of nitrites and nitrates, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha will be evaluated&#xD;
      at the salivary level. Salivary collection will be done by means of Salivets. Dosages of&#xD;
      nitrite and nitrate, IL-6 and TNF-alpha will be conducted on morning saliva sample. Salivary&#xD;
      samples will be processed at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Hygiene Section of&#xD;
      the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health - Polytechnic University of Marche,&#xD;
      with delivery within the day or refrigerated for a maximum of 4 days before transport from&#xD;
      GSS premises to the analysis laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions There are currently no adverse reactions associated with taking FENOXIDOL™&#xD;
      as a dietary supplement. However, in this study, all adverse reactions reported spontaneously&#xD;
      by the patient or detected by the investigator will be reported on the Case Report Form&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS The procedures in the study regarding conduct, conduct and&#xD;
      documentation have been prepared to ensure compliance with the ethical principles set out in&#xD;
      the Helsinki Declaration and its revisions. The design of the research also included&#xD;
