    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some men who have been treated for localized prostate cancer with surgery or radiation still&#xD;
      show signs of the disease in their blood. This is called biochemically recurrent prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Radium-223 is a small molecule. It uses radiation to kill cancer cells and improves&#xD;
      survival in advanced prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if it can treat prostate cancer&#xD;
      and induced immune changes earlier in the disease when the cancer is only detectable by&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how Radium-223 affects men with rising PSA but no evidence of cancer on conventional&#xD;
      CT or bone scan, but positive findings on PET or molecular imaging in the bones. The primary&#xD;
      focus is impact on the immune system with secondary focus on impact on PSA and imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer who have had surgery and/or radiation, but their&#xD;
      PSA is rising even though no disease is visible on routine imaging scans (CT or bone scans).&#xD;
      Patients are required to have PET or molecular imaging findings in bones, but not organs&#xD;
      (lymph nodes are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Their ability to do&#xD;
      normal tasks will be reviewed. They will give tissue samples or a report from their doctor&#xD;
      about their cancer. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have an electrocardiogram&#xD;
      to measure heart function. They will have a scan of their chest and abdomen using radiation&#xD;
      or magnetic resonance imaging. They will have a bone scan with injection of Tc99. They will&#xD;
      have a positron emission tomography scan with intravenous (IV) injection of 18F-NaF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get Radium-223 by IV. For this, a small plastic tube is put into an arm&#xD;
      vein. Radium-223 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle = 4 weeks) for up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Participants will repeat the screening tests during the study. They will also complete&#xD;
      Quality of Life Surveys and give stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will have long-term follow-up every 6 weeks for the rest of&#xD;
      their lives.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and surveillance are treatment options for prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients with biochemical progression after localized therapy with either definitive&#xD;
      radiation or surgery (biochemically recurrent prostate cancer). A primary goal in these&#xD;
      patients is to prevent morbidity from their cancer that results from disease progression and&#xD;
      metastatic disease on conventional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radium-223 has demonstrated the ability to improve survival in men with symptomatic&#xD;
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with a manageable toxicity profile,&#xD;
      particularly in patients who have not yet received docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation, even at low doses can impact immune recognition and immune cell killing of cancer&#xD;
      cells. Recent findings by the LTIB suggest that radium-223 potentiated T-cell killing of&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radium-223 may present an alternative option for patients with BRPC that is not associated&#xD;
      with substantial toxicity (as seen with ADT) and may have a lasting effect due to its&#xD;
      potential effect on the immune system and/or the bone microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging PET imaging studies will likely find evidence of micrometastatic disease, often in&#xD;
      the bones, in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients, although these patients will&#xD;
      have no standard of care that can be supported by prospective data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radium-223 has demonstrated the ability to improve survival in men with symptomatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer, but it remains unknown what the impact is in patients with micrometastatic or PET&#xD;
      positive prostate cancer in their bones&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data has suggested that radium-223 can impact the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, changes in PSA kinetics, changes on PET scan findings, and safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of radium-223 in this population will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine statistically significant changes in immune cell populations compared to&#xD;
      baseline in participants with biochemically recurrent or 18F NaF PET scan positive prostate&#xD;
      cancer treated with radium-223&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging showing positive findings on NaF PET, negative CT Scan and Tc-99m Bone Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detectable PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 6 injections of radium-223 with monthly assessments of PSA and&#xD;
      periodic immune response. NaF PET scans will be completed at screening then at 4 and 7 months&#xD;
      after the start of radium-223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment participant will be followed every 6 (+/- 2 weeks).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a detectable PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative CT scan/MRI and Tc99 bone scan for metastatic prostate cancer. (Only Tc99&#xD;
             will be used to detect bone lesions, CT/MRI would be used to detect soft tissue&#xD;
             lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of findings on PET scan (i.e., NaF PET scan) suspicious for metastatic&#xD;
             prostate cancer in bone. Note: while lymph node findings would be allowed and provide&#xD;
             the opportunity for the assessment of any abscopal effects, PET scan findings&#xD;
             suggesting visceral disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             available on the use of radium in participants &lt; 18 years of age; therefore, only&#xD;
             adults are included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects radium-223 on the developing human fetus are unknown but based on the&#xD;
             mechanism of action, radium-223 has the potential to cause fetal harm. For this&#xD;
             reason, men must agree to use condoms for the duration of study therapy and at least 6&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
        after the last treatment administration. Female partners of reproductive potential must use&#xD;
        a highly effective method of birth control during treatment and for 6 months after their&#xD;
        partner s last treatment administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
