      Carbapenem-resistant (CR) Gram negative bacteria (GNB) - which are resistant to carbapenems&#xD;
      (a last-line potent antibiotic with a high therapeutic index) - are also resistant to all&#xD;
      other beta-lactam antibiotics. Most CRGNB are also extensively-drug resistant (XDR)&#xD;
      (resistant to all classes of antibiotics except polymyxins and/or tigecycline) or pan-drug&#xD;
      resistant (PDR) (resistant to all antibiotics), resulting in a dearth of effective options&#xD;
      against these life-threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against CRGNB, standard therapy includes monotherapy (using polymyxins or tigecycline) or&#xD;
      unguided antibiotics combination (polymyxins + carbapenem). Unfortunately, CRGNB can develop&#xD;
      resistance after antibiotic monotherapy, resulting in the further development of pan-drug&#xD;
      resistance. Unguided antibiotic combinations, selected anecdotally based on past experience,&#xD;
      are also unlikely to be useful in our local setting, as effective antimicrobial combinations&#xD;
      are bacterial-strain specific due to large variation in molecular mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance.Hence, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of a novel treatment&#xD;
      strategy using in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT) to guide antibiotic&#xD;
      combinations in the management of patients with CRGNB infections in a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT).&#xD;

      The health problem - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in GNB and the dearth of therapeutic&#xD;
      options AMR, particularly in GNB infections (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae&#xD;
      and Acinetobacter baumannii), means resistance to multiple or even all available antibiotic&#xD;
      classes. The growing incidence of CRGNB and XDRGNB is an urgent global healthcare challenge&#xD;
      today. These pathogens are classified as &quot;priority 1&quot; (utmost critical) pathogens by the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO). Hsu et al from Singapore has published recently on the&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and&#xD;
      carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are the &quot;foundation&quot; of modern medicine, without which key medical procedures&#xD;
      including surgery and chemotherapy for cancer are rendered too dangerous to perform. With the&#xD;
      advent of CRGNB, effective antibiotic treatment strategies are now limited. Currently,&#xD;
      approximately 700,000 people die from resistant infections every year in the world. It is&#xD;
      estimated that by 2050, 10 million lives (1 in 3 The people) per year and a cumulative USD&#xD;
      $100 trillion of economic output are at risk due to drug resistant infections, if resistance&#xD;
      rates continue to rise unabated. Patel and co-workers observed mortality rates of 40-50% in&#xD;
      patients with bloodstream infections caused by CR Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most CRE infections&#xD;
      and the transmission of CRE are predominantly linked with healthcare exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination therapy - a current mainstay therapeutic option against CRGNB Given the current&#xD;
      resistance landscape, coupled with a continued dwindling pipeline of drugs to treat these&#xD;
      infections, physicians in Singapore now face a severe lack of effective antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapies to treat infections caused by CRGNB. While polymyxin B, an old antibiotic&#xD;
      previously forsaken due to an allegedly high rate of toxicities, has been resurrected for&#xD;
      such infections, the presence of polymyxin B heteroresistance limits its utility as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in severe or deep-seated infections. Currently, antibiotic combination therapy&#xD;
      has been adopted by most infectious diseases (ID) physicians locally, as the mainstay&#xD;
      treatment against CRGNB infections, because of the theoretical benefits conferred by&#xD;
      antibiotic combination therapy (e.g. synergism, prevention of development of resistance). In&#xD;
      addition, there is increasing clinical evidence suggesting that antibiotic combination&#xD;
      therapy may improve prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately to date, the mortality reduction associated with antibiotic combination therapy&#xD;
      in the treatment of CRGNB infections has not been consistently observed across all studies.&#xD;
      For example, in a prospective comparison of 55 patients treated for XDR A. baumannii&#xD;
      infections, the authors found that the combination of colistin + tigecycline resulted in&#xD;
      higher mortality than colistin + a carbapenem when the tigecycline minimum inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration (MIC) of the causative pathogen was &gt;2 mg/L (HR = 6.93, 95% CI 1.61-29.78; P=&#xD;
      0.009), suggesting that caution is needed when developing polymyxin combination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our local retrospective study, the Investigators have shown that when compared to&#xD;
      polymyxins monotherapy or unguided antibiotic combination therapy, the guided selection of a&#xD;
      rationally optimised antibiotic combinations was associated with significantly lower rates&#xD;
      (by 8 times) of infection-related mortality in patients with XDRGNB infections. In most&#xD;
      previous combination therapy studies in the clinical setting, the studies are typically&#xD;
      limited by small sample sizes and retrospective nature. To address the ambiguity surrounding&#xD;
      the use of polymyxin combinations, three large prospective RCTs are currently underway in&#xD;
      Europe and the USA (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT01732250, NCT0159797, NCT03159078)). In these&#xD;
      trials, a fixed combination (polymyxins + carbapenem) will be compared to a fixed type of&#xD;
      monotherapy (polymyxins alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular diversity and complexity in local CRGNB and the implications in antibiotic&#xD;
      combination selection Although the aforementioned overseas trials will attempt to address the&#xD;
      ambiguity surrounding the use of polymyxin combinations by comparing a fixed combination&#xD;
      (colistin + meropenem) to a single monotherapy, the findings of the trials will likely not be&#xD;
      generalizable to or applicable in many geographical areas in Asia, especially our local&#xD;
      setting, due to the diversity and complexity in the molecular mechanisms of resistance in our&#xD;
      local CRGNB strains. Therefore, additional clinical trials will be needed to assess synergy&#xD;
      between polymyxins and other agents for specific type pathogens. Such an approach to&#xD;
      determining effective antibiotic combinations will be too time-consuming and certainly not&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike countries in the United States and Europe, where a predominant K. pneumoniae clonal&#xD;
      (ST-258) and resistance type (KPC) is observed, there is greater diversity in Singapore. This&#xD;
      greatly complicates management strategies, including the selection of effective combinations&#xD;
      for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our local CRE is associated with a variety of resistance mechanisms (e.g. various&#xD;
      carbapenemases production in IMPs, KPCs, NDMs, OXA-48, OXA-181, OXA-232, and dual&#xD;
      carbapenemases production with/without porin down regulation). The local K. pneumoniae&#xD;
      appeared to be of highly varied sequence types (STs) (ST 11, 14, 15, 17, 29, 42, 48, 147,&#xD;
      163, 231, 237, 273, 437, 568, 841, and 885). In addition, the investigators have also&#xD;
      detected the presence of mcr-1 novel plasmid that confers resistance to the polymyxins in our&#xD;
      CRE isolates that are KPC- or NDM-producers in SGH. For CR A. baumannii, three clones (IC I,&#xD;
      IC II, and IC2 II, respectively) from the three outbreaks in 1996, 2001, and 2006 were&#xD;
      observed. While these clones harboured carbapenemase producing genes - blaOXA-64, blaOXA-66,&#xD;
      and blaOXA-51-like, respectively, blaIMP-4, ISAba1-blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-58-like have&#xD;
      also been described. For CR P. aeruginosa, our local isolates did not belong to any major&#xD;
      international clonal complexes such as ST111 and ST235. While carbapenemase production in CR&#xD;
      P. aeruginosa is less common, blaIMP and blaVIM have been described.&#xD;
      Non-carbapenemase-mediated mechanisms (veb-1 gene +/- efflux pumps +/- porin losses)&#xD;
      accounted for carbapenem resistance in local P. aeruginosa strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance, coupled with the interplay of multiple resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms in local CRGNB, impact on therapy selection decisions and presents as a huge&#xD;
      challenge to clinicians locally. The presence of porin mutations and varying levels of porin&#xD;
      expression further complicates the pathogen's responses to antibiotic therapy, including&#xD;
      combination therapy. For instance, one of the postulated synergy mechanisms is that membrane&#xD;
      permeabilisation mediated by polymyxins may enhance the access of carbapenems to their target&#xD;
      sites, hence reducing the chances of carbapenem hydrolysis by carbapenemases. This&#xD;
      synergistic activity may be diminished in the presence of decreased porin-related&#xD;
      permeability, and it is demonstrated that combinations of colistin-doripenem/ertapenem were&#xD;
      not synergistic and not bactericidal against isolates with low porin expression. Locally, the&#xD;
      investigators have also previously shown that, due to the variability of resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms and the interplay between multiple mechanisms, the types of effective&#xD;
      antimicrobial combination are bacterial strain-specific. Given the wide variety and&#xD;
      permutations of resistance mechanisms, effective antimicrobial combinations are highly&#xD;
      varied, and therefore strain-specific testing is required to guide selection of&#xD;
      strain-specific combinations in our local setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solving the health problem - Strain-specific combination therapy as a precision therapy&#xD;
      against CRGNB In view of the problem described above, the application of &quot;precision medicine&quot;&#xD;
      through individualised antimicrobial chemotherapy will be the crux in our combat against&#xD;
      CRGNB infections. Strain-specific antibiotics combination testing, in particular, should be&#xD;
      performed to guide selection of drugs for combined therapy for the following purposes: Rule&#xD;
      out antagonistic antibiotic combinations and ascertain the right and effective antibiotic&#xD;
      combination that is synergistic and bactericidal for a specific CRGNB. Currently, in a&#xD;
      routine hospital setting, the therapeutic selection for CRGNB is guided by in vitro&#xD;
      susceptibility testing (e.g. disk diffusion, Vitek 2), and at best coupled with the&#xD;
      determination of MICs (that may require an additional day for results to be available).&#xD;
      Currently, this constitutes standard care or best available therapy. However, such&#xD;
      traditional single- antibiotic susceptibility results have limited utility in the guiding the&#xD;
      selection of combination therapy against CRGNB, as MICs alone are not useful in the&#xD;
      prediction of synergistic/bactericidal effect and guide the selection of antibiotics&#xD;
      combination therapy, which is required in CRGNB infections where nearly all single&#xD;
      antibiotics are ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the clinical need in our local setting, a prospective in vitro antibiotic&#xD;
      combination testing (iACT), with a rapid turn-around time of less than 24 hours (to know an&#xD;
      antibiotics combination that is at least inhibitory), was developed to guide physicians in&#xD;
      managing patients with CRGNB/XDRGNB infections. The iACT and its workflow were developed at&#xD;
      the urgent request of our Infectious Diseases (ID) physicians, after extensive research about&#xD;
      the use of iACT for management of patients with CRGNB/XDRGNB infections. Antibiotic&#xD;
      combinations, that are shown to be at least inhibitory against the growth of pathogen, will&#xD;
      be made known to the requesting ID physician within 18-24 hours. After an additional 20&#xD;
      hours, the bactericidal antibiotics combination will be confirmed with the ID physician. The&#xD;
      objective of the iACT is to guide physicians in the selection of an individualised and&#xD;
      rationally optimised combination therapy, taking into account the in vitro combination&#xD;
      testing results of each strain and the patient's clinical and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      parameters. To date, the role and feasibility of the iACT, as well as the clinical utility of&#xD;
      the service, have been published in a number of retrospective studies. However, iACT is not&#xD;
      officially accepted to be used in routine practice in SGH, or anywhere else globally. SGH&#xD;
      Translational Medicine Office has recommended that strong evidence with high quality data&#xD;
      from prospective, randomised control trials is needed to change current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fully evaluate the clinical utility of iACT guided therapy, the Investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct an RCT comparing the therapy strategy incorporating iACT to guide selection of&#xD;
      antibiotic combinations with current standard therapy. The iACT RCT will overcome the&#xD;
      limitations that are inherent in retrospective studies and above-mentioned clinical trials&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT01732250, NCT01597973, NCT03159078) conducted overseas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the RCT design will minimise confounding and allocation bias between treatment arms.&#xD;
      Secondly, the use of our novel iACT platform will allow the strain-specific selection of&#xD;
      antibiotic combinations against each CRGNB strain in a timely manner, as opposed to using&#xD;
      only a single fixed combination in these trials (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT01732250,&#xD;
      NCT01597973, NCT03159078). Thirdly, through detailed workup of the presence of various&#xD;
      carbapenemases, efflux pumps, and porin loss detection, the Investigators will have detailed&#xD;
      description of the molecular mechanisms mediating carbapenem resistance. Such description of&#xD;
      the molecular mechanisms will document that our proposed guided therapy strategy is suitable&#xD;
      for more than one type of CRGNB infections with variety of resistance mechanisms, and capable&#xD;
      of combating against local and global molecular epidemiology of CRGNB infections,&#xD;
      strengthening the external validity and applicability of this novel therapy strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing new knowledge with scientific and clinical applications Currently, CRGNB are&#xD;
      listed as the utmost critical pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO), for which new&#xD;
      and effective treatment strategies against CRGNB is urgently needed. Once completed, our&#xD;
      study would represent the first randomised controlled trial that examines the utility of&#xD;
      strain-specific antibiotic combination testing in the treatment of CRGNB infections. If our&#xD;
      hypothesis is proven, this guided therapy strategy can change current practice paradigms in&#xD;
      the treatment of CRGNB both locally and internationally, and provide a novel solution to the&#xD;
      management of CRGNB infections. Given the heterogeneity of patients with CRGNB infections,&#xD;
      our proposed RCT unequivocally addresses the challenges in treating CRGNB infection in ways&#xD;
      that is otherwise not possible (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov IDs NCT01732250, NCT01597973,&#xD;
      NCT03159078). Through the description of the molecular epidemiology of CRGNB infections in&#xD;
      our study, the Investigators will provide new insight into the complicated resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms common in our local CRGNB strains. The investigators anticipate that the findings&#xD;
      of this study will drive further research, particularly translational research, to further&#xD;
      enrich knowledge, and improve management, of CRGNB infections.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators plan to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate a new treatment strategy for CRGNB infections, termed guided antibiotic combination therapy, using the most effective (synergistic and bactericidal) antibiotic combination indicated by iACT. It is an investigator-initiated, two-site, two-arm, open-label, RCT.&#xD;
The randomisation will be stratified for the 2 hospitals. At each site, treatments will be randomly assigned to study subjects in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated, permuted-block randomisation schedule with a random block size known only to the study biostatistician.
