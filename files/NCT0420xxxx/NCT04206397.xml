  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares how different types of touch found in massage therapies impact pain&#xD;
      perception, and whether these effects differ in individuals with and without chronic pain.&#xD;
      This study also examines psychological factors that may predict differences in touch&#xD;
      perception in individuals with chronic pain. This research will improve our understanding of&#xD;
      whether and how massage therapies can benefit pain and health, and whether this differs in&#xD;
      people who suffer from chronic pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Chronic pain levels using the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure chronic pain levels using the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire. This measure will be included in a linear regression model to determine whether this measure significantly predicts differences in ratings of touch pleasantness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trauma history using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure trauma history using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. This measure will be included in a linear regression model to determine whether this measure significantly predicts differences in ratings of touch pleasantness.</description>

    <measure>Current depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale without chronic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure current depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. This measure will be included in a linear regression model to determine whether this measure significantly predicts differences in ratings of touch pleasantness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings of affective touch</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Touch pleasant/unpleasantness ratings will be assessed in response to each sensory stimulus (brushing, tapping, and pressure) using a Visual Analog Scale with anchors of &quot;no pleasantness&quot; to &quot;most pleasant imaginable.&quot; Affective touch perception is the difference in ratings between the affective and neutral touch conditions during the baseline testing session and will be compared between individuals with and without chronic pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings of Heat Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured during the baseline and post-tests in the affective-Conditioned Pain Modulation blocks. Pain intensity will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale with anchors from &quot;no pain &quot; to &quot;most intense pain imaginable.&quot; VAS pain ratings will be compared before the cold water bath.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings of Heat Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured during the baseline and post-tests in the affective-Conditioned Pain Modulation blocks. Pain intensity will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale with anchors from &quot;no pain &quot; to &quot;most intense pain imaginable.&quot; VAS pain ratings will be compared before and after blocks of affective touch stimuli .</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings of Heat Pain Unpleasantness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pain unpleasantness will be measured during the baseline and post-tests in the affective-Conditioned Pain Modulation blocks. Pain intensity will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale with anchors from &quot;no unpleasantness&quot; to &quot;most unpleasant pain imaginable.&quot; VAS pain ratings will be compared before and after the cold water bath.</description>

Pain intensity will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale with anchors from &quot;no unpleasantness&quot; to &quot;most unpleasant pain imaginable.&quot; VAS pain ratings will be compared before and after blocks of affective touch stimuli.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breathing rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Respiration rate will be measured during the baseline and during the affective touch and pain trials.</description>
