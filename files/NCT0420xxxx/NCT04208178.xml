  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two parts multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      Phase III study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alpelisib compared to alpelisib&#xD;
      matching-placebo in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer whose tumor harbors a PIK3CA mutation&#xD;
      following induction therapy with a taxane in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.&#xD;
      Part 1 is the open-label, safety run-in part of the study, designed to confirm the&#xD;
      recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D) dose of alpelisib in combination with trastuzumab and&#xD;
      pertuzumab. Following Part 1, Part 2 will be initiated, which is the randomized, Phase III&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;

             cardiac events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM)&#xD;
