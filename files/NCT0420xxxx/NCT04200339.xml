  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of three substance use&#xD;
      screening instruments (S2BI, BSTAD, and TAPS Tool) against a criterion standard of Diagnostic&#xD;
      Statistical Manual - 5 (DSM-5) substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses in an adolescent&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the psychometric properties of three substance use screening and&#xD;
      brief assessment tools for adolescents against criterion standard of Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) substance use disorder&#xD;
      diagnoses in a population of adolescents who receives care at a participating primary care&#xD;
      practice; or, for an initial evaluation at a substance use disorders program for youth. The&#xD;
      three tools to be tested are the Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs (BSTAD);&#xD;
      Screening to Brief Intervention (S2BI) screening tool; and the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription&#xD;
      medications, and other Substance (TAPS) Tool. BSTAD and S2BI were developed specifically for&#xD;
      use with adolescents and each has been validated in a single trial. These tools use past-year&#xD;
      &quot;frequency of use&quot; questions to determine risk level for a substance use disorder. The TAPS&#xD;
      tool includes both screening and brief assessments and while it has been studied more&#xD;
      extensively in adult primary care patients, its validity with adolescents is not known. For&#xD;
      youth, alcohol, marijuana and tobacco use, and particularly early initiation, are associated&#xD;
      with greater risk of substance use disorders, use of illicit drugs, misuse of opioids, and&#xD;
      opioid use disorders. Thus, identifying and addressing substance use early is an important&#xD;
      form of prevention that can be delivered in medical care settings for this age group.&#xD;

    <description>The focus of this study is to evaluate the performance of each tool (S2BI, BSTAD, and TAPS Tool) in identifying substance use and substance use disorders at previously identified cut points for alcohol, marijuana and tobacco/nicotine for each tool. The properties that will be evaluated include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-)</description>

        Recruitment and study procedures may occur either in-person or remotely. We will recruit&#xD;
        participants to enroll in the study from participating health care sites. These will&#xD;
        include 1) an outpatient adolescent substance use disorders program at a pediatric hospital&#xD;
        (ASAP, Boston Children's Hospital), 2) the adolescent medicine program at a federally&#xD;
        qualified health center (FQHC) in Boston (Martha Elliot Health Center (MEHC), Boston&#xD;
        Children's Hospital), and 3) community-based primary care pediatrics practices that&#xD;
        participate in the Pediatric Physicians' Organization at Children's (PPOC). The FQHC is&#xD;
        considered a primary care sites participating in this study.&#xD;
