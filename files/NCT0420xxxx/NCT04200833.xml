      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitis is a potentially blinding complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).&#xD;
      Treatment remains a substantial challenge, even though the use of tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF)-α-antagonists has improved visual outcomes substantially. Among these agents,&#xD;
      adalimumab has been recently approved for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis and is thus&#xD;
      the first biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) approved for JIA-associated&#xD;
      uveitis. However, some patients do not respond sufficiently or lose response over time. In&#xD;
      these cases switching to another biologic DMARD is recommended. Recently golimumab, a fully&#xD;
      humanized anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy in a small case series,&#xD;
      leading to uveitis inactivity in 4 of 7 patients Golimumab is approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      polyarticular JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with JIA-associated uveitis failing treatment with adalimumab benefit from the&#xD;
      treatment with golimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and patient recruitment (retrospectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective single-center study in patients with JIA-associated active uveitis at the&#xD;
      Medical University of Graz/Austria, in whom golimumab was started after failure of standard&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppressive drugs and adalimumab. All patients that have started golimumab&#xD;
      from March 2010 are included in the study. Uveitis is defined and anatomically classified&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working&#xD;
      Group. Primary failure to adalimumab was diagnosed in patients without change in the SUN&#xD;
      score and an entry grade of 3 or higher or with worsening activity, defined as either a&#xD;
      two-grade increase in inflammation or an increase to grade 4. With bilateral disease, the eye&#xD;
      with the higher grade of uveitis was analysed. Relapse of uveitis was defined as active&#xD;
      inflammation after an inactivity for at least 3 months. Loss of response was defined as&#xD;
      failure to improve under continued treatment with adalimumab despite intermitting&#xD;
      intensifying concomitant therapy, such as local or systemic steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Golimumab treatment was administered in the standard dose of 50 mg sc every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with a weight of at least 40 kg. Previous therapy with a conventional DMARD such as&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX) was continued, if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures of uveitis include the reduction in grade of intraocular inflammation,&#xD;
      the best-corrected visual acuity, eye soreness, redness of eyes, light sensitivity and the&#xD;
      steroid sparing potential. Response to treatment is classified as complete, partial or no&#xD;
      response. Complete response constitute achieving inactive uveitis, defined as &lt;0.5 cell per&#xD;
      field in the anterior chamber or posterior segment (grade 0) and absence of vitreous haze and&#xD;
      macular edema. Partial response is diagnosed in patients with improved uveitis, defined as&#xD;
      decrease of one grade in the level of inflammation, without a decrease to grade 0 in the&#xD;
      anterior chamber (AC) and posterior segment. Primary failure, relapse and loss of response to&#xD;
      golimumab is defined in the same way as for adalimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving Golimumab were evaluated clinically and immunologically at regular&#xD;
      intervals. At each visit the laboratory analysis included complete blood cell counts, levels&#xD;
      of creatinine, hepatobiliary-injury biomarkers, and C-reactive protein. Side effects were&#xD;
      assessed by patient's reported history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Continuous variables will be analyzed by Student's t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations will be analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation test.&#xD;
      Binary variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was&#xD;
      defined as p&lt;0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V.6.0&#xD;
      (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).&#xD;
