      this study evaluates the effects of therapeutic exercises on kinesiophobia and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life in adult haemophilia patients. half of participants will receive therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises and verbal information about the positive effects of therapeutic exercises on&#xD;
      physical pathologies due to hemophilic arthropathy while the other half will receive only&#xD;
      verbal information.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      in haemophilia patients recurrent musculoskeletal hemorrhage cause to arthropathy&#xD;
      characterized by severe degeneration of joint cartilage and bones. arthropathy leads to&#xD;
      decrease in the patient's health related quality of life. furthermore pain, risk of injury&#xD;
      and lack of motivation lead to decreased physical activity and development of kinesiophobia.&#xD;
