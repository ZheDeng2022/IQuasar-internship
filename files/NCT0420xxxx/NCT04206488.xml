        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             Electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory test results, including serum chemistry, blood&#xD;
             coagulation, hematology, and urinalysis performed at screening. If there are&#xD;
             abnormalities, the investigator may decide that the abnormalities or deviations from&#xD;
             normal are not clinically significant, in which case the participant may be included.&#xD;
             This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and&#xD;
             initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal renal function at screening as evidenced by an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (eGFR) of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 milliliter per minute (mL/min) per&#xD;
             1.73 meter square (m^2) calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology&#xD;
             Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta human chorionic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, sinus node disease, or incomplete&#xD;
             atrioventricular (AV) block or a family history of prolonged QT interval syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive blood screen for hepatitis C virus antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (HBsAg), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal&#xD;
             supplements), except for oral contraceptives, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Received an experimental drug/placebo or used an experimental medical device within 3&#xD;
             months or within a period less than 5 times the drug's half-life (whichever is longer)&#xD;
