    <textblock>
      The low back pain is a leading cause to limit individual functional activities worldwide and&#xD;
      60%-80% of adults are probable to get low back pain at least once in life time. Whereas, the&#xD;
      chronic low back pain prevalence is 10%.The current literature suggests that any exercise is&#xD;
      beneficial for reducing chronic nonspecific low back pain. This limits evidence regarding&#xD;
      superiority of specific exercise for low back pain treatment. Therefore, a randomized control&#xD;
      trial will be conducted at department of physiotherapy to assess which treatment is more&#xD;
      effective in chronic low back pain at department of physiotherapy, institute of physical&#xD;
      medicine and rehabilitation, Dow University of Health Sciences after synopsis approval.&#xD;
      Overall 150 participants with 18-40 years old having chronic low back pain will be eligible&#xD;
      and they will be included through non-probability, purposive sampling technique. The written&#xD;
      informed consent will be taken from all the participants. They will be divided through&#xD;
      systematic random sampling method into two groups, 75 in each group. Group A (experimental&#xD;
      group) will receive Bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and group B (control&#xD;
      group) will receive Swiss ball exercises. All participants will be assessed using assessment&#xD;
      form. Pain and functional disability will be measured by subjective outcome tools, visual&#xD;
      analogue scale with 0-10cm and Oswestry disability index , respectively. Range of movement of&#xD;
      lumbar and multifidus muscle activity will be measured by objective outcome tool,&#xD;
      modified-modified Schober's test and surface electromyography, respectively. The pre &amp; post&#xD;
      treatment outcomes will be collected and recorded. Treatment sessions will be given thrice a&#xD;
      week for 5 weeks. A maximum drop-out rate of 20% is expected. The Mean ± SD will be&#xD;
      calculated for quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. The recorded outcome variables before and after the five weeks of treatment will&#xD;
      be compared and analysed. The p-value of 0.05 will be considered as level of significant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, Low back pain (LBP) is the commonest musculoskeletal pain, for which participants&#xD;
      consult general practitioners. It is defined as &quot;pain and discomfort, localized below the&#xD;
      costal margin and above the inferior gluteal fold, with or without referred leg pain&quot;. The&#xD;
      LBP with specific causes are rare (&lt;15%). Whereas, majority (&gt;80%) of LBP cases are&#xD;
      non-specific LBP (NSLBP). The traditional temporal categorization comprises as acute LBP (&lt;6&#xD;
      weeks), sub-acute LBP (≤12 weeks) or chronic LBP (&gt;12 weeks). It is based on the duration of&#xD;
      the current episode. The LBP is experienced in 60% to 80% of adults at some point in&#xD;
      lifetime. There is 15% annual worldwide incidence rate of LBP and 30% point prevalence. LBP&#xD;
      is one of the five leading causes of YLDS that contributes 57•6 million. The estimation&#xD;
      suggests 5% to 10% of LBP cases will develop chronic. This chronicity is responsible for high&#xD;
      treatment expenses, sick leave, and different sufferings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence based guidelines for LBP diagnosis suggest to first rule out any underlying&#xD;
      pathology (spinal infection, cancer and fracture of spine and cauda equina syndrome). The LBP&#xD;
      without any specific pathology is labelled as NSLBP. The routine use of radiologic imaging is&#xD;
      not warranted based on clinical guidelines until presence of specific pathology. The goal of&#xD;
      LBP treatment includes pain relief, function improvement, reduced work leave of absence, and&#xD;
      chronicity prevention. The analgesics (topic or oral), exercise, manual therapy, traction,&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), back supports, acupuncture, biofeedback,&#xD;
      spinal injections, and lastly, surgery may include in treatment options.Among exercise&#xD;
      interventions the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) exercise approach is&#xD;
      designed to stimulate proprioceptors in order to enhance neuromuscular mechanism responses.&#xD;
      The extremity patterns of PNF have diagonal direction with combination of movements, and&#xD;
      these patterns are performed in line with the topographic arrangement of the muscles being&#xD;
      used. Therefore, these exercises are thought to be suitable for muscles training&#xD;
      anatomical-plane or anatomical-direction training programs. Moreover, PNF often have been&#xD;
      used to improve the range of movement (ROM) and endurance. Various techniques of PNF training&#xD;
      are used like rhythmic initiation, rhythmic stabilization, reversal of agonists, and reversal&#xD;
      of antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the existing literature there is little direction with mixed evidence to physiotherapists&#xD;
      that what intervention is more beneficial to apply for CLPB. According to author's knowledge,&#xD;
      the base to rely on PNF techniques needs evidence related to PNF patterns specification, that&#xD;
      which lower limb PNF pattern is more effective. A randomized clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to explore the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical lower limb PNF patterns in flexion and in&#xD;
      extension on multifidus in CLBP to evaluate and stabilize evidence based physical therapy&#xD;
      practice in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the effects of limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss ball exercises on&#xD;
           multifidus motor activity, lumbar ROM, pain and functional disability in CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the frequencies and statistical association of age, gender, body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI) and occupation among participants in CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the statistical association among multifidus motor activity, lumbar ROM,&#xD;
           pain and functional disability of participants with CLBP before and after the exercise&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. T determine the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss&#xD;
           ball exercises in participants with CLBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the effects of bilateral, asymmetrical limbs PNF pattern exercises and Swiss&#xD;
           ball exercises in participants with CLBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Null hypothesis: There is no difference between effects of bilateral asymmetrical limbs&#xD;
           proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and Swiss ball exercises on multifidus muscle&#xD;
           in chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alternate Hypothesis: The effects of bilateral asymmetrical limbs proprioceptive&#xD;
           neuromuscular facilitations are more beneficial than Swiss ball exercises on multifidus&#xD;
           muscle in chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: The research design will be randomize control trial (RCT), experimental&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique: Non probability purposive sampling technique will be used. Sample size:&#xD;
      Initially, a sample size of 54 human subjects was calculated through open epi software with&#xD;
      95% Confidence Interval and 80% power of test with post-test VAS mean (2.1) and standard&#xD;
      deviation (0.85), in experimental group and post-test VAS mean (1.5) and standard deviation&#xD;
      (0.69) in control group. Due to small sample size, it is increased to 150 with drop rate of&#xD;
      20%. The 75 participants per group will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy department, Institute of physical medicine and rehabilitation (IPM&amp;R), Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences (DUHS), Chand Bibi road, Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking consent, the objectives of study will be told to all participants.The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. All the participants will be&#xD;
      assessed with outcome measures before after 5 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions protocol: (half hour session, thrice a week for 5 weeks). Group A (experimental&#xD;
      group) will receive, PNF rhythmic initiation with bilateral asymmetrical upper and lower limb&#xD;
      pattern,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant in supine position (on the back) with left arm in&#xD;
           extension-adduction-internal rotation with right hand gripping his left wrist with right&#xD;
           arm in modified extension-abduction-internal rotation. Neck will be in flexion looking&#xD;
           at left hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapist distal hand (hand away from head of the participant) will grip wrist of&#xD;
           participant's left hand and the proximal hand (hand near to head of the participant)&#xD;
           will be on top of the participant's head with fingers pointing towards the left side of&#xD;
           participant neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be asked to lift left arms and push the head back through the pattern&#xD;
           of flexion -abduction-external rotation and neck in extension to the left in opposition&#xD;
           of therapist hand resistance. At the end range of motion extensor muscles of back will&#xD;
           start to contract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, participant will be asked to reverse the movement pattern to&#xD;
           extension-adduction-internal rotation and neck flexion to right against the therapist&#xD;
           resisting hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be repeated on other side of participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then for lower limbs, participant's left leg will be in extension-abduction-internal&#xD;
           rotation and right leg in extension-adduction-external rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapist will grasp the lateral and dorsal surfaces of both feet with distal hand.&#xD;
           Proximal arm will be placed underneath the participant's thighs to hold them together.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then participant will be asked to lift both feet up, bend legs up and away towards right&#xD;
           shoulder against therapist resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The right leg will go into flexion-abduction-internal rotation, the left leg into&#xD;
           flexion-adduction-external rotation. At the end of range, the motion continues as lower&#xD;
           trunk flexion with rotation and side-bending to the right.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After that, participant will asked to reverse the left leg into&#xD;
           extension-abduction-internal rotation and right leg in extension-adduction-external&#xD;
           rotation against resistance. At end of range, the motion will carry on as trunk&#xD;
           extension and elongation to the left with left rotation and side trunk flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be repeated on other side of participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 repetition and 3 sets for each side, 20 second rest between two sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (control group) will receive Swiss ball exercises :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Supine position: A ball will be placed under participant neck, and will be asked to bend&#xD;
           hip and knee up to 90°. 5 times, 10 seconds hold&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supine position: With a ball below the pelvis, knees bent, the ball press will be done&#xD;
           with pelvis. 5 times, for 10 seconds hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Crawling position: With a ball below one knee while keeping toes away from contact with&#xD;
           the floor, the participant will balance first to stabilize the posture and slowly raise&#xD;
           the other lower limb. This exercise will be performed in turn for the two lower limbs 10&#xD;
           times, with 10 seconds hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prone position: Participant will place a ball in front of pelvis and will repeatedly&#xD;
           raise and lowered the two lower limbs alternately. There will be 10 repetitions, with 5&#xD;
           sets, taking 15 seconds rest between each set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical package for the social sciences 21 version will be used for data analyzing.&#xD;
      The mean and standard deviation will be calculated for quantitative variables like age. The&#xD;
      qualitative variables will be shown through calculated frequencies and percentages. The&#xD;
      outcome results of the study (decrease pain intensity, improve functional disability, improve&#xD;
      range of movement and improve multifidus activity) taken before and after the treatment will&#xD;
      be compared and analysed. The p-value of 0.05 will be considered as level of significant.&#xD;
