      In many cancers, early stage diagnosis and early treatment offers the best chance of a&#xD;
      prolonged recurrence free- and overall survival. In stage III/IV resectable melanoma, an&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New therapeutic strategies for melanoma come as a result of significant advances in the&#xD;
      understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms and molecular biology. The resulting new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies include oncogene-targeted therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, and&#xD;
      these are now approved therapies that have transformed the routine clinical management for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease. However, most patients with advanced melanoma still die of&#xD;
      their disease, and thus, there remains an urgent need to improve upon current therapies. Most&#xD;
      patients with advanced disease eventually progress, and the question as to whether earlier&#xD;
      treatment with systemic therapy after resection of all macroscopic melanoma (adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy) improves long term survival is under investigation in melanoma and other solid&#xD;
      malignancies. Furthermore, with the increased number of therapies utilised in melanoma, the&#xD;
      question of optimal sequencing and selection of single or combination therapy remains&#xD;
      unanswered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant clinical trials in patients with resectable but bulky stage III/IV melanoma&#xD;
      allows for the rapid evaluation of drug activity in humans utilising multiple clinical&#xD;
      endpoints (metabolic response with Positron Emission Tomography [PET], clinical response with&#xD;
      Computed Tomography [CT] imaging, pathological response, relapse-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival) and translational endpoints (morphological, genetic and immunophenotyping of tumour&#xD;
      and blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will test the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib as neoadjuvant and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for twenty adult patients with histologically confirmed&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 measurable and resectable AJCC (8th edition) Stage IIIB, IIIC or IIID cutaneous or&#xD;
      unknown primary melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune&#xD;
      control. Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody with high&#xD;
      specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 receptor, thus inhibiting its&#xD;
      interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 and programmed cell death ligand 2.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications&#xD;
      because of its mechanism of action to bind the PD-1 receptor on the T cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a pre-existing vascular network, is&#xD;
      essential for tumour growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its&#xD;
      receptors play a major role in tumour angiogenesis. Lenvatinib is an oral potent multiple RTK&#xD;
      inhibitor that selectively inhibits VEGF receptors. In clinical use, lenvatinib is one of the&#xD;
      only inhibitors currently labelled with a mechanism of action as an inhibitor of not only&#xD;
      VEGFRs but also fibroblast growth factor receptors, both of which are currently believed to&#xD;
      very important for tumour angiogenesis. Tumour blood vessels are abnormal, both structurally&#xD;
      and functionally, relative to those of non-malignant tissues. Normalizing the tumour&#xD;
      vasculature with antiangiogenic agents could potentially be used to improve the effectiveness&#xD;
      of immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade. The evidence indicates that the&#xD;
      potential benefit of such combinations will be manifested though modulation of both the&#xD;
      tumour vasculature and the tumour immune microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of combination therapy of lenvatinib and an anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab&#xD;
      is ongoing for various solid tumours. In addition to efficacy and safety endpoints, testing&#xD;
      this combination in the neoadjuvant setting provides a valuable opportunity to investigate&#xD;
      potential biomarkers and mechanisms of responsiveness, resistance, toxicity and relapse.&#xD;
      Limiting the combination of drugs to the neoadjuvant period only, limits the toxicity that&#xD;
      may be experienced by patients whilst maintaining an effective treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many cancers, early stage diagnosis and early treatment offers the best chance of a&#xD;
      prolonged recurrence free- and overall survival. In stage III/IV resectable melanoma, an&#xD;
      opportunity exists to improve outcomes with the addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic&#xD;
      therapy as an adjunct to surgery. Neoadjuvant clinical trials for resectable but bulky stage&#xD;
      III/IV melanoma allows for the efficient and rapid evaluation of drug activity in humans&#xD;
      utilising multiple clinical endpoints of metabolic, radiological and pathological response;&#xD;
      relapse-free survival; overall survival. Recent clinical trials of neoadjuvant ipilimumab&#xD;
      combined with nivolumab (OPACIN-NEO) and neoadjuvant dabrafenib combined with trametinib&#xD;
      (NeoCombi) in resectable stage III melanoma showed that a pathological response (&lt; 50% viable&#xD;
      tumour at tumour bed in the former trial, and complete response in the latter) was associated&#xD;
      with a longer relapse-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study design is therefore based on the hypothesis that six weeks of&#xD;
      combined pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may be sufficient to induce an enhanced tumoral&#xD;
      immunity to result in a higher pathological and clinical response at the time of definitive&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and translational findings from this study have the potential to inform rational&#xD;
      decisions regarding combinations of treatment both in the metastatic and the adjuvant&#xD;
      settings. This is a critical study to inform future practice and future phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trials. The neoadjuvant design provides an important opportunity to address critical&#xD;
      translational endpoints from multiple blood draws and tissue biopsies during treatment. From&#xD;
      this, the evaluation of potential biomarkers and mechanisms of responsiveness, resistance,&#xD;
      toxicity and relapse is possible, beyond the traditional clinical, pathological and&#xD;
      radiological parameters. Baseline and serial blood, and tissue samples will be analysed at&#xD;
      MIA translational research facilities. The biomarker component of this study will require&#xD;
      blood samples and core biopsies of tumour tissue at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (PRE) Week 1 (EDT 1) Week 6 - complete lymph node dissection specimen (POST) At&#xD;
      Relapse (RELAPSE) if applicable and available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant treatment will be administered for 6 weeks, followed by complete resection of&#xD;
      tumour to no evidence of disease. Surveillance of disease during the 6 week neoadjuvant&#xD;
      period will be undertaken with surgical assessments and with ultrasounds of the affected&#xD;
      lymph node basin. Surgery is followed by 46 weeks of pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy or until&#xD;
      disease relapse, death, intolerable adverse drug reactions or by withdrawal of patient&#xD;
      consent. After 52 weeks of the study treatment phase, patients will be followed 3 monthly for&#xD;
      relapse (and progression, following relapse) and survival for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy endpoints for this study have been used across the International Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      Melanoma Consortium.&#xD;
