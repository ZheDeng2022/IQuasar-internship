  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) trial have proven the effectiveness of intraarterial&#xD;
      revascularization in patients with larger cerebral artery occlusion. The success rate of EVT&#xD;
      is close to 80%, but only 50% of patients improve to independent functional outcome.&#xD;
      Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed to reduce the futile revascularization.&#xD;
      However, updated guidelines recommend the indications for EVT based on the results of&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials (RCT), management of post-revascularization is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines suggest that systolic blood pressure should be adjusted below 180 mmHg and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure below 105 mmHg in patients undergoing intraarterial reopening.&#xD;
      However, in the case of successful recanalization by EVT, same guideline is adopted even&#xD;
      though the possibility of intracerebral hemorrhage or reperfusion injury by high blood&#xD;
      pressure. On the other hand, too low blood pressure can worsen cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will compare the effectiveness of active blood pressure control group&#xD;
      (with less than 140 mmHg systolic blood pressure) versus standard blood pressure control&#xD;
      group (with less than 180 mmHg systolic blood pressure) during the first 24 hours in patients&#xD;
      who underwent EVT and achieved successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3). The goal is to reach&#xD;
      the target blood pressure within 60 minutes of randomization.&#xD;

      1. The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded&#xD;
           end-point assessment (PROBE) design study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After successful revascularization, the active blood pressure control group and the&#xD;
           standard blood pressure control group will be randomized by 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who is admitted to the Department of Neurology at the participating hospital&#xD;
           with acute cerebral infarction will will be included for 5 years from December 2019 to&#xD;
           December 2023 (based on the date of stroke). Patients who have undergone intraarterial&#xD;
           thrombectomy and have successfully reopened arteries should be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collect medical history, laboratory findings and blood pressure parameters (systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure variability, etc.),&#xD;
           neurological scores, functional recovery, and quality of life indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neurological scores, functional recovery scores, and quality of life indicators are&#xD;
           performed by independent researchers in the blind state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All data is collected using e-CRF, and the image study will be anonymized and sent to&#xD;
           the central adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Central adjudication will review the image study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. One intermediate analysis will be conducted at the end of first period or when a half of&#xD;
           study patients were enrolled.&#xD;
