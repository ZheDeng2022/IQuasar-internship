      This multi-center randomized control trial (RCT) will compare efficacy and safety endpoints&#xD;
      using the insulin-only configuration of the iLet Bionic Pancreas (BP) System versus Usual&#xD;
      Care (UC) during a 13-week study period. Participants may be enrolled initially into a&#xD;
      screening protocol and then transfer into the RCT protocol, or they may enter directly into&#xD;
      the RCT protocol. The RCT will be followed by an Extension Phase in which the RCT Usual Care&#xD;
      (UC) Group will use the insulin-only configuration of the iLet Bionic Pancreas System for 3&#xD;
      months. At the completion of use of the BP system in the RCT only, participants will enter a&#xD;
      2-4 day Transition Phase and be randomly assigned to either transition back to their usual&#xD;
      mode of therapy (MDI or pump therapy) based on therapeutic guidance from the iLet BP System&#xD;
      or transition back to their usual mode of therapy based on what their own insulin regimens&#xD;
      were prior to enrolling in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional ancillary study to assess the safety of utilizing blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements instead of CGM measurements as input into the iLet for ~48-60 hours. The Study&#xD;
      is intended to mirror a real-world situation where CGM may not be available for an extended&#xD;
      period of time (eg, user runs out of sensors and is awaiting new shipment).&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the efficacy and safety of the insulin-only configuration of the iLet BP System&#xD;
      (using insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and Fiasp [adults only]) in maintaining near-normal&#xD;
      glycemia relative to usual care in a home-use study in adults and children with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives • To assess the impact of the insulin-only configuration of the iLet BP&#xD;
      System on quality of life and treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four major parts: (1) the Test-Run Phase, (2) the RCT Period, (3) the Extension&#xD;
      Phase for the UC Arm, and (4) the Transition Phase. These four parts are described below, and&#xD;
      detailed in the main part of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Test-Run Phase will be conducted to (1) test the functionality of all aspects of the iLet&#xD;
      BP System, (2) train the clinical staff on the execution of the clinical protocol, and (3)&#xD;
      provide hands-on training with the device prior to initiating the RCT Period. The initial&#xD;
      test run will be conducted at one site (MGH) with ~5 participants using the iLet BP system&#xD;
      for 4-7 days. If there are no safety or consequential device issues, a test run will be&#xD;
      conducted at each of the other 15 sites, with ~2 participants per site using the iLet BP&#xD;
      system for 4-7 days. The iLet BP system will use insulin lispro or insulin aspart. Results of&#xD;
      this Test-Run Phase will be evaluated for safety prior to beginning the RCT Period as&#xD;
      described in section 3.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 13-week, parallel-group, multi-center RCT Period is designed to compare the insulin-only&#xD;
      iLet BP Group using insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or Fiasp (adults only); and a control&#xD;
      group following usual care (UC Group). Upon completion of the RCT Period, the BP Group will&#xD;
      enter the 2-4 day Transition Phase and the UC Group will enter the Extension Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UC Group Extension Phase will immediately follow the RCT Period. Participants from the UC&#xD;
      Group who complete the primary outcome visit, miss no more than 3 of the maximum possible&#xD;
      number of the weekly questionnaires, attend all clinic visits, and follow study procedures&#xD;
      for collecting CGM data during the RCT Period, will be given the option to use the iLet BP&#xD;
      system for 13 weeks. The visit schedule and procedures for the Extension Phase will be&#xD;
      similar to that of the BP Group in the RCT Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2-4 day Transition Phase will be conducted for all participants who complete BP use at the&#xD;
      end of the RCT Period (BP Group). Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either&#xD;
      transition back to their usual mode of therapy (MDI or pump therapy) based on therapeutic&#xD;
      guidance from the iLet BP system or transition back to their usual mode of therapy based on&#xD;
      what their own insulin regimens were prior to enrolling in the RCT Period. For those&#xD;
      randomized to using their pre-study regimens, the dosing can be adjusted by the investigator&#xD;
      to mitigate safety issues but should follow pre-study regimen as closely as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional ancillary study will be offered to participants who are using the iLet at the&#xD;
      time of the 13-week randomized trial visit. This will will assess the safety of utilizing&#xD;
      blood glucose measurements instead of CGM measurements as input into the iLet for ~48-60&#xD;
      hours. It will be completed at the end of the RCT for those in the BP Group prior to the&#xD;
      Transition Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-Run Visit and Phone Contact Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Visit - Eligibility assessed, informed consent, point-of-care/local HbA1c,&#xD;
           testing and procedures similar to the RCT Screening Visit including psychosocial&#xD;
           questionnaires; if eligible, BP system started.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o For participants who completed the separate screening protocol, eligibility will be&#xD;
           reassessed. Point-of-care/local HbA1c will be obtained if more than 28 days have&#xD;
           elapsed. Participants will not need to repeat the psychosocial questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone contact after 1-2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shut-down visit at the end of the study period 4-7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT Period Visit and Phone Contact Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Visit (which may be completed as part of a separate screening protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligibility assessed, informed consent signed, point-of-care/local HbA1c,&#xD;
                psychosocial questionnaires completed, blinded Dexcom G6 CGM sensor placed for non&#xD;
                Dexcom G6 users.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For baseline data collection, participants using a personal Dexcom G6 who have&#xD;
                     at least 85% of possible glucose data in last 14 days can skip the blinded CGM&#xD;
                     wear&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Participants using a personal Dexcom G6 with &lt;85% of data will use their&#xD;
                     personal Dexcom G6.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For participants who completed the separate screening protocol, eligibility&#xD;
                     will be reassessed. Point-of-care/local HbA1c will be obtained if more than 28&#xD;
                     days have elapsed. Participants will not need to repeat the psychosocial&#xD;
                     questionnaires or blinded CGM wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the separate screening protocol or Test Run Phase of this protocol was completed or&#xD;
           blinded CGM wear is not needed, randomization can proceed immediately. If blinded CGM&#xD;
           wear was performed as part of this protocol, randomization visit will occur14-21 days&#xD;
           after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             -  Participants in the UC Group will wear a blinded Dexcom G6 sensor throughout the&#xD;
                entire study unless they are current users of the Dexcom G6 CGM, in which case they&#xD;
                will continue to use their own Dexcom G6 CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
