  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Era of using ultrasound guided blocks provides an attractive and more or less safe&#xD;
      alternative to other techniques. Among these blocks is ultrasound-guided transverse abdominis&#xD;
      plane block (USG-TAP block) that controls pain by local anesthetic injection into the&#xD;
      neurofascial plane of the abdominal muscles. Ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block&#xD;
      (USG-TPVB) is another technique in which local anesthetic is injected nearby the thoracic&#xD;
      vertebra where spinal nerve emerges from the intervertebral foramina. It provides ipsilateral&#xD;
      somatic and sympathetic blockade in many dermatomes around the injection site. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to verify which technique is more efficient in reducing the intra- and&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic requirements in hepatic patients.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized clinical study, sixty patients will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      two groups according to a computer-generated random number table of 30 patients each to&#xD;
      receive ultrasound-guided either TAP block (Group T) or PVB (Group P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and location Theodor Bilharz research institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients (ASA II or III ) undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia&#xD;
      will be recruited and will be randomly allocated using a computer-generated random number&#xD;
      table of 30 patients each to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paravertebral block group or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transverse abdominis muscle block group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology in details :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the pre-operative period visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment from 0 to&#xD;
           10, with 0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning the worst pain imaginable will be explained to&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg will be given as pre-medication upon arrival to the operating room&#xD;
           then 500 ml lactated Ringer's solution will be administered slowly iv as a pre-load&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring :&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, gas analyzer, bispectral index (BIS), and&#xD;
      TOF-Guard module for neuromuscular monitoring (Dragger Infinity Kappa version VF-5W, Germany)&#xD;
      are connected to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction and maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During mask pre-oxygenation, patients' baseline hemo-dynamic parameters will be recorded&#xD;
           regarding blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General anesthesia will be standardized for all patients with :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5- 2 µg / kg fentanyl, 2-2.5 mg/kg 2% propofol then 0.5 mg/kg atracuriam will be&#xD;
      administered for muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be intubated and lungs mechanically ventilated to maintain end-tidal CO2&#xD;
           between 30 to 35 mmHg. Fresh gas flow oxygen in air 30-40% at a rate of 3 L/min for 10&#xD;
           minutes will be administered then decreased to 1L/min using a closed system (Fabius GS,&#xD;
           Dräger, Lübeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will receive 1 MAC desflurane which is defined as an expired fraction of&#xD;
           6.0 vol. %. Then the dial-up percentage will be adjusted to establish a BIS value&#xD;
           between 40- 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Top- up doses of 0.15 mg/kg atracurium will be given to maintain intra-operative muscle&#xD;
           relaxation according to TOF-guard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgical procedures will be done in the range between 10 am and 2 pm and by the same&#xD;
           surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the 2 groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In group P, USG-TPVB will be performed with the patient is in sitting position, a linear&#xD;
      transducer (6-15 MHz) placed just lateral to the spinous process, the depth of field will be&#xD;
      set about 3 cm to start scanning. The transverse processes and ribs will be visualized as&#xD;
      hyper echoic structures with acoustic shadowing below them. Once the transverse processes and&#xD;
      ribs are identified, the transducer is moved slightly cauded into the intercostal space&#xD;
      between adjacent ribs to identify the thoracic para-vertebral space (PVS) and the adjoining&#xD;
      intercostal space. The PVS appears as a wedge-shaped hypo echoic layer demarcated by the&#xD;
      hyper echoic reflections of the pleura below and the internal intercostal membrane above. It&#xD;
      is important to visualize the pleura very clearly at all times. The hyper echoic line of the&#xD;
      pleura and underlying hyper echoic air artifacts move with respiration. The needle stimuplex&#xD;
      needle (BRAUN Stimuplec D Plus 0,71*50- 80 mm 22 G* 2'', 15°) will be inserted and 0.5 - 1 ml&#xD;
      local anesthetic injection administered to show the displacement of pleura downward followed&#xD;
      by 15 cc bupivacaine 0.25% Marcaine® flacon, Astra Zeneca, Sweden) into each side the PVS.&#xD;
      Visualization of the needle and its tip and controlling its path at all times are essential&#xD;
      to avoid inadvertent pleural puncture or entry into the intervertebral foramen. A pop often&#xD;
      is felt as the needle penetrates the internal intercostal membrane. Intra-vascular injection&#xD;
      will be eliminated by negative aspiration before injection. Local anesthetic (15- 20 ml) is&#xD;
      slowly injected in small increments, avoiding forceful high-pressure injection to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of bilateral epidural spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In group T, USG-TAP Subcostal blockage will be done in plane technique with 22 G needle&#xD;
      (BRAUN Stimuplex D Plus 0,71 50- 80 mm 22 G). The puncture area and the ultrasound probe will&#xD;
      be prepared in an aseptic manner. The ultrasound probe is placed in a transverse plane to the&#xD;
      lateral abdominal wall in the midaxillary line, between the lower costal margin and iliac&#xD;
      crest. On each side, The rectus abdominis and underlying transverses abdominis muscles near&#xD;
      the costal margin and xiphoid process will be identified. In-plane image will be obtained and&#xD;
      the needle will be inserted through the rectus muscle 2-3 cm medial to the probe. Once the&#xD;
      tip of the needle is visualized to be in the plane, 0.25% bupivacaine will be administered&#xD;
      incrementally. The drug will be injected along the oblique subcostal line, extending&#xD;
      inferolaterally from the xiphoid towards the anterior part of the iliac crest by multiple&#xD;
      punctures; a total of 15 ml will be given on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When heart rate and blood pressure exceeds 20% of baseline in spite of adequate level of&#xD;
           anesthesia guided by BIS, boluses of 0.5 µg/kg fentanyl will be given &amp; the total&#xD;
           fentanyl dose will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atropine 0.5 mg increments will be used to control bradycardia (&lt;50 beat min-1) while&#xD;
           hypotension (less than 20% of preanesthetic level) will be managed by increasing fluid&#xD;
           infusion rate, decreasing inhalational anesthetic concentration and ephedrine 5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reversal of neuromuscular blockade will be achieved by IV administration of neostigmine&#xD;
           0.05 mg kg-1 and atropine 0.02 mg kg-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be extubated and transferred to post- anesthetic care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, weight, height, sex, ASA, medical history as well as physical examination will be&#xD;
           documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viral hepatitis markers and liver ultrasonography will be done to verify liver&#xD;
           affection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification including preoperative serum albumin, serum&#xD;
           bilirubin, ascites, prothrombin time (PT), or INR (modified CTP score), and grade of&#xD;
           encephalopathy will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver functions AST, ALT and ALP will be taken preoperatively, immediately&#xD;
           postoperatively and 24 hours later to rule out any change in liver functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding hemodynamic parameters blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored in each&#xD;
           group prior and following the block, induction of general anesthesia as well as&#xD;
           endotracheal intubation, then every 10 min till end of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total amount of fentanyl consumption throughout operation will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total anesthetic consumption will also be calculated according to the following formula&#xD;
           (18):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total liquid (ml) = from t=0 to t=end dt The time from the start of end-tidal control (t=0)&#xD;
      until the time when the vaporizer will be switched off at the end (t=end).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A conversion factor is detected from the amount of vapor given from each ml of volatile&#xD;
      liquid: conversion factor of desflurane is 209 ml calculated from the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversion factor = [density of volatile liquid (g/ml) ×volume at room temperature and&#xD;
      pressure (24000 ml)] /molecular weight (g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total volatile values used will be calculated by summing the product of usage rate by the&#xD;
      duration of each time epoch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average volatile usage (ml/h) =&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain intensity will be estimated by a numeric rating scale (NRS) (0 = no pain, 10 =&#xD;
           worst imaginable pain) at rest and on coughing at 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours following the end&#xD;
           of surgery. When VAS is exceeding four, boluses of 5 mg intravenous pethidine were given&#xD;
           till VAS declined to be less than 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first analgesic demand as well as total analgesic requirements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any complications regarding the procedure or the block will be noted as intraperitoneal&#xD;
           injection, bowel hematoma and transient nerve palsy as well as Local anesthetic&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of analgesia (paracetamol).&#xD;
