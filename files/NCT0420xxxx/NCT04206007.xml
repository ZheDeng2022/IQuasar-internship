  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study with UMC119-06 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. This will be a dose escalation, open label,&#xD;
      single-center study in adult with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. UMC119-06 is ex vivo&#xD;
      cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells product which is intended&#xD;
      for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide, predicted to be the third leading cause of death in adults by 2020. Patients with&#xD;
      COPD are characterized with airflow limitation and chronic inflammation, which is caused by&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, noxious particles or gases. These inhaled irritants will induce&#xD;
      inflammation, emphysema and fibrosis though chronic exposure. The current pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of COPD is symptomatic and is mainly based on bronchodilators, such as selective&#xD;
      β2-adrenergic agonists (short-and long-acting), anticholinergics, theophylline, or a&#xD;
      combination of these drugs. In patients with continuing exacerbations, inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICSs) may be added in the form of a triple fixed dose combination inhaler&#xD;
      that includes ICSs, long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) and inhaled long-acting muscarinic&#xD;
      antagonists (LAMA). Although current clinical treatment strategies can improve and stabilize&#xD;
      COPD states and quality of life, none of them are able to modify the progressive decline in&#xD;
      lung function which is the hallmark of this disease. Therefore, development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COPD in adult&#xD;
      patients is of urgent need. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, mesenchymal&#xD;
      stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment of COPD.&#xD;
