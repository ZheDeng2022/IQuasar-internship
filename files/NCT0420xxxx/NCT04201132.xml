    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter single-arm, open label study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Neuroguard IEP System for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in&#xD;
      subjects at elevated risk for adverse events following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The&#xD;
      Neuroguard IEP System is a 3-in-1 carotid stent delivery system consisting of an angioplasty&#xD;
      balloon, an integrated embolic protection device and a nitinol self-expanding stent loaded&#xD;
      over the balloon and constrained by an outer sheath. Eligible patients between 20 and 80&#xD;
      years of age have been diagnosed with either de-novo atherosclerotic or post CEA restenotic&#xD;
      lesion(s) in the internal carotid arteries (ICA) or at the carotid bifurcation with ≥50%&#xD;
      stenosis if symptomatic or ≥80% stenosis if asymptomatic (both defined by angiography using&#xD;
      NASCET methodology). Symptomatic patients are defined as having stroke or TIA ipsilateral to&#xD;
      the carotid lesion within 180 days of the procedure within the hemisphere supplied by the&#xD;
      target vessel. Enrolled subjects will be followed at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months&#xD;
      and 36 months.&#xD;

             target artery as needed for carotid stenting.&#xD;
