      This Unitaid-funded study aims to assess the feasibility and, acceptability and effects of&#xD;
      implementing HIV testing at birth testing using point-of-care (POC) HIV nucleic acid testing&#xD;
      (NAT) in maternity settings. Outcomes measures will include age at uptake of testing,&#xD;
      turnaround time from testing to caregiver result receipt, HIV positivity rate, and timing of&#xD;
      ART initiation for HIV-positive infants. This study will compare outcomes between HIV-exposed&#xD;
      at high vs low risk of maternal HIV transmission. The study will also assess the impact of&#xD;
      POC birth testing on retention in care and impact on subsequent testing at 6 weeks.&#xD;
