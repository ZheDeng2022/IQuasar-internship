  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open label, first-in-human, Phase I/IIa, blood-stage P. vivax malaria vaccine&#xD;
      trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the blood-stage Plasmodium vivax&#xD;
      malaria vaccine candidate PvDBPII in Matrix M1 in healthy adults living in the UK.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIa clinical trial is designed to primarily assess the safety of the&#xD;
      PvDBPII-Matrix M1 vaccine in healthy volunteers and to establish whether the PvDBPII-Matrix&#xD;
      M1 vaccine can demonstrate a reduced parasite multiplication rate in vaccinated subjects&#xD;
      compared to infectivity controls in a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 will be recruited in England at the Centre for&#xD;
      Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in Groups 1 and 2 will receive three doses of the PvDBPII 50ug/Matrix M1 50ug&#xD;
      candidate vaccine prior to blood-stage CHMI 2-4 weeks after the third vaccination. Volunteers&#xD;
      in Group 1 who complete 3 vaccinations and CHMI will be invited back for a fourth vaccination&#xD;
      at 5 months following their third vaccination and form a new study group- Group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo blood stage CHMI with Plasmodium vivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in a parallel study (VAC069), who will undergo the same CHMI without prior&#xD;
      vaccination, will be used as infectivity controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will be followed for approximately 9 months after the third&#xD;
      vaccination, approximately 2 years in total from enrolment. Participants in Group 2 will be&#xD;
      followed for 1 year from enrolment. Participants in Group 3 will be followed for 9 months&#xD;
      after their final (fourth) vaccination, approximately up to 2.5 years in total from&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
