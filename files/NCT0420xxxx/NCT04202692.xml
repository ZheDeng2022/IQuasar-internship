  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over&#xD;
      study with GERDOff Plus added on top of the current PPI treatment in patients with GERD. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of GERDOff Plus, a class III medical device,&#xD;
      consisting in a hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and magnesium trisilicate, in addition&#xD;
      to the PPIs, in patients with GERD not fully satisfied with their current treatment with&#xD;
      PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive either GERDOff Plus or placebo q.i.d. for 21 days followed by a&#xD;
      wash-out period of 3 weeks. After the wash-out period, the patients will receive either&#xD;
      placebo or GERDOff Plus respectively&#xD;
