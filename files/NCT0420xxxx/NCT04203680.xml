  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In cardiac surgery, myocardial protection is mandatory during cross clamp time&#xD;
      followed by reperfusion. Use of cardioplegic solutions preserves myocardial energy stores,&#xD;
      hindering electrolyte disturbances and acidosis during periods of myocardial ischemia. This&#xD;
      study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate&#xD;
      (HTK) solution versus blood cardioplegia in coronary artery bypass graft surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Three hundred and twenty patients were randomized into&#xD;
      Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) group and blood cardioplegia group. Ventilation&#xD;
      time, total bypass time, cross clamp time, length of ICU or hospital stay and the early&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes were analysed.&#xD;

      The Ethics Committee of Ain Shams university approved this randomized prospective&#xD;
      double-blinded controlled parallel group study to be held in Cardiothoracic Academy for three&#xD;
      months from December 2019 to April 2020. The study was conducted on three hundred and twenty&#xD;
      older patients aged from 60-80 years old posted for elective coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG). Written informed consents were signed by all patients. Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
      (1) patients with Unstable angina (class III or IV); (2) Poor left ventricular function (LVEF&#xD;
      &lt;40%) ;(3) Patient with acute myocardial infarction; (4) Previous CABG; (5) Previous renal&#xD;
      failure; (6) Preoperative Aortic valve or Mitral valve disease requiring replacement ;(7)&#xD;
      Urgent CABG operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed medical history, including medications used, symptoms and risk factors for&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease (smoking, DM, hypertension), NYHA classification and full&#xD;
      investigations were assessed on the night of the surgical procedure. Anesthesia management&#xD;
      was standardized for all patients. Premedication with midazolam was limited to a maximum of&#xD;
      0.05 mg/kg. Anesthesia was done with 12 μg/kg fentanyl, 5-7 mg/kg thiopental sodium, and 0.15&#xD;
      mg/kg pancuronium and was maintained with 1-2.0% isoflurane. Heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      were maintained within 20% of the baseline values. Anticoagulation was achieved with heparin&#xD;
      300 U/kg administered into the right atrium to maintain an activated clotting time above 480&#xD;
      s. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established by non-occlusive roller pumps, membrane&#xD;
      oxygenators and arterial line filtration. The CPB circuit was primed with 1.8 l lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's solution and 50 ml of 20% mannitol. Management of CPB included systemic hypothermia&#xD;
      during aortic cross-clamping, targeted mean perfusion pressure between 60 and 80 mmHg, and&#xD;
      pump flow rates of 2.2 l/min/m2.Intraoperatively the patients were monitored using ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, Invasive blood pressure monitoring, arterial blood gases, central venous line&#xD;
      catheter and temperature probe. Surgical approach was performed by median sternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups either HTK group and blood cardioplegia group&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated randomization code, with allocation ratio 1:1. Opaque&#xD;
      sealed envelopes were prepared according to the randomization schedule, and were opened by a&#xD;
      clinician not involved in any part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the HTK group, patients received 30 ml/kg of HTK cardioplegic solution at 4°C through an&#xD;
      antegrade fashion at an initial perfusion pressure of 80-100 mmHg. In blood cardioplegia&#xD;
      group, patients received one liter of blood cardioplegia was given with the antegrade route&#xD;
      at 30°C, or lower. Blood maintenance cardioplegia was repeated every 30-45mins. The study&#xD;
      medications were calculated and prepared by ICU residents who were not a part of the research&#xD;
      team. To ensure blinding of study drug administration, the medication vials were kept in&#xD;
      opaque bags. Trial bags were blinded and marked with a unique number. The allocation of trial&#xD;
      drugs was determined by the web-based randomization system by the allocation of the bag&#xD;
      number. The end-point assessor of the outcomes was blinded to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before separation from CPB, patients were rewarmed to 36-37°C. After separation from CPB,&#xD;
      heparin was neutralized with protamine sulfate 1 mg/100 U heparin to reach an activated&#xD;
      clotting time within 10% of baseline. All patients were then transferred to the ICU after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the study included early postoperative outcomes including cardiac&#xD;
      enzymes preoperatively, 8 &amp; 24 hour post-operatively, 30-day mortality, wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities and pericardial effusion. The secondary end-points included ventilation time,&#xD;
      cross clamp and total bypass time, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, need for&#xD;
      inotropic support, 30-day readmission, the incidence of late postoperative complications as&#xD;
      renal dysfunction.&#xD;
