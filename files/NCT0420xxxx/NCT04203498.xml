  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of nabiximols, compared with&#xD;
      placebo, when added to standard of care, in the treatment of muscle spasms associated with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial includes a 28-day Baseline period, a&#xD;
      12-week treatment period (comprising a 2-week titration phase and a 10-week maintenance&#xD;
      phase), and 2-week follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will enter the 28-day baseline period. During baseline, participants&#xD;
      will maintain their optimized oral MS antispasticity medication regimen and record spasm&#xD;
      count using an electronic daily diary. At screening (Day 1), eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),&#xD;
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the&#xD;
      first 14 days of treatment. Participants may leave a gap between sprays of approximately 15&#xD;
      minutes. Participants should continue at the same dose level achieved at the end of the&#xD;
      titration phase ±1 spray divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for the remainder of&#xD;
      the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily spasm count, the participant's symptom experiences, clinician's assessment of&#xD;
      spasticity, functional outcomes, health-related quality of life, changes in mood, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 18 weeks&#xD;
      (127 days), including the 28-day baseline period. Participants will have a maximum duration&#xD;
      of 85 (±7) days on IMP treatment.&#xD;
