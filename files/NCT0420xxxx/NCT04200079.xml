      Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary (COPD) patients are the paradigm of the chronic&#xD;
      complex patient. Their follow up can sometimes be difficult and challenging (1). There are&#xD;
      patients with recurrent exacerbations that put an enormous burden on health care resources&#xD;
      (2). They also have multiple comorbidities (3) that can sometimes make their management&#xD;
      difficult. In an attempt to coordinate all these efforts KGH, HDH and Providence Care have&#xD;
      numerous essential resources to take care of COPD patients like the nurse navigators, nurse&#xD;
      practitioners and the pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs provide an excellent&#xD;
      support to the clinical activity of Respirologists and other health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The main rationale for the development of the Kingston COPD cohort is to translate&#xD;
      that highly demanding clinical activity in a teaching and research oriented activity that&#xD;
      could be used by clinicians, medical students, residents and fellows. Having a guideline&#xD;
      complained established protocol in COPD patients that are usually follow at KGH and HDH could&#xD;
      help in not only in unified the way COPD patients are seeing (preserving the importance of&#xD;
      the personalized approach) but most importantly established a multidimensional (clinical,&#xD;
      physiological, radiological, laboratory) database. This could help know not only the results&#xD;
      of our clinical activity but also have a long term (&gt;5yrs) database for clinical research&#xD;
      projects in collaboration with national and international research groups. Therefore this&#xD;
      proposal is important because it will help translate our busy daily clinical work in a highly&#xD;
      productive teaching and research activity.&#xD;

      Aims: establish a long term multidimensional follow up of a large COPD cohort of COPD&#xD;
      patients in Kingston, Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: 1. established a simple and easy to apply follow up protocol in COPD&#xD;
      patients. 2. Hire a research assistant 3. Set up the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data source: Patients included in the present cohort will be those usually follow at the&#xD;
      Respirology clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital in Kingston Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data elements: this will include clinical, laboratory, physiological and radiological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical: baseline and yearly evaluation. The following information will be collected and&#xD;
      registered: Age, gender, history of prematurity and low weight at birth, maternal smoking&#xD;
      during pregnancy, history of infections or wheezing during infancy, pack year history: (age&#xD;
      of smoking initiation, years smoking, packs per day, age of quitting if quit), active or&#xD;
      former smokers, use of vaping or marihuana?, registration of Comorbidities using the Copd&#xD;
      cOmorbidiTy indEx COTE index, use of medications: LABA, LAMA, dual, LABA/ICS, ICS,&#xD;
      Roflumilast, Erithromycin, NAC, etc, use of O2 at home: lt/min and duration, CPAP and BiPAP&#xD;
      and pressures, degree of dyspnea measure by the Medical Research Council scale, height,&#xD;
      weight, Body Mass Index, Free Fat Mass Index determined by electrical bioimpedance, handgrip,&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic girth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory: baseline and yearly The following information from the patient chart will be&#xD;
      collected and registered: CBC (including differential specifically eosinophilia), CRP,&#xD;
      baseline alfa 1 AT levels (only baseline), fibrinogen, basal ABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological information: yearly evaluation The following information will be collected and&#xD;
      registered: FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, TLC, IC/TLC, RV/TLC, DLCO, KCO. MIP, MEP, 6MWD with and&#xD;
      without O2 in those O2 Sat 90% or lower. In a sample of interest full Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological information: Yearly Low dose chest CT The following information will be&#xD;
      registered from the final reports of the chest CT: Emphysema presence, type, extent and&#xD;
      localization, PulmArt/Ao diameter ratio measurement, presence of bronchiectasis (type and&#xD;
      localization), presence of air trapping, presence (type and localization) of interstitial&#xD;
      changes, presence of coronary calcifications, presence of osteoporosis, presence of lung&#xD;
      nodules---- Lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage and identification Data will be stored in an encrypted file behind a firewall in&#xD;
      a KGH server. For research purpose patient's information will be anonimized by using a study&#xD;
      ID number that will be linked to the CR number of every patient in a different encrypted&#xD;
      file. There will be no personal identifiable information during the entire process of each of&#xD;
      the proposed studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan The description of the characteristics of the participants will&#xD;
      follow the following methodology: qualitative data will be described using relative&#xD;
      frequencies. We will use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S) to determine if a quantitative&#xD;
      variable has a normal distribution. Quantitative data with a normal distribution will be&#xD;
      expressed using the mean and the standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When comparison between groups is planned the following methodological plan will be applied:&#xD;
      quantitative data with non-normal distribution will be described with the median and the&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR). Differences will be compared with chi square for qualitative data&#xD;
      or student t test and Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative data according to each variable&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
