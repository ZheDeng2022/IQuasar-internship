      The main purpose of this study is to find out the highest possible dose of maprotiline that&#xD;
      can be given safely in combination with temozolomide and tamoxifen. Temozolomide is approved&#xD;
      to treat glioblastoma and the investigator wants to understand what doses are safe to use.&#xD;
      Tamoxifen has been used for many years to treat breast cancer and there have also been&#xD;
      studies combining it with temozolomide for the treatment of brain tumors that have shown the&#xD;
      combination to be safe. In this study, the investigator will be adding maprotiline to&#xD;
      temozolomide and tamoxifen, determining the highest possible dose that is safe, making sure&#xD;
      there are no significant drug interactions and studying the safety of this combination.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive a combination of temozolomide and tamoxifen for two weeks. After that, they will receive a combination of temozolomide, tamoxifen and maprotiline for the remainder of the study. All drugs are administered orally. Subjects will undergo visits at the beginning of week 3, week 5 and week 7 that will involve multiple blood draws and ECGs to evaluate for pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Response will be assessed every two months with an MRI and patients will continue on study as long as their tumors are under control and they are tolerating the regimen.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically proven World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV gliomas.&#xD;
             Patients will be eligible if the original histology was a grade II or grade III glioma&#xD;
             as long as a subsequent histological diagnosis of a grade IV glioma is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone upfront therapy that included a combination of&#xD;
             radiotherapy and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by&#xD;
             MRI scan. A scan should be performed within 10 days prior to registration and on a&#xD;
             steroid dose that has been stable for at least five days. If the steroid dose is&#xD;
             increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tissue confirmation of histology at the University of Rochester&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery (including gamma-knife or cyber-knife) must have confirmation of true&#xD;
             progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium&#xD;
             scanning, MR spectroscopy, MR Perfusion, or surgical documentation of disease. The&#xD;
             decision of which modality to use to make this confirmation will be at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for&#xD;
             the release of their protected health information.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an interval of at least 28 days from any investigational agent or&#xD;
             from prior cytotoxic therapy, six weeks from prior nitrosureas, three weeks from&#xD;
             procarbazine and two weeks from vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed prior radiotherapy and must have an interval of greater than&#xD;
             90 days from completion of initial radiation therapy to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WBC &gt; 3,000/µl, ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3, platelet count of &gt; 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt; 8&#xD;
             gm/dl). Patients must have adequate liver function (SGOT and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times&#xD;
             ULN), and adequate renal function (creatinine clearance &gt;30ml/min as measured by&#xD;
             Cockroft-Gault formula) &lt;before starting therapy. These tests must be performed within&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached&#xD;
             by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any number of recurrences are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking tamoxifen for other indications are eligible for the study&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are within 3 months of treatment with radiation and concurrent&#xD;
             temozolomide will not be eligible unless there are new enhancing abnormalities outside&#xD;
             the high dose radiation fields (i.e. beyond the 80% isodose line) or surgical&#xD;
             demonstration of active tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant and must agree to practice adequate contraception. Women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within&#xD;

          -  Concomitant use of enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs will be prohibited. These&#xD;
             include phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and oxacarbazepine. If patients are on&#xD;
             these at time of study enrollment, drugs can be transitioned to a non-enzyme inducing&#xD;
             anti-epileptic drug at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses or other history that in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or&#xD;
             would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.&#xD;
