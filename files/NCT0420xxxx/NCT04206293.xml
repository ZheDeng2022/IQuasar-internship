    <measure>Change From Baseline in Skin Hydration as Measured by Corneometer®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (D0) to D28 and D84</time_frame>
    <description>Corneometer® measures the hydration level of the superficial skin surface (epidermis). The measurement is based on capacitance measurement of a dielectric medium in this case skin. It uses fringing field capacitance sensors to measure the dielectric constant of the skin. The dielectric constant of skin will change with water content. This allows for any changes in skin hydration to be measured by the precision measuring capacitor. These changes in water content of the stratum corneum are converted into arbitrary units of hydration. 5 measurements were done on the same zone and average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model and expressed in arbitrary units. A positive change from Baseline indicates better skin hydration rate. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

          <title>Skin Hydration (Corneometer®)</title>
          <description>Corneometer® measures the hydration level of the superficial skin surface (epidermis). It uses fringing field capacitance sensors to measure the dielectric constant of the skin. The dielectric constant of skin will change with water content. This allows for any changes in skin hydration to be measured by the precision measuring capacitor. These changes in water content of the stratum corneum are converted into arbitrary units of hydration. 5 measurements were done on the same zone and average value was calculated.</description>

          <description>Melanin index measured with Mexameter® defines the skin pigmentation related to melanin content in the skin. Measurements are performed by the application of a probe to the skin surface. The probe has a 5 mm aperture that emits radiations. These radiations are reflected by the skin and captured back by the same probe. The results are expressed as an index value in arbitrary units from 0 to 999. 3 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated.</description>

        <description>Skin hydration was measured using MoistureMeterD® XS (for epidermis and dermis), a non-invasive probe which measures the dielectric constant of the skin at a depth of 0.5 mm. 5 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated, expressed as tissue dielectric constant (TDC). The TDC is directly proportional to the amount of water in the tissue. A positive change from Baseline indicates better skin hydration. Values were obtained from a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Hydration as Measured by MoistureMeter D® 1.5 mm</title>
        <description>Skin hydration was measured using MoistureMeter D® S15 (for epidermis and dermis), a non-invasive probe which measures the dielectric constant of the skin at a depth of 1.5 mm. 5 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated, expressed as TDC. The TDC is directly proportional to the amount of water in the tissue. A positive change from Baseline indicates better skin hydration. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Hydration as Measured by Corneometer®</title>
        <description>Corneometer® measures the hydration level of the superficial skin surface (epidermis). The measurement is based on capacitance measurement of a dielectric medium in this case skin. It uses fringing field capacitance sensors to measure the dielectric constant of the skin. The dielectric constant of skin will change with water content. This allows for any changes in skin hydration to be measured by the precision measuring capacitor. These changes in water content of the stratum corneum are converted into arbitrary units of hydration. 5 measurements were done on the same zone and average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model and expressed in arbitrary units. A positive change from Baseline indicates better skin hydration rate. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Elasticity Parameters: Uf: Final Deformation (Firmness), Ue: Immediate Extensibility, Ur: Immediate Retraction (Tonicity), Ua: Total Recovery of the Initial State as Measured by Cutometer ®</title>
        <description>Skin elasticity was measured by a Cutometer ® which uses an in vivo non-invasive method to evaluate biological extensibility and elasticity variations. The various parameters analysed were Uf: final deformation (firmness), Ue: immediate extensibility, Ur: immediate retraction (tonicity), Ua: total recovery of the initial state. 2 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A Negative change from Baseline indicates firmer skin. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Elasticity Parameters: Uf: Final Deformation (Firmness), Ue: Immediate Extensibility, Ur: Immediate Retraction (Tonicity), Ua: Total Recovery of the Initial State as Measured by Cutometer ®</title>
          <description>Skin elasticity was measured by a Cutometer ® which uses an in vivo non-invasive method to evaluate biological extensibility and elasticity variations. The various parameters analysed were Uf: final deformation (firmness), Ue: immediate extensibility, Ur: immediate retraction (tonicity), Ua: total recovery of the initial state. 2 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A Negative change from Baseline indicates firmer skin. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>
          <population>FAS included any participant included in the study with at least a post-baseline value. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given timepoint.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Relative Parameters of Skin Elasticity: Q1, Q2, Q3 as Measured by Cutometer ®</title>
        <description>The parameters evaluated were: Elastic Recovery (Q1)=elastic recovery area (QE)/maximum recovery area (QO), Viscous Recovery (Q2)=viscous recovery area (QR)/maximum recovery area (QO) and Viscoelastic Recovery (Q3)= (QE+QR)/QO. 2 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A negative change from Baseline in Q1 and Q2 indicates decreased skin elasticity. A positive change from Baseline in Q3 indicates decreased skin elasticity. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Elasticity as Measured by Elastimeter®</title>
        <description>Instant skin elasticity was measured with Elastimeter® and defines the skin elasticity determined as a resistance against deformation caused by the Elastimeter® probe on the skin surface. 3 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. The values were expressed in Newton/meter. Higher values of ISE indicate higher skin elasticity. A positive change from Baseline indicates increased skin elasticity. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Roughness as Measured by Vivosight OCT®</title>
        <description>Skin roughness was measured by Vivosight optical coherence tomography (OCT®) system which is used to obtain high resolution imaging of skin sub-structures and vascular networks. The skin roughness parameters from the images included Ra and Rz. Ra is a measure of the average length that is between peaks and valleys. Rz helps measure the vertical distance between the highest peak and the lowest valley. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A negative change from Baseline indicates decreased skin roughness. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <description>OAC is a skin density parameter measured by Vivosight OCT® system used to obtain high resolution imaging of skin sub-structures and vascular networks. It analytically describes the reduction of OCT signal intensity with increasing depth-in-tissue. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A positive change from Baseline indicates increased skin density. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Brightness Index as Measured by Glossymeter®</title>
        <description>Skin brightness index was measured using Glossymeter®. 3 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were expressed in &quot;Glossymeter Units&quot;. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. Higher glossymeter values indicate higher skin brightness. A positive change from Baseline indicates increased skin brightness. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Colour as Measured by Spectrophotometer®</title>
        <description>Skin colour was measured by Spectrophotometer®. It converts colours perceived by man to a digital code composed of three parameters: L*: for clarity (from dark to light) a*: for the green-to-red spectrum b*: for the blue-to-yellow spectrum; a* and b* are chrominance parameters, L* is a luminance parameter. Higher values of a*, b*and L* indicates 'skin more red', 'skin more yellow' and 'skin clearer'. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model and expressed in arbitrary units. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Melanin Index as Measured by Mexameter®</title>
        <description>Melanin index measured with Mexameter® defines the skin pigmentation related to melanin content in the skin. Measurements are performed by the application of a probe to the skin surface. The probe has a 5 mm aperture that emits radiations. These radiations are reflected by the skin and captured back by the same probe. The results are expressed as an index value for each parameter in arbitrary units from 0 to 999. 3 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A negative change from Baseline indicates less pigmented skin. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Skin Melanin Index as Measured by Mexameter®</title>
          <description>Melanin index measured with Mexameter® defines the skin pigmentation related to melanin content in the skin. Measurements are performed by the application of a probe to the skin surface. The probe has a 5 mm aperture that emits radiations. These radiations are reflected by the skin and captured back by the same probe. The results are expressed as an index value for each parameter in arbitrary units from 0 to 999. 3 measurements were done on the same zone and the average value was calculated. Values were obtained from a mixed ANOVA model. A negative change from Baseline indicates less pigmented skin. The data is presented for area treated with Juvéderm® VOLITE and non-treated area in the same participants.</description>
          <population>FAS included any participant included in the study with at least a post-baseline value. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given timepoint.</population>
