      The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a profound school teacher training&#xD;
      programme to teach a mindfulness-based programme (.b) in Danish schools on the pupils&#xD;
      self-reported mental well-being at seven months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to evaluate i) the effectiveness of the profound school teacher&#xD;
      training programme to teach the .b-programme in Danish schools on the pupils self-reported&#xD;
      mental well-being post intervention (at five months).&#xD;

      The study is a cluster randomised trial. From May 2018 - May 2019, we recruited the total of&#xD;
      110 Danish schools (27 schools from the Capital Region of Denmark, 18 schools from Region&#xD;
      Zealand, 25 schools from Region of Southern Denmark, 30 schools from Central Denmark Region&#xD;
      and 10 schools from Region of Northern Denmark).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schools included the total of 191 school teachers for teacher training (56 teachers from&#xD;
      the Capital Region of Denmark, 28 teachers from Region Zealand, 42 teachers from Region of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark, 50 teachers from Central Denmark Region and 15 teachers from Region of&#xD;
      Northern Denmark). Each included teacher will be asked to recruit a class of pupils (15-25&#xD;
      pupils) to test the effectiveness of the .b-programme (in total approx. 3000 pupils).&#xD;
