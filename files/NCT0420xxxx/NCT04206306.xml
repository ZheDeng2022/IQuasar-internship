      Intensive Care Unit Acquired Delirium (ICU-AD) and Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness&#xD;
      (ICU-AW) are common in critically ill, mechanically ventilated adult patients. As more&#xD;
      patients survive ICU stays but suffer from long-term functional declines leading to&#xD;
      unemployment and disability, research is urgently needed. The aims of this study are to: 1)&#xD;
      describe the trajectory of physical functions one year after ICU discharge, including&#xD;
      distance walked in 6 minutes (6MWD), hand grip (HGS), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP),&#xD;
      cognitive function (mini mental state examination,MMSE), physical function ICU test score&#xD;
      (PFITs) , medical reserach council scale (MRC), medical research council questionnaire&#xD;
      (MRC-Q)and basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL); 2) examine the&#xD;
      incidences of ICU-AD and ICU-AW; and 3) test the interaction between ICU-AD and ICU-AW on&#xD;
      one-year functional trajectories in the ICU survivors.4) compare two tools, the intensive&#xD;
      care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) and confusion assessment method for the ICU&#xD;
      (CAM-ICU), for their predictive validity for outcomes related to delirium, hospital mortality&#xD;
      and length of stay (LOS), and examined whether the tools' predictive validity was affected by&#xD;
      patients' arousal status (RASS≥0, RASS&lt;0).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this 3-year cohort study, consecutive ICU stay over 24 hours and adult patients (≧20&#xD;
      years) will be screened for enrollment at 6 medical ICUs in the National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital. Participants will be assessed daily for delirium occurrence for up to 14 days of&#xD;
      ICU stay, and again upon ICU discharge. The instrument used for delirium are the confusion&#xD;
      assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and the intensive care delirium screening checklist&#xD;
      (ICDSC). The 7 point rating scale of CAM-ICU-7 will also be used to rate the severity of&#xD;
      delirium. Delirium assessment is possible,if the the patient's Richmond Agitation and&#xD;
      Sedation Scale (RASS, -5~+4) is ≧ -3, -4~-5 are deeper levels of sedation (unarousable or&#xD;
      responsive to painful stimulation only) cannot be assessed accurately. The CAM-ICU comprises&#xD;
      four features which assess the following: acute change or fluctuation in mental status&#xD;
      (Feature 1), inattention (Feature 2), disorganized thinking (Feature 3) or an altered level&#xD;
      of consciousness (Feature 4). Patients are considered to have delirium if they present with&#xD;
      both the first (acute onset and fluctuating course) and second (inattention) core symptoms&#xD;
      and either the third (altered consciousness) or fourth (disorganized thinking) symptom. The&#xD;
      ICDSC comprises eight items (score 0-8), ICDSC score of 4 or higher are considered delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At ICU discharge,assess ICU-AW using a standardized protocol. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      for one year after ICU discharge at 1, 3, 6, 12 months. A comprehensive functional evaluation&#xD;
      (6-minute walking test, grip strength test, maximum inspiratory pressure test, mini-mental&#xD;
      state exam, physical function ICU test score and basic and instrument activities of daily&#xD;
      living questionnaires, medical research council scale and medical research council&#xD;
      questionnaire) will be completed. Estimated 158 participants will be enrolled and followed&#xD;
      for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using the SPSS package. For example, the Generalized Estimating&#xD;
      Equation (GEE) will be performed to delineate the trajectory of physical functions one year&#xD;
      after ICU discharge and to test the interaction among ICU-AD, ICU-AW, and one-year functional&#xD;
      trajectories. The findings will add to the development of intervention program to reduce&#xD;
      ICU-AD and ICU-AW, thus promoting functional recovery for ICU survivors.&#xD;
