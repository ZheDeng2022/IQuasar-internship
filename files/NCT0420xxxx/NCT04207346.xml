  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common and serious condition affecting many&#xD;
      Veterans. There are effective treatments for PTSD, but additional treatments are needed in&#xD;
      order to better serve Veterans suffering from PTSD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is one&#xD;
      such promising treatment. It involves use of powerful magnet to stimulate the specific brain&#xD;
      regions in Veterans with PTSD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown effective in&#xD;
      treating depression, but currently it is unclear if it is an effective treatment for PTSD.&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial enrolling 91 Veterans with PTSD comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment and sham transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation in treating PTSD. The hypothesis is that those who receive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation will experience improved functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often chronic and disabling condition&#xD;
      prevalent in the Veteran population. While there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of medications and psychotherapy for improving PTSD symptoms, there has been&#xD;
      limited study of functioning as an outcome, and the role of other treatments such as somatic&#xD;
      therapies. One promising but understudied somatic treatment for PTSD is repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The characteristics of TMS treatment are different&#xD;
      than those of existing treatments and may provide alternative treatment to Veterans who do&#xD;
      not respond to medications and psychotherapy. Further, it is possible that TMS may have a&#xD;
      greater effect on functioning and lead to higher rates of recovery compared with medications&#xD;
      or psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine whether Veteran participants with PTSD who receive TMS delivered to&#xD;
      the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 1 Hz have greater improvements in: PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      functioning, and depressive symptoms than Veterans receiving sham treatments at treatment&#xD;
      completion and at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method 91 Veterans with PTSD will be randomly assigned to receive low frequency TMS or sham&#xD;
      TMS. All TMS will be applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      functional outcomes, and depressive symptoms will be measured for all participants at&#xD;
      treatment completion, 3 months, and 6 months after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Veterans with PTSD receiving TMS will have greater improvements in PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      functioning, and depressive symptoms at treatment completion and at three and six months&#xD;
      after treatment completion compared to Veterans receiving sham TMS.&#xD;
