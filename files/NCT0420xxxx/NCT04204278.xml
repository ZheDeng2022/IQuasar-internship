    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinical improvement and safety in patients&#xD;
      treated with MONOVISC for ankle osteoarthritis. Specifically, this study will provide&#xD;
      confirmation to the effectiveness and safety of MONOVISC at relieving ankle joint pain to 6&#xD;
      months post-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtain real world, post market data to confirm the clinical improvement and safety in&#xD;
      patients treated with a single injection of MONOVISC for the symptomatic relief of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis in the ankle joint. The entire study duration from first subject in to last&#xD;
      subject out will be approximately one and half years. The enrollment phase will be&#xD;
      approximately 12 months with a follow-up phase of 6 months. Visits will be scheduled at&#xD;
      screening, baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment.&#xD;
