  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-antitrypsin (AAT) is a member of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors and is to a&#xD;
      large extent responsible for restricting proteinases, notably neutrophil elastase, and&#xD;
      proteinase 3, which might otherwise attack the lung tissue. Individuals with a genetic&#xD;
      deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AATD) are at a significantly increased risk (80-100%) of&#xD;
      developing emphysema. This study is designed to administer a solution of AAT by nebulizer so&#xD;
      that patients can inhale the drug instead of requiring infusions as in current treatment. A&#xD;
      significant advantage of inhalation is that the AAT is directly transferred to the lungs,&#xD;
      which is the site most in need of the protein. Previous results show that in addition to the&#xD;
      added convenience, three times higher concentrations of AAT can be achieved in the lungs by&#xD;
      inhalation than by intravenous infusions. To date, more than 220 patients have completed&#xD;
      Inhalation studies for several indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study population will consist of adult patients with congenital alpha-1&#xD;
      antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency who have moderate airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume&#xD;
      in 1 second 50% ≤ [FEV1] ≤ 80% of predicted) and FEV1/slow vital capacity [SVC] ≤ 70% and who&#xD;
      have not experienced two or more moderate or one or more severe exacerbations of COPD during&#xD;
      the past year. A total of 220 patients will be recruited, and after 4 weeks practice inhaling&#xD;
      saline with the nebulizer, will be randomized 1:1 to inhale either 80 mg/day &quot;Kamada-AAT for&#xD;
      Inhalation&quot; or a placebo with identical appearance. Patients will be treated for 104 weeks&#xD;
      and then followed up for a further 26 weeks. Over this time there will be 13 visits to the&#xD;
      clinical study site for evaluation of lung function by blood tests and CT densitometry. In&#xD;
      addition the patients will be required to fill out a daily e-diary with details of the&#xD;
      inhalations and will also report their daily symptoms.&#xD;
