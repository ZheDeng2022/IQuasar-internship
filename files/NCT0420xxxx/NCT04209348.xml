  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial will be conducted among women at risk for&#xD;
      or diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) at the University of Tennessee Medical Center&#xD;
      Knoxville (UTMC). The trial will be called Project Wellness. It will compare a physical&#xD;
      activity (behavior change) intervention (i.e., walking/stepping in place) versus a general&#xD;
      wellness intervention (e.g., health education focusing on immunizations, contraceptive&#xD;
      options following delivery, etc.) on physical activity levels, maternal glycemic profile in&#xD;
      the third trimester, and infant size and anthropometric measurements soon after birth (i.e.,&#xD;
      weight, length, circumference, skinfolds). It is hypothesized that the physical activity&#xD;
      intervention will increase physical activity levels, and improve maternal glycemic profile&#xD;
      and infant anthropometric measures at birth. It is also hypothesized that maternal glycemic&#xD;
      profile in the third trimester will be associated with infant anthropometric measurements at&#xD;
      birth.&#xD;

    <description>The behavioral physical activity (PA) intervention focuses on walking, or stepping in place when it is not possible to walk (e.g., stormy weather). The primary goal of the PA intervention is to achieve at least 30 minutes per day of walking/stepping in place. The secondary goal is to use a PA tracker (e.g., the Fitbit Charge 3 provided by the intervention) to log and review walking/stepping, and to accumulate at least 3,000 steps during their 30 minutes of walking/stepping each day.</description>
