  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previse is a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that predicts acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI). Previse uses machine learning methods and information drawn from the&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury; by doing&#xD;
      so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse can give clinicians the&#xD;
      time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the&#xD;
      sequelae of AKI. It has been demonstrated in retrospective work that Previse can predict AKI&#xD;
      with high accuracy at long prediction horizons, but the tool has yet to be validated in&#xD;
      prospective settings; therefore, in this project, the clinical utility of Previse will be&#xD;
      assessed through an individually randomized controlled multicenter trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as an individually randomized, controlled, and non-blinded multicenter&#xD;
      prevention trial with a baseline period and a primary endpoint of proportion of patients&#xD;
      meeting one or more criteria for the Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days (MAKE30)&#xD;
      composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent creatinine elevation ≥ 200%&#xD;
      of baseline, all censored at the first of hospital discharge or 30 days. The trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a machine learning algorithm for AKI prediction, in approximately&#xD;
      8,574 patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted to one of three participating study hospitals.&#xD;
      Individual patient randomization will be performed at the time of the alert with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio. Patients will be evaluated for inclusion in the trial upon admission, and&#xD;
      will be automatically enrolled upon meeting inclusion criteria. Because data collection will&#xD;
      be conducted through noninvasive procedures that are routinely employed in clinical practice,&#xD;
      it will require a waiver of informed consent. Trial efficacy will be assessed at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled study visits, and safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis for all patients.&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events, laboratory tests, vital&#xD;
      signs, and physical examinations throughout the study. An independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DMC) will be formed to assist in the periodic monitoring of safety, data quality,&#xD;
      and integrity of study conduct. In addition, the DMC will review the interim efficacy&#xD;
      analysis performed to determine whether the primary endpoint has been met. Total trial&#xD;
      duration is expected to be approximately 12 months.&#xD;
