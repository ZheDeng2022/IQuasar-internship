      1. Patients The study included 30 patients with chronic kidney failure on dialysis&#xD;
           treatment at the Center for Nephrology and Dialysis of the Clinical Center Kragujevac.&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria were: regular dialysis treatment for more than 3 months, 3 times a&#xD;
           week and hemoglobin values lower than 110g / L. Exclusion criteria were: hemoglobin&#xD;
           values lower than 80g/L, the use of antioxidant and immunosuppressive therapy,&#xD;
           uncontrolled malignancies, proven active bleeding and presence of systemic inflammation&#xD;
           or active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ethical approval The research was conducted with respect to the Helsinki Declaration on&#xD;
           Medical Research, the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Center Kragujevac&#xD;
           No 01-14-3039. All subjects provided written informed consent before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Used plant extract Standardized Aronia extract (SAE) is official product of&#xD;
           pharmaceutical company Pharmanova (Belgrade, Serbia); nevertheless, procedure of&#xD;
           extraction was done by EU-Chem company (Belgrade, Serbia). This product contains&#xD;
           400mg/30ml of polyphenols, while the recommended daily dosage is 30ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood sampling Patients included in the study consumed standardized Aronia melanocarpa&#xD;
           extract (30ml/day) for 30 days. On the day 0, before SAE consumption, blood samples from&#xD;
           all patients were collected for hematologic analyzes, inflammation parameters, oxidative&#xD;
           stress parameters and antioxidant protection before the dialysis procedure. All&#xD;
           mentioned parameters were determined again after consuming the product, ie. on the 30th&#xD;
           day of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analytic Procedures Venous blood samples (2 x 4.5ml) were taken before the start of&#xD;
           supplementation (zero day) and at the end of supplementation (30th day). Vacuum tubes&#xD;
           with sodium citrate were used for blood sampling. The first sample was used for routine&#xD;
           hematologic analyzes, the second sample was used for plasma and erythrocyte lysate&#xD;
           extraction in order to determinate redox and inflammatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluation of Systemic Redox State Plasma samples were used for determination of the&#xD;
           levels of the following pro-oxidants: superoxide anion radical (O2-), hydrogen peroxide&#xD;
           (H2O2), nitrites (NO2-) and index of lipid peroxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid&#xD;
           reactive substances (TBARS), while the parameters of antioxidative defence system, such&#xD;
           as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and level of reduced&#xD;
           glutathione (GSH) were determined in erythrocytes lysates samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A) Index of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) determination The degree of lipid peroxidation in&#xD;
           the plasma samples was estimated by measuring TBARS, using 1% thiobarbituric acid in&#xD;
           0.05 NaOH, which was incubated with the sample at 100°C for 15 min and measured at 530&#xD;
           nm. TBA extract was obtained by combining 0.8 ml sample and 0.4 ml trichloro acetic acid&#xD;
           (TCA); afterwards, the samples were put on ice for 10 min and centrifuged for 15 min at&#xD;
           6000 rpm. (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Nitrite determination (NO2-)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nitric oxide (NO) decomposes rapidly to form stable nitrite/nitrate products. The NO2-&#xD;
           level was measured and used as an index of NO production, using Griess's reagent. For&#xD;
           NO2 - determination in plasma 0.1 ml 3 N PCA (perchloride acid), 0.4 ml 20 mM&#xD;
           ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.2 ml plasma were put on ice for 15 min,&#xD;
           then centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm. After pouring off the supernatant, 220 μl K2CO3&#xD;
           was added. Nitrites were measured at 550 nm. (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Superoxide anion radical determination (O2-)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Superoxide anion radical concentrations in plasma samples were measured using the&#xD;
                NTB (Nitro Blue Tetrazolium) reagent in TRIS buffer (assay mixture). The&#xD;
                measurement was performed at a wavelength of 530 nm. (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Hydrogen peroxide determination (H2O2)&#xD;
&#xD;
                The measurement of H2O2 was based on the oxidation of phenol red by H2O2 in a&#xD;
                reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase. Two hundred microlitres of perfusate&#xD;
                or plasma was precipitated using 800 mL of freshly prepared phenol red solution; 10&#xD;
                μL of (1:20) horseradish peroxidase (made immediately before use) was subsequently&#xD;
                added. The level of H2O2 was measured at 610 nm (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Determination of reduced glutathione (GSH)&#xD;
&#xD;
                The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was determined based on GSH oxidation via&#xD;
                5,5-dithiobis-6,2-nitrobenzoic acid. GSH extract was obtained by combining 0.1 ml&#xD;
                0.1% EDTA, 400 μl hemolysate, and 750 μl precipitation solution (containing 1.67 g&#xD;
                metaphosphoric acid, 0.2 g EDTA, 30 g NaCl, and filled with distilled water until&#xD;
                100 ml; the solution is stable for 3 weeks at +4C°). The level of GSH was measured&#xD;
                at 420 nm (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Determination of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Isolated RBCs were washed three times with three volumes of ice-cold 0.9 mmol/l NaCl,&#xD;
           and hemolysates containing about 50 g Hb/l were used for the determination of CAT&#xD;
           activity. CAT buffer, prepared hemolysate sample, and 10 mM H2O2 were used for CAT&#xD;
           determination. Detection was performed at 360 nm. SOD activity was determined by the&#xD;
           epinephrine method. Hemolysate was mixed with carbonate buffer, and then epinephrine was&#xD;
           added. Detection was performed at 470 nm (6-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluation of the inflammatory status In order to evaluate the inflammatory status of&#xD;
           patients, following parameters were measured at both points of interest (0 and 30th&#xD;
           day): serum C-reactive protein concentration - CRP and tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
           concentration - TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The serum C- reactive protein (CRP) concentration was determined by the turbidimetric&#xD;
           method on the Olympus AU680. The normal serum CRP concentration is ≤ 5 mg/L.&#xD;
           Microinflammation is defined as the concentration of CRP in the serum of 5 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plasma TNF-α concentrations were determined by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay&#xD;
           (ELISA) using commercially available high sensitivity indirect sandwich enzyme-linked&#xD;
           immunosorbent assay (Sigma Aldrich).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Evaluation of the hematological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           At both points of interest, the values of the following haematological parameters in all&#xD;
           patients were analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Erythrocytes (Er), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), erythrocyte index- mean&#xD;
           corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin&#xD;
           concentration (MCHC), serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDH), serum haptoglobin&#xD;
           concentration and iron status: serum iron concentration, ferritin; total iron binding&#xD;
           capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), transferrin saturation&#xD;
           (TSAT), haptoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Statistical Analysis IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 Desktop for Windows was used for&#xD;
           statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the distribution of data.&#xD;
           Statistical comparisons were performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
           tests with a Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons, in the case of normal&#xD;
           distribution of data between groups, while Kruskal-Wallis was used for comparison&#xD;
           between groups where the distribution of data was different than normal. Values of p &lt;&#xD;
           0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
