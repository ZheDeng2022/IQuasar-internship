  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      investigators want to observe a group of pediatric patients who are going to undergo open&#xD;
      thoracic surgery at Queen Silvia's child and youth hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital.&#xD;
      Population that has been selected is between 6-36 months due to the fact that the&#xD;
      physiological development does not differ significantly with respect to drug response and&#xD;
      circulation. During general anesthesia and surgery, investigators will use an NIRS). A sensor&#xD;
      is placed frontally on the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This comparative study will study the relationship between regional oxygenation frontal and&#xD;
      2/4-channel EEG. An EEG sensor with adhesive will also be attached to the frontal on&#xD;
      patient's forehead next to tendons from NIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consulted consecutively at the thoracic surgeon who will undergo open&#xD;
      thoracic surgery with the support of the hair removal machine and who have the intended age&#xD;
      for the study at Queen Silvia's Children's and Youth Hospital, Salhgrenska University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroperatively, data collection will occur in 5-minute intervals for frontal and occipital&#xD;
      measurements. The measurements are started before the patient is anesthetized and terminated&#xD;
      when the patient is awakened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual monitoring parameters under general anesthesia will be collected and documented, see&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      Children who are routinely operated for surgery that cause high levels of circulatory changes&#xD;
      (e.g., heart surgery) are currently routinely used to monitor the so-called regional&#xD;
      oxygenation technique over the brain, (NIRS). Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a&#xD;
      technique for measuring regional oxygen saturation, indirectly autoregulation in the brain.&#xD;
      NIRS use has clinically resulted in an increased possibility of detecting episodes of&#xD;
      regional ischemia that had not previously been recognized. Investigators do not know for sure&#xD;
      what these episodes of impaired oxygenation in the brain can mean if not detect them in time&#xD;
      and thus can correct them. There is no such research that has studied it in children.&#xD;
      Investigators know that impaired oxygenation in the brain can occur with severe immediate&#xD;
      blood loss. Investigators in the research group have been able to observe that in children&#xD;
      who are otherwise healthy and who are operated for cranioplasty procedures &lt;1 year old, when&#xD;
      they have ongoing heavy bleeding, the oxygenation in the brain and sometimes sharply&#xD;
      decreases before investigators can replace the blood loss, even though the blood pressure can&#xD;
      be maintained adequately . Peroperative hypovolaemia is a factor that risks disrupting&#xD;
      autoregulation in the brain. Regarding which median arterial pressure (MAP) is required to&#xD;
      maintain intact autoregulation under general anesthesia, a scientific consensus is still&#xD;
      lacking. Dagal &amp; Lam have shown that an MAP between 50-150 mmhg in adults indicates intact&#xD;
      autoregulation, even though they claim that there is great individual variation. Research&#xD;
      relating to children and autoregulation is limited, however, there is research on middle&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP). Today at Drottning silvia's children and youth hospital -thorax&#xD;
      surgeon, the Sahlgrenska University Hospital uses a monitor whose brand is called INVOS and&#xD;
      which uses NIRS technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS e.g. works practically by attaching a sensor to the skin in the area where monitoring is&#xD;
      to be performed. By illuminating skin and underlying tissue with infrared light in spectra&#xD;
      700 to 1100 nm, it is possible to measure regional oxygen saturation in different tissues. In&#xD;
      cerebral measurement, the sensor is placed frontally, just down the hairline. NIRS then&#xD;
      returns absolute values (0-100%) of cerebral oxygen saturation frontally in the area where&#xD;
      the sensor is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, NIRS is routinely used during open-hearth surgery. NIRS may indicate when ischemia or&#xD;
      ongoing impaired autoregulation occurs. However, the weakness of the technique may be that&#xD;
      even when a circulating organ does not extract oxygen, the NIRS value is high, which means&#xD;
      that investigators cannot be completely sure of the values when they are high if other parts&#xD;
      that affect the value (pH, mean arterial pressure etc.) are affected negatively. This means&#xD;
      that supplementation with EEG e.g. BIS or Masimo technology could increase the possibility&#xD;
      that even when &quot;false for high values of NIRS&quot; are detected and thus treatable. Regarding EEG&#xD;
      and use on children, studies on deep anesthesia and burst suppression, where in their method&#xD;
      similar technical equipment of BIS was used, which intenser in this study to detect burst&#xD;
      suppression. Otherwise, the BIS or Masimo technique is used clinically during child&#xD;
      anesthesia to part also, for example, at so-called. procedure investigations when one wants&#xD;
      rapid flow rates of the study for a certain time, but also in the monitoring of children who&#xD;
      have ongoing epileptic seizures when the technique has shown that it detects burst&#xD;
      suppression. This new area of studying BS and utilizing and possibly this technology during&#xD;
      open heart surgery, if possible, could increase safety even more for these many times already&#xD;
      vulnerable children. Investigators want to observe a group of pediatric patients who will&#xD;
      undergo open thoracic surgery with the support of a heart lung machine at Drottning Silvia's&#xD;
      child and youth hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      study how the regional oxygenation one of the brain possibly has an influence on the&#xD;
      emergence of so-called burst suppression. Population that has been selected is between 6-36&#xD;
      months due to the fact that the physiological development does not differ significantly with&#xD;
      respect to drug response and circulation. Investigators intend to study 15 children according&#xD;
      to statistical calculation see below. The time for data collection of the study is estimated&#xD;
      at approx. 12 months.&#xD;
