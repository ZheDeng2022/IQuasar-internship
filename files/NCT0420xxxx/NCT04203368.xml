  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study was conducted in 268 patients aged from 65-70 years posted for&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients were randomly allocated to either adenosine or&#xD;
      verapamil(control) groups. In the adenosine group, patients received IV adenosine 6 mg bolus&#xD;
      then wait 2 minutes, if it failed to return to sinus rhythm then another 12 mg IV bolus of&#xD;
      adenosine was administered, if supraventricular tachycardia persisted then the patient was&#xD;
      shifted to verapamil. In verapamil group, patients received IV verapamil 5mg bolus slowly&#xD;
      over 2 minutes followed by a second IV bolus dose of 5 mg ,10 minutes after the initial dose&#xD;
      in case of persistence of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). If SVT persisted, the patient&#xD;
      was shifted to adenosine. The efficacy of the study drug, ICU stay length, systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, hospital- stay length, duration of extubation, the total dose of the study drug&#xD;
      used, the total cost of the study drugs and the incidence of adverse events were recorded.&#xD;

      Written informed consent was obtained from every patient. This prospective, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group clinical trial was conducted in 268 patients. The following inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were used: (1) RCT; (2) adult (age: 65-70 years) patients with ASA physical status II and&#xD;
      III, scheduled for elective isolated CABG; (3) use of adenosine versus verapamil for&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia; (4) the efficacy was a mandatory&#xD;
      outcome measurement ; (5) Ejection fraction 50-60%; (6) Absence of any associated&#xD;
      comorbidities or history of myocardial infarction. Patient with impaired cerebral Perfusion,&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability arrhythmias other than PSVT were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia management was standardized to minimize any effect of anesthetic type on&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Premedication with midazolam was limited to a maximum of 0.05 mg/kg. Anesthesia&#xD;
      was induced with 12 μg/kg fentanyl, 5-7 mg/kg thiopental sodium, and 0.15 mg/kg pancuronium&#xD;
      and was maintained with 1-2.0% isoflurane. Heart rate and blood pressure were maintained&#xD;
      within 20% of the baseline values. Anticoagulation was achieved with heparin 300 U/kg&#xD;
      administered into the right atrium to maintain an activated clotting time above 480 s.&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was conducted with non-occlusive roller pumps, membrane&#xD;
      oxygenators, arterial line filtration, and cold blood-enriched hyperkalemic arrest. The CPB&#xD;
      circuit was primed with 1.8 l lactated Ringer's solution and 50 ml of 20% mannitol.&#xD;
      Management of CPB included systemic hypothermia (to an esophageal temperature of 32°C) during&#xD;
      aortic cross-clamping, targeted mean perfusion pressure between 60 and 80 mmHg, and pump flow&#xD;
      rates of 2.2 l/min/m2. Myocardial protection was achieved with antegrade cold blood&#xD;
      cardioplegia. A 32-μm filter (Avecor Affinity, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used in the arterial&#xD;
      perfusion line. Before separation from CPB, patients were warmed to 36-37°C. After separation&#xD;
      from CPB, heparin was neutralized with protamine sulfate and 1 mg/100 U heparin to reach an&#xD;
      activated clotting time within 10% of baseline. All patients were transferred to the ICU&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated to either adenosine or verapamil(control) groups according&#xD;
      to a computer-generated randomization code, with allocation ratio 1:1. Opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes were prepared according to the randomization schedule, and were opened by a&#xD;
      clinician not involved in any part of the study. Upon arrival at the ICU, a standardized&#xD;
      protocol for postoperative care was implemented for all patients by well-trained nurses&#xD;
      supervised 1:1and by the ICU consultants. The study medications were calculated and prepared&#xD;
      by ICU nurses who were not a part of the research team. Both end-point assessors of the&#xD;
      outcomes and patients were blinded to the study drugs. All staff were blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation excluding the ICU consultant and resident who were not part of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure blinding of study drug administration, the medication vials were kept in opaque&#xD;
      bags. Trial bags were blinded and marked with a unique number. The allocation of trial drugs&#xD;
      was determined by the web-based randomization system by the allocation of the bag number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the adenosine group, patients received IV adenosine 6 mg bolus then wait 2 minutes, if it&#xD;
      failed to return to sinus rhythm then another 12 mg IV bolus of adenosine was administered,&#xD;
      if supraventricular tachycardia persisted then the patient was shifted to verapamil. In&#xD;
      verapamil group, patients received IV verapamil 5mg bolus slowly over 2 minutes followed by a&#xD;
      second IV bolus dose of 5 mg ,10 minutes after the initial dose in case of persistence of&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). If SVT persisted, the patient was shifted to adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were routinely extubated when deemed clinically appropriate according to the&#xD;
      local ICU protocol, by ICU staff, when the patient was able to maintain spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      for 48 h, according to normal weaning parameters, after which they were encouraged to sit on&#xD;
      a chair and mobilize with the assistance of health care providers in the ICU then the&#xD;
      physiotherapist became responsible for improving mobility and rehabilitation of the patients&#xD;
      till discharge from the hospital. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were continuously&#xD;
      monitored during drug administration and 30 minutes after conversion to sinus rhythm.&#xD;
