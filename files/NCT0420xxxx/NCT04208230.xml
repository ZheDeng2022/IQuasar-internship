      Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased cortical bone porosity and increased fracture&#xD;
      risk. The goal of this proposed study is to understand the longitudinal evolution of cortical&#xD;
      bone porosity and to investigate the underlying biological processes that drive increased&#xD;
      cortical porosity and fracture risk in the setting of diabetes. The investigators will apply&#xD;
      novel techniques for in vivo imaging of cortical pores to patients with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      controls in a longitudinal prospective study. This work will establish the longitudinal&#xD;
      progression of cortical porosity and determine whether pore content can serve as a predictor&#xD;
      of future cortical degradation and bone fragility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed study is to investigate the underlying biological processes&#xD;
      that drive increased cortical porosity in the setting of T2D and to understand the&#xD;
      longitudinal evolution of human diabetic bone disease with a special focus on cortical&#xD;
      porosity. The investigators propose the first longitudinal study of pore progression in T2D&#xD;
      patients, which will be performed using a novel combined high-resolution peripheral&#xD;
      quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (CE MR)&#xD;
      imaging approach. The investigators will use novel image analysis approaches to characterize&#xD;
      pore content and spatial distribution of porosity within the cortex, and micro finite element&#xD;
      (Î¼FE) analysis to quantify biomechanical impact of porosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone quality deficits underlying increased fragility in T2D are not fully understood. At the&#xD;
      tissue level, research evaluating deficits in material properties and fracture resistance is&#xD;
      ongoing. At the structural level, increased cortical porosity is a clearly established&#xD;
      deficit in bone quality in T2D. Porosity is a major determinant of strength, stiffness, and&#xD;
      fracture toughness of cortical tissue, and therefore represents an important target for the&#xD;
      prevention or reversal of T2D-associated skeletal fragility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms driving increased cortical porosity in T2D are unknown. To develop treatments&#xD;
      specifically targeted at the prevention or reversal of pathological porosity, the&#xD;
      investigators must understand the biological drivers of porosity. Today these biological&#xD;
      drivers are unknown. Within the compact cortex, formation of large cortical pores has been&#xD;
      attributed to clustering of osteons and merging of Haversian canals. At the endocortical&#xD;
      border, 'trabecularization' or marrow space expansion is hypothesized to drive observed&#xD;
      increases in cortical porosity. Multiple mechanisms of pore space expansion likely are at&#xD;
      play in diabetic bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased marrow adiposity and compromised microvascular health are recognized aspects of T2D&#xD;
      mellitus, and may be implicated in the development of pathological porosity. Studies&#xD;
      investigating rodent models and humans have established the association of increased marrow&#xD;
      fat with T2D. (BMI alone, in contrast, has not been shown to have an association with marrow&#xD;
      fat.) Increased marrow fat - in turn - is associated with low BMD and poor trabecular&#xD;
      microstructure. The investigators have also documented that increased marrow fat is&#xD;
      associated with vertebral fracture, independent of BMD. The historic concept of marrow fat as&#xD;
      merely a passive filler has been superseded by an appreciation for this fat depot as a&#xD;
      dynamic player in bone quality. To date this link has been studied primarily in terms of&#xD;
      trabecular bone microstructure; the investigators propose that it could be a player in&#xD;
      cortical bone microstructure as well. Microvascular complications of T2D are among the most&#xD;
      serious manifestations of the disease. In advanced disease, neovascularization through the&#xD;
      process of angiogenesis leads to progression of retinopathy and nephropathy. Recent work has&#xD;
      suggested that microvascular pathology also affects trabecular bone quality in diabetes. In&#xD;
      cortical bone, where the majority of porosity contains blood vessels, neovascularization&#xD;
      necessitates removal of bone tissue. Therefore the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      microvascular pathology may be influencing cortical microstructural changes in T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of pathological pore space may indicate drivers of pore space expansion, and lead to&#xD;
      strategies for predicting and preventing porosity-related fractures. Characterization of pore&#xD;
      content may indicate pore space enlargement by expansion of the marrow cavity, expansion of&#xD;
      the vascular network, or both. If the investigators discover that altered marrow distribution&#xD;
      or composition is associated with increased porosity in T2D, this suggests that expansion of&#xD;
      the marrow cavity may be contributing to pathological porosity. In this case the&#xD;
      investigators would direct future efforts towards the emerging topic of fat-bone&#xD;
      interactions, specifically: 1) the balance between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation&#xD;
      occurring from a common multipotent precursor; and 2) the action of adipokines on bone&#xD;
      remodeling. If the investigators determine that altered vessel distribution or microvascular&#xD;
      health is associated with increased porosity in T2D, this suggests that the vascular network&#xD;
      may be contributing to pathological porosity. In this case the investigators would direct&#xD;
      future research toward the interaction between the vascular system and cortical bone&#xD;
      remodeling. The vascular system is known to influence bone remodeling through vasoactive&#xD;
      substances released by endothelial cells. In the context of disuse, for example, bone loss is&#xD;
      associated with increased vascularity and hyperemia, achieved by the release of vasoactive&#xD;
      substances by endothelial cells. As the investigators look at these possible mechanisms of&#xD;
      increased cortical porosity, appropriate treatment strategies will be clarified.&#xD;
      Specifically, increased porosity related to fat metabolism might indicate interventions&#xD;
      focused on directing mesenchymal stem cell differentiation towards osteoblastogenesis or&#xD;
      regulating adipokine action on bone remodeling. Alternatively, increased porosity due to&#xD;
      microvascular damage might indicate modulation of vasoregulators or anti-angiogenic therapy&#xD;
      as used to combat neovascularization and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
