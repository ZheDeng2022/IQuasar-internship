      A randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-design, multiple-site study to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical (therapeutic) effet of a generic Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Douglas&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals America Ltd) compared with the reference standard Ketoconazole Cream 2% (Teva&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals USA Inc) in subjects with a microbiologically-confirmed, clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of tinea pedis. Approximately 675 subjects, male or female, 18 years or older, will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Therapeutic Cure of tinea pedis at the test-of-cure visit conducted 2 weeks after the end of treatment (Day 56 +/- 4). Therapeutic cure is defined as having both a clinical and mycological cure of tinea pedis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Clinical Cure at Day 56 +/- 4. Clinical Cure is defined as a total severity score of &lt;/= 2, with no individual severity score of &gt;1. This is calculated using The Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Tinea Pedis rated by the Investigator using a standardized rating scale as follows:&#xD;
0=none (complete absence of any sign or symptom)&#xD;
Mild (slight)&#xD;
moderate (definitely present)&#xD;
Severe (Marked, intense).&#xD;
The following signs and symptoms will be rated:&#xD;
Signs = fissuring/cracking, erythema, maceration, and scaling Symptoms = pruritis and burning/stinging</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mycological cure of tinea pedis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment (Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects in each treatment group with a Mycological Cure of tinea pedis at Day 56 +/- 4. Mycological Cure is defined as having a negative KOH test AND a negative fungal culture.</description>

          -  Tinea pedis confirmed at baseline by positive KOH wet mount.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sum of clinical signs and symptoms score of target lesion at least 4; in addition&#xD;
             target lesion must have a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema and a minimum score&#xD;

             disease and/or trophic changes of the lower limbs to an extent that, in the opinion of&#xD;

             subject's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;

             or ophthalmic corticosteroids for acute or chronic conditions (e.g. allergic&#xD;
             conjunctivitis, asthma/COPD maintenance) is acceptable to the extent that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, does not compromise safety of subject or integrity of the&#xD;
             data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral terbinafine or itraconazole within 2 months before Visit 1.&#xD;
