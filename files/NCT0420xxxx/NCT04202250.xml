  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral nerve catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty included in the study. These patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to the catheter tip configuration as CEMP (closed-ended multiport catheter) group and OESP&#xD;
      (open-ended single port catheter) group. Patient controlled analgesia device will be attached&#xD;
      to the peripheral nerve catheter of these patients. Demographic data of the patients , the&#xD;
      number of pushing the button the amount of bolus dose given, and the total dose given in the&#xD;
      patient controlled anesthesia device, the need for additional analgesia and the amount, pain&#xD;
      scores, complications will be recorded for three days postoperatively. Records will be&#xD;
      compared statistically.&#xD;

      Ethics committee approval was received on 10 December 2019, numbered 19/397. The study was&#xD;
      planned to include 90 adult patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at Gülhane Training&#xD;
      and Research Hospital between 10 December 2019 and April 2020. Continue femoral nerve&#xD;
      catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the patients included in the study.&#xD;
      These patients will be randomized to the catheter tip configuration as CEMP (closed-ended&#xD;
      multiport catheter) group and OESP (open-ended single port catheter) group. Patient&#xD;
      controlled analgesia device will be attached to the peripheral nerve catheter of these&#xD;
      patients. Demographic data of the patients who have placed an femoral nerve catheter and used&#xD;
      the catheter successfully for three days postoperatively, the number of pushing the button,&#xD;
      the amount of bolus dose given and the total dose given in the patient controlled anesthesia&#xD;
      device,the amounts of need for additional analgesia and pain scores(Numeric rating Scale),&#xD;
      complications will be recorded for three days postoperatively. Records will be compared&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;

    <description>After sterile preparation and large inguinal crease draping, with the US probe in a sterile sleeve or cover , we will proceed to hydrolocalization with 5-10 mL 5% dextrose in order to open the space between the femoral nerve and the superior part of the ilio-psoas muscle. The Contiplex® FX Non-Stimulating Tuohy Set, 17Ga. x 3½ inches. the Non-Stimulating Needle and the closed-tip multiport catheter will be then inserted under control and its position assessed between the femoral nerve and the superior aspect of the ilio-psoas muscle. Some aliquots of 5% dextrose will inject to confirm correct dispersal of the solution along the femoral nerve. The catheter will be tunnelled subcutaneously.A patient-controlled analgesic device will be attached to the catheter for postoperative analgesia. continuous peripheral nerve patient-controlled analgesia is as follows: 0.125% bupivacaine; hourly infusion: 4 ml / hour, pca dose (bolus): 5 ml / hour, lock-up time: 30 min, 4-hours limit: 30 ml.</description>
