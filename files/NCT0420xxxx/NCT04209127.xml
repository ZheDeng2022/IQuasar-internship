      Single blinded randomized controlled study of symptom improvement after uterine artery&#xD;
      embolization (UAE) versus ultrasound guided percutaneous/transvaginal microwave ablation,&#xD;
      evaluated by validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis is a benign condition causing pain and bleeding disorders in many women.&#xD;
      Hysterectomy has historically been the golden standard for treatment as well as&#xD;
      (postoperatively) diagnosis of the disease. In accordance with refined diagnostic tools such&#xD;
      as ultrasound and/or MRI, minimally invasive treatments for adenomyosis are being explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to compare two minimally invasive techniques: embolization of the uterine artery (a&#xD;
      commonly used procedure) and microwave ablation of adenomyotic tissue (previously only in&#xD;
      clinical use in China).&#xD;

      Single blinded randomized controlled study of symptom improvement after uterine artery&#xD;
      embolization (UAE) versus ultrasound guided percutaneous/transvaginal microwave ablation,&#xD;
      evaluated by validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis is a benign gynecological condition, where endometrial glands and stroma invades&#xD;
      the myometrial walls of the uterus. The disease is thought to be estrogen-dependent, but the&#xD;
      etiology, as well as the prevalence, is currently unknown. Known risk-factors are previous&#xD;
      uterine surgery and parity, although the disease has been found also in nulligravida with no&#xD;
      previous uterine trauma. Adenomyosis can cause severe dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain and infertility. Historically diagnosis has been made post hysterectomy by&#xD;
      pathologists, however with transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) as well as MRI the condition is now&#xD;
      possible to identify with non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy has previously been seen as the golden standard treatment for adenomyosis, but&#xD;
      may cause long-term side effects such as genitovaginal prolapse. It also carries a&#xD;
      substantial risk of short term complications such as infections and organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic treatment such as the levonogestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) can be&#xD;
      effective, however there is a risk of expulsion and irregular bleedings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the study of minimally invasive or&#xD;
      non-invasive therapies with uterine preservation such as uterine arterial embolization (UAE),&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF), microwave treatment and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). A&#xD;
      randomized controlled study is ongoing, comparing UAE and hysterectomy. RF ablation often&#xD;
      requires the aid of a laparoscopic procedure, which is invasive. HIFU is currently only&#xD;
      described in small cohorts and case-reports. Ultrasound or computer tomography guided&#xD;
      percutaneous microwave thermal ablation is minimally invasive, has low time requirements, is&#xD;
      easy to perform, and has been broadly used for the treatment of solid tumours in organs other&#xD;
      than the uterus with favourable effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation of adenomyosis has been performed in China. The effect and acceptability&#xD;
      has been high. The research team in this study has been to China to study the treatment. We&#xD;
      have visited the clinic and studied the procedure as well as talked to patients pre- and post&#xD;
      operatively . The equipment at Danderyd Hospital has the same output effects as the equipment&#xD;
      in China. Danderyd Hospital has approved the method for use in uterine myomas. However, no&#xD;
      randomized comparative study of other minimally invasive methods has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of percutaneous&#xD;
      CT- or ultrasound guided microwave ablation and uterine artery embolization for the treatment&#xD;
      of adenomyosis in a randomized single blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women fulfilling inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria will be identified at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of Danderyd Hospital. Advertisement may be placed in local newspapers or on&#xD;
      social media (Facebook and Instagram) and relevant webpages or in gynecological clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomized after having been informed orally and in written and after having&#xD;
      signed informed consent and after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      MRI-examination. Randomization will be in random permuted blocks of 6 at a ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization will be according to a computer generated randomization sequence. After&#xD;
      patients have signed informed consent and fulfill inclusion without exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      the initial magnetic resonance imaging they will be allocated to an intervention by&#xD;
      consecutive opening of sealed opaque envelopes containing the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and investigators will not be blinded. The MRI will be performed and evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre randomization evaluation After having signed informed consent but before randomization&#xD;
      patients will undergo MRI of the uterus. Patients with endometriosis or a clinically&#xD;
      significant presence of uterine fibroids (myomas&gt;3cm) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women included in the study after MRI examination will fill in a PBAC evaluation during&#xD;
      the menses preceding treatment. Women will fill a VNRS for maximal pain during 1 month prior&#xD;
      to treatment. In addition a full blood panel will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for uterine artery embolization no pathologist report will be performed before any&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation Microwave ablation will be performed percutaneously or vaginally using a&#xD;
      Covidien Emprint microwave ablation system with a 30-80 Watts effect in 14-16 gauge needle&#xD;
      with a ceramic tip using computer tomography with fusion technique or ultrasound for&#xD;
      adenomyosis imaging and needle guidance. After identification of the needle path with CT or&#xD;
      peroperative ultrasound a small skin incision using a scalpel will made for the needle entry&#xD;
      in the case of percutaneous treatment. No incision will be made if treatment is given&#xD;
      vaginally. When needed to optimize the needle path in order not to damage adjacent organs,&#xD;
      artificial ascites (approx 500mL Ringer-acetate) will be created using a thin syringe through&#xD;
      the abdominal wall. The ablation zone of a 70W needle is estimated to be 4x3x3 cm after 300s&#xD;
      or 5x4x4 cm after 600s. Patients will be given intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing or general anesthesia during treatment to minimize movement during ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine artery embolization Embolization will be performed in conscious women with an&#xD;
      epidural catheter or patient controlled analgesia for pain relief. A catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted in the femoral artery to access the uterine artery during x-ray monitoring and&#xD;
      during administration of contrast to visualize the adenomyotic tissue and its supporting&#xD;
      arterial supply. When the supporting arterial branch has been identified polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      particles are released into the bloodstream. These particles cause a thrombosis in the&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation post treatment Women will estimate VNRS maximum postoperative pain day of surgery&#xD;
      and the following 7 days. In addition, they will note how many days passed before all pain&#xD;
      subsided, use of pain medication will be noted and period until resuming normal daily&#xD;
      activities. The period of hospitalization will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual blood loss (PBAC) will be noted the first menstruation, menstruation number 3 and 5&#xD;
      post treatment. PBAC is a validated instrument for menstrual blood loss quantification.&#xD;
      UFS-QOL is a validated instrument for women with uterine fibroids, but is commonly used also&#xD;
      in trials regarding adenomyosis, and will be evaluated 6 months post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be after 1-2 menstruation at approximately 2 months and at 6 months&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow up visit 2 months (+/-2 weeks) and 6 months (+/-2 weeks) post treatment&#xD;
      acceptability will be assessed as overall satisfaction of treatment on a scale from 1-7 and&#xD;
      if the woman would recommend the treatment to a friend. At the follow up visit at 6 months&#xD;
      hemoglobin, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), and prolactine (PRL)&#xD;
      will be measured. AMH estimates the effect of the treatment on the ovarian reserve. CA-125&#xD;
      and PRL have been used to evaluate pathophysiological changes in adenomyosis. These will be&#xD;
      compared to levels taken on the day of the operative procedure. A uterine biopsy will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new MRI scan will be performed 6 months post treatment (+/-21 days). Women will then be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a long-term follow up (&gt;12 months) with evaluation of recurrence of&#xD;
      symptoms, with clinical controls (gynecological exams and TVUS) and using PBAC and UFS-QOL&#xD;
      yearly until retraction of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis is a benign condition but have a significant impact on the lives of women, and&#xD;
      the condition is not well studied. Reports have suggested adenomyosis in approximately 40% of&#xD;
      patients undergoing hysterectomy. Women with adenomyosis are much more likely to report on&#xD;
      symptoms as dysmenhorrea, heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. As&#xD;
      hysterectomy is a highly invasive procedure with costs for women in terms of absence from&#xD;
      work and short and long term complications, finding new minimally invasive and&#xD;
      uterine-sparing treatments would be beneficial for affected women.&#xD;
