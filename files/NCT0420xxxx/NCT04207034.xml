      SOURCE OF DATA Patient visiting the Outpatient Section of the Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      Krishnadevaraya College of Dental Sciences and Hospital will be screened and randomly&#xD;
      recruited for the study as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. The eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be informed of the nature and benefits of the participation of the study and a written signed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. The study population will consist of twenty (n=20) subjects who&#xD;
      will be age (30 to 40 years) and sex matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The study was performed according to split- mouth design, and all teeth in the&#xD;
      mouth were treated randomly using either the left or the right side of the maxilla and&#xD;
      mandible for control , and the opposite side for the therapy. Each patient was entered into a&#xD;
      clinical protocol consisting of two different treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (n=10) - Test group ( diode laser + flap surgery) Group II (n=10) - control group&#xD;
      (flap surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL PROCEDURE GROUP I (TEST GROUP) Patient will be asked to rinse with 0.2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash. Following the administration of local anaesthesia 2% lignocaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride ( with 1: 80,000 epinephrine) , Laser application will be carried out , with&#xD;
      the help of 810 nm (A.R.C LASER FoxTM) diode laser with a flexible optic tip of 300µm . The&#xD;
      sulci will be lased with a repeated beam ( 0.2 sec on 0.3 sec off) at an output power of 1.0&#xD;
      W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracrevicular incision will be placed with the help of 15c Bard Parker surgical blade ,&#xD;
      full thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement of granulation tissue will be done and flap will be suture back in position using&#xD;
      3-0 black breaded silk suture, the site will be covered with non eugenol periodontal dressing&#xD;
      for protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative instructions will be given to the patient. 2 ml blood will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline(sample 1) , at 5 minutes (sample 2) and within 20-30 minutes (sample 3) of starting&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (CONTROL GROUP) Patient will be asked to rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash.&#xD;
      Following the administration of local anaesthesia 2% lignocaine hydrochloride ( with 1:80,000&#xD;
      epinephrine) ,intracrevicular incision will be placed with the help of 15c Bard Parker&#xD;
      surgical blade , full thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement of granulation tissue will be done and flap will be suture back in position using&#xD;
      3-0 black breaded silk suture, the site will be covered with non eugenol periodontal dressing&#xD;
      for protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative instructions will be given to the patient. 2 ml blood will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline(sample 1) , at 5 minutes (sample 2) and within 20-30 minutes (sample 3) of starting&#xD;
      the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood samples Six millilitres (6 ml) of blood samples will be drawn from the&#xD;
      patient through an antecubital vein using strict aseptic technique via a 22- gauge sterile&#xD;
      plastic cannula and sent for for qPCR analysis to quantify total bacterial load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR ANALYSIS The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique for DNA&#xD;
      replication that allows the &quot;target&quot; DNA sequence to be selectively amplified. The PCR&#xD;
      involves the primer mediated enzymatic amplification of DNA. In this study Quantitive&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA from the blood samples will be extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit&#xD;
           according to the manufacture's recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to quantify the total bacterial load, qPCR will be carried out using a&#xD;
           universal primer to the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis was performed in a total volume of 6 ml blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples for qPCR will be dispensed into well plates, sealed and centrifuged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amplification will be done , settings for qPCR will be as follows: 95 degree centigrade&#xD;
           for 10 minutes followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95 degree centigrade for 1 minute,&#xD;
           52 degree centigrade for 1 minute , 72 degree centigrade for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After each cycle , PCR products will be monitored for the increase in fluorescence of&#xD;
           SYBR green.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All measurements will be performed in triplicate for both test and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the negative control , ultrapure water will be used replacing the clinical sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the specificity of the amplified products, a melting curve will be obtained&#xD;
           from 60 degree centigrade to ninty five degree centigrade, with continuous florescence&#xD;
           measurement at each 1% increase in temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data acquisition and analysis will be performed using the ABI 7500 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be subjected for normality test. Best on the data parametric&#xD;
      or non parametric test will be performed. P value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
