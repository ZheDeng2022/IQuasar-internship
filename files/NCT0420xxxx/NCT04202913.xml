  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      School based, mental-health intervention focused on improving self-efficacy and coping skills&#xD;
      in children aged 9-13 years. The overall premise of our intervention is that by teaching&#xD;
      children these skills they will in-turn become more resilient when faced with life-stressors&#xD;
      and/or adverse events.&#xD;

      Healthy Kids is a 1:1 health coaching intervention delivered in school-settings. Students&#xD;
      meet weekly with their assigned health coach and together they identify both strengths and&#xD;
      areas for improvement with respect to resilience, developing resilience skills, and setting&#xD;
      resilience goals. Topics discussed include coping skills, self-efficacy, and interpersonal&#xD;
      relationships. The program was developed using the social determination theory (SDT), goal&#xD;
      theory, and elements from the social-ecological model. SDT was used within the intervention&#xD;
      to promote and facilitate behavior change. Goal theory was also utilized to develop&#xD;
      strategies to support youth short- and long-term goal setting. Finally, weekly discussions&#xD;
      about resilience and goal setting activities accounted for elements of the social-ecological&#xD;
      model which acknowledges that behaviors are not independent factors, but are influenced by&#xD;
      multiple levels of one's personal and social environment.&#xD;
