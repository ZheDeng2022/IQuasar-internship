  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EndoRotor® is intended for use (USA labeling) in endoscopic procedures by a trained&#xD;
      gastroenterologist to resect and remove tissue, not intended for biopsy, of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) system including post-endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) tissue&#xD;
      persistence with a scarred base and residual tissue from the peripheral margins following&#xD;
      EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial investigators will conduct a post-market, prospective, non-randomized,&#xD;
      multi-center study for the treatment of subjects with the need for resection of recurrent&#xD;
      flat or sessile colorectal lesions where EndoRotor is the primary resection modality of&#xD;
      persistent adenoma with a scarred base.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the majority of polyps are non-malignant, it is known that the risk of malignancy&#xD;
      increases with polyp size, with polyps &lt; 10 mm having &lt; 1% risk of cancer, polyps of 10 mm&#xD;
      having a 10% risk of cancer and polyps of 20 mm having a greater than 10% risk of cancer. It&#xD;
      is also understood that a polyp of &lt; 1 cm takes approximately 10 years to transform into&#xD;
      invasive colorectal carcinoma. Therefore, adenomas greater than 5 mm are normally treated.&#xD;
      Polyps with tethered bases resulting from scarring are often the most challenging to resect&#xD;
      endoscopically. The scarring can be caused by previous attempts at resection, previous deep&#xD;
      biopsies, or tattoos placed too closely. These polyps often do not lift and can be impossible&#xD;
      to snare even when stiff snares are used. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and&#xD;
      knife-assisted resection (KAR) are techniques that have been shown effective in the&#xD;
      management of scarred polyps, however these techniques have not been widely adopted in the&#xD;
      West. Argon plasma coagulation has been more commonly used to ablate adenomatous tissue in&#xD;
      scarred polyps but this technique does not allow for the histological assessment of the&#xD;
      scarred polyp and is less effective than ESD. The EndoRotor provides a technique whereby the&#xD;
      lesion can be effectively removed without adjunct procedures with collection of tissue for&#xD;
      histological assessment.&#xD;
