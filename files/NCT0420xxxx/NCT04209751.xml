  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute diarrhea in children is a public health problem. It is estimated that children under 3&#xD;
      years are subject to 1 or 2 episodes of diarrhea per year in Europe. These diarrheal episodes&#xD;
      are frequent, expensive and responsible for many consultations and hospitalizations in&#xD;
      developed countries. The origin of diarrhea in children is viral in about 70% of cases. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of a viral infection is often considered without microbiological evidence. However,&#xD;
      microbiological evidence is recommended for certain categories of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of bacteria or parasites in the child's diarrhea does not seem negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of infectious diarrhea among&#xD;
      summer diarrhea in children leading to pediatric emergency room visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, we will describe the pathogens responsible for childhood diarrhea during the&#xD;
      summer period, describe common factors that can serve as guidance on the etiology of&#xD;
      diarrhea, and describe common factors that can be used as tools. preventive to the&#xD;
      transmission of these pathogens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining consent from the holders of parental authority, a stool collection will be&#xD;
      requested from all pediatric emergency patients presenting as a reason for &quot;diarrhea&quot;&#xD;
      consultations between June 1 and September 30, 2020. It will be given by the nurse organizing&#xD;
      the reception, a medical information questionnaire and a stool collection container for those&#xD;
      accompanying a child with diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child presents stool during the waiting period or during the medical consultation,&#xD;
      these will be collected and sent to the medical biology laboratory of the University Hospital&#xD;
      for a broad analysis (virological, bacteriological and parasitological).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor in charge of the patient will complete a pre-established clinical information&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, the stool will be taken care of and a DNA extract will be made and&#xD;
      preserved. The search for pathogens will be carried out by molecular biology, by series,&#xD;
      non-prospectively. The results will only be transmitted at a distance and will not be&#xD;
      communicated to families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic management of children included in the study will be identical to the usual&#xD;
      practice. Microbiological analysis will not delay, prolong or disrupt the treatment of the&#xD;
      acute episod of diarrhea.&#xD;
