  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      InnoSlim® has been studied for enhancing metabolic functions whereas many lab studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the potential efficacy of InnoSlim® for the blood sugar and blood lipids&#xD;
      regulation. There has been no relevant human study on InnoSlim® on blood sugar and blood&#xD;
      lipids regulation. There have reported that 2018 estimating the total costs of diagnosed&#xD;
      diabetes have risen to $327 billion in 2017 from $245 billion in 2012. Although&#xD;
      pharmacological methods have been developed to treat diabetes, these treatments can be costly&#xD;
      and are not without potential adverse effects. The development of dietary agents for the&#xD;
      prevention of diabetes could represent a cost-effective and safe means to deal with this&#xD;
      growing public health crisis.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators are investigating the effects of InnoSlim® on blood sugar&#xD;
      and blood lipids regulation in humans. The testing sample is orally administrated to&#xD;
      participants with pre-diabetes and hyperlipidemia humans, the efficacy parameters of blood&#xD;
      sugar, lipid profile and other parameters, as well as adverse effects to the healthy&#xD;
      individual, are screened during the trial, the significant difference is shown and no adverse&#xD;
      effect reported.&#xD;
