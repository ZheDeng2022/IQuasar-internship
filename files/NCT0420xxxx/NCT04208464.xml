  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib in patients with adult&#xD;
      idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM). Half of the patients enrolled onto the study will&#xD;
      receive 24 weeks of baricitinib from the baseline visit with a 12 week follow-up period. The&#xD;
      other half of patients will receive barcitinib treatment after an initial 12-week delay with&#xD;
      a 4 week follow up period for safety.&#xD;

      Potential participants will attend a screening visit to confirm their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the trial. Once eligibility is confirmed the participant will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive 24 weeks of baracitinib from the baseline visit with 12 weeks of follow up or receive&#xD;
      24 weeks of baracitinib after a delayed-start of 12 weeks from the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits every 4 weeks starting at the baseline visit at week 0.&#xD;
      At each visit data will be collected about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signs of disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A blood test to check blood count, liver and kidney function and markers of inflammation&#xD;
           for safety purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participant reported assessment of how disease disease is progressing and how it affects&#xD;
           their day-to-day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the following data will be collected at week 0, week 12, week 24 and week 36:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signs of disease damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood and urine sample collection for biomarker analysis&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomised, treatment-delayed trial design. Participants will be randomised into two arms: participants in one arm will receive 24 weeks of baracitinib treatment from baseline with 12 weeks of follow up; participants in the other arm will have a delayed treatment start for 12 weeks, then will receive 24 weeks of baracitinib treatment with 4 weeks of follow up for safety.</intervention_model_description>

                  commit to completing the course during the study. Such cases should be discussed&#xD;
                  with a respiratory physician as per local guidelines. A PPD response that is&#xD;
                  equal to or greater than 10 mm should be considered a positive test, although&#xD;

                  between 30-60mL/min should receive a reduced oral dose of 2mg baricitinib OD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;
