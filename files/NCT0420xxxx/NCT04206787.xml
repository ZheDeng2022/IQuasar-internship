    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the sequential strategy with afatinib as first-line treatment and&#xD;
      to find the optimal treatment strategy for long-term chemotherapy-free regimens in Chinese&#xD;
      patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, this study can also assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of afatinib as first-line treatment.&#xD;

             therapies are permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases (patients with brain metastases, who were&#xD;
             previously treated, are eligible provided they have asymptomatic brain metastasis for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks on stable doses of medication) at the start of afatinib treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent participation in an interventional oncology clinical trial&#xD;
