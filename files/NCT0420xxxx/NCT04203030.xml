  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test if a program with physical activity and learning about&#xD;
      movement (including goal setting, benefits of physical activity, and how to increase physical&#xD;
      activity gradually) helps people to become more active and to move better. The physical&#xD;
      activity program involves specific exercises done in a group setting, and the education part&#xD;
      will involve learning about different ways to move to make everyday activities easier. The&#xD;
      program will last 16 weeks. This program will take place in a large fellowship area of a&#xD;
      partner church through an established community-based participatory research partnership in&#xD;
      Chicago, IL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limitations in physical function (PF) are related to decreased quality of life and are&#xD;
      predictive of disability, nursing home admission, increased healthcare costs, and mortality&#xD;
      in older adults. Structured physical activity has been shown to prevent mobility disability&#xD;
      among those with physical function limitations, though community-based programs are needed,&#xD;
      particularly in underserved communities. The purpose of this study is to pilot test a&#xD;
      tailored physical activity intervention in churches in Chicago's West Side through an&#xD;
      existing community-based participatory research partnership. The investigators previously&#xD;
      found high rates of physical function limitations in these communities, and through&#xD;
      qualitative research have identified intervention components that may aid in promoting&#xD;
      physical activity among community members with physical function limitations. The primary aim&#xD;
      is test the intervention in a 16 week, proof-of-concept study in 20 participants who are&#xD;
      ambulatory but have PF limitations. The group-based physical activity intervention will take&#xD;
      place in a large common area of a church. For feasibility the investigators will be testing&#xD;
      the intervention in one church. The intervention will be delivered over 16 weeks, with&#xD;
      assessments at baseline and 16 weeks.&#xD;
