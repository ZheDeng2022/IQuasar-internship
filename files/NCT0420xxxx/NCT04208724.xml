  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial study uses a structural support program for adoption of cancer screening&#xD;
      interventions at a rural community-based organization. Rural communities face unique barriers&#xD;
      in implementation of evidence-based interventions due to a lack of infrastructure, community&#xD;
      capacity, and expertise as academic and research centers are often clustered in urban areas.&#xD;
      The support program may help a rural community-based organization select, adapt, and&#xD;
      implement cancer prevention and control evidence-based interventions.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-based organizations participate in the support program, consisting of 2 half-day&#xD;
      training workshops over 2 weeks, and 30-minute bi-weekly consultations in order to adapt and&#xD;
      implement the cancer screening intervention for community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Located in the Yakima Valley of Washington&#xD;
             State&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Serve community members who are 18 and&#xD;
             older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective II COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION: Willing to commit to the 6-month program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective II PARTICIPANTS: Receiving services from the recruited community-based&#xD;
             organization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: Not up-to-date for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer&#xD;
             screening according to current U.S. Preventive Services Tasks Force (USPSTF)&#xD;
             guidelines. The current USPSTF recommendations for breast, cervical, and colorectal&#xD;
             cancer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breast Cancer Screening: Women ages 50-74 should be screened for breast cancer&#xD;
                  with mammography every 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cervical Cancer Screening: Women ages 21-29 should be screened for cervical&#xD;
                  cancer every 3 years with cervical cancer cytology alone. For women ages 30-65,&#xD;
                  the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every&#xD;
                  5 years or every 5 years with high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in&#xD;
                  combination of cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Colorectal Cancer Screening: Individuals ages 50-75 should be screened for&#xD;
                  colorectal cancer with guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) or fecal&#xD;
                  immunochemical test (FIT) once a year, or colonoscopy every 10 years (USPSTF&#xD;
                  approves additional screening tests, but these are the most commonly used).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects breast cancer&#xD;
             screening, we will recruit women ages 50-74.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects cervical&#xD;
             cancer screening, we will recruit women ages 21-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects colorectal&#xD;
             cancer screening, we will recruit women and men ages 50-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective III PARTICIPANTS: Average risk for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer&#xD;
