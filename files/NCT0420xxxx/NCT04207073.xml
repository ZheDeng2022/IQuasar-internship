  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the studies in the literature are examined, no study has been reached to examine whether&#xD;
      median nerve mobilization causes changes in two-point discriminatory values in healthy&#xD;
      individuals. This study aimed to investigate the effect of median nerve mobilization exercise&#xD;
      on two-point discrimination in healthy adult male and female participants. Secondly, it was&#xD;
      aimed to determine the role of variables such as gender, age, BMI (weight in kilograms,&#xD;
      height in meters and weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2), smoking,&#xD;
      dominant extremity and physical activity level in 2-point discrimination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-point discrimination is one of the most important cortical senses that require strong&#xD;
      tactile sensitivity and the ability to distinguish two points from one point on the skin.&#xD;
      Neural mobilization has been reported to be effective in the nerve-related waist, leg, neck,&#xD;
      arm, and plantar heel pain, but there is still insufficient evidence for other&#xD;
      neuromusculoskeletal problems. It has been stated that factors such as application technique,&#xD;
      type and patient characteristics of mobilization are effective in the treatment and more&#xD;
      comprehensive studies should be done on this subject. This study aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of median nerve mobilization exercise on two-point discrimination in healthy adult&#xD;
      male and female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 healthy female and male adult individuals (60 females, 60 males) will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Individuals will be divided into two groups as female and male (n = 60), and a&#xD;
      two-point discrimination test will be performed on the palmar face of both hands from the&#xD;
      distal phalanx, forefinger, middle finger and palm. After the evaluation, the participants in&#xD;
      both groups were randomly divided into two groups as the exercise group (n = 30) and control&#xD;
      group (n = 30). Participants in the exercise group will perform 2 sets of 5 repetitive Median&#xD;
      nerve mobilization exercises (total of 20 sessions) per day for 10 days. After the exercise&#xD;
      program, the two-point discrimination measures will be repeated in all groups.&#xD;
