  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study that will assess the investigational drug, cabozantinib, in patients&#xD;
      with liver cancer (specifically hepatocellular carcinoma) and who had received a liver&#xD;
      transplant as a part of curative care, but the cancer has come back (recurred). The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to see how useful cabozantinib is in controlling the disease of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib blocks the function of various proteins found on the surface of the body's cells&#xD;
      (called receptor tyrosine kinases) that are important in the development of cancer tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive cabozantinib until they are no longer receiving benefit from&#xD;
      the study drug or they experience an intolerable side effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three main parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Participants will have test, procedures, and assessments done for safety and&#xD;
      eligibility. Some may be done for research purposes only. Several visits may be needed to&#xD;
      complete the screening part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Period: During this part, participants will take the study drug as prescribed by&#xD;
      the study doctor. While on the study drug, participants will visit the clinic about once a&#xD;
      week for tests, procedures, and assessments for safety, eligibility, and research only&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Drug Visit and Follow-up: Participants will be asked to make an End of Study&#xD;
      Drug visit about 30 days after the last dose of study drugs for safety, eligibility, and&#xD;
      research only purposes. After this visit, participants will continue to have follow-up visits&#xD;
      about every 8 weeks. If participants are experiencing side effects, they will be followed&#xD;
      weekly for about 4 weeks, then monthly until resolution or stabilization.&#xD;
