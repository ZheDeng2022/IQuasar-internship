  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the World&#xD;
      since 2003. Many people suffer from this disease or its complications for many years and die&#xD;
      prematurely. In the European Union, the total direct costs of respiratory diseases are&#xD;
      estimated to be around 6% of the total healthcare budget, with COPD accounting for 56% (38.6&#xD;
      billion Euros) of the costs of respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the natural history of COPD, many patients may experience acute exacerbations (AECOPD)&#xD;
      that are described as episodes of sustained worsening of the respiratory symptoms that result&#xD;
      in additional therapy. These episodes of exacerbation that often require been seen in the&#xD;
      emergency department and/or a hospital admission are associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality; they are responsible for a significant portion of the economic burden of the&#xD;
      disease too. The pharmacological approach used in the management of AECOPD (inhaled&#xD;
      bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics), has the objective to minimize the&#xD;
      negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the collaborative effort between the European Respiratory Society, the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society, and others to provide clinical recommendations for the prevention of&#xD;
      AECOPD, there is still a considerable number of patients that are prone to suffer from&#xD;
      recurrent exacerbations and to experience a more severe impairment in health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all the above, the aim is to identify the factors potentially associated with&#xD;
      hospital admission in patients with AECOPD in English, French, German, and Spanish, speaking&#xD;
      countries, and to develop a predictive model that predicts the risk of hospitalization in&#xD;
      this group of patients, by using artificial intelligence. In this study proposes to take&#xD;
      advantage of SAVANA, a new clinical platform, created in the context of the era of electronic&#xD;
      medical records (EMRs), to analyse the information included in the electronic medical files&#xD;
      (i.e., big data). This clinical platform is a powerful free-text analysis engine, capable of&#xD;
      meaningfully interpreting the contents of the EMRs, regardless of the management system in&#xD;
      which they operate. In this context, this machine learning analytical method can be used to&#xD;
      build a flexible, customized and automated predictive model using the information available&#xD;
      in EMRs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as&#xD;
      with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generally accepted research practices&#xD;
      described in the International Conference Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, the Helsinki Declaration in its latest edition, Good Pharmacoepidemiology&#xD;
      Practices, and applicable local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain patient confidentiality, demographic and personal identifying information (e.g.,&#xD;
      initials, date of birth, etc.) will not be collected; only age will be collected. In no case&#xD;
      Savana staff will handle a correspondence table between the anonymized patient codes and&#xD;
      their EMRs. Only the healthcare centre can identify patients. In any case, SEPAR, the study&#xD;
      sponsor, or its partners, will not have gto EMRs. It will only access a report, which will&#xD;
      contain aggregated information on the data obtained as described in this protocol. The final&#xD;
      results will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the European Data Protection Authority, an anonymous clinical record is released&#xD;
      from its status as personal data, so that the General Data Protection Regulation no longer&#xD;
      applies. The anonymization is performed at each site by the owner of the information (so that&#xD;
      nobody else has access to that information and so that it is not possible to track it).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All actions will be taken in accordance with the Code of Good Data Protection Practices for&#xD;
      Big Data Projects of the European Data Protection Authority, the European General Data&#xD;
      Protection Regulation or another that may replace it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, clinical records will never be stored in a location other than the institution&#xD;
      where it is implemented. Savana does not use EMRs from individual patients, but aggregate&#xD;
      clinical information, which is also encrypted and secured. The aggregation of the data&#xD;
      ensures the impossibility of identifying patients or individual centres. The system is based&#xD;
      on the processing of a large amount of information (Big Data), so that the impact of random&#xD;
      errors is minimized. The use of this software is possible nowadays since there has been a&#xD;
      notable improvement in the implementation of EMRs, which may result in the use of this&#xD;
      software in significant investments for the use and better knowledge of the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this new technology allows a complete dissociation between the data obtained for&#xD;
      the current study and the personal data of the patient, since this information is obtained in&#xD;
      an aggregated and completely anonymous form. This clearly represents an advance in data&#xD;
      protection in the context of classical observational epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, only aggregated and completely anonymous data will be obtained, completely&#xD;
      dissociated from the personal data of each patient and centre. The confidentiality of patient&#xD;
      records will be maintained at all times. All study reports will contain only aggregated data&#xD;
      and will not identify patients, doctors or individual centres. At no time during the study,&#xD;
      the sponsor will receive information that may allow the identification of a patient or&#xD;
      individual centre.&#xD;
