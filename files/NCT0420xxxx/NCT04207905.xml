  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the renewal of the Healthy&#xD;
      Michigan Plan (HMP) Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver on December 21, 2018, for the period&#xD;
      January 1, 2019-December 31, 2023. This waiver provides approval for the state to require&#xD;
      Medicaid expansion beneficiaries ages 19-62 to complete and report 80 hours per month of&#xD;
      community engagement as a condition of eligibility, among other waiver provisions, beginning&#xD;
      January 1, 2020. Community engagement activities include employment, education, job training,&#xD;
      job search activities, participation in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, or community&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The State of Michigan will implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of community engagement requirements on Medicaid enrollment, health insurance&#xD;
      coverage, self-reported health status, access to and utilization of health services,&#xD;
      earnings, and employment, compared to a control group of HMP enrollees exempted from the&#xD;
      community engagement requirement for purposes of the evaluation.&#xD;

      Goals of the Demonstration&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the overarching&#xD;
      goals of the Healthy Michigan Plan (HMP) demonstration are to increase access to quality&#xD;
      health care, encourage the utilization of high-value services, promote beneficiary adoption&#xD;
      of healthy behaviors, and implement evidence-based practice initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of MDHHS for HMP include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving access to healthcare for uninsured or underinsured low-income Michigan&#xD;
           residents;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving the quality of healthcare services delivered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing uncompensated care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengthening beneficiary engagement and personal responsibility;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encouraging individuals to seek preventive care, adopt healthy behaviors, and make&#xD;
           responsible decisions about their healthcare;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supporting coordinated strategies to address social determinants of health in order to&#xD;
           promote positive health outcomes, greater independence, and improved quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helping uninsured or underinsured individuals manage their health care issues;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encouraging quality, continuity, and appropriate medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation for this demonstration is focused on examining:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of the community engagement requirement on enrollees' employment, earnings&#xD;
           and financial well-being; enrollment in other public support programs; health outcomes;&#xD;
           and health insurance status (HMP, commercial health insurance, or uninsurance);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent to which new eligibility and coverage policies impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital uncompensated care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Insurance coverage in the state&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall HMP enrollment and characteristics of HMP enrollees&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Enrollees' health care utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medicaid health service expenditures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact HMP has had on enrollees' health outcomes, employment status, and financial&#xD;
           well-being;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiences of HMP enrollees who are disenrolled regarding insurance coverage&#xD;
           status, access to care, and re-enrollment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicaid program sustainability, including Medicaid expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT design involves the random selection of a control group of HMP enrollees from across&#xD;
      the state who are expected to be subject to the community engagement requirement but who are&#xD;
      designated as being not subject to this requirement during the evaluation period (January 1,&#xD;
      2020 through December 31, 2023). This control group will be compared to an intervention group&#xD;
      of HMP enrollees who will be subject to the community engagement requirement. Individuals who&#xD;
      enroll in HMP after randomization occurs will not be eligible for inclusion in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random selection of the control group (22,917 HMP enrollees, representing 10% of the&#xD;
      individuals identified as subject to the work requirements as of November 2019) was performed&#xD;
      in December 2019. This sample size for the control group will enable longitudinal analysis of&#xD;
      key outcomes (e.g., employment, insurance coverage, self-reported health status, health&#xD;
      services utilization, income, and credit outcomes) over the demonstration period, with&#xD;
      sufficient statistical power to assess differences in these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources will include beneficiary surveys; state administrative data, including Medicaid&#xD;
      enrollment files, Medicaid administrative claims, specialty behavioral health administrative&#xD;
      claims, Michigan Care Improvement Registry immunization history, health risk assessment&#xD;
      tables, cost-share tables, and other Medicaid tables; state workforce data, including state&#xD;
      unemployment insurance program data; and public use data, including American Community&#xD;
      Survey, Current Population Survey, Medicaid enrollment data from Medicaid Budget and&#xD;
      Expenditure System (MBES), Medicaid and Medicare cost reports, Credit data, Behavioral Risk&#xD;
      Factor Surveillance System, Healthcare Cost &amp; Utilization Project (HCUP) inpatient discharge&#xD;
      data, and program administrative cost data.&#xD;

    On 3/4/2020 a federal judge ruled the HMP work requirement unlawful, thereby ending it and&#xD;
    suspending implementation of this RCT. This is not an IRB suspension.&#xD;

        Healthy Michigan Plan enrollees subject to the community engagement requirement are&#xD;
        eligible for the study. The RCT design involves the random selection by the State of&#xD;
        Michigan or its designee of a control group of HMP enrollees from across the state who are&#xD;
        expected to be subject to the community engagement requirement but who are designated as&#xD;
        being not subject to this requirement during the evaluation period (January 1, 2020 through&#xD;
        December 31, 2023). This control group will be compared to an intervention group of HMP&#xD;
        enrollees who will be subject to the community engagement requirement. Individuals who&#xD;
        enroll in HMP after randomization occurs will not be eligible for inclusion in the control&#xD;
        group.&#xD;
