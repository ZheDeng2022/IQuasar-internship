  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the expected pain response timeline for patients receiving epidural steroid&#xD;
      injections, our team plans to assess patient pain severity and degree of pain relief every 3&#xD;
      days for 23 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are already planning to receive an epidural steroid injection from their&#xD;
      physiatrist will be approached by study members on the day of their injection. If enrolled,&#xD;
      the patients will be contacted every 3 days for 23 days to determine the severity of pain and&#xD;
      degree of pain relief from the injection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any patient schedule for an epidural steroid injection (ESI) at Stallworth&#xD;
             Rehabilitation Hospital through the department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The epidural steroid injection will be performed as part of standard clinical care,&#xD;
             this study only aims to describe the clinical response to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ESI has been performed within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid injection elsewhere in body within last 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oral or intramuscular steroids within last 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to comply with required follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Please note that it is assumed that a patient scheduled for an epidural steroid&#xD;
             injection clinically is assumed to not have any contraindications to the injection&#xD;
             itself such as active systemic infection or pregnancy.&#xD;
