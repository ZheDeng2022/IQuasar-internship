  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects ages 18 - 45 years inclusive. It is designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and PK of single oral doses of VT-1598. Forty-eight subjects will be enrolled in the study at&#xD;
      1 site in the US and randomized to receive either VT-1598 or placebo in 6 dosage cohorts&#xD;
      (five fasted cohorts and one fed cohort). Each cohort will have 8 subjects; 6 subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single oral dose of VT-1598 and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo. Cohorts 1&#xD;
      - 5 will include 2 sentinel subjects randomized to different treatments. Cohort 6 (receiving&#xD;
      treatment after being fed a high-calorie, high-fat meal) will not include sentinel subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the study site before dosing and remain at the study site for&#xD;
      safety monitoring and PK assessments for at least 72 hours post-dose. Subjects will return to&#xD;
      the study site on study Days 7, 14, and 21 for outpatient safety monitoring and PK&#xD;
      assessments. There are no formal hypotheses being tested in this Phase 1 trial study. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are 1) to determine the safety of single-ascending oral&#xD;
      doses of VT-1598 in healthy adult subjects in a fasted state, and 2) to determine the safety&#xD;
      of single oral dose of VT-1598 in healthy adult subjects in a fed state.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects ages 18 - 45 years inclusive. It is designed to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and PK of single oral doses of VT-1598. Forty-eight subjects will be enrolled in the study at&#xD;
      1 site in the US and randomized to receive either VT-1598 or placebo in 6 dosage cohorts&#xD;
      (five fasted cohorts and one fed cohort). Cohorts 1 - 4 will run sequentially, but Cohorts 5&#xD;
      and 6 may be started concurrently. Each cohort will have 8 subjects; 6 subjects will receive&#xD;
      a single oral dose of VT-1598 and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo. Cohorts 1 - 5&#xD;
      will include 2 sentinel subjects randomized to different treatments. Cohort 6 (receiving&#xD;
      treatment after being fed a high-calorie, high-fat meal) will not include sentinel subjects.&#xD;
      VT-1598 will be administered in the following escalation schedule: Cohort 1 will receive 40&#xD;
      mg dose, Cohort 2 will receive 80 mg dose, Cohort 3 will receive 160 mg dose, Cohort 4 will&#xD;
      receive 320 mg dose, Cohort 5 will receive 640 mg dose, and Cohort 6 (fed cohort) will&#xD;
      receive 160 mg dose. Subjects will be admitted to the study site before dosing and remain at&#xD;
      the study site for safety monitoring and PK assessments for at least 72 hours post-dose.&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the study site on study Days 7, 14, and 21 for outpatient safety&#xD;
      monitoring and PK assessments. There are no formal hypotheses being tested in this Phase 1&#xD;
      trial study. The primary objectives of this study are 1) to determine the safety of&#xD;
      single-ascending oral doses of VT-1598 in healthy adult subjects in a fasted state, and 2) to&#xD;
      determine the safety of single oral dose of VT-1598 in healthy adult subjects in a fed state.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are 1) to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile&#xD;
      in plasma and urine of VT-1598 and its primary metabolite, VT-11134, in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects, and 2) to determine the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the PK profile&#xD;
      of VT-1598 and VT-11134 when a single oral dose of VT-1598 is given.&#xD;
