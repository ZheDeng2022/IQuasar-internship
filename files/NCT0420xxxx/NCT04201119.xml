    <textblock>
      Oxiris membrane is an efficient tool for inflammatory cytokines adsorption. Cardiac surgery&#xD;
      is followed by an inflammatory state mimicking sepsis. The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      cytokine adsorption by Oxiris® membrane can attenuate the inflammatory response and thus&#xD;
      decrease the microcirculation impairment that followed cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The quick SOFA score (qSOFA) assists health care providers in estimating the risk of morbidity and mortality due to sepsis.&#xD;
The score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points near the onset of infection was associated with a greater risk of death or prolonged intensive care unit stay.</description>

    <measure>Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score with Oxiris® membrane</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>SAPS II was designed to measure the severity of disease for patients admitted to Intensive care units aged 18 or more.&#xD;
24 hours after admission to the ICU, the measurement has been completed and resulted in an integer point score between 0 and 163 and a predicted mortality between 0% and 100%. No new score can be calculated during the stay. If a patient is discharged from the ICU and readmitted, a new SAPS II score can be calculated.&#xD;
This scoring system is mostly used to:&#xD;
describe the morbidity of a patient when comparing the outcome with other patients.&#xD;
describe the morbidity of a group of patients when comparing the outcome with another group of patients</description>
