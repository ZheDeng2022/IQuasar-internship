      Prospective, controlled, randomized study to compare Ambu AuraGain with Intersurgical i-Gel&#xD;
      mask during mechanical ventilation in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that when comparing the Ambu® AuraGainTM with Intersurgical&#xD;
      i-GelTM mask, the Ambu® AuraGainTM would exhibit a higher oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP)&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to compare the Ambu AuraGain with the i-Gel in terms of safety and efficacy&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation in critical phase of the pneumoperitoneum in lateral decubitus&#xD;
      and reverse trendelemburg position. Secondary objectives are comparing insertion time, number&#xD;
      of attempts, ventilatory airway peak pressure, time and success rates for gastric tube&#xD;
      insertion and the incidence of side effects.&#xD;

      Design: Prospective, controlled, randomized study. Participants: After approval by the local&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Committee, all patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy at Hospital Plató (Barcelona) will be screened for participation. Patients&#xD;
      will be informed about the study and they must provide written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for orotracheal intubation during surgery will be considered as a study withdrawal&#xD;
      criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are: insertion time, number of attempts, ventilatory airway peak&#xD;
      pressure, time, and success rates for gastric tube insertion and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been calculated to detect a significant difference in oropharyngeal leak&#xD;
      pressure (OLP) between two devices. According to the results of previous studies, the&#xD;
      investigators assume a mean OLP of 29.2 (3.3) cmH2O for the i-Gel and of 34 (5) cmH2O for the&#xD;
      Ambu AuraGain. In order to detect a difference of 10%, assuming a standard deviation of 5&#xD;
      cmH2O for both devices, 44 patients are required per group with a power of 80% and an alpha&#xD;
      error of 0.05. To cover against a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 98 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be numbered consecutively and assigned to one of the&#xD;
      two groups, 'LMA Ambu AuraGain' or 'i-gel', using a computer-generated random number table,&#xD;
      by the principal investigator. The individual result will be kept in opaque envelopes. After&#xD;
      the recruitment, the day of the procedure, the enrolling investigator will open sealed,&#xD;
      opaque envelopes that conceal the group allocation. Participants will be blinded to their&#xD;
      group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures In the operating room, intravenous access will be secured and routine monitoring&#xD;
      using ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (EtCO2) and sevoflurane (EtSevo) (Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Compact Critical Care Monitor; GE&#xD;
      Healthcare). After pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen by facemask for 3 min, anaesthesia will&#xD;
      be induced with intravenous Fentanyl 50 μg/ml (2μg/kg), Propofol 1% (2-3 mg/kg) and Rocuronio&#xD;
      1% (0,6 mg/kg). The investigators will continue ventilating with 100% oxygen using a facemask&#xD;
      at least for 1 min until optimum conditions for laryngeal mask insertion are achieved (loss&#xD;
      of eyelash reflex, relaxation of the jaw, immobility, and apnoea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with Sevoflurane 2% in an air-oxygen mixture using a circle&#xD;
      system with a fresh gas flow of 2 l/min. Additional intravenous Fentanyl will be&#xD;
      administrated as clinically needed during anesthesia by an increase of 10-20% in blood&#xD;
      pressure or heart rate. Laryngeal masks size will be determined according to the&#xD;
      manufacturers weight-based recommendations and the insertion technique will be according to&#xD;
      the recommendations of the Instruction Manual. After successful insertion, the cuff will be&#xD;
      inflated with air until 60 cmH2O intracuff pressure (ICP) measured using an Ambu® airway&#xD;
      pressure manometer (AMBU, S.L. B- 81040149, Alcala, Madrid, Spain). The second measurement of&#xD;
      intracuff pressure will be performed for surgeries taking over an hour to ensure that the&#xD;
      intracuff pressure has not changed significantly (± 5 cmH2O) since the last calibrated&#xD;
      intracuff pressure. An effective airway will be judged by a square wave capnograph trace,&#xD;
      bilateral chest auscultation and no audible leak with peak airway pressures at 12 cmH2O or&#xD;
      greater during gentle manual ventilation. The device will be connected to the respiratory&#xD;
      machine (Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Compact Critical Care Monitor; GE Healthcare) and patients will be&#xD;
      ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, adjusting the respiratory rate to an end-tidal CO2&#xD;
      of 30-35mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gastric tube will be inserted via the drain tube. The correct placement of the gastric tube&#xD;
      will be confirmed by free movement during insertion and by aspiration of gastric fluid or&#xD;
      detection of injected air by epigastric auscultation. Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP) will&#xD;
      be measured by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3&#xD;
      liters/min (maximum allowed 40 cmH2O) recording the pressure at which equilibrium has been&#xD;
      reached or audible air is leaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leak pressure will be recorded before peritoneal insufflation and during&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum. The peritoneal insufflation pressure will be set at 12 mmHg. At the end of&#xD;
      the surgery, the anesthesiologist will remove the laryngeal masks when the patients obey&#xD;
      commands. The patients will be transferred to the Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to be&#xD;
      monitored after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be entered into an Excel Database. All statistical analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted using software from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS,&#xD;
      Version 18.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution of data will be determined using&#xD;
      Kolmogorov- Smirnov analysis. The quantitative variables will be summarized with means and&#xD;
      standard deviations or with medians and percentiles P25 and P75 in case of asymmetric&#xD;
      distributions, and qualitative variables with frequencies and percentages. To study the&#xD;
      relationships between qualitative variables, contingency tables will be made and the&#xD;
      Chi-square or Fisher's tests will be used. The difference in oropharyngeal leak pressure&#xD;
      (OLP) between two devices will be analyzed by a Student ́s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      in case of non-normal distributions. To compare the incidence of side effects between the&#xD;
      groups, the exact Fisher test or Chi-squared tests will be used. Significant differences will&#xD;
      be quantified with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
