      To evaluate the suitability of two odour capturing techniques for early detection of skin&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the suitability of two odour capturing techniques for early&#xD;
      detection of skin cancer. The techniques to capture VOCs are: a) solid phase microextraction&#xD;
      (SPME) and b) collection of VOCs via an adsorptive patch, worn on the skin. The objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the suitability of two techniques for collecting VOCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odour samples from cancerous and healthy skin will be captured using the two non-invasive&#xD;
      techniques. The techniques will initially be tested in a laboratory environment. They will&#xD;
      then be applied in parallel to patients and healthy people. VOC compounds of odour samples&#xD;
      will be analysed for their profiles in respect of cancerous and healthy skins. The VOCs&#xD;
      profiles will be recorded in a VOC bank for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial tests, patients (n=20) with skin cancer will be recruited from Poole&#xD;
      and Dorset County Hospitals. Arrangement will be made to obtain odour samples by positioning&#xD;
      patches on the cancerous skin sites (for approximately 30 minutes) of patients and recover&#xD;
      them. To obtain samples from healthy people (n=10), staff and students within the university&#xD;
      are invited to participate in this research by providing odour samples from their skins using&#xD;
      the same type of patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, VOCs from skin cancer patients will also be collected from patients with the&#xD;
      SPME fibres described earlier. The SPME device is roughly equivalent in size and shape to a&#xD;
      ballpoint pen, from the tip of which an adsorbent fibre can be extended. The SPME device is&#xD;
      held statically with a flexible clamp (a weighted clamp which rests on a bench / desk near&#xD;
      the patient), and is positioned so that the tip of the fibre rests close to, but not&#xD;
      touching, the affected skin area. The fibre needs to be held in place to sample the air above&#xD;
      the affected skin for a pre-determined period of time, likely to be 15 - 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Specifics such as the sampling time and related factors will be evaluated during the initial&#xD;
      laboratory testing. Following the defined time period of sampling, the fibre is retracted&#xD;
      into the body of the SPME device (to protect it), and the device is returned to the&#xD;
      laboratory for analysis. The high temperatures involved in GCMS analysis cause VOCs captured&#xD;
      by the SPME device to be released (desorbed) and they are subsequently swept through the GCMS&#xD;
      system for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VOC samples from both the techniques will be transported to Bournemouth university for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome will be the identification of the most suitable VOC collection technique (SPME vs&#xD;
      patch) by comparing the VOC profiles of cancerous and healthy skin.&#xD;
