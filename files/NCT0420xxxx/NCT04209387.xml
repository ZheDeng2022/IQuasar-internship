  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current practice for diagnosing and managing PTSD relies primarily on subjective clinical&#xD;
      assessments by clinicians as well as patient self-report. An independent, objective and&#xD;
      neuro-physiology based method for directly assessing brain function is not available, but is&#xD;
      much needed to improve diagnosis and management of PTSD. To address this critical need, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to test a set of novel biomarkers which are based on measures of&#xD;
      coherent activity among the regions of cerebral cortex during sleep. In preliminary studies&#xD;
      on EEG acquired during sleep from Veterans with PTSD alone as well as other co-morbidities,&#xD;
      the investigators have shown that the neuromarkers were highly sensitive/specific to the&#xD;
      presence of PTSD, and highly sensitive to the severity of symptoms in PTSD group. The overall&#xD;
      goal of this project is to further validate these novel neurophysiology marker in&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective studies&#xD;

      The project involves 3 types of research studies :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1. This is a retrospective study where the Neuromarker analyses will be applied to a&#xD;
      large existing database (n=656) containing sleep EEG recordings along with health and&#xD;
      functional outcome measures, from Veterans with PTSD only (n=107), TBI only (n=126), both&#xD;
      PTSD and TBI (n=87), depression only (n=80), and controls (no PTSD/TBI/Depression; n=256).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2. This is a prospective study with n=10 Veterans with PTSD and n=10 controls to&#xD;
      evaluate potential improvement on the performance of the Neuromarkers using a dense array&#xD;
      (64) EEG montage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3. This is a prospective study with PTSD (n=50) at multiple times during the Veterans&#xD;
      ongoing clinical treatment for PTSD. sleep EEG measures will be collected at pretreatment,&#xD;
      after first session of therapy, immediately after completion of therapy, and at 3-month post&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For retrospective Study 1, the investigators will evaluate the performance of the PTSD&#xD;
      neuromarker, in terms of sensitivity/ specificity/accuracy, utilizing a database of n=656&#xD;
      Veterans who have previously enrolled in the VA Portland Health Care System Sleep Laboratory&#xD;
      Data Repository. The data repository contains sleep polysomnography (PSG) recordings (EEG and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory parameters), demographic information, medical history, and the following&#xD;
      validated surveys (1) Epworth Sleepiness Scale, (2) NIH PROMIS, (3) Insomnia Severity Index,&#xD;
      (4) Functional Outcomes of Sleep, (5) Patient Health Questionnaire, (6) PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      checklist (PCL-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For prospective study 1, the investigators will perform sleep-EEG studies in n=10 PTSD and&#xD;
      n=10 control subjects using a 64 channel EEG montage and will compare the performance of the&#xD;
      neuromarkers, in distinguishing PTSD from non-PTSD groups, with the accuracy of diagnosis&#xD;
      using only six EEG electrodes as performed in Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For prospective study 2, n=50 Veterans with PTSD symptoms undergoing the Veterans clinical&#xD;
      treatment at the Bedford VA will be recruited and the following data will be acquired:&#xD;
      Sleep-EEG, Demographic, Medical History, and Use of Medications forms, The Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Short Form, NIH PROMIS, PCL-5, and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5).&#xD;
      Primary independent variable will be changes in the Neuromarker and the dependent variables&#xD;
      will consist of the functional and quality of life measures.&#xD;
