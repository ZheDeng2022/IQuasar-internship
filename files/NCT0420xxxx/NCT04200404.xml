    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study of CS1001 in combination with regorafenib in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or refractory cancers. There will be a dose escalation portion in&#xD;
      &quot;allcomers&quot;to find a suitable dose of regorafenib for combination use with CS1001. This study&#xD;
      will also enroll participants with specific tumor types in the phase II part of the study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of the combined regimen (RP2D of regorafenib&#xD;
      + CS 1001)&#xD;
