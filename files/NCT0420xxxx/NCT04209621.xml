      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are cancers often&#xD;
      treated with the drug ibrutinib. For some people, ibrutinib stops working. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if adding another drug can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test how people with ibrutinib-resistant CLL respond to duvelisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with CLL or SLL that is no longer responding to ibrutinib or has&#xD;
      developed mutations that could stop it from working&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan. For this, participants will have a dye injected into a vein. They will lie in a&#xD;
           machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy. For this, a needle injected into the participant s bone will remove&#xD;
           marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional lymph node biopsy. For this, the participant s whole lymph node or part of it&#xD;
           will be removed through the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional lymphapheresis. For this, the participant s blood is removed through a vein in&#xD;
           one arm, the white blood cells separated out, and the blood returned through a vein in&#xD;
           the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take duvelisib twice daily by mouth. They will continue ibrutinib at their&#xD;
      current dose for the first 6 months. They will continue to take duvelisib until their CLL/SLL&#xD;
      stops responding or they develop intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an antibiotic and antiviral medication. They may take steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests every 2 weeks during the first 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have monthly follow-up visits during the first 6 months and every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter. These will include repeats of some of the screening tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), ibrutinib&#xD;
           resistance is predominantly caused by somatic mutations in BTK and PLCG2. Virtually all&#xD;
           patients with detectable mutations eventually develop progressive disease. Patients who&#xD;
           discontinue ibrutinib often have rapidly progressive disease that can be difficult to&#xD;
           control. These observations suggest that BTK inhibitors still exert at least a partial&#xD;
           anti-tumor effect. Outcomes after ibrutinib discontinuation are poor. Early detection of&#xD;
           BTK and PLCG2 mutations represents an opportunity for preemptive intervention to&#xD;
           eliminate the resistant clone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duvelisib is a dual PI3K-gamma and zeta inhibitor. Duvelisib monotherapy improved&#xD;
           progression-free survival and overall response rate compared to ofatumumab and had a&#xD;
           manageable safety profile in subjects with previously treated CLL/SLL. Based on these&#xD;
           results, duvelisib received US approval for CLL/SLL after at least 2 prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will assess duvelisib in patients who develop disease progression or BTK&#xD;
           and/or PLCG2 mutations on ibrutinib. Duvelisib will overlap with ibrutinib for the first&#xD;
           six 28-day cycles to prevent disease acceleration often seen in patients who discontinue&#xD;
           ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To investigate the rate of overall response to duvelisib in patients with&#xD;
      ibrutinib-resistant CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on current treatment for CLL/SLL with ibrutinib and at least one of the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BTK and/or PLCG2 mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progressive CLL per iwCLL guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known Richter transformation will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study with a safety lead-in&#xD;
           cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment plan: Duvelisib will be administered with ibrutinib for the first six28-day&#xD;
           cycles then&#xD;
&#xD;
      duvelisib monotherapy will be administered continuously until disease progression or&#xD;
      intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: until disease progression or intolerance.&#xD;
