    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well of pembrolizumab and a vaccine&#xD;
      therapy (ATL-DC vaccine) work in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) and can be removed by surgery (surgically accessible). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines, such&#xD;
      as ATL-DC vaccine, may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab and ATL-DC vaccine may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma compared to ATL-DC alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the influence of pembrolizumab on the cell cycle-related genetic signature&#xD;
      within the tumor microenvironment of progressive/recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the influence of adjuvant autologous tumor lysatepulsed dendritic cell&#xD;
      (ATL-DC) vaccination on peripheral T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab and ATL-DC vaccination in&#xD;
      progressive/recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the 6 month progression-free survival (PFS6) based on Response Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria in patients treated on both arms of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To calculate the overall survival of recurrent glioblastoma patients treated on both arms&#xD;
      of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the associations between exploratory biomarkers, clinical outcomes, and&#xD;
      adverse events which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Estimating the correlation of quantitative assessments of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte&#xD;
      (TIL) density or the interferon (IFN) gamma-associated genetic signature with clinical&#xD;
      responses to pembrolizumab and ATL-DC in recurrent glioblastoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Estimating the efficacy of pembrolizumab and ATL-DC through PFS6, PFS and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) as defined by RANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Estimating the efficacy of pembrolizumab and ATL-DC through PFS6, PFS, and OS as defined&#xD;
      by immunotherapy RANO (iRANO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Exploring whether oligoclonal T cell populations within tumor tissue are similarly&#xD;
      expanded in peripheral blood after ATL-DC vaccination and/or pembrolizumab, and correlating&#xD;
      with clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. Exploring whether changes in specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters&#xD;
      correlate with tumor and peripheral blood immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Beginning 14 days prior to scheduled surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. After surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycle repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ATL-DC intradermally (ID) with poly ICLC&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) every 2 weeks for up to 3 doses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Beginning 14 days prior to scheduled surgery, patients receive placebo IV. After&#xD;
      surgery, patients receive placebo IV on day 1. Cycle repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ATL-DC ID with poly ICLC&#xD;
      IM every 2 weeks for up to 3 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
                  of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in&#xD;
                  situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known tumor primarily localized to the brainstem or spinal cord&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;

             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as hepatitis C virus [HCV]&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid [RNA] is detected) infection. Note: no testing for hepatitis B and&#xD;
             hepatitis C is required unless mandated by local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
