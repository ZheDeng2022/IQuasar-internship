      The aim of the study is to investigate disease in volunteers deliberately infected with&#xD;
      influenza A(H3N2), including biological markers of inflammation and immune response, and&#xD;
      changes in physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, physical&#xD;
      activity, oxygen saturation and electrocardiographic data during the onset of influenza&#xD;
      infection. Ultimately, this may lead to prediction of symptomatic disease at an earlier stage&#xD;
      to allow more effective interventions. The experimental medicine study design will involve&#xD;
      human influenza infection challenge, whereby volunteers will be inoculated with influenza&#xD;
      virus and monitored in hospital for 10 days as they develop and get better from flu.&#xD;
      Continuously-monitoring wearable physiological sensors will be given to the participants 7&#xD;
      days before this and worn continuously until the end of the flu infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza ('flu') is one of the most common causes of severe lung infection. Seasonal flu&#xD;
      affects between 10 and 46% of the population each year and causes around 12 deaths in every&#xD;
      100,000 people infected. Furthermore, new strains of flu viruses emerge unpredictably every&#xD;
      few years, causing pandemics that spread rapidly across the world. Since currently available&#xD;
      antiviral drugs and vaccines cannot prevent these outbreaks, it is essential to be able to&#xD;
      identify flu infections at an early stage to enable rapid treatment of individuals and&#xD;
      implementation of public health measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate disease in volunteers deliberately infected with&#xD;
      influenza A(H3N2), including biological markers of inflammation and immune response, and&#xD;
      changes in physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, physical&#xD;
      activity, oxygen saturation and electrocardiographic data during the onset of influenza&#xD;
      infection. To achieve this, the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers and inoculate&#xD;
      them with a flu virus, after which they will be observed in hospital while they develop a&#xD;
      cold. Each volunteer will be given a number of devices that they will wear before and during&#xD;
      infection. In addition, they will have blood and nasal samples taken to examine the way their&#xD;
      immune system responds to infection. The resulting data will be analysed to see if the&#xD;
      sensors data correlate with the onset of infection and these will be compared with measures&#xD;
      of the immune response. Ultimately, the investigators anticipate that optimised sensor data&#xD;
      from devices to be developed may be useful in rapidly detecting when someone is about to&#xD;
      develop flu infection, so that they can quickly be treated and outbreaks may be identified at&#xD;
      an early stage.&#xD;
