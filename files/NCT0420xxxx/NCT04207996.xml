      This study aims to characterize how vagus nerve compound action potentials (CNAPs) conduct&#xD;
      along the vagus nerve in gastroparetic patients receiving GES therapy using a flexible,&#xD;
      non-invasive multielectrode array (MEA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      1, in a small cohort of 5-10 gastroparetic patients receiving GES therapy, we will determine&#xD;
      the optimal multielectrode array (MEA) recording electrode configuration (e.g., surface area&#xD;
      covered and electrode density) for the noninvasive measurement of gastric electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (GES) evoked compound nerve action potentials (CNAP) from the skin surface over&#xD;
      the left and right cervical vagus nerve. During Phase 2, a study of 15-30 gastroparetic&#xD;
      patients receiving GES therapy, we will use the optimal MEA configuration identified in Task&#xD;
      1 to measure and classify the vagal CNAP response signature (including the direction of&#xD;
      travel and anatomical location of the strongest signal (e.g., to infer the anatomical course&#xD;
      of the cervical vagus in each subject) with respect to subject-reported symptom scores via&#xD;
      the 9-item Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) survey. We will cross-reference these&#xD;
      results with the preliminary results obtained with bipolar ECG electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a symptom survey questionnaire and Gastric Cardinal Symptom Index&#xD;
      (GCSI) questionnaire. Two electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes will be placed on both sides&#xD;
      of the neck overlying the area near the carotid pulse (which overlies the carotid artery in&#xD;
      the neck on the side of your neck) where the vagus nerve is located.This is done in order to&#xD;
      measure the vagal nerve electrical impulses in the neck (electrical signal travelling in the&#xD;
      nerve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two ECG electrodes will be placed on each of the arms and one on the chest for measurement of&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) ( a test to measure the electrical activity of your heart). Three ECG&#xD;
      electrodes may be placed on the stomach to measure the electrical activity of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the placement of the electrodes, a 2-5 minute recording will be made.The GES device&#xD;
      will be interrogated (data will be obtained) for the settings of the device and these will be&#xD;
      recorded by the study team. After the recording, the electrodes will be removed from the neck&#xD;
      and a newer kind of electrodes called as MEA (Multi electrode Array)) devices that contain&#xD;
      multiple (tens to thousands of small electrodes) will be placed on either one, or both sides&#xD;
      of the neck. This film will help capture the vagus signal from a large area and help define&#xD;
      the path of the vagus nerve. After the placement of this film with small electrodes, another&#xD;
      2-5 minute recording will be made. The electrodes will then be removed and subject will be&#xD;
      allowed to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time required for Phase 1 will be approximately an hour (60 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will complete a symptom survey questionnaire and Gastric Cardinal Symptom Index&#xD;
      (GCSI) questionnaire. Multiple electrodes (MEA) will be placed on either one or both sides of&#xD;
      the neck. One ECG electrodes will be placed on each of the arms, and one on the chest for&#xD;
      measurement of electrocardiogram (ECG). Three ECG electrodes will be placed on the stomach to&#xD;
      measure the electrical activity of the stomach. After the placement of the electrodes a 2-5&#xD;
      minute recording will be made. The GES device will be interrogated (data will be obtained)&#xD;
      for the settings and these will be recorded by the study team. With the GES stimulator on, a&#xD;
      2-5 minute recording will be made. Then, the GES stimulator will be reprogrammed to deliver&#xD;
      the signal at 50% of the original power, and another 2-5 minute recording will be made. Then,&#xD;
      the device will again be programmed to deliver the signal at 25% of the original power&#xD;
      setting on the device. Another 2-5 minute recording will be made. After this, the device will&#xD;
      be reprogrammed to the original settings. The electrodes will then be removed and subject&#xD;
      will be allowed to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time required for Phase 2 will be approximately an hour (60 minutes).&#xD;
