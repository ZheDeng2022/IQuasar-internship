      This is a global, multicenter, open-label pre-approval access program to provide access to&#xD;
      pralsetinib (BLU-667) until such time that pralsetinib becomes available through other&#xD;
      mechanisms or the Sponsor chooses to discontinue the program.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1a. Pathologically documented and definitively diagnosed non-resectable or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
        with a RET fusion for patients who are either treatment naïve, or who have been previously&#xD;
        treated with systemic therapy. In the presence of a primary driver mutation, such as EGFR,&#xD;
        ALK, ROS1, NTRK, or BRAF, the patient must be treated with the appropriate targeted therapy&#xD;
        first. Patient is eligible if RET fusion is confirmed AND patient has undergone initial&#xD;
        therapy for his/her driver mutation, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        1b. Pathologically documented and definitively diagnosed RET mutation in advanced MTC&#xD;
        patients who are treatment naïve or who have been previously treated with MKI therapy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        1c. Pathologically documented and definitively diagnosed advanced solid tumor with an&#xD;
        oncogenic RET fusion previously treated with standard of care appropriate for the tumor&#xD;
        type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If previously treated with a selective RET inhibitor (e.g., RETEVMO), confirm patient&#xD;
        has not progressed but has discontinued due to adverse event(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient is not eligible for an ongoing study of pralsetinib or cannot access an ongoing&#xD;
        study of pralsetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age. 5. Patient has adequate vital organ function, including&#xD;
        heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, bone marrow and endocrine, and is expected to tolerate&#xD;
        therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No presence of clinically symptomatic interstitial lung disease or interstitial&#xD;
        pneumonitis, including radiation pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of daily living or&#xD;
        requiring therapeutic intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient or patient's legal guardian, if permitted by local regulatory authorities,&#xD;
        intends to provide informed consent prior to the start of treatment with pralsetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient does not require therapy with a concomitant medication that is a strong&#xD;
        inhibitor or strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient has not received treatment with any systemic anticancer therapy (except for&#xD;
        immunotherapy or other antibody therapies) and all forms of radiotherapy within 14 days or&#xD;
        5 half-lives prior to the first dose of pralsetinib. Pralsetinib may be started within&#xD;
        these washout periods if considered by the healthcare provider to be safe and within the&#xD;
        best interest of the patient, with prior Sponsor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Patient has not received treatment with any immunotherapy or other antibody therapy&#xD;
        within 28 days prior to the first dose of pralsetinib (immune related toxicities must have&#xD;
        resolved to &lt; Grade 2 prior to starting pralsetinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Patient has not had a major surgical procedure (minor surgical procedures such as&#xD;
        central venous catheter placement, tumor needle biopsy, and feeding tube placement are not&#xD;
        considered major surgical procedures) within 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
        pralsetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        12. Women must be willing, if not postmenopausal or surgically sterile, to abstain from&#xD;
        sexual intercourse or employ highly effective contraception during pralsetinib&#xD;
        administration period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of pralsetinib. Men, if&#xD;
        not surgically sterile, must be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ highly&#xD;
        effective contraception during pralsetinib administration period and for at least 90 days&#xD;
        after the last dose of pralsetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        13. Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
