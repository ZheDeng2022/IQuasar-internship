  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multiple-ascending dose&#xD;
      study in patients with hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study medication treatment will be 13 weeks and includes a Fixed-Dose&#xD;
      Treatment period and a Dose Titration Treatment period. The Fixed-Dose Treatment period&#xD;
      consists of multiple daily dosing at a fixed dose level. Once patients have completed the&#xD;
      Fixed-Dose Treatment period, patients will enter the Dose Titration Treatment period where&#xD;
      PCO371 (or placebo), oral calcium and oral active vitamin D can each be titrated according to&#xD;
      the patient's albumin-corrected serum calcium level.&#xD;
