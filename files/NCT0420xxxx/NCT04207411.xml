    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of anesthetic blocks repeated with&#xD;
      bupivacaine in the management of patients with persistent dentoalveolar pain. Goals are to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms of persistent dentoalveolar&#xD;
      pain and to highlight predictive criteria for the effectiveness of anesthetic blocks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept, randomized, controlled prospective pharmacological trial, single&#xD;
      blind, with two parallel arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated locoregional&#xD;
      anesthetic blocks with bupivacaine in patient's persistent dentoalveolar pain compared to a&#xD;
      control group receives a simulated anesthesia (local anesthesia with lidocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the tolerance of repeated locoregional anesthetic blocks to bupivacaine&#xD;
           patients with persistent dentoalveolar pain compared to control receiving simulated&#xD;
           anesthesia (local anesthesia with lidocaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate demographic and nosological predictive factors (age of symptoms,&#xD;
           Quantitative Sensory Testing results) and psychometric (anxiety, depression,&#xD;
           dramatization) of the effectiveness of anesthetic blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, the patients participate will be randomized to anesthetic&#xD;
      block treatment with bupivacaine or lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 1st step of the study patients will participate at 6 visits (day -7, day 0, day 7,&#xD;
      day 14, day 21 and M2) and will receive either a series of 4 locoregional anesthetic blocks&#xD;
      with bupivacaine or a series of 4 local anesthesia with lidocaine (&quot;simulated&quot; control group)&#xD;
      at day 0, day 7, day 14 and day 21. The main criterion is raised 2 months after the end of&#xD;
      the series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2nd step&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients from experimental group will be followed until month 6 (2 visits: month 3&#xD;
           month 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients from control group :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will received in open (if they want) a series of 4 locoregional anesthetic blocks with&#xD;
           bupivacaine (day56, day,63, day 70, day 77) and will be followed during 6 months after&#xD;
           the first injection (7 visits: day 63, day 70, day 77, month 3, month 4, month 5, month&#xD;
           8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will be followed until month 6 ((2 visits: month 3 month 6).&#xD;

    <description>This self-questionnaire will assess the pain intensity and impact of pain on the patient's life. He understands : a body image ; the maximum pain, the weakest pain, the usual pain of the last 15 days (numerical scale 0 to 10); the description of the current analgesic treatment; a assessment of relief by a percentage scale (0 to 100%); the study of the impact of pain on mood, relationships with other people, walking, sleep, work, joy of life, leisure, activities in general (scales numeric, rating from 0 (normal) to 10 (activity impossible).</description>

    <description>Its purpose is to evaluate in a general way the effectiveness of a treatment felt by the patient. This scale consists of 7 levels of descriptors answering the question &quot;Since start of treatment, how would you describe the change (if any) in your limitations of activities, your symptoms, your emotions and your quality of life in general, related to your affection painful? &quot;, Divided according to 3 modalities: improvement: (7) very, (6) medium, (5) slightly, unchanged( 4), worsen (3) slightly, (2) medium, (1) very.</description>

    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Assessment Questionnaire is a self-questionnaire that has been specifically validated to assess and monitor the different aspects of neuropathic pain and is sensitive to change. This questionnaire consists of twelve questions, ten of which relate to the description of pain by measuring its intensity using a numerical scale, that is, by grading the pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain imaginable). The remaining two questions each offer five answers about the duration of spontaneous pain over 24 hours (from &quot;1 to 3 hours per day&quot; to &quot;continuously&quot;) and the number of painful seizures (paroxysms) over 24 hours (from &quot;no painful crisis&quot; to &quot;more than 20&quot;). The ten descriptive questions can be grouped into 5 dimensions. The sum of the 10 questions gives the total score scored on 100 and each dimension gives a sub-score.</description>
