  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer with Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) can&#xD;
      lead to associated musculoskeletal pain and may cause patients to discontinue important&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial assessing the affect of Vitamin B12 on AI-associated&#xD;
      joint pain and other outcomes. Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment or&#xD;
      control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess whether daily oral Vitamin B12 decreases average joint pain in women with&#xD;
      AI-Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether daily vitamin B12 improves functional quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the impact of treatment on serum inflammatory cytokine levels (C- reactive&#xD;
           protein) between baseline and various points in treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the American Cancer Society, there were more than 250,000 new breast cancer&#xD;
      cases in 2017. Incidence of breast cancer increases with age, with more than 75% of patients&#xD;
      being postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis. In addition, hormone receptors (HR) are over&#xD;
      expressed in the majority of breast cancer tumors in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two classes of anti-endocrine therapies are used for treatment of HR-positive breast cancer:&#xD;
      tamoxifen and the AIs, which can only be used to treat postmenopausal women because they are&#xD;
      ineffective in women with functional ovaries. Joint pain is a significant AI-associated&#xD;
      toxicity, affecting as many as 50% of patients. No factors associated with breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment (such as chemotherapy) or co-morbid conditions (such as diabetes or body mass&#xD;
      index) have been clearly shown to be predictive of the development of joint pain. The cause&#xD;
      of AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms remains elusive but some think it is associated&#xD;
      with the direct effects of estrogen deprivation on bone, neurohormonal changes which result&#xD;
      in change in pain sensitivity, and immune system changes that alter the circulating or local&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies report more than 20% of patients are no longer taking their AI chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen because of AI-associated joint pain. As many as 40,000 women are affected by this&#xD;
      toxicity in the United States annually and up to 20,000 women discontinue AI therapy because&#xD;
      of intolerable joint pain and muscle aches. The current treatment for AI associated&#xD;
      musculoskeletal symptoms is limited to oral pain medications and exercise, but, neither&#xD;
      intervention has optimal effects, and the long term use of oral pain medication is&#xD;
      problematic. Improvement in the treatment of AI associated musculoskeletal symptoms is needed&#xD;
      to improve compliance with therapy, and thereby lead to improved breast cancer outcomes and&#xD;
      survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team conducted a pilot study (Campbell et al. Breast J, 2018) which suggested that&#xD;
      vitamin B12 reduces pain and improves quality of life for participants taking aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AIs) who experienced AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. This study aims to&#xD;
      confirm these results in a phase III randomized prospective trial. If confirmed, Vitamin B12&#xD;
      would become a safe and cost-effective option for the treatment of AI-related musculoskeletal&#xD;
      symptoms, leading to improved cancer outcomes and survivorship.&#xD;
