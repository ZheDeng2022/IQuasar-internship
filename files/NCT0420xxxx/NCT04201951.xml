      Postpartum hemorrhage and its complications are very well known causes for maternal mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity especially in developing countries. World Health Organization Recommendations&#xD;
      for Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), on 2012 included the use of&#xD;
      uterotonics for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during the third stage of labor&#xD;
      for all births. Tranexamic acid (TA) is antifibrinolytic agent used to decrease blood loss in&#xD;
      surgery and health conditions associated with increased bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane Systematic Review from the best available evidence to determine whether TA is&#xD;
      effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment the review&#xD;
      concluded that TA (in addition to uterotonic medications) decreases blood loss postpartum and&#xD;
      prevents PPH and blood transfusions following vaginal birth and abdominal delivery in women&#xD;
      at low risk of PPH based on studies of mixed quality. There was insufficient evidence to draw&#xD;
      conclusions about serious side effects and the effects of TA on venous thromboembolic events&#xD;
      and mortality beside its use in high-risk women was not investigated on&#xD;
