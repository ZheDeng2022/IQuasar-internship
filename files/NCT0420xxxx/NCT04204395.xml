    <textblock>
      *Primary: To compare the control group, women in the experimental group will have lower level&#xD;
      of labor pain after the intervention of peanut ball usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Secondary: To compare the control group, women in the experimental group will have higher&#xD;
      level of support and control after the intervention of peanut ball usage; To compare the&#xD;
      control group, women in the experimental group will have lower level of anxiety after&#xD;
      intervention of peanut ball usage; To compare the control group, women in the experimental&#xD;
      group will have shorter duration of labor after intervention of peanut ball usage.&#xD;

      We will ask the participants to join this research on the department of obstetric outpatient&#xD;
      department, and give the consent form to sign. Then we will allocate the participant into the&#xD;
      experiment group or the control group, furthermore, we will give the sheet which includes the&#xD;
      information about peanut ball usage, like the destination, method, position, duration, and&#xD;
      quick response code of the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they finish the admission process in the delivery room, we will give the peanut ball to&#xD;
      the participants who is in the experimental group, and the participants of the control group&#xD;
      will receive the routine care of delivery room.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed perception of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The three post-tests will be assessed when 30 minutes after each intervention, and cervical dilation is during 5 to 7 centimeters, and during 8 to 10 centimeters.</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of Pain assessed by Visual analogue scale for pain(VAS-P). Range of the VAS-P score is 0 to 10, higher scores means worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed perception of Support and Control in Birth</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The post-test will be assessed within 24 hours after delivery.</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of Support and Control assessed by Chinese version support and control scale in birth(C-SCIB). The range of the score is from 33 to 165, higher score means better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed perception of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The three post-tests will be assessed when 30 minutes after each intervention, and cervical dilation is during 5 to 7 centimeters, and during 8 to 10 centimeters.</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of anxiety assessed by Visual analogue scale for anxiety(VAS-A). Range of the score is 0 to 10, higher scores means worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changed trajectory of Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline will be assessed when the cervical dilation is during 0 to 3 centimeters. The three post-tests will be assessed when 30 minutes after each intervention, and cervical dilation is during 5 to 7 centimeters, and during 8 to 10 centimeters.</time_frame>
