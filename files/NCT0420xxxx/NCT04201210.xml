  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HSCT is currently the only curative option for SCD but less than 20% of SCD patients have a&#xD;
      MD donor available. So far, all curative approaches beyond a MSD HSCT at young age are&#xD;
      non-satisfactory. With the lack of a suitable donor for the vast majority of patients, the&#xD;
      major question of this trial is, if a haploidentical αß/CD19+ T-cell depleted HSCT can be a&#xD;
      valid alternative to a MSD HSCT. The main challenge in non-malignant diseases is to offer a&#xD;
      safe and GvHD-free HSCT without rejection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Can an α/ß depleted T-Haplo-HSCT with regard to disease free survival, adverse events and&#xD;
      safety be considered equivalent to a matched sibling donor transplantation (MSD), in order to&#xD;
      offer cure for the majority of patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of a α/ß T-depleted haploidentical HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune reconstitution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fertility It is expected that the use of TCRαβ+ and CD19+ depleted haploidentical cell&#xD;
           grafts in combination with the less aggressive and well tolerated conditioning regimen&#xD;
           needed for patient preparation will be associated with a low risk of grade II-IV aGVHD&#xD;
           and no extensive cGvHD, no graft failure and increase speed, spectrum and functionality&#xD;
           of immune system reconstitution. This is supposed to reduce the incidence of severe&#xD;
           infections leading to lower rates of transplantation related mortality (TRM).&#xD;

    <description>Adult patients ≥18 years. The European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation.&#xD;
In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.</description>
