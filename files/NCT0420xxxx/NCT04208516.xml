  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multimodal analgesic regimen including regional anesthesia is used at UPMC Shadyside for&#xD;
      primary thoracic and major abdominal surgeries. The current standard-of-care regional&#xD;
      anesthesia techniques include Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block for video assisted thorascopic&#xD;
      surgery (VATS) and Quadratus Lumborum (QL) block for major abdominal surgery. These blocks&#xD;
      are routinely administered as a continuous catheter technique in order to extend the duration&#xD;
      of postoperative analgesia. Although rare, continuous nerve block techniques carry risks and&#xD;
      limitations, including catheter dislodgement, migration, kinking and leaking at the site,&#xD;
      bleeding, and infection. They are also much more expensive to perform and maintain than&#xD;
      single-injection nerve blocks at this institution. Perioperative intravenous (IV) lidocaine&#xD;
      is one of the safest local anesthetics, and its use has been shown to provide analgesia and&#xD;
      reduce opioid requirements. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that part of the analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be due to the systemic effects of the&#xD;
      local anesthetic infused at the site. Therefore, it is possible that the combination of a&#xD;
      single block followed by an infusion of IV lidocaine may provide the same benefits as a&#xD;
      continuous nerve block at a lower cost. The purpose of this study is to show that a single&#xD;
      block technique plus IV lidocaine is non-inferior to a continuous block technique. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study we chose two surgical models--VATS and major abdominal surgery--and ESP&#xD;
      and QL blocks, respectively. The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized (1:1),&#xD;
      open-label, active-comparator, noninferiority trial. The study will prospectively investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy of continuous block versus single block plus IV lidocaine infusion for&#xD;
      postoperative pain management in patients undergoing primary unilateral VATS or primary major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After obtaining a signed informed consent, participating patients will be randomized by&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers to either the control group to receive continuous Erector&#xD;
      Spinae Plane block (in the case of thoracic surgery) or continuous Quadratus Lumborum block&#xD;
      (in the case of abdominal surgery), or the treatment group to receive single shot Erector&#xD;
      Spinae Plane block (in the case of thoracic surgery) or single shot Quadratus Lumborum block&#xD;
      (in the case of abdominal surgery) with postoperative intravenous lidocaine infusion.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will take place via an opaque&#xD;
      envelope containing the treatment group allocation that will be given to the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      performing the block after informed consent is signed. Procedures will take place in the UPMC&#xD;
      Shadyside pre-operative block area. The expected duration of nerve block procedures is 10-20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the continuous nerve block group and is undergoing thoracic&#xD;
      surgery, an anesthesiologist on the Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain Service (AIPPS)&#xD;
      will administer the block with this approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous ESP Block Approach: The patient will be positioned in seated position with side or&#xD;
      sides to be blocked marked. The T5 spinous process will be identified by palpation starting&#xD;
      with C7 and continuing caudad. C7 is the most prominent spinous process anatomically. The T5&#xD;
      spinous process will be marked with a marking pen. The block area will be cleaned using 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine solution. The entire block procedure is performed under strict aseptic&#xD;
      technique. An ultrasound probe covered in a sterile probe cover will be placed at the T5&#xD;
      spinous process in a cephalad to caudad orientation and moved lateral until the T5 transverse&#xD;
      process is identified. 1-2ml of 1% lidocaine will be administered just above the ultrasound&#xD;
      probe for local skin infiltration. An 18 gauge Tuohy needle will then be inserted in plane in&#xD;
      a cephalad to caudad direction under ultrasound visualization until the tip of the needle&#xD;
      touches the T5 transverse process. The T5 transverse process is the anatomical target for&#xD;
      this block. 20ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will then be injected using slow fractionated injection,&#xD;
      aspirating every 5ml to ensure the needle tip is not intravascular. Local anesthetic spread&#xD;
      in the appropriate plane will be confirmed with ultrasound. Once injection is complete, a 20&#xD;
      gauge nonstimulating catheter will be inserted through the Tuohy needle. Catheter tip&#xD;
      placement will be confirmed with ultrasound. If bilateral blocks are to be performed, the&#xD;
      procedure will then be repeated on the contralateral side. Upon patient arrival to PACU, a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of 0.25% lidocaine at 10ml/hr per side blocked via ESP catheter will be&#xD;
      initiated and continued for 72 hours or until 12 hours prior to patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the continuous nerve block group and is undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery, an anesthesiologist on the Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain Service (AIPPS)&#xD;
      will administer the block with this approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous QL Block Approach: The patient will be positioned in lateral decubitus position&#xD;
      with the side to be blocked facing up and the side or sides to be blocked marked. The block&#xD;
      area will be cleaned using 2% chlorhexidine solution. The entire block procedure is performed&#xD;
      under strict aseptic technique. An ultrasound probe covered in a sterile probe cover will be&#xD;
      placed transversally between the iliac crest and the costal margin at the level of the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line and the three muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall (external&#xD;
      oblique, internal oblique and transversus abdominis) will be identified. The probe will then&#xD;
      be moved posteriorly until the transversus abdominis muscle (TAM) tapers off into its&#xD;
      aponeurosis approximately at the level of the posterior axillary line, and posteriorly to&#xD;
      this the intersection of the transversalis fascia with the lateral side of the QL muscle will&#xD;
      be identified. An 18 gauge Tuohy needle will then be inserted in plane in an anterior to&#xD;
      posterior direction until the tip of the needle is visualized at the intersection of the&#xD;
      transversalis fascia with the lateral side of the QL muscle. The intersection of the&#xD;
      transversalis fascia with the lateral side of the QL muscle is the anatomical target for this&#xD;
      block. Once the initial injection of local anesthetic is complete, a 20 gauge nonstimulating&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted through the Tuohy needle. Catheter tip placement will be confirmed&#xD;
      with ultrasound. If bilateral blocks are to be performed, the patient will be repositioned,&#xD;
      the area to be blocked will be cleaned and prepared in a strict aseptic fashion as described&#xD;
      above, and the procedure will then be repeated on the contralateral side. Upon patient&#xD;
      arrival to PACU, a continuous infusion of 0.25% Lidocaine at 10ml/hr per side blocked via QLB&#xD;
      catheter will be initiated and continued for 72 hours or until 12 hours prior to patient&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the single block plus IV lidocaine group and is undergoing&#xD;
      thoracic surgery, an anesthesiologist on the Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain Service&#xD;
      (AIPPS) will administer the block with this approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Shot ESP Block with Postoperative IV Lidocaine Approach: The same technique described&#xD;
      for the CESP will be used except that in this case a single ESP block will be performed. A 22&#xD;
      gauge Tuohy needle will be used to perform these blocks. After the proper positioning of the&#xD;
      needle 20ml of 0.5% ropivacaine plus, 4mg dexamethasone, plus 30mcg dexmedetomidine will be&#xD;
      deposited. In the recovery room an infusion of IV lidocaine at 50mg/hr for be initiated for&#xD;
      72 hours or until 12 hours prior to patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the single block plus IV lidocaine group and is undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, an anesthesiologist on the Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain Service&#xD;
      (AIPPS) will administer the block with this approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Shot QL Block with Postoperative IV Lidocaine Approach: The same technique described&#xD;
      for the CQL will be used except that a single QL block will be performed. A 22 gauge Tuohy&#xD;
      needle will be used to perform these blocks. After the proper positioning of the needle 20ml&#xD;
      of 0.5% ropivacaine plus, 4mg dexamethasone, plus 20mcg dexmedetomidine per injection site&#xD;
      (30mcg if unilateral block only) will be deposited. Upon patient arrival to PACU, a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of intravenous lidocaine at 50mg/hr will be initiated and continued for&#xD;
      72 hours or until 12 hours prior to patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Management: Both treatment groups will receive the standard anesthetic technique&#xD;
      and multimodal analgesic technique at our institution, including preoperative gabapentin&#xD;
      300mg PO and acetaminophen 1000mg PO, intraoperative IV propofol infusion-based general&#xD;
      anesthetic combined with sub-anesthetic dose IV ketamine infusion, IV dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      infusion, IV acetaminophen, and avoidance of intraoperative opioids. Postoperative pain&#xD;
      management will also follow standard protocol, using IV hydromorphone (0.2-0.3 mg) and PO&#xD;
      oxycodone (5-10 mg) on request by the patient for moderate to severe pain (VAS &gt;5), scheduled&#xD;
      ketamine 20-50mg PO q 8hrs for 48 hours, scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg IV or PO q 6hrs,&#xD;
      scheduled gabapentin 100-300mg PO at bedtime, and dexmedetomidine infusion 0.2mcg/kg/hr IV&#xD;
      for 24 hours if the patient is located in the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the patient will be followed by the blinded research team for incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events, as well as the collection of the primary and secondary outcome measures. Pain&#xD;
      assessment will be done by nurses in the PACU and on the floor using Numeric Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale, with 0 meaning no pain and 10 meaning worst possible pain. Opioid medication&#xD;
      consumption, pain scores, local anesthetic medication consumption, serum lidocaine levels,&#xD;
      and adverse effects will be recorded on worksheets included in patient research folders, with&#xD;
      each study participant having their own research folder identified only by randomly assigned&#xD;
      patient study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator responsible for data collection will remain blinded to the patient's&#xD;
      group allocation, and will not become unblinded during the data collection process because&#xD;
      data will be collected from the patient's medical record and will not involve physically&#xD;
      observing the patient (which would otherwise result in unblinding since the presence or&#xD;
      absence of a perineural catheter and patient pump status would make the group allocation&#xD;
      obvious). However, this information will not be obtainable when collecting data from the&#xD;
      medical record. It is not possible to blind nursing staff or the patient to the patient's&#xD;
      group allocation because the presence or absence of a visible perineural catheter will make&#xD;
      the group allocation obvious.&#xD;
