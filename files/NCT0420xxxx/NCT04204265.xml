      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the clinical improvement and safety in patients&#xD;
      treated with MONOVISC for shoulder osteoarthritis. Specifically, this study will provide&#xD;
      confirmation to the effectiveness and safety of MONOVISC at relieving shoulder joint pain to&#xD;
      6 months post-treatment.&#xD;
