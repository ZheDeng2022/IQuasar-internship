  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite the fact that many lines of evidence point to the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of early mobilization in medical or surgical ICUs, there remains limited evidence regarding&#xD;
      the efficacy or outcome of mobilizing patients in trauma ICU. Given the lack of published&#xD;
      literature or routine protocol for mobilizing this population in our institution, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a formal protocol and quality improvement project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the flexibility and effects of an early mobilization project in a&#xD;
      trauma ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Observational, pre-post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: A eight-bed trauma ICU in a medical center in Taipei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Critically ill adults admitted to the trauma ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This project will involve a routine care baseline phase to promote early&#xD;
      mobilization of critically ill patients. The bedside physical therapist (PT) will assess the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the activity level throughout the day. The PT will provide guidelines for&#xD;
      appropriate activities, with the option to perform more advanced activities using equipment.&#xD;
      Early mobilization will be provided once daily 5 days/week during the 30-minute family&#xD;
      visiting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary outcome measures will be as follows: (1) the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      occupational therapist (OT) and/or PT consultations per ICU days 3, 7 and 14; (2) the time&#xD;
      and types of mobilization activities performed at the day of ICU admission, the day of ICU&#xD;
      discharge and the day of hospital discharge, including passive and active activities; (3) the&#xD;
      Perme intensive care unit mobility score at the day of ICU admission, the day of ICU&#xD;
      discharge and the day of hospital discharge; Secondary outcome measures will include the&#xD;
      following: (1) the number of times and reasons for suspended activities; (2)&#xD;
      mobilization-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Unadjusted comparisons before and after implementation of the project&#xD;
      will be performed using chi-square analysis, Fisher exact test, or the Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test, as appropriate. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 will be used to determine&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early mobilization is a component of the ABCDE bundle (Awaken from sedation; Breathe&#xD;
      independently from ventilator; Choice of sedation; Delirium management; Early mobilization),&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary, patient-centered strategy to facilitate evidence-based practices in&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) settings. In patients who underwent early mobilization, specific&#xD;
      benefits were fewer ventilator days, fewer ICU and hospital days, fewer hospital&#xD;
      complications, less sedation and delirium days, and improved in-hospital functional outcomes.&#xD;
      Despite the fact that several lines of evidence demonstrated the safety and efficacy of early&#xD;
      mobilization in the ICU, studies conducted in neurological or trauma ICU settings are scarce,&#xD;
      possibly because of safety considerations such as physiologic instability (hemodynamic or&#xD;
      intracranial pressure) and invasive device integrity. It has only recently been suggested&#xD;
      that such programs are effective, safe, and potentially beneficial in critically ill&#xD;
      neurological patients. Nevertheless, there is no set protocol in place for moving these&#xD;
      patients, nor any suggested parameters to monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence regarding early mobilization has been based on reports from general medical and&#xD;
      surgical ICU environments, rather than from neurosurgical ICU (NSICU) or trauma ICU settings.&#xD;
      In NSICU patients with acute brain injury mostly, safety during mobilization could be&#xD;
      compromised because of hemiparesis or hemiplegia, cognitive impairment, tenuous intracerebral&#xD;
      pressure and cerebral perfusion, or dislodgement of cerebral monitoring or other indwelling&#xD;
      devices. In trauma ICU, trauma patients often have extensive orthopedic and neurosurgical&#xD;
      injuries, creating additional barriers to mobility. Little is known about the potential&#xD;
      effects of mobilizing patients with acute brain or server injuries admitted to the trauma&#xD;
      ICU. In one pre- and post-intervention research study of early mobilization in patients with&#xD;
      neurologic injury treated in a ICU, mobility levels increased post-intervention, without&#xD;
      adverse events. The results also supported the notion that progressive early mobilization&#xD;
      program leads to shorter ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), fewer patient restraint days,&#xD;
      and fewer hospital-acquired infections. Another relevant study showed that implementation of&#xD;
      a progressive mobility algorithm was safe and was associated with a higher likelihood of&#xD;
      mobilization in the first week after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the&#xD;
      neurological ICU. For trauma patients, previous studies demonstrated the safety of a mobility&#xD;
      protocol in a trauma and burn ICU and, additionally, showed a decrease in airway, pulmonary,&#xD;
      and vascular complications. Results from another study revealed favorable functional outcomes&#xD;
      for patients involved in a structured mobility program with physical therapy in the&#xD;
      neuro/trauma ICU. Overall, the lack of available evidence highlights the fact that there&#xD;
      remains much research to be done regarding early rehabilitation for patients in the trauma&#xD;
      ICU and there are specific questions to be answered regarding the timing of intervention, the&#xD;
      intensity and the type of exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, in the trauma ICU of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the referral of&#xD;
      patients for physical therapy and mobilization occurred at the discretion of the medical&#xD;
      providers with very low the proportion of patients with physical therapist (PT)&#xD;
      consultations. Therefore, the overall objective of this quality improvement (QI) project will&#xD;
      be to evaluate a structured and interdisciplinary early rehabilitation and progressive&#xD;
      mobility protocol for critically ill patients in a trauma ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose： The goals of the project will be to provide a standardized, evidence-based,&#xD;
      interdisciplinary mechanism to increase each patient's activity level safely while&#xD;
      simultaneously initiating and promoting a culture of mobility. The investigators will also&#xD;
      conduct this project to evaluate the effects of this early mobilization program on the&#xD;
      outcomes of patients in the trauma ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention： Overview of Project Setting, Design, and Patients The project initiative will&#xD;
      be developed using an established and structured QI framework (described below in &quot;QI&#xD;
      Process&quot;) and evaluate using an observational, pre-post design. A nonprobability, convenience&#xD;
      sampling strategy will be used for program evaluation. The setting will be the trauma ICU in&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital, 8-bed trauma ICU unit. PT and Occupational therapist&#xD;
      (OT) consultations and treatments will be available when ordered by medical providers. Both&#xD;
      the assessment method and training program (progressive mobility protocol for all critically&#xD;
      ill patients) are current procedure of the early rehabilitation team. The project will be&#xD;
      implemented using equipment resources, the Sara Combilizer or Sara Plus (Arjo Huntleigh,&#xD;
      GETINGE group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a retrospective, pre- QI Process period (January 1, 2018, through&#xD;
      June 30, 2019) followed by a prospective QI-Process phase (December 31, 2019-December 31,&#xD;
      2022). We conducted a retrospective review covering the period from January 1, 2018, through&#xD;
      June 30, 2019, of patients &gt;20 years of age admitted to the trauma ICU (more than 3 days),&#xD;
      who were alive more than 7 days after ICU admission. Charts from the first consecutive 100&#xD;
      patients who meet aforementioned criteria will be reviewed retrospectively before&#xD;
      implementation of the QI Process by using the daily medical records and daily assessment&#xD;
      reports of nursing built into the electronic medical records of NTUH. The prospective&#xD;
      population will consist of patients above 20 years old who required trauma ICU admission for&#xD;
      three or more days with PT or/with OT consultations from December, 2019, through December 31,&#xD;
      2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QI Process The structured QI model of the project initiative will create a change in practice&#xD;
      using the &quot;four Es&quot; approach: engage, educate, execute, and evaluate. To achieve this, a&#xD;
      collaborative interdisciplinary QI team, the EM Working Group, will be created. Participation&#xD;
      in the EM Working Group will be open to all interested the ICU staff. Active participants&#xD;
      will include at least one champion from each of the following groups: physicians, nurse&#xD;
      practitioners, nurses, OT, PT and rehabilitation physicians. This core group of individuals&#xD;
      will meet on a weekly basis over 2 months to plan (engage and educate) the QI project prior&#xD;
      to its execution and evaluation. First, champions from the rehabilitation team will conduct&#xD;
      focus groups with all stakeholders from their respective disciplines to present the problem&#xD;
      and identify trauma ICU -based facilitators and barriers to early mobilization. Explain why&#xD;
      the interventions are important. Bedside staff will better understand the importance of&#xD;
      mobility if there is a clear understanding that mobility will increase safety, decrease&#xD;
      secondary complications and improve outcomes, ultimately shortening hospital stays and cost&#xD;
      of care. Second, the rehabilitation team will develop guidelines for mobilization in the&#xD;
      trauma ICU based on the feedback provided from the focus groups and prior literature&#xD;
      regarding early mobilization. Third, educational resources will be developed for all trauma&#xD;
      ICU staff. Finally, the interdisciplinary team will determine valid and feasible outcome&#xD;
      measures based on previously published early mobilization QI studies to evaluate performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff Educational Resources To ensure competence in treating this patient population,&#xD;
      literature will be reviewed on the efficacy and safety of early mobilization and&#xD;
      interventions. Then, educational resources will be presented in meetings, presentations, or&#xD;
      online communications. A formal written procedure will also be available to staff. A relevant&#xD;
      online learning module regarding early rehabilitation in critically ill patients will be&#xD;
      created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Early Mobilization Program Early mobilization will be defined as any active exercise&#xD;
      where the patients could assist with the activity using their own muscle strength and control&#xD;
      that occurred within the first 7 days of trauma ICU admission and will be intended to&#xD;
      maintain or restore overall function as well as being scored using the ICU mobility scale.&#xD;
      The ICU mobility scale includes rolling, bridging, sitting, standing and walking, and upper&#xD;
      and lower limb flexion and extension. In-bed therapies will include active or active-assist&#xD;
      range of motion, bridge exercise, quadriceps setting, straight leg raising, rolling exercises&#xD;
      and facilitation. Safety criteria for early mobilization will be evaluated the following&#xD;
      before intervention: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) above 6; raised intracranial pressure&lt;20mmHg;&#xD;
      no cardiopulmonary arrest; no acute myocardial infarction; no rapidly developing&#xD;
      neuromuscular disease; no pregnancy; no ruptured or leaking aortic aneurysm; and no ICU&#xD;
      admission for palliative care or no medical orders specifying alternate activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It does not preclude the patient receiving assistance from staff or equipment. The protocol&#xD;
      will include an initial assessment by the physician on service to determine readiness to&#xD;
      participate in PT. If deemed appropriate, PT and OT consults will be requested. It will be&#xD;
      determined whether each patient's activity level will evaluated by the rehabilitation team.&#xD;
      PTs will facilitate active mobility, while range of motion, seating, and positioning will be&#xD;
      the purview of PTs, with OT collaboration as needed. The bedside PT will record this&#xD;
      information in the electronic record daily performances and goals note. The bedside PT will&#xD;
      also assess the appropriateness of the activity level throughout the day by the ICU mobility&#xD;
      scale. Activities may be implemented by nurses and/or therapists based on their specific&#xD;
      skills and provided equipment. The PT will provide guidelines for appropriate activities,&#xD;
      with the option to perform more advanced activities using equipment (Sara Combilizer or Sara&#xD;
      Plus) Note: individualized to the patient. PTs will teach the family how to do passive or&#xD;
      active range of motion, bed exercises, and sitting position in bed for the patient as well as&#xD;
      encourage the family to assist with these exercises when they visit. Early mobilization will&#xD;
      be provided once daily 5 days/week during the 30-minute family visiting time (morning or&#xD;
      afternoon visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe adverse events will be prospectively defined as falls, unplanned extubation, cardiac&#xD;
      arrest, loss of an invasively-inserted line and new-onset atrial or ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmia; all these will be recorded during mobilization sessions. The investigators&#xD;
      will define adverse events that will require a mobilization session to be suspended&#xD;
      prematurely a priori. These events include decrease in mean arterial pressure &lt;60 mmHg or&#xD;
      decrease in oxygen saturation &lt;88% for more than 3 minutes or occurrence of a new oxygen&#xD;
      requirement with a fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;0.6. If an adverse event occurs during a&#xD;
      therapy session, the session will be immediately stopped and the attending physician will be&#xD;
      notified.&#xD;
