  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study of up to 40 treated subjects; subjects enrolled&#xD;
      may be greater than subjects treated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled to ensure a minimum number of subjects by skin type participate in&#xD;
      the study as follows: FST I-II, at least 5 subjects; FST III, at least 10 subjects; FST IV,&#xD;
      at least 5 subjects. Additionally, up to 20 training subjects will be enrolled that will be&#xD;
      excluded from efficacy analysis, but will be included in safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized baseline and follow-up images will be taken using the sites' preferred camera&#xD;
      system. No pre-treatment medication prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Study subjects will receive up to three treatments with the PicoPlus with the 595nm&#xD;
      on one hand and the 660nm on the other hand. Subjects will receive the same wavelength for&#xD;
      all treatments on each specific hand; treatments will alternate by subjects between the left&#xD;
      side getting treated with the 595nm and the right side getting treated with the 660nm&#xD;
      depending on enrollment. Treatments will be 30+7 days apart up to three treatments until&#xD;
      desired clearance has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Up to 2 balancing treatments may be done if needed based on the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion to achieve equal clearance on each hand utilizing the wavelength of the&#xD;
      investigator's choice. Phase II will not be considered for efficacy endpoints.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Principal Investigator, sub-investigator or qualified clinician delegated by the principal investigator, will complete a Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale assessing overall aesthetic improvement by wavelength at the 30-day visit following the last treatment visit for Phase I of the study. Scale ranging 1-Very Much Improved and 5-Worse.</description>

    <measure>Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>During all study treatments, the subject's pain levels will be monitored using a validated Numeric Rating Scale ranging from 0-10. The maximum and average pain score will be recorded by wavelength.</description>
