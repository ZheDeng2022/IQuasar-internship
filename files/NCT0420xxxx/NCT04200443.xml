    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib and temozolomide work in treating patients&#xD;
      with leiomyosarcoma or other soft tissue sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving cabozantinib and temozolomide may work better than either one alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with leiomyosarcoma or other soft tissue sarcoma. Cabozantinib is an&#xD;
      investigational drug, which means that it has not been approved by the United States (US)&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory agencies for sale or use by the&#xD;
      public for the indication under investigation in this study.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR]+partial&#xD;
      response [PR]+stable disease [SD]) assessed at 12 weeks for subjects in Cohort 1&#xD;
      (Leiomyosarcoma Arm) treated with cabozantinib and temozolomide as defined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (defined as CR+PR) for subjects in Cohort 1 treated&#xD;
      with a combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) for subjects in Cohort 1 treated with a&#xD;
      combination of cabozantinib and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the median progression free rate for subjects with combination of&#xD;
      cabozantinib and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate overall survival for subjects in Cohort 1 treated with a combination of&#xD;
      cabozantinib and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess safety and tolerability for subjects treated with a combination of cabozantinib&#xD;
      and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the overall response rate (defined as CR+PR) in Cohort 2 (other soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess Quality of Life (QoL) and subject-reported outcomes as measured by the&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQoL-Group Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the correlation of progression free rate (PFR) and overall survival (OS) to&#xD;
      levels of sVEGFR2, PIGF, VEGF, HGF, sMET, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and soluble AXL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients with progressive disease (PD) are followed up&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 2 years and patients without PD are followed up every 6 months for&#xD;
      up to 5 years.&#xD;

             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements&#xD;
             and must have signed the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment&#xD;
             formulation or dacarbazine&#xD;

             have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regiment are ineligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             cabozantinib and temozolomide are antineoplastic agents with potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and&#xD;
             temozolomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             cabozantinib and temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with cabozantinib or temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational kinase&#xD;
                  inhibitor) within 14 days before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any type of cytotoxic, biologic or other systemic anticancer therapy (including&#xD;
                  investigational) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation therapy for bone metastasis within 14 days before first dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other radiation therapy within 28 days before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic treatment with radionuclides within 42 days before the first dose of&#xD;
                  study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior&#xD;
                       radiation therapy are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major surgery (e.g., GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 56&#xD;
                  days before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;

                    -  Note: Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 28 days&#xD;
                       before first dose and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision, tooth&#xD;
                       extraction) at least 10 days before first dose. Subjects with clinically&#xD;
                       relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval calculated by the Bazetts formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) within 28 days before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If a single electrocardiography (ECG) shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt;&#xD;
                  500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed&#xD;
                  within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive&#xD;
                  results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, the following conditions:&#xD;

                       Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, subjects should be&#xD;
                       class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) ˃ 150 mm&#xD;
                       Hg systolic or ˃ 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive&#xD;
                       treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction&#xD;
                       (MI), or other ischemic event within 6 months before the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including those associated with a high risk of&#xD;
                  perforation or fistula formation:&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
                       abscess within 6 months before the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed&#xD;
                            before the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis of &gt; 0.5 teaspoon&#xD;
