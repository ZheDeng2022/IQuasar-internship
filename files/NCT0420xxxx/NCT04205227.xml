    <textblock>
      First-in Human study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ENB003 in&#xD;
      combination with Pembrolizumab in solid tumors. The study is separated into two parts. Part A&#xD;
      is a 3+3 dose escalation to define the recommended RP2D; this part will include metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer patients subjects, but&#xD;
      other solid tumors will be allowed. Once the RP2D is selected, the study will be expanded&#xD;
      into metastatic melanoma, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer subjects.&#xD;
      A small number of sarcoma subjects will be included, as exploratory.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part A: Dose Escalation (with Run-in) A 7-day run-in period of ENB-003 monotherapy, will be&#xD;
      administered to all Part A subjects on Days -7, -5 and -3, prior to initiating combination&#xD;
      therapy with pembrolizumab at Day 1. ENB-003 will also be administered on Days 1, 3 and 5 in&#xD;
      Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, ENB-003 will be administered on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of&#xD;
      alternate 21-day treatment cycles, starting with Cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 design, with the following doses being&#xD;
      administered during Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  150 µg ENB-003&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  300 µg ENB-003&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  500 µg ENB-003&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  750 µg ENB-003&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000 µg ENB-003 Pembrolizumab will be administered as 200 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day&#xD;
           cycle in all Part A cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Dose Expansion Twelve (12) subjects with malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer, or&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer will receive 1 x 21-day treatment cycle of ENB-003 at the recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D) selected in Part A + pembrolizumab. If dose limiting toxicities (DLT) occur in&#xD;
      no more than 3 subjects , Part B will be expanded with an additional 27 subjects, plus 6&#xD;
      additional subjects with sarcoma. A review of efficacy will be conducted by a Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) in Part B once 39 RP2D subjects (including 9 malignant melanoma&#xD;
      subjects, 16 ovarian cancer subjects and 14 pancreatic cancer subjects) have completed their&#xD;
      scheduled 12 week CT/MRI scans. Upon approval by the DSMB, a maximum of 64 further subjects&#xD;
      will be treated at the RP2D.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must fulfill all the following inclusion criteria relevant to their tumor&#xD;
             type to be eligible for participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Malignant Melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
             malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD1/Ligand 1 (L1) monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody (mAb) administered either as monotherapy, or in combination with other&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies. PD-1 treatment progression is defined by&#xD;
             meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has demonstrated disease progression (PD) after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST&#xD;
                  Version 1.1. The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment&#xD;
                  no less than four weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence&#xD;
                  of rapid clinical progression.1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progressive disease has been documented within 12 weeks from the last dose of&#xD;
                  anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.1&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. This determination is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial&#xD;
             date of PD documentation will be considered the date of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Pancreatic Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed (previously obtained biopsied) metastatic unresectable&#xD;
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with one or more prior treatments for their pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If subjects have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair deficiency&#xD;
             (dMMR) phenotype they must have been previously treated with anti-PD1 and demonstrated&#xD;
             either PD or disease stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Ovarian Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Histologically proven diagnosis of high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear&#xD;
             cell ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Recurrent platinum-resistant disease, defined as PD within 6 months (182 days) of the&#xD;
             last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy OR greater than 6 months from completion&#xD;
             of most recent platinum-based chemotherapy, but not suitable for further platinum&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, poorly differentiated or&#xD;
             dedifferentiated liposarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, malignant fibers&#xD;
             histiocytoma, synovial sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, or dedifferentiated or&#xD;
             mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. All cases should be classified histologically as being intermediate- or high grade.&#xD;
             For soft-tissue sarcomas, this would correspond to Grade 2 or 3 according to the&#xD;
             FNCLCC (Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease not amenable to curative surgical&#xD;
             resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Receipt of at least 1 systemic line of therapy for advanced disease. For subjects&#xD;
             diagnosed with diseases for which no standard therapy exists (e.g. dedifferentiated&#xD;
             chondrosarcoma), this requirement is waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects may have received up to 3 previous lines of systemic anti-cancer therapy for&#xD;
             advanced disease. Systemic therapy administered with neoadjuvant or adjuvant intent is&#xD;
             not considered a therapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. For subjects with tumor types other than malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer or&#xD;
             pancreatic cancer with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic solid tumors who have PD after treatment with at least 1 available therapy&#xD;
             for metastatic disease that is known to confer clinical benefit, or are intolerant to&#xD;
             treatment, or refuse standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For the dose-escalation phase (Part A), tumor vasculature, stroma and/or tumor cells&#xD;
             are marker positive for ETBR, as determined by IHC staining &gt;25%. Subjects who do not&#xD;
             satisfy this criterion may be enrolled in the dose expansion phase (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a life expectancy of &gt;3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. All subjects must have an archived tumor tissue biopsy sample obtained within 24&#xD;
             months of Screening that is suitable for performing IHC and biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not breastfeeding,&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g.,&#xD;
             CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137) and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or&#xD;
             higher immune-related adverse event (irAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1&#xD;
             severity or baseline. Subjects with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible at&#xD;
             Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
             toxicity and/or complications from the surgery prior to starting study treatment, as&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may&#xD;
             participate provided it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous&#xD;
             investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Diagnostic Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Average Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;460 msec for males and QTcF &gt;480 msec&#xD;

             sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years.&#xD;

             situ (e.g., breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially&#xD;
             curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;

             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form&#xD;
             of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or it is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the&#xD;
