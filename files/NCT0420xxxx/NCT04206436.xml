      Study is looking at the effects of cystic fibrosis treatment on bone muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex multisystem genetic disease, with pulmonary and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal consequences dominating the clinical picture. The life-expectancy of CF&#xD;
      patients has increased through several therapeutic advances. Although respiratory failure&#xD;
      remains the major cause of mortality in CF, musculoskeletal impairments contribute to major&#xD;
      morbidity. In the general population, musculoskeletal conditions are among the most common&#xD;
      reasons for seeking medical care, and the risk of osteoporotic fracture increases with age.&#xD;
      As the CF population ages, the morbidity related to musculoskeletal effects may increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of CF related bone disease is multifactorial and includes effects of pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency, poor nutritional status, vitamin D deficiency, glucocorticoid treatment,&#xD;
      inflammation, hypogonadism, and sarcopenia, collectively resulting in attenuated bone mineral&#xD;
      accrual and low bone density The effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance&#xD;
      regulator (CFTR) modulating drugs on bone disease in CF has not been evaluated. Effects of&#xD;
      CFTR modulators may help counter the bone and muscle consequences of CF either directly by&#xD;
      effects on bone or muscle cells, or indirectly by improved lung disease, improved nutritional&#xD;
      status, decreased systemic inflammation or glucocorticoid use, or subsequent increases in&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that better understanding of the bone&#xD;
      and muscle effects of CFTR modulator therapies will help guide strategies to optimize bone&#xD;
      accrual, prevent osteoporosis and fractures, and improve functional outcomes in the aging CF&#xD;
      population. Set on the backbone of a longitudinal observational cohort study, the study will&#xD;
      systematically and comprehensively evaluate changes in bone and muscle mass and strength from&#xD;
      baseline to 12 month and 24 month time points among patients receiving CFTR modulator&#xD;
      therapies and also among controls not receiving CFTR modulator therapies.&#xD;
