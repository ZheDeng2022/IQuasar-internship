      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is a pill youth with type 2 diabetes take. It can cause side effects like diarrhea&#xD;
      and upset stomach. Researchers want to see if a fiber supplement can help decrease these side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a prebiotic fiber supplement helps improve the gastrointestinal side effects of&#xD;
      people taking metformin and helps with their blood sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 10-25 with type 2 diabetes who are taking or will take metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting with a nutritionist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stop taking all diabetes medication for 1 week. They will then take&#xD;
      metformin by mouth for 1 week. They will be randomly assigned to take either a fiber&#xD;
      supplement or a placebo by mouth during the same week. They will then stop all study&#xD;
      treatments for 2-3 weeks. Then they will restart metformin for 1 week. The groups that&#xD;
      received the fiber versus the placebo will be reversed. All participants will then continue&#xD;
      taking metformin and take the fiber for 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 visits over about 2 months. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal tests: A plastic tube will be inserted in the participant s arm vein for blood draws.&#xD;
      They will drink a special meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan: Participants will lie on their back while the&#xD;
      scan measures their body fat and muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While they are home, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fill out daily surveys online&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wear daily activity and blood sugar monitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect their stool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eat only certain foods for two 1-week periods...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is the most widely prescribed anti-diabetes medication in the world and the&#xD;
      first-line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth and adults. However, metformin&#xD;
      s glucose-lowering ability is variable in clinical practice, and efficacy is further limited&#xD;
      by poor medication adherence because of metformin-associated adverse effects.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as bloating, abdominal discomfort, cramping, and diarrhea&#xD;
      are the most common side effects associated with metformin use occurring in up to 80% of&#xD;
      individuals at drug initiation and up to 30% in individuals on chronic treatment. In youth&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, the burden of metformin-associated side effects is high because&#xD;
      metformin is the only oral FDA-approved for treatment and there are no other oral&#xD;
      alternatives. Therefore, identifying ways to mitigate these GI side effects, especially in&#xD;
      youth with type 2 diabetes, is of high clinical significance. New data suggest that&#xD;
      metformin-induced changes in the gut and/ or the microbiome may be related to both its&#xD;
      beneficial (glucose-lowering) and adverse effects. To address this clinical challenge,&#xD;
      prebiotic fibers that are non-digestible food ingredients, may help to improve metformin&#xD;
      tolerability by increasing beneficial bacteria and stool metabolites, such as short chain&#xD;
      fatty acid (SCFA) stool concentrations. This pilot study will test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      prebiotic microbiome modulator (MM) - containing prebiotic fibers and polyphenols - will&#xD;
      reduce GI side effects of metformin at time of initiation and change the stool metabolite&#xD;
      profile in youth and young adults with T2D treated with metformin, age 10-25 years who are&#xD;
      not on insulin therapy. The 9-week study will have 2 phases and 6 outpatient visits at the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center. Phase 1 is a 5-week randomized double blind cross-over trial with two&#xD;
      1-week intervention periods (metformin + prebiotic and metformin + placebo) during which&#xD;
      subjects will eat a standardized diet. Phase 2 will occur immediately following phase 1 in&#xD;
      which participants will start an open-label 4-week intervention with metformin and the&#xD;
      prebiotic MM.&#xD;
