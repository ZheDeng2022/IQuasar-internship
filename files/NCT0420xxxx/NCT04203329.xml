          8. Unable to routinely walk at least 20 feet without assistance;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known allergy/adverse reaction to bovine derivatives;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Planned procedures or concomitant condition(s) that may extend ambulation attempts&#xD;
             beyond routine ambulation and/or hospital discharge time (e.g., staged procedure,&#xD;
             serious co-morbidity, uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             extreme morbid obesity), in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intra-Operative Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        All criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is a candidate for Same Day Discharge per&#xD;
             protocol (no procedure related events/complications e.g., no new pericardial effusion,&#xD;
             post-procedure diuresis not needed, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Case completed in time for subject to be reasonably recovered and discharged according&#xD;
             to protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All femoral venous access sites are planned to be closed with the MVP&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Initial subject eligibility will be determined based on pre-operative screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Final subject enrollment will be determined at the end the procedure, prior to closure,&#xD;
        based on general intra-op exclusion criteria, as well as additional intraoperative&#xD;
        criteria. Enrollment is thus determined intra-operatively, at the end of the case and just&#xD;
        prior to closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intra-Operative Exclusion Criteria Subjects will be excluded from participating in this&#xD;
        study if any of the following exclusion criteria occur during the index procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any attempt at femoral arterial access during the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the index limb(s): infection or inflammation in the vicinity of the groin&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within 8 hours before or after&#xD;
             the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All venous access sites must are subject to the following exclusion criteria, assessed&#xD;
             immediately prior to enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Difficult insertion of procedural sheath or needle stick problems at the onset of&#xD;
                  the procedure (e.g., multiple stick attempts, accidental arterial stick with&#xD;
                  hematoma, &quot;back wall stick&quot;, etc.) in any of the study veins;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A procedural sheath &lt; 6 Fr or &gt; 12 Fr in inner diameter is present at time of&#xD;
                  closure;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Venous access site location is noted to be &quot;high&quot;, above the inguinal ligament&#xD;
                  (cephalad to lower half of the femoral head or the inferior epigastric vein&#xD;
                  origin from the external iliac vein);&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Intra-procedural bleeding around sheath, or forming hematoma at the time of&#xD;
                  closure;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Length of the tissue tract, the distance between the anterior venous wall and&#xD;
                  skin, is estimated to be less than 2.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Discharge Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Physician or designee must perform discharge evaluation on the same day as the&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has successfully ambulated without bleeding from access site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has been able to void.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No clinically significant ECG findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is accompanied by a responsible person who will be near them for the next 24&#xD;
             hours. Subjects must meet all Discharge Criteria in order to be eligible for same day&#xD;
             discharge at physician discretion.&#xD;
