    <textblock>
      Kidney and Pancreas transplantation is considered the treatment of choice for many people&#xD;
      with End Stage Renal Disease and Type 1 diabetes because quality of life and survival is&#xD;
      often better after transplantation. However the quality of organs varies as does the quality&#xD;
      of perfusion once they are transplanted. The immediate determinant of the survival of any&#xD;
      transplanted allograft often depends on the overall quality of perfusion of the organ. The&#xD;
      assessment of perfusion is currently visually and empirically done and reported by the&#xD;
      surgical team, with low objectivity. The Laser Speckle Doppler technique will be used in both&#xD;
      kidney and pancreas transplantation to objectively study the quality of blood flow to the&#xD;
      kidney and pancreas after transplantation. This Doppler will provide continuous, non-invasive&#xD;
      blood flow monitoring of the microvascular environment of the transplanted organ. The&#xD;
      strength of the technique is in evaluating changes in flow over an area of interest or the&#xD;
      whole transplanted organ and accurately numerically quantifying the flow. The laser speckle&#xD;
      Doppler technique is now well established and has been used in various clinical and research&#xD;
      setting as the most convenient means of assessing tissue blood flow. It has however not yet&#xD;
      been used in kidney and pancreas transplantation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND After reperfusion in solid organ transplantation, the quality of organ reperfusion&#xD;
      is often assessed visually and reported as good, moderate, reasonable, patchy or poor. In our&#xD;
      centre a Renogram is usually performed which uses radioactive tracer which most kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients would have within 24 hours after transplantation to assess the overall&#xD;
      perfusion of the allograft. The Speckle Laser Doppler is a powerful clinical tool to obtain&#xD;
      full field, high resolution images of microvascular perfusion of an organ It has been used in&#xD;
      many medical fields such as dermatology vascular medicine and neurosciences both in a&#xD;
      research and in clinical settings. This study seeks to utilise this technique to try to&#xD;
      accurately quantify perfusion in the kidney and pancreas after transplantation and to develop&#xD;
      a robust numerical quantification system of reporting on organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Speckle Laser Doppler blood flow imager uses the laser speckle contrast technique to&#xD;
      deliver real-time blood flow images with numerical physical data, providing outstanding&#xD;
      performance in a wide range of pre-clinical and clinical research applications. This&#xD;
      technique has not yet been applied for the assessment of kidney transplant perfusion&#xD;
      reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION/AIM(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the use of the laser blood flow imager in both kidney and pancreas&#xD;
           transplantation and obtain real time video images with physical parametric data of the&#xD;
           blood flow of transplanted organs at the time of transplantation as a proof of principle&#xD;
           study to accurately quantify the blood flow rate either in the whole transplanted organ&#xD;
           or a specific area of interest so as to develop a robust numerical quantification system&#xD;
           of reporting on the perfusion of the transplanted organ. While this technique has been&#xD;
           used in neurosurgery and other clinical settings it has not been evaluated before in a&#xD;
           transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the markers of inflammation (Hypo perfusion) and oxidative stress and attempt&#xD;
           correlation with the quality of perfusion obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to utilise this technique to try to accurately quantify perfusion in the&#xD;
      kidney and pancreas after transplantation and to develop a robust numerical quantification&#xD;
      system of reporting on organ perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Circulating markers of hypo perfusion and kidney injury will be measured to include:&#xD;
      lactate, glutamate, pyruvate, Interleukin 6 as well as glutathione a marker of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and assess their correlation with outputs from the two devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE This study seeks to utilise this technique to try to accurately quantify perfusion&#xD;
      in the kidney and pancreas after transplantation and to develop a robust numerical&#xD;
      quantification system of reporting on organ perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The moorFLPI-2 blood flow imager uses the laser speckle contrast technique to deliver&#xD;
      real-time blood flow images with numerical physical data, providing outstanding performance&#xD;
      in a wide range of pre-clinical and clinical research applications. This technique has not&#xD;
      yet been applied for the assessment of kidney transplant perfusion reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN and METHODS of DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYIS Speckle Doppler The Speckle&#xD;
      Laser Doppler blood flow imager will be used to obtain real-time blood flow images at&#xD;
      reperfusion and immediately thereafter this imaging will occur immediately after the surgery&#xD;
      when the patient is still under anaesthetic it will take approximately 15 minutes. Initially&#xD;
      these images with the flow parametric data will be stored on a laptop which comes with the&#xD;
      rental equipment. However once the study is complete, all images and data will be stored on a&#xD;
      desktop/drive in the department along with other departmental research data confidentially.&#xD;
      The software integrated in the equipment incorporates multiple blood flow parameters and a&#xD;
      statistical analytical package for an exhaustive analysis of various parameters. The Speckle&#xD;
      Laser Doppler has two low power visible aiming lasers that indicate the approximate centre of&#xD;
      the image. The aiming lasers will appear as a single point at a distance of 25 cm. As the&#xD;
      distance is increased or decreased from 25 cm, the aiming lasers will appear as two separate&#xD;
      points with the centre of the image being located at the midpoint between them. The aiming&#xD;
      lasers can be turned on or off by pressing the button on the scan head or from the System&#xD;
      Setup window in the PC software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The moorFLPI-2 measurement software provides two measurement modes that can be used&#xD;
      separately or in combination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-image measurement mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single point measurement mode. The multi-image mode setting will be used as it measures&#xD;
           flux over regular timed intervals and that is what is required for us to quantify the&#xD;
           perfusion as compared to a single point measurement mode which measures the average flux&#xD;
           at a single point in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples Concurrently blood samples will be obtained on each patient on Day 0 (day of&#xD;
      transplantation), after reperfusion to measure markers of hypo perfusion and kidney injury:&#xD;
      lactate, glutamate, pyruvate, Interleukin 6 as well as glutathione a marker of oxidative&#xD;
      stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for 3 years following their transplant to look for any transplant&#xD;
      related problems which may relate to the quality of the organ as assessed by speckle Doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and Statistical analysis This is an exploratory study to evaluate the use of&#xD;
      Doppler in kidney transplants and as such sample size is mainly dictated by pragmatic&#xD;
      considerations and what is available for the duration of hiring the device. Nevertheless&#xD;
      sample of 68 is sufficient to provide reasonable precision for the agreement and correlation&#xD;
      tests intended for this study in an exploratory level. The analyses will be mainly&#xD;
      descriptive. Tests will be exploratory and in the view of generating information for future&#xD;
      larger studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Q1 The software integrated in the equipment incorporates multiple blood flow&#xD;
      parameters and a statistical analytical package for an exhaustive analysis of various&#xD;
      parameters. The comparison between the 2 methods for measuring blood flow will be assessed&#xD;
      for agreement using the appropriate statistical methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables for markers of inflammation, circulating markers of hypo perfusion&#xD;
      and oxidative stress will also be assessed for any correlation with speckle Doppler perfusion&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events at the end of 3 years follow up will be compared with the blood flow measurements in&#xD;
      categorical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
