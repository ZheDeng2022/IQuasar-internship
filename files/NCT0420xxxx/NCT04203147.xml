  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 8&#xD;
      sessions of in-home, telephone-delivered, culturally-modified, manualized diabetes-modified,&#xD;
      behavioral activation treatment (Home DM-BAT) delivered by trained diabetes nurse educators&#xD;
      among low income, ethnic minority seniors with poorly controlled T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized controlled efficacy trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the efficacy of Home DM-BAT on clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and LDL-Cholesterol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Low income, minority seniors with poorly controlled T2DM randomized to Home&#xD;
      DM-BAT will have significantly greater improvements in clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and LDL-Cholesterol) at 12 months of follow-up compared to the control group&#xD;
      (in-home, telephone-delivered supportive therapy - ST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of Home DM-BAT on behavioral outcomes (home blood glucose&#xD;
      monitoring, diet, exercise and medication adherence) and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Low income, minority seniors with poorly controlled T2DM randomized to Home&#xD;
      DM-BAT will have significantly greater improvements in behavioral outcomes (home blood&#xD;
      glucose monitoring, diet, exercise and medication adherence) and quality of life (physical&#xD;
      and mental health components of SF-12) at 12 months of follow-up compared to the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of Home DM-BAT intervention for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Home DM-BAT will be more cost-effective in improving hemoglobin A1c levels at&#xD;
      12 months of follow-up, compared to the control group, as measured by differences in program&#xD;
      costs, resource utilization, and hemoglobin A1c levels.&#xD;

      Study Overview. Two hundred participants will be randomized 1:1 to Home DM-BAT (n=100) or the&#xD;
      control condition (n=100) to control for attention. The intervention includes 8 weekly&#xD;
      intervention sessions and 10 monthly booster sessions. Study assessments will be performed by&#xD;
      blinded research assistants at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months of follow-up. Primary&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted at 12 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Home DM-BAT Intervention: A trained nurse educator will deliver the&#xD;
      manualized Home DM-BAT intervention via telephone. Subjects will receive 8-weekly sessions of&#xD;
      behavioral activation and monthly booster sessions from months 3-12. All intervention&#xD;
      sessions will be delivered by telephone and will include a previously tested diabetes&#xD;
      education/skills training intervention based on ADA guidelines, diabetes-tailored behavioral&#xD;
      activation and will address social determinant of health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (GHE+ST): Patients randomized to the control group will receive in-home,&#xD;
      telephone-delivered 8-weekly sessions of combined general health education (GHE) and&#xD;
      supportive therapy (ST) and monthly booster sessions from months 3-12 to match the&#xD;
      intervention group for both content and attention. The control group will not receive&#xD;
      diabetes education, address social determinants of health, or behavioral activation.&#xD;
