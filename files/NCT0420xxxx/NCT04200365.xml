  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done in patients who have been receiving corticosteroids or other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of cGVHD for at least 6 months. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to find out if itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids or other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies is safe and effective in people with cGVHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft versus host disease remains a major hurdle to improve allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation outcome, with cGVHD being associated with decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Suppression of the immune system with corticosteroids forms the basis of first-line therapy&#xD;
      for management of GVHD, but sustained responses are usually seen in less than 50 percent of&#xD;
      patients and there is no standard second- or third-line treatment for steroid refractory&#xD;
      cGVHD. Identification of novel therapeutic targets are needed to improve outcomes.&#xD;
      Therapeutic potential has been shown by a JAK inhibitor in the treatment of steroid&#xD;
      refractory GVHD. Itacitinib is a novel, selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases and will be studied here in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD.&#xD;
