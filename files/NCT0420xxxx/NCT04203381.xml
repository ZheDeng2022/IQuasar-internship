  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria feel increased distress with the onset&#xD;
      of puberty. Gender clinics treat these young adolescents by &quot;blocking&quot; puberty using&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist medications. This has the possibility of&#xD;
      impacting bone development as sex steroids are important to bone mass development. In this&#xD;
      multi-site study, the investigators will examine bone marrow composition (by MRI) in 40&#xD;
      transgender youth and bone density and body composition before/after pubertal blockade&#xD;
      compared to healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to identify the effects of pubertal blockade on bone density and&#xD;
      size in pediatric transgender individuals. Information is limited regarding bone health and&#xD;
      metabolism for this group, and especially for children who are transgender. Further, the&#xD;
      team's expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),&#xD;
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and peripheral quantitative computed tomography&#xD;
      (pQCT), examining the natal female skeleton in previous NIH funded studies, and extensive&#xD;
      clinical expertise, provide an ideal foundation to apply this protocol to examine transgender&#xD;
      female and transgender male skeleton. Findings from this study will allow us to identify&#xD;
      potential preventative strategies to counter the long-term effects of puberty blockade such&#xD;
      as osteoporosis and raise awareness of this medical consequence to medical care providers of&#xD;
      transgender patients. The proposed project seeks to answer the clinically relevant question&#xD;
      of how bone marrow composition relates to body composition, and its relation to both bone&#xD;
      density and skeletal strength, in transgender patients who are undergoing puberty blockade,&#xD;
      the first phase of therapy preceding gender-affirming hormone therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Forty participants who are transgender and who have been prescribed a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist by their physician will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scans at baseline and at 12 months after initiation of the GnRH agonist therapy. This longitudinal observational study of two cohorts seeks to identify significant changes in bone marrow adiposity and bone density over 12 months. The same assessments will be obtained in 40 healthy control subjects matched for age, race/ethnicity and body mass index, all factors that are known to influence skeletal outcomes. The evaluations of bone marrow adiposity will be correlated with bone density measurements and the assessments of mood (validated anxiety and depression scales) and health-related quality of life, before and after pubertal blockade.</description>
