  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate sleep quality and duration affects quality of life, and can cause adverse health&#xD;
      outcomes, for many Canadians. Existing sleep therapies have limitations, such as inability to&#xD;
      adhere to a cognitive behaviour modification or the risk of dependence on pharmaceutical&#xD;
      therapies. Raw honey has a long history of anecdotal reports supporting its use to improve&#xD;
      sleep quality. In an effort to develop an evidence base for honey as a sleep aid, we&#xD;
      completed a preliminary proof-of-principle study to assess feasibility and potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of honey to improve sleep quality. Results of our preliminary study demonstrate&#xD;
      that honey is safe and effective for improving quality of sleep with no associated adverse&#xD;
      effects, as compared to melatonin. The current study design builds off the experiences of the&#xD;
      preliminary trial and will add more scientific rigor to the evidence base we have started to&#xD;
      build.&#xD;

      Inadequate sleep quality and duration may result in adverse health outcomes and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life. Research thus far identify interventions such as behavior modification and&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals to aid sleep. According to Stats Canada (2007-2013 Canadian Health Measures&#xD;
      Survey), despite these available interventions, roughly half of men and women (43% and 55%,&#xD;
      respectively) aged 18-64 have difficulty falling or staying asleep; these results are similar&#xD;
      to those reported in 2005. The lack of improvement in sleep might reflect important&#xD;
      limitations with the current interventions; individuals with sleep disorders may find&#xD;
      adherence to such interventions difficult to maintain (e.g. behavior modification) or the&#xD;
      therapies may pose a risk (e.g. dependence on pharmaceuticals). There is a clear need for&#xD;
      alternative therapeutic interventions, particularly those that are simple and cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational and anecdotal evidence supports honey as an alternative to promote better&#xD;
      sleep. During sleep, the brain typically utilizes liver glycogen stores to provide continuous&#xD;
      and adequate energy; foods that promote liver glycogen storage before sleep may ensure&#xD;
      availability of this energy source and therefore lead to better sleep.4 Raw honey is a&#xD;
      rapidly digestible and metabolizable dense energy source, and thus may provide this sleep&#xD;
      time energy reserve. Additionally, honey may promote melatonin formation due to its possible&#xD;
      tryptophan content (a precursor to melatonin) that both helps to initiate sleep as well as&#xD;
      promote release of hormones that facilitate whole body recovery during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this information, we completed a preliminary open-label proof-of-principle study to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and potential effectiveness of honey in improving sleep quality. In a&#xD;
      cross-over study of poor sleepers, honey improved some areas of sleep compared to melatonin.&#xD;
      The results of this study are the driving factor for the randomized, double-blind, cross-over&#xD;
      study in poor sleepers proposed here.&#xD;
