      The investigators aim to study if patients that undergo catheter ablation for ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia benefit from continuation of Vaughan-Williams class III antiarrhythmic drugs for&#xD;
      3 months after their ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation is a valuable option to control recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) in&#xD;
      patients with structural heart disease. A recent trial proved that catheter ablation is&#xD;
      superior to escalation of anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs) in prevention of VT recurrence and&#xD;
      death (Sapp et al. N Engl J Med 2016; 375:111-121). However, even with ablation,&#xD;
      approximately 20-50% of patients will have an episode of VT within one year. This is probably&#xD;
      explained in part by the substrate (myocardial scar from cardiomyopathy) persists after VT&#xD;
      ablation and that ablation lesions heal and evolve over days, weeks and even months. Most&#xD;
      patients (if not all) of patients who undergo ablation are on AADs and usually have failed at&#xD;
      least one of them. Furthermore, most AADs, and Vaughan Williams class III AADs in particular&#xD;
      (the most frequently used to treat VT) carry significant and life-threatening side effects&#xD;
      from pulmonary, hepatic and hematologic toxicities up to significant ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
      and death. Since these patients have already failed AADs, and the significant adverse profile&#xD;
      of AADs, there is no evidence that the benefits of continuation of these drugs will surpass&#xD;
      the risks after ablation. Therefore the investigators decided to ask the question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with structural heart disease who undergo VT ablation, does continuation of&#xD;
      class III AADs for 3 months, increases VT-free survival compared to discontinuation of&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on expert consensus about clinical equipoise in regards of AAD continuation after VT&#xD;
      ablation, the investigators decided to select patients with lowest risk of VT recurrence&#xD;
      after ablation as our study population. The investigators aim to include in our study only&#xD;
      those patients who have an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD), who have NO&#xD;
      inducible VT at the end of the ablation procedure and also who have NO inducible VT prior to&#xD;
      discharge on a procedure called non-invasive programmed stimulation (NIPS). It has been shown&#xD;
      that patients with inducible VT at the end of ablation and during NIPS have significantly&#xD;
      higher risk of VT recurrence compared to those in whom VT was not induced. In NIPS, one uses&#xD;
      the previously Implanted ICD to pace the ventricle fast enough to try to induce VT. Both&#xD;
      procedures will be performed as usual practice in patients who undergo VT ablation in the&#xD;
      arrhythmia service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this pilot study is to evaluate whether the strategy of continuation of&#xD;
      class III AADs following initial catheter ablation for VT, improves VT-free survival and&#xD;
      reduces readmissions.&#xD;
