      The primary objective of the It MATTERS registry is to assess erectile function at 6 months,&#xD;
      post implantation of an It MATTERS Study Penile Prosthesis, demonstrating an improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life from baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a post-market study on a newly released device and is part of the planned&#xD;
      postmarket clinical follow-up (PMCF) of the device. Adult males with moderate to severe&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction (IIEF-EF domain score 1-16) who meet the indications for surgical&#xD;
      correction of erectile dysfunction will be included. The purpose of this study will be to&#xD;
      assess the impact of the Tactra malleable prosthesis on quality of life in men with erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction through use of the International Index of Erectile Function, Erectile Function&#xD;
      Score (IIEF-EF).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to six months in the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a validated, widely used, multidimensional self-report instrument for the evaluation of erectile function. It consists of 15 items that assess sexual function in five domains: erectile function (Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5,15), orgasmic function (Q9,10), sexual desire (Q11,12), intercourse satisfaction (Q 6,7,8) and overall satisfaction (Q 13,14). A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions. The IIEF-15 total score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 domains.&#xD;
The erectile function (EF) domain is the most sensitive domain of the IIEF. IIEF-EF score ranges from 1 to 30 and is derived by scoring 0 (poorest function) to 5 (best function) on each of six questions function (Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15). There are five categories of erectile function based on EF domain score: severe (1-10), moderate (11-16), mild to moderate (17-21), mild (22-25) and no ED (26-30).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms and overall sexual function at Post-Surgery, 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter post device implantation compared to baseline, as measured by the PHQ-9 Depression Questionnaire and the IIEF: Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Surgery, 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter through study completion, an average of 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a diagnostic tool for mental health disorders used by health care professionals. The PHQ contains: mood anxiety, alcohol, eating, and somatoform modules. The PHQ-9, is a validated tool specific to depression, scoring each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria. Scored from 0-27, the PHQ-9 is separated into five different diagnoses: minimal depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10-14), moderately severe depression (15-19), and severe depression (20-27).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post device implantation compared to baseline as measured by the WPAI:GH Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:GH (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health) is a validated tool that asks a series of questions about the effect of subject health problems, both physical and emotional, on their ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI:GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes, as following 6 questions: 1 = currently employed, 2 = hours missed due to health problems, 3 = hours missed other reasons, 4 = hours actually worked, 5 = degree health affected productivity while working, 6 = degree health affected regular activities. Scores are then multiplied by 100 to be expressed in percentages.</description>
