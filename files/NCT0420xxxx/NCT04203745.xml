  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new diode fractional laser&#xD;
      for skin resurfacing and treatment of pigmented lesions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, clinical trial to study the effects of the&#xD;
      nonablative, fractional diode laser for skin resurfacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 eligible participants will be enrolled at up to three (3) sites. Participants will&#xD;
      receive up to 4 treatments to the face, and other off-face locations may be treated.&#xD;
      Participants will complete follow-up visits for clinical evaluation and photography at 1 and&#xD;
      3 months after the final treatment.&#xD;
