  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check if repeated subcutaneous (SC) injections of&#xD;
      lanadelumab can prevent angioedema attacks in teenagers and adults with non-histaminergic&#xD;
      angioedema with normal C1-INH. Another aim is to check if they tolerate the repeated SC&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a SC injection of lanadelumab every two weeks for 26 weeks. The&#xD;
      first two doses of lanadelumab will be given at the study clinic. Once a participant (and/or&#xD;
      parent/caregiver) has been appropriately trained, lanadelumab can be self-injected. Visits to&#xD;
      the study clinic are planned for the first, third and fourth week and then every 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of non-histaminergic normal C1-INH angioedema population with 12 years of&#xD;
      age and above. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive repeated SC administrations of&#xD;
      lanadelumab or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Randomization will be stratified based on&#xD;
      baseline angioedema attack rate (1 to less than (&lt;) 2 attacks/4 weeks, and greater than (&gt;=)&#xD;
      2 attacks/4 weeks), as well as subtype (known mutations, family history and unknown mutation,&#xD;
      idiopathic).&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy evaluation period will consist of two periods: Day 0 (after study drug administration) through Day 182 (the end of treatment period), presumed steady-state period from Day 70 through Day 182. Run in period will be 4 weeks and may be extended up to 8 weeks to determine their baseline attack rate. The normalized number of investigator-confirmed angioedema attacks (NNA) during each efficacy evaluation period will be expressed as a monthly (28 days) angioedema attack rate.

                  per 4 weeks prior to screening and this attack rate must be confirmed during the&#xD;
                  observation period while treated with chronic high-dose antihistamine (cetirizine&#xD;
                  40 milligram per day [mg/day] or equivalent high-dose second-generation&#xD;

             adjustment during the study treatment period that, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             or sponsor, may confound the results of the safety assessments or may place the&#xD;
             participant at risk. Participants with stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening and NOT expecting any change to their treatment regimen for 6 months during&#xD;
             the study treatment period, will not be excluded.&#xD;

             sponsor, may compromise their safety or compliance, preclude the successful conduct of&#xD;
             the study, or interfere with interpretation of the results (e.g. significant&#xD;
             pre-existing illness or other major comorbidities that the investigator considers may&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of study results).&#xD;
