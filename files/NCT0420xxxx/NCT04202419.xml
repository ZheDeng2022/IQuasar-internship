  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a fractional diode laser&#xD;
      for treatment of pigmented lesions such as, but not limited to lentigos (age spots), solar&#xD;
      lentigos (sunspots), and ephelides (freckles).&#xD;

      Prospective, open-label, clinical trial to study the effects of the nonablative, fractional&#xD;
      diode laser for treatment of pigmented lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 eligible participants will be enrolled at up to five (5) sites. Participants will&#xD;
      receive up to three (3) treatments in the following treatment areas: face, hands, arms, back,&#xD;
      chest, or legs. Participants will complete follow-up visits for clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      photography at 1 and 3 months after the final study treatment.&#xD;
