  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works for the treatment of hematological&#xD;
      malignancies that have come back (relapsed), does not respond (refractory), or is detectable&#xD;
      after CAR T cell therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then for up to&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;
