      Objective: This study is to observe the safety and therapeutic effect of cryoablation&#xD;
      combined with pd-1 antibody immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy in multiple primary&#xD;
      lung cancer (MPLC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this study, 20 patients with MPLC who conform to the admission criteria are&#xD;
      enrolled and began to receive treatment with Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib after&#xD;
      cryoablation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Camrelizumab and Apatinib until&#xD;
      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of the patient or the&#xD;
      researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this study is safety of cryoablation combined with carillizumab and&#xD;
      apatinib for MPLC. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate, disease control&#xD;
      rate, time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival. Exploratory&#xD;
      endpoint is to explore biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood that could potentially predict&#xD;
      the efficacy of Camrelizumab and Apatinib.&#xD;
