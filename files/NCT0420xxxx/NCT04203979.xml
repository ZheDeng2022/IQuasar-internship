  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study designed to examine the performance of biomarkers,&#xD;
      molecular biological methods and other analysis in blood from patient with suspected sepsis&#xD;
      in the Emergency department. 300 - 400 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will prospectively include adult patients (&gt;18 years) with suspected sepsis&#xD;
      admitted to Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål (OUH-Ullevål). Patients admitted to the&#xD;
      emergency department and managed by the medical rapid response team or the sepsis rapid&#xD;
      response team are considered eligible for inclusion. Informed consent will be collected at&#xD;
      the emergency department if possible, or within few days, by a clinical investigator or a&#xD;
      study nurse. The investigators aim to include 300 - 400 patients treated by the Sepsis Rapid&#xD;
      Response Team or Medical Emergency team for possible sepsis. Patients classified to have had&#xD;
      other conditions than sepsis in the post hoc assessment will be used as controls. The&#xD;
      inclusion period will be 12 months.&#xD;

      Samples will be collected, together with routine blood samples, from patients with suspected&#xD;
      sepsis shortly after arrival at the Emergency department, before antibiotics are given.&#xD;
      Calprotectin, CRP and leukocytes wil be analysed in the routine laboratory. Blood will be&#xD;
