    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is defined as denudation of the tooth root surface due to the apical&#xD;
      movement of the gingiva. The occurrence of gingival recession as a periodontal finding has&#xD;
      been estimated to be 78.6%. It is multi-factorial and poses problems from different aspects&#xD;
      to the patient.Various etiological factors documented over the years include, (in the&#xD;
      decreasing order of frequency) toothbrush trauma, malalignment, local factors, occlusal&#xD;
      trauma, high frenum attachment, cervical fillings and crown impingement. Recession levels are&#xD;
      also influenced by various other factors such as age, sex, teeth and surfaces of teeth, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the years, several authors have presented their views on the etiology, types, treatment&#xD;
      modalities and prognosis of gingival recession ranging from the direct lateral sliding flap&#xD;
      to the most recent minimally invasive techniques. The1970s saw Harvey and Bernimoulin&#xD;
      individually demonstrated the use of coronal advancement of the flap along with the use of&#xD;
      grafts with the coronal advancement performed 2 months after the grafting was done on the&#xD;
      denuded root surface. Subsequently, over the next 3 decades connective tissue grafts along&#xD;
      with coronally advanced flap was established as the gold standard for recession coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lien-Hui Huang (2005) pioneered the use of blood derivatives in the form of Platelet rich&#xD;
      Plasma (PRP) for root coverage but with limited or no substantial improvement over existing&#xD;
      techniques. More studies were done on blood derivatives and their efficacy which led to the&#xD;
      introduction of the second generation of platelet concentrates, Platelet rich Fibrin, as an&#xD;
      alternative. Platelet rich Fibrin was first developed by Choukroun in the year 2001 and has&#xD;
      been followed by several studies which have revealed that the slow and sustained release of&#xD;
      key growth factors makes it a useful bio-healing material. Comparisons with platelet rich&#xD;
      plasma have also proved that, platelet rich fibrin has a better release of growth factors and&#xD;
      the presence of leukocytes, which offers quicker and more efficient healing with better&#xD;
      regenerative potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent years have seen newer techniques which are aimed at making it a minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure. One such technique was the pinhole surgical technique given by Chao in the year&#xD;
      2012 which involved a tunnelling procedure along with the usage of a bioresorbable membrane&#xD;
      which satisfied the expectations of the trial.6Better outcomes can be achieved with the use&#xD;
      patient's own products instead of a foreign graft material. Therefore, the present study&#xD;
      compares the effectiveness of Platelet Rich Fibrin as an adjunct to the surgical technique&#xD;
      for root coverage&#xD;
