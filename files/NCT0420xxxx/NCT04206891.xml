  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILBC) represents 5-15% of all invasive BCs. The CDH1 gene&#xD;
      (OMIM no. 192090), located on the chromosome 16q22.1, encodes for the E-cadherin protein, a&#xD;
      key regulator of cell adhesion. Loss of E-cadherin expression is frequently detected in LBC&#xD;
      CDH1 germline loss-of-function mutations are associated with the autosomal dominant&#xD;
      cancer-predisposition syndrome, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC; OMIM no. 137215).&#xD;
      The cumulative risk of LBC for women with a CDH1 mutation is estimated to be 42% (95% CI 23%&#xD;
      to 68%) by 80 years, when it is a component of HDGC syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some authors described CDH1 germline mutations in women with in situ or ILBC with&#xD;
      early onset (&lt;45 or &lt;50) and bilateral in situ or ILBC with no family history of HDGC. These&#xD;
      results are opening a new scenario, suggesting that CDH1 could be a susceptibility gene for&#xD;
      LBC in women without a family history of DGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to investigate prevalence of CDH1 in this specific population&#xD;
      of women with early onset (&lt;45 or &lt;50) in situ or ILBC, bilateral LBC or LBC with no family&#xD;
      history of HDGC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILBC) represents 5-15% of all invasive BCs. LBC presents&#xD;
      relevant differences in the transcriptomic profiles, metastatic pattern, and clinical&#xD;
      behaviour compared to infiltrating ductal BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDH1 gene (OMIM no. 192090), located on the chromosome 16q22.1, encodes for the&#xD;
      E-cadherin protein, a key regulator of cell adhesion. Loss of E-cadherin expression is&#xD;
      frequently detected in LBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDH1 germline loss-of-function mutations are associated with the autosomal dominant&#xD;
      cancer-predisposition syndrome, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC; OMIM no. 137215).&#xD;
      The cumulative risk of LBC for women with a CDH1 mutation is estimated to be 42% (95% CI 23%&#xD;
      to 68%) by 80 years, when it is a component of HDGC syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, updated clinical guidelines for CDH1 testing criteria have been published. For LBC,&#xD;
      CDH1 genetic screening has been suggested for families with diagnosed of both DGC and LBC&#xD;
      (one diagnosis before the age of 50) and patients with bilateral or familial LBC before the&#xD;
      age of 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some authors described CDH1 germline mutations in women with in situ or ILBC with&#xD;
      early onset (&lt;45 or &lt;50) and bilateral in situ or ILBC with no family history of HDGC. These&#xD;
      results are opening a new scenario, suggesting that CDH1 could be a susceptibility gene for&#xD;
      LBC in women without a family history of DGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have revised all literature data about early-onset LBC and CDH1 germline&#xD;
      mutations, excluding pedigrees associated with DGCs. In detail, 482 cases of LBCs were&#xD;
      screened for CDH1 constitutional mutations. Family history for breast carcinoma was&#xD;
      documented in 40.7 % of the considered probands and 20.3 % presented a bilateral BC&#xD;
      manifestation. Mean age at onset was 46 years. Fourteen novels deleterious alterations (2.9&#xD;
      %) have been reported; 5 were missense (35.7 %), 3 mutations affected the splicing sites&#xD;
      (21.4 %), 3 deletions (21.4 %), 2 insertions (14.3 %) and 1 stop codon (7.2 %). These&#xD;
      mutations affect different CDH1 gene domains, spanning almost all 16 exons and introns 1-7-13&#xD;
      boundaries. Two missense mutations were defined as potentially pathogenic variants in vitro&#xD;
      and in silico analysis [Corso et al. Fam Cancer 2016]. Overall, about 3% of the screened&#xD;
      population with LBC have a mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no clear-cut genetic indicators for increased risk have been identified in patients&#xD;
      with lobular breast cancer (LBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to investigate prevalence of CDH1 in this specific population&#xD;
      of women with early onset (&lt;45 or &lt;50) in situ or ILBC, bilateral LBC or LBC with no family&#xD;
      history of HDGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that CDH1 is a susceptibility gene for LBC and that a novel and&#xD;
      rare syndrome (called as hereditary LBC), independent from the classic HDGC setting, should&#xD;
      be described, especially in subjects with early onset of LBC, before 45 years at diagnosis,&#xD;
      and in bilateral LBC manifestation.&#xD;
