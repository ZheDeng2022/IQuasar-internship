  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Kahook Dual Blade is a single-use device specially designed to create a clean cut in the&#xD;
      trabecular meshwork. This ablation in the trabecular meshwork allows a better outflow of the&#xD;
      aqueous humor, thus reducing the intraocular pressure (IOP), theoretically beyond the IOP&#xD;
      reduction achieved by other minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies already published showed good results in terms of the reduction of the number of&#xD;
      glaucoma medications and the reduction in the IOP, but not a single study has been performed&#xD;
      prospectively comparing the efficacy of the technique, not even with the cataract surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This new device, the Kahook Dual Blade, has been specially designed to create a gentle cut&#xD;
      compared to other cutting-devices that also remove the trabecular meshwork. Preclinical&#xD;
      investigation showed no harm in the surrounding tissues. Only two prospective studies have&#xD;
      been published, showing good results in terms of IOP reduction and a significant cut-off in&#xD;
      the glaucoma medications. However, to better assess the real effect, a prospective comparison&#xD;
      with cataract surgery or any other trabecular technique should be performed. We also aimed to&#xD;
      determine the safety of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A prospective, randomized controlled, interventional study was conducted to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety of the Kahook Dual Blade. Patients with cataract and&#xD;
      open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OHT) were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Patients were consecutively recruited from the Department of Glaucoma. Eligible&#xD;
      patients were asked to participate if cataract surgery was indicated due to best-corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity (BCVA) bellow 0.5 (in decimal scale), and moderate IOP reduction and a cut-off&#xD;
      of the glaucoma medications was also aimed. Patients included in the study had been&#xD;
      previously diagnosed with primary open-angle (POAG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PSX) or OHT,&#xD;
      and mild-to-moderate glaucoma according to the Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson classification,&#xD;
      preoperative IOP ≤ 24 mmHg on at least one hypotensive medication, and coexistence of&#xD;
      cataract without narrowing the angle (visible scleral spur at least in 2 quadrants). Both&#xD;
      eyes from the same patient could be eligible if they both met the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria were excluded: patients with other&#xD;
      glaucoma subtypes (elevated episcleral venous pressure, orbital occupancy, Sturge-Weber&#xD;
      syndrome or any type of angle-closure glaucoma). Patients who underwent any intraocular&#xD;
      surgery in the previous six months, including any laser or surgical intervention for&#xD;
      glaucoma, or patients with any ophthalmic diseases that may interfere with tests were&#xD;
      excluded. Severe or end-stage glaucoma or those with an indication of filtering or glaucoma&#xD;
      drainage implant surgeries due to a high IOP with the maximum tolerated medication or&#xD;
      glaucoma progression were also exclude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were thoroughly examined before clinical intervention. This included a medical&#xD;
      history review, slit-lamp examination, IOP determination with hand-held applanation&#xD;
      tonometer, gonioscopy, dilated fundus examination, endothelial cell count (ECC) including&#xD;
      cell and size automated detection with specular microscopy (EM-3000, Tomey Corporation,&#xD;
      Nagoya, Japan), simulated keratometry (simK) determined by topography (Pentacam®, Oculus,&#xD;
      Wetzlar, Germany), and standard automated perimetry (VF) (G1-Tendency Oriented Perimeter,&#xD;
      Octopus® 1-2-3, Haag-Streit, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignation and surgical technique For safety reasons, patients did not discontinue any&#xD;
      topical hypotensive medications before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, controlled study was designed. Eyes were randomly assigned to each treatment&#xD;
      group (www.random.org). If both eyes of the same patient were eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      study, they could be allocated in different treatment groups due to randomization. All&#xD;
      surgeries were performed by two experienced glaucoma surgeons. Standard cataract surgery with&#xD;
      phacoemulsification using a 1.8 mm clear corneal incision (CCI) and intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      capsular bag placement was performed under topical anesthesia and 1% intracameral lidocaine.&#xD;
      The surgeons were blinded to randomization until the end of the cataract surgery. At this&#xD;
      point, if the patient was assigned to the treatment group the surgeon instilled acetylcholine&#xD;
      1% to reduce the pupillary size and facilitate visualization of the angle structures. To help&#xD;
      maintain width, the anterior chamber was filled with a viscoelastic agent. Since the ab&#xD;
      interno trabeculectomy is performed in the nasal quadrant, the surgeons then situated&#xD;
      temporal, the patient's head was rotated 45 degrees in the opposite direction of the surgical&#xD;
      site, and the microscope was tilted 30 to 45 degrees towards the surgeon. To guarantee better&#xD;
      access to the nasal area of the angle, a 1.8 mm keratome was employed to widen the&#xD;
      paracentesis. Further details of the surgical technique are described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative medications and follow-up Hypotensive medication was not administered intra- or&#xD;
      post-operatively unless an IOP spike was detected. Postoperative topical treatment included a&#xD;
      fixed combination of antibiotic plus steroid (tobramycin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1%) six&#xD;
      times a day for seven days; this was tapered over the next four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits were undertaken at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months. During follow-up, results of the slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometer IOP,&#xD;
      and the number of medications were recorded at all visits. The VF and the ECC were also&#xD;
      re-tested at 6 and 12 months. All the postoperative visits were conducted by the same&#xD;
      examiner (NVA). Topical glaucoma medication was re-introduced if the target IOP according to&#xD;
      the severity of the visual field was not achieved, o a higher than preoperative IOP was&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures - Data analysis Data obtained from each group were evaluated to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of both interventions. The primary study outcomes were IOP and the&#xD;
      number of glaucoma treatments. VF, ECC, BCVA and simK were secondary outcomes used to define&#xD;
      the safety of both procedures. Success was defined as an IOP reduction of ≥ 20% from&#xD;
      baseline; this cut-off was based on that reported in other glaucoma surgeries and is used for&#xD;
      evaluation of this trabecular technique. The Saphiro-Wilk test was used to assess the sample&#xD;
      distribution. Independent and dependent sample t-tests, when possible, were used to compare&#xD;
      the results between groups and over time for each group. As both eyes of the same patient&#xD;
      could be included in any of the treatment groups, generalized estimating equations (GEE) for&#xD;
      repeated measures (IOP and number of medications) were also performed. A random-effect&#xD;
      logistic regression was employed to analyse baseline characteristics associated with the&#xD;
      success endpoint (IOP reduction of ≥20% from baseline). Statistical significance was set at a&#xD;
      two-sided p-value ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata® version 14.1&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
