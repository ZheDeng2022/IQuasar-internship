  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib given together&#xD;
      with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and to see how well they work in treating patients with CD33&#xD;
      positive acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Talazoparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a protein (antibody) combined&#xD;
      with a chemotherapy drug which specifically targets acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing a&#xD;
      marker (CD33). Adding talazoparib to the gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy may lead to an&#xD;
      increased effectiveness in treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of talazoparib given in combination with gemtuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin therapy in adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the overall response rate (ORR consisting of complete remission [CR] or&#xD;
      complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) of combination therapy with&#xD;
      talazoparib and gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the preliminary anti-leukemic efficacy of talazoparib given in combination with&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin as determined by complete remission (CR) rate, best response rate (CRi&#xD;
      + partial remission [PR]), duration of remission, leukemia-free survival (LFS), transfusion&#xD;
      independence (TI), and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with this combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib given in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin on&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) in treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate mechanistic biomarkers including levels of PARP inhibition and deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) damage effects in peripheral blood and marrow samples from patients treated with&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate quality of life (QOL) of patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated with&#xD;
      talazoparib and gemtuzumab ozogamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the number of patients able to proceed onto subsequent hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) following combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talazoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 4, and 7 or day 1 for patients who CR/CRi after&#xD;
      cycles 1 or 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 12 months.&#xD;
