  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study with an orally administered drug, BDTX-189 in participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors that have select mutations or alterations in human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB2) genes or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1). The&#xD;
      main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of BDTX-189 that can be given safely to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects of BDTX-189&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn what the body does to BDTX-189 after it has been taken (pharmacokinetics or PK)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the antitumor activity of BDTX-189 in participants with select allosteric ErbB&#xD;
           gene mutations&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BDTX-189 is an irreversible, small molecular inhibitor that is highly selective versus&#xD;
      wild-type EGFR and potent for cancer driver mutations of the ErbB family, including&#xD;
      extracellular, transmembrane, and kinase domain allosteric mutations of HER2, as well as EGFR&#xD;
      and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. These allosteric ErbB mutations are found in 1 - 2 % of&#xD;
      most solid tumors and enriched in some cancers with a prevalence of about 2 - 7% such as in&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. Currently approved HER2 and EGFR directed therapies are not active against the&#xD;
      spectrum of allosteric mutations at relevant and tolerated exposure levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1/2 multi-center, open-label trial is a first-in-human study that will evaluate&#xD;
      BDTX-189 orally administered daily as a single agent in patients with solid tumors harboring&#xD;
      select mutations or alterations. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation primarily designed&#xD;
      to assess the safety and tolerability of BDTX-189 and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D). Phase 1 will focus on patients with a solid tumor with alterations such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allosteric HER2 or HER3 mutation(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER2 amplified or overexpressing tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following selection of the RP2D, a Phase 2 portion will be initiated to further evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical activity of BDTX-189. Phase 2 will focus on patients with a solid tumor harboring&#xD;
      an:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allosteric HER2 mutation (including but not limited to S310F/Y, R678Q, L755S/P, V777L,&#xD;
           V842I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible mutations must be determined by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) test&#xD;
      routinely used by each institution and performed in a CLIA-certified or equivalent&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
