  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potato is a nutritious food that comprises approximately 30% of total vegetable intake in&#xD;
      the United States (US). Consumption of pulses in the US is low but its contribution to health&#xD;
      is frequently promoted. However, in the US diet, potatoes contribute as much dietary fiber,&#xD;
      far more potassium, and a host of similar nutrients as pulses. When prepared to enhance its&#xD;
      slowly digested starch content, potatoes produce a moderate glycemic response. In encouraging&#xD;
      a shift towards plant-based foods and sustainable diets, the potato can partially replace&#xD;
      meat in meat dishes to enhance the overall quality of the diet and reduce meat intake to&#xD;
      recommended levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 11% of individuals with untreated prediabetes progress to diabetes every year.&#xD;
      Reversion to normal blood glucose concentrations reduces the incidence of diabetes by 56%.&#xD;
      Healthy eating patterns such as the DASH and the Mediterranean Diet have shown that high&#xD;
      intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes or pulses, and potatoes are associated&#xD;
      with cardiometabolic health. In contrast, dietary patterns rich in meat and sugar-rich foods&#xD;
      are associated with increased risk of mortality, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that it may be prudent to replace certain foods with fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables rather than simply embrace plant-based diets. Small changes that bestow health&#xD;
      benefits are likely to be sustainable in the long-term. The objective of the present&#xD;
      application is to develop a diet intervention to reverse insulin resistance in an overweight&#xD;
      or obese population. The central hypothesis is that in the context of an overall healthy&#xD;
      eating pattern, potatoes and pulses will not differ in the glycemic and insulinemic&#xD;
      responses, lipid profile, and hsCRP concentration they elicit.&#xD;
