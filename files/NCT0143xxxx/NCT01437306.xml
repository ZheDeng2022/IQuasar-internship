      The objective of this single-dose, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-way crossover,&#xD;
      food-effect study is to evaluate the effect of food on the rate of absorption and oral&#xD;
      bioavailability of a test formulation of lofexidine 400 μg (2 x 200 μg tablet) manufactured&#xD;
      by US WorldMeds, LLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-way crossover, food-effect&#xD;
      study in which 12 healthy adult subjects will receive two separate single-dose&#xD;
      administrations of lofexidine 400 μg (2 x 200 μg tablet). In one study period, subjects will&#xD;
      be administered the study treatment following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. In the&#xD;
      other study period subjects will fast overnight for at least 10 hours, then begin consuming&#xD;
      an FDA standard high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal 30 minutes prior to administration of&#xD;
      the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned numbers in an ascending order, based on successful completion of&#xD;
      the screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive each of the treatments listed below in randomized fashion during the&#xD;
      two treatment periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment A: Test Formulation Lofexidine 400 μg Dose = 2 x 200 μg tablet administered under&#xD;
      fasted conditions US WorldMeds, LLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment B: Test Formulation Lofexidine 400 μg Dose = 2 x 200 μg tablet administered under&#xD;
      fed conditions US WorldMeds, LLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each drug administration will be separated by a washout period of at least seven days. Each&#xD;
      dose will be orally administered along with 240 mL (8 fl. oz.) of room temperature tap water.&#xD;
      After dosing, no food will be allowed until 4 hours post-dose. Except for the 240 mL of room&#xD;
      temperature tap water provided with the dose, no water may be consumed for 1 hour prior&#xD;
      through 1 hour post dose. Meals will be the same and scheduled at approximately the same&#xD;
      times relative to dose for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent adverse events (AEs) of hypotension, all subjects will have intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) access established at each check-in and will be administered normal saline (NS) at a&#xD;
      continuous rate of 150 cc/hour until 1 hour prior to each dose administration. The IV&#xD;
      catheter will remain in place for at least 12 hours postdose so that additional fluid can be&#xD;
      administered if needed. If symptoms or clinically significant hypotension persist, IV fluid&#xD;
      administration may continue for more than 12 hours, until it is no longer needed as&#xD;
      determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced. During each study period, 6 mL blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained prior to each dosing and following each dose at selected times&#xD;
      through 48 hours post-dose. A total of 28 pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      from each subject, 14 samples in each study period. Plasma pharmacokinetic samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for lofexidine using a validated analytical method. Appropriate pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters will be calculated for each formulation using non-compartmental methods. In&#xD;
      addition, blood will be drawn and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory testing at&#xD;
      screening and at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Samples will be analyzed for lofexidine concentration and calculations will be performed for the following: Cmax and Tmax will be taken directly from the data.&#xD;
The elimination rate constant, will be calculated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log-linear segment of the plasma concentration time curve.&#xD;
Elimination half-life (T½) as follows: T½ = ln(2) / λZ&#xD;
Area under the curve will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity using:&#xD;
AUCinf = AUClast + Clast/ λZ where Clast is the final concentration LOQ.</description>
