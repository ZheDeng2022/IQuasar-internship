      The purpose of the study is determination of effective vitamin D replacement strategy in&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency states with currently available preparations in Pakistan &amp; to determine&#xD;
      the cost effective monitoring strategy with urinary calcium excretion serving as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker of achievement of vitamin D sufficiency state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the out-patient Endocrinology Clinics of the Aga Khan&#xD;
      University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. All patients seen in endocrine clinics with Vitamin D&#xD;
      level less than 20 ng and do not have any of exclusion criteria mentioned below will be&#xD;
      eligible for recruitment in the study. The study participants will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      4 groups for intervention to receive intramuscular or oral Vitamin D in 200,000 or 600,000&#xD;
      units as per group allocation. Each group will comprise of 25 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Vitamin D3 600,000 units IM and then every 2 monthly for 2 times if levels remain &lt;&#xD;
      30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Vitamin D3 600,000 units orally and then every 2 monthly for 2 times if levels&#xD;
      remain &lt; 30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Vitamin D3 200,000 units IM initially and then every 2 monthly for 2 months if&#xD;
      levels remain &lt; 30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Vitamin D3 200,000 units orally initially and then every 2 monthly for 2 times if&#xD;
      levels remain &lt; 30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prescribed elemental Calcium 1 gram /day. Vitamin D levels along with&#xD;
      the other biochemical parameter and random urine for calcium &amp; creatinine will be checked at&#xD;
      00, 02, 04, 06 and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has resurfaced as a significant public health problem in recent&#xD;
      years. In Pakistan and as well in the region, VDD is very prevalent despite adequate sunshine&#xD;
      throughout the year. Prevalence of VDD of 92% and 81% in ambulatory patients has been&#xD;
      reported from centers in Karachi and Lahore recently. Reports previously have also&#xD;
      demonstrated VDD from various regions of Pakistan, a study conducted at tertiary care&#xD;
      hospital in Karachi found that 55% of healthy breast fed infants and 45% of nursing mothers&#xD;
      had very low levels of vitamin D. Another study conducted in Hazara division found rickets as&#xD;
      a common problem in children despite abundant sunlight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several areas of controversy which has great relevance for the investigators&#xD;
      community like what level of vitamin D should be considered as deficiency, what are the daily&#xD;
      requirements of vitamin D and how VDD should be corrected. Generally level below 20ng/ml is&#xD;
      considered deficient and levels between 21 and 29 ng/ml is considered relative insufficiency&#xD;
      as depicted by intestinal calcium absorption and nadir levels of parathyroid hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the daily intake required to attain adequate serum 25(OH)D concentrations&#xD;
      are compounded by the wide variability in the dose-response curve and basal 25(OH)D&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no universally accepted method of correcting VDD, In US the available preparation is&#xD;
      50,000 units of ergocalciferol, given weekly or three times per week for total of 300,000&#xD;
      units. Several strategies has recently been studied, a study from southern Brazil&#xD;
      demonstrated that a single 300 000 IU oral dose of vitamin D3 was more effective than 800 IU&#xD;
      per day to increase serum 25(OH)D levels in elderly persons, living in a low-income housing&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to this comparison of the equivalent oral doses of vitamin D3 600 IU/day, 4200&#xD;
      IU/week and 18,000 IU/month on vitamin D status showed that daily dose was more effective&#xD;
      than a weekly dose, and a monthly dose was the least effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In India a recent study evaluated the common physician practice of prescribing 1500 mcg (60&#xD;
      000 IU) cholecalciferol per week for 8 weeks for VDD. Twenty-eight subjects with mean 25&#xD;
      hydoxy vitamin D level of 13.5 nmol/l received oral supplementation of 1500 mcg&#xD;
      cholecalciferol per week and 1g elemental Ca daily for 8 weeks. At 8 weeks the vitamin&#xD;
      deficiency was corrected in all patients with mean the mean 25(OH)D levels of 82.4 nmol/l&#xD;
      however at 1 year follow up all subjects were again vitamin D deficient with the mean 25(OH)D&#xD;
      level of 24.7 nmol/l. This suggests that ongoing supplementation after initial loading is&#xD;
      needed for sustained improvement in 25(OH)D levels vitamin D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study from Australia, a single annual intramuscular injection of 600,000 IU&#xD;
      cholecalciferol was administered to 50 vitamin D-deficient participants. Specimens were&#xD;
      collected at baseline and after 4 and 12 months of therapy. Serum 25OHD3 levels were&#xD;
      significantly higher at 4 months (114 ±35 nmol/L), and 12 months (73 ±13nmol/L) compared with&#xD;
      baseline (32 ±8nmol/L) (P &lt; 0.001), increasing by an average of 128% over the 12 months. The&#xD;
      therapy was effective, with normalization of serum 25OHD levels and maintenance of a level&#xD;
      well above 50nmol/L at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Pakistan oral vitamin D supplementations are available in only in combination with calcium&#xD;
      supplement with maximum availability of 400 IU. Two depot intramuscular preparations are&#xD;
      available one with 200,000 IU and other with 600,000 IU of vitamin D3. Regarding the 600,000&#xD;
      unit preparation the practices among physician are varied, common practice is to give 600,000&#xD;
      units intramuscularly every 03 months, some physicians prescribe a second injection after&#xD;
      first month in cases of severe deficiency and some physicians prescribe 3 injections of&#xD;
      Vitamin D at 2 weekly interval and then repeat in 3 months if needed. Regarding the 200,000&#xD;
      unit preparation, it is less commonly used, more expensive than the other preparation;&#xD;
      however it has the advantage of using orally as well. There are no published guidelines with&#xD;
      these mega doses of depot preparations. The effects of these mega doses have not been studied&#xD;
      in the investigators setting and practices are based on individual experiences. The&#xD;
      investigators strongly feel that information regarding effective correction of vitamin&#xD;
      deficiency with currently available depot preparation is lacking and the investigators study&#xD;
      will help in answering this very important and relevant clinical query.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators second objective of the study is to find a cost effective method of&#xD;
      monitoring adequacy of vitamin D replacement. While treatment with vitamin D is easy and&#xD;
      inexpensive, monitoring of vitamin D levels is expensive, not widely available and assay&#xD;
      limitations in terms of precision, accuracy and measurements of status of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators planned to measure urinary calcium excretion as an index of adequacy of&#xD;
      vitamin D status and to determine the correlation with vitamin D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine calcium is a reflection of dietary intake, calcium absorption from gut, bone turnover,&#xD;
      and renal excretion mechanisms. At steady-state excretion is usually approximately 30% of the&#xD;
      dietary intake. The efficiency of the absorption of renal calcium and of intestinal calcium&#xD;
      and phosphorus is increased in the presence of vitamin D. Reports show increase of intestinal&#xD;
      calcium transport by 45 to 65% in women when 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were increased from&#xD;
      an average of 20 to 32 ng per milliliter (50 to 80 nmol per liter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calciuria estimated by the calcium/creatinine ratio tended to increase in parallel with 25 OH&#xD;
      vitamin D levels this is mostly studied in pediatric population given vitamin D for&#xD;
      prophylaxis of rickets. In adult patients with hypercalciuria and renal stone formation&#xD;
      positive correlation is seen with vitamin D and urinary calcium excretion. Seasonal variation&#xD;
      in vitamin D levels and urinary calcium excretion has also been described. Gokce C et al find&#xD;
      significant correlation between random single voided urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio and&#xD;
      24-hour total calcium excretion in 67 subjects who were selected prospectively to represent a&#xD;
      wide range of renal and parathyroid function as well as urinary calcium and phosphate loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that this simple urine test can be followed to evaluate the vitamin&#xD;
      D sufficiency state in post vitamin D treated patients and can serve as a cost effective mean&#xD;
      of following these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of vitamin D replacement on vitamin D levels with currently available&#xD;
      preparations in patients with vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the correlation between vitamin D levels and urinary calcium excretion in&#xD;
      deficiency and sufficiency states.&#xD;
