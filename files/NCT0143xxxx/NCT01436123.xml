    <textblock>
      Intensive therapy with rosuvastatin 40 mg and ApoA-I Milano reduces the total atheroma volume&#xD;
      (TAV) up to 6.38 or 14.1 mm3 respectively. Our previous bench studies PLASMONICS and NANOM&#xD;
      First-in-Man trial documented TAV reduction up to unprecedented 79.4 and 60.3 mm3&#xD;
      respectively with high level of safety and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completed randomized two arm (1:1) study (NANOM-PCI) with parallel assignment (n=62)&#xD;
      assessed (NCT01436123) the safety and feasibility of the delivery technique for nanoparticles&#xD;
      (NP) using micro-injection catheter (with intravascular intramural injection of allogeneous&#xD;
      stem cells carrying NP after MSCT-, IVUS- and OCT-guided mapping of the vessel), and&#xD;
      plasmonic photothermal therapy of atherosclerosis combined with stenting (Nano group, n=32)&#xD;
      versus stenting with Xience V cage (Stenting group, n=30). The primary outcome was TAV at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean reduction of TAV at 12 months in Nano group was -84.1 mm3 (95% CI: SD 28.3; min&#xD;
      -52.4 mm3, max -99.1 mm3; p&lt;0.05) versus +12.4 mm3 in case of stenting (p&lt;0.05 between&#xD;
      groups). 42/62 patients (68%) in Nano group passed the Glagov threshold of a 40% plaque&#xD;
      burden with mean plaque burden (PB) 36.2% (95% CI: SD 9.3%, min 30.9%, max 44.5%). The&#xD;
      increase of the minimal lumen diameter was 61.2 and 63.3% at 12 month follow up in groups&#xD;
      respectively. The serial assessment of VH-IVUS showed a significant decrease at 12 months in&#xD;
      the dense calcium area, fibrous and fibro-fatty tissue with fulminant necrosis due to&#xD;
      thermolysis in Nano-group, whereas an increase of fibrous and fibro-fatty components in&#xD;
      stenting arm. We have documented 2 vs 3 cases of the definite thrombosis and 3 vs 5 cases of&#xD;
      target lesion revascularization in groups respectively. The analysis of the event-free&#xD;
      survival of the ongoing clinical follow-up shows the significantly lower risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular death in Nano group if compare with conventional stenting (93.4% vs 86.7%;&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmonic resonance-mediated therapy using noble-metal NP associated with significant&#xD;
      regression of coronary atherosclerosis. Tested delivery approach has acceptable safety and&#xD;
      efficacy for atheroregression below a 40% PB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that multistep approach with the use of stent in acute care&#xD;
      unit, and then subsequent transcatheter micro-injection with nanoparticles can resolve&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, stop and regress atherogenesis, remodulate or even rejuvenate arteries. Stem&#xD;
      cells in patch can be good carriers for nanoparticles as well as high-effective metabolic&#xD;
      vectors (paracrine-like regulation of alive cells and via bioactive products of cell lysis&#xD;
      after detonation of nanoparticles) for the treatment of plaque on site. Gold nanoparticles&#xD;
      with silica-iron oxide shells promise high-energy plasmonic photothermic burning or melting&#xD;
      effect under the near-infrared laser irradiation onto the lesion. Thus the investigators&#xD;
      expect complex two-side effect on the plaque with protected lumen and adventitia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel discoveries in atherogenesis, and development of nanobiotechnologies with potentials&#xD;
      for the management of atherosclerosis leads us to the quest of new approaches. The&#xD;
      investigators still cannot really effectively treat atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators management is more symptomatic, and lipid-pool or inflammation-oriented!&#xD;
      The investigators cannot manage non-organic part (mineral deposits, calcified necrotic core,&#xD;
      partially collagen and fibrotic tissue) and total plaque volume Surgery and invasive&#xD;
      procedures is just focused on blood flow restoration (just manipulate the form of plaque) +&#xD;
      concerns of clinical and technical restrictions (incl. alien body - stent) + risk of&#xD;
      restenosis or subacute 'fatal' in-stent atherothrombosis + graft survival/ occlusion +&#xD;
      surgery-related complications High rate of short- and long-term complications and&#xD;
      readmissions. Regression of atherosclerosis in fact is still a dream. The investigators offer&#xD;
      an alternative to stenting and may be cardiac artery bypass surgery (CABG). Our approach can&#xD;
      really allow to rejuvenate arteries, Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) can burn plaque,&#xD;
      but stem cells and bioengineered structures promise restoration of the vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our personal previous data showed that PPTT can 1.6-fold reduce a volume of plaque with most&#xD;
      optimal long-term result in subsets with the use of SPCs as a delivery approach. The most&#xD;
      optimal delivery systems of NPs into the plaque are the on-artery bioengineered patch and&#xD;
      ferro-magnetic approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nanoparticles (NPs) are quite safe for an organism but entire kinetics is mostly unknown. The&#xD;
      most dangerous approach with lowest level of efficacy and safety is a delivery of NPs with&#xD;
      microbubbles. SP+ and mesenchymal SPCs have the similar efficacy as a local delivery system&#xD;
      with a lot of beneficial properties such as anti-inflammative, anti-apoptotic, and&#xD;
      multi-metabolic effects leading to the plaque degradation and artery rejuvenation. Thus,&#xD;
      nanoburning is very challenging technique to demolish and reverse the plaque especially in&#xD;
      combination with stem cell technologies promising functional restoration of the vessel wall&#xD;
      and can be an alternative to stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altering general strategy the investigators generally offer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators don't need a therapy only with harvested stem cells (not so effective,&#xD;
           but more provocative); the investigators have to manage host resident stem cells on site&#xD;
           [local in-artery infusion] with growth factors, cytokines [or systemic potentiation, but&#xD;
           risk of side effects and adverse events is high].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Regular intravenous systemic therapy with modified BM (bone marrow), circulating&#xD;
           progenitor, and iPS (induced pluripotent) stem cells might be beneficial for prevention&#xD;
           of diseases, and rejuvenation of tissues and organs - but the system as whole will be&#xD;
           compromised [the investigators can store stem cells of each individual to use for cell&#xD;
           therapy or bioengineering].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The best way - development of bioengineered constructions through life to transplant a&#xD;
           bioartificial organ on request.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multi-step invasive treatment of atherosclerosis - (1) biodegradable stenting in ACU&#xD;
           (acute care unit), or preventively, with no restenosis and no acute atherothrombosis&#xD;
           risk profile, (2) regular systemic or local stem cell therapy, or with cytokines, (3)&#xD;
           on-artery MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells)-related bioengineered patch with silica-gold&#xD;
           iron-bearing NPs [SCs (stem cells) as carriers for NPs with transduction in hands of&#xD;
           magnetic fields for local elimination of plaque, and subsequent rejuvenation of artery&#xD;
           wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our new approach, challenging modern therapy of atherosclerosis include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BIODEGRADABLE STENTS - for 6-24 months period under the soft short-term antithrombotic&#xD;
           therapy (resolving concerns with stenosis/ lumen + steered remodeling); no hemorrhages,&#xD;
           no alien metal body, no concerns with further CABG, minimal inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTRAVENOUS NON-SPECIFIC SYSTEMIC STEM CELL THERAPY - before and after stenting - launch&#xD;
           repair effects in vessel + beneficial effects for ischemic or injured tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ON-ARTERY BIOENGINEERED PATCH transplantation with NPs or MICRO-INFUSION of stem cells&#xD;
           bearing NP - grown with MSCs and NPs (bovine pericardium scaffold); 3-6 weeks to grow a&#xD;
           thin structure (recover cells before or during stenting), multi-effects due to migration&#xD;
           of SCs + bioactive products of lysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PLASMONIC PHOTOTHERMAL THERAPY - 'melting' and 'burning' effects - direct degradation +&#xD;
           bioactive products of stem cells' lysis + further migration of SCs from patch&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential expected disadvantages of our approach: Necessity of the special precise delivery&#xD;
      technique. Lost function of artery - irreparable pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammative damage -&#xD;
      necessity of another clinical approach for restoration of tissue (may be with stem cells).&#xD;
      Threat of acute fatal atherothrombosis due to rupture of (vulnerable) plaque - verification&#xD;
      of the optimal antithrombotic therapy. Cannot treat non-organic part of plaque - necessity of&#xD;
      the special therapy for mineral deposits, calcified necrotic core, fibrotic sites - solution&#xD;
      using stem cells. Harm of potent detrimental adverse effects - vapor bubbling (boiling of&#xD;
      cytoplasm and ECM with subsequent lysis of cells, and provocation of pro-apoptotic cascades),&#xD;
      acoustic and shock waves due to plasma-generated laser-related detonation of nanoshells in&#xD;
      tissue - need regenerative therapy (type of SCs, conditions and way of transplantation;&#xD;
      Culturing? Sorting?). Erratic (unsteered) heating - surrounding tissue of the site of&#xD;
      interest can achieve a temperature until 38-39°. But at the site of burning final temperature&#xD;
      can be at about 50-180 C (cauterization/ searing/ melting effect) with consequent&#xD;
      pro-fibrotic effect - need regenerative therapy and clarification of energy options.&#xD;
