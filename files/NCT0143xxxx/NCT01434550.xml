    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if SBRT will be a better way to treat pancreas cancer and&#xD;
      to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this treatment will have on participants and their&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for cancer of the pancreas is surgery (if possible), external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. These standard treatments are not a cure and often&#xD;
      extend life by just a few months. Recently, a new approach has been developed, called&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Based on the results of earlier studies using&#xD;
      SBRT, the study doctors at Moffitt feel this is a reasonable alternative to the standard&#xD;
      treatment for your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers high radiation doses to the tumor every&#xD;
      day for 5 days which gives the usual 5-6 week course of radiation in less than a week. It has&#xD;
      also been shown to have much less side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if SBRT will be a better way to treat pancreas cancer and&#xD;
      to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this treatment will have on you and your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six patients will be asked to be part of a subgroup called TBRI (Tissue, Blood, Research&#xD;
      Imaging). In this subgroup, the investigators want to study if there is early death of tumor&#xD;
      cells from the treatment by looking at the tumor using PET/CT scans and biopsies, and by&#xD;
      testing your body's white blood cells taken by a procedure called leukapheresis. You do not&#xD;
      have to take part in the TBRI subgroup to get treatment on this study with SBRT.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All Participant inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amenable to leukapheresis as determined by a leukapheresis nurse&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria - All Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of radiotherapy that overlaps with the planned ports to the primary&#xD;
             pancreatic tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with tumors that are not accessible to direct access cannot be included in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of antineoplastic therapy or irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of autoimmune diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of HIV infection, AIDS or other immunosuppressive disease state. The need to&#xD;
             exclude patients with HIV/AIDS is because one of the endpoints of the study is immune&#xD;
             response. People with HIV have a compromised immune system and enrollment in this&#xD;
             study could confound the results (TBRI only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring corticosteroids are ineligible because one of the endpoints of the&#xD;
             study is immune response. Since steroids modulate the immune system, enrollment of&#xD;
             patients on steroids could confound the results. There must be no use of&#xD;
             corticosteroids in the fours weeks preceding entry into the study (TBRI only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active bacterial, fungal or viral infection&#xD;

          -  Women who are currently pregnant or actively breast feeding. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and must use effective&#xD;
             contraception during trial participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychiatric illness which in the opinion of the principal investigator&#xD;
             might compromise a patient's ability to tolerate or complete treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient requiring blood thinners (due to risk of gastrointestinal [GI] bleed)&#xD;
