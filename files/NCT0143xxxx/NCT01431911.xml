  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing of initiating short-term treatment for COPD exacerbations with oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy has been shown to influence the recovery time of&#xD;
      exacerbations with early initiation of exacerbation therapy having a faster symptom recovery&#xD;
      compared to delayed initiation. While oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotic therapy are&#xD;
      crucial for immediate exacerbation therapy, maintenance therapy with controller medications&#xD;
      for COPD has been recommended to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. The initiation of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after a COPD exacerbation has been shown to be beneficial in the&#xD;
      reduction of risk of future exacerbations. However, there is a lack of information on whether&#xD;
      the timing of this initiation influences the risk of future exacerbations. The following&#xD;
      study evaluates the impact of early versus delayed initiation of controller medication&#xD;
      therapy for maintenance treatment following a COPD-related exacerbation on outcomes of future&#xD;
      exacerbations and costs in patients with COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study period for this analysis will range from January 2003 through June 2009. Patients with&#xD;
      at least one COPD exacerbation will be selected as the initial population. Three types of&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations will be identified: 1) hospitalization with a primary discharge diagnosis&#xD;
      code for COPD, 2) an emergency department (ED) visit with a primary diagnosis code for COPD,&#xD;
      3) physician visit with a dispensing of oral corticosteroid (OCS) or antibiotic (ABX) within&#xD;
      5 days of the visit. Only the first two will be selected as index exacerbations, which is&#xD;
      defined as the first chronologically occurring exacerbation for a patient. For&#xD;
      hospitalization exacerbations the discharge date of the hospitalization will be the index&#xD;
      date and for ED exacerbations the date of the visit will be the index date. The pre-index&#xD;
      period will be defined as the 1-year period before index date and the post-index period will&#xD;
      be defined as 1-year period after index date. The enrollment period will thus range from&#xD;
      January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2008. The post-index period will be used to identify the&#xD;
      date of receipt of prescription for first COPD maintenance medication. This date of receipt&#xD;
      will be used to compute the time to start maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment refers&#xD;
      to the use of controller medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the study hypothesis for the primary outcome being tested was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit between early and&#xD;
      delayed cohorts Ha: There is a difference in risk of COPD-related hospitalization/ED visit&#xD;
      between early and delayed cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts Ha: There&#xD;
      is a difference in COPD-related costs between early and delayed cohorts&#xD;

        Patients meeting study criteria mentioned belowwere classified into two cohorts, early and&#xD;
        delayed, based on timing of (maintenance treatment) MTx after the index date - 0 to 30 days&#xD;
        and 31 to 180 days, respectively. A 30-day period was chosen to define early initiation&#xD;
        based on sample size considerations and recent evidence demonstrating the increased risk of&#xD;
        subsequent exacerbations during an 8-week period following an initial exacerbation [Hurst&#xD;
        JR 2009]. Outcomes were computed for and compared between these two cohorts. An incremental&#xD;
        analysis evaluating the effect of delaying MTx by every 30 days was also done classifying&#xD;
        patients into six categories based on 30-day increments of starting MTx (0 to 30 days, 31&#xD;
        to 60 days, 61 to 90 days, 91 to 120 days, 121 to 150 days, and 151 to 180 days) (Figure&#xD;
        1). Outcomes were then compared across the 6 categories thereby allowing assessment for&#xD;
        every 30-day increment up to 180 days after the index date.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least 40 years of age,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  continuously enrolled for medical and pharmacy benefits during their pre- and&#xD;
             post-period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosis of COPD (ICD 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were excluded if they had MTx in the pre-index period (to ensure inclusion of&#xD;
             MTx-na√Øve patients) or if they received their first MTx during 181 to 365 days of the&#xD;
             post-period (as dispensing of MTx unlikely to be related to the index exacerbation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additionally, patients were excluded if they had any of the following comorbid&#xD;
             conditions anytime during the study period: respiratory cancer, cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
             fibrosis due to, bronchiectasis, pneumonociosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary&#xD;
             tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  also if they had other doses (unapproved in the US) of fluticasone&#xD;
             propionate-salmeterol xinafoate combination (100/50 mcg or 500/50 mcg) or budesonide&#xD;
             dipropionate-formoterol fumarate fixed dose combination (any dose).&#xD;
