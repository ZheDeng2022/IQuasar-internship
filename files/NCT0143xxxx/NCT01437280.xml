    <textblock>
      Oncolytic viruses are viruses that can be found in nature, but they have been modified so&#xD;
      that they can no longer multiply in normal cells. These viruses &quot;infect&quot; cancer cells and&#xD;
      kill them. Once the cancer cell dies thousands of the viruses are released and can&#xD;
      potentially infect other cancer cells in the area. The effects of oncolytic viruses on the&#xD;
      tumor are felt to be the result of a combination of the oncolytic viruses directly killing&#xD;
      the tumor cells as well as the patient's immune system killing cancer cells that are infected&#xD;
      with the oncolytic virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern oncolytic viruses have been used for treatment of thousands of patients. The safety of&#xD;
      such treatments has been good and there have been no deaths caused by treatment with&#xD;
      oncolytic viruses. Many patients have benefited from the treatment in the sense that their&#xD;
      tumors have stopped growing, become smaller or even completely disappeared. Some benefits are&#xD;
      temporary, but about one third of patients seem to gain longer lasting benefit likely to&#xD;
      impact survival. The effect of oncolytic viruses on improving survival has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncolytic viruses can be created from many different types of viruses. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators are using an oncolytic virus created from an adenovirus. Adenoviruses are the&#xD;
      types of viruses that cause the common cold and the flu. Because replication in normal cells&#xD;
      does not take place, these oncolytic viruses should not cause any diseases in normal cells.&#xD;
      Further, to date there has been no incidence of passing the virus on to other humans from&#xD;
      patients who were treated with oncolytic viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see the highest dose of CGTG-102 (the oncolytic virus being&#xD;
      used in this study) that can safely be given to subjects. The investigators will also&#xD;
      evaluate whether or not the CGTG-102 is helpful in reducing the size of the cancer and&#xD;
      improving patient survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pre-treatment visit - subject will undergo a physical examination with vital signs, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken and a PET (Positron emission tomography)-CT (Computer tomography) scan&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, there will be 4 visits with injections performed on trial days 1, 4, 8 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections are given directly into the tumors with help from using an ultrasound. The&#xD;
      total dose of oncolytic virus the subject will receive will be divided into 1-10 injections&#xD;
      which will be injected into individual tumors in the body. The maximum number of tumors that&#xD;
      can be injected for one treatment will be 10 tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISIT 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day 1 visit, blood samples will be taken as well as two biopsies from one of the&#xD;
      tumors. In addition pleural fluids (fluids from the chest) or ascites (fluids from abdominal&#xD;
      walls) may be collected if possible. Then the subject will receive the first set of&#xD;
      injections with CGTG-102. Before the injections, the subject may be given a dose of Tylenol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISIT 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day 4 visit, in addition to blood samples being taken the subject will receive a&#xD;
      second round of intratumoral injections into the same tumors selected for injections on day&#xD;
      1. Urine will also be collected right before the subject goes home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISIT 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day 8 visit is identical to the day 4 visit. The same blood samples and urine sample are&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISIT 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day 15 visit blood samples and a urine sample will be taken as well as a biopsy from&#xD;
      one of the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have to stay overnight at the hospital after each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit will be scheduled on days 29 where only blood samples and a urine sample&#xD;
      will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of trial visit is scheduled around day 43 where in addition to lab samples a PET-CT&#xD;
      scan will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following day 43 the subject will be contacted by study staff at 6 week intervals for 3&#xD;
      months, then at 3 month intervals for up to one year and yearly thereafter.&#xD;

Patients will receive 4 administrations of CGTG-102 (on days 1, 4, 8, 15).&#xD;
Escalation to the next dose level will occur when the safety of all 4 administrations has been evaluated at day 43 on all patients in the preceding dose level.&#xD;
The total dose will be injected into up to 10 tumors injectable by either direct visualization/palpitation and/or ultrasound. Typically, the largest safely injectable tumors are chosen.&#xD;
Injections will be performed by a radiologist or other trained physician. Injections will be planned based on the baseline PET-CT: only PET-positive tumors or tumor regions should be injected. Injection needles designed for percutaneous insertion into tissues will be used.</description>
