      To evaluate the efficacy of the adapted program a randomized controlled trial enrolling 620&#xD;
      eligible African American men who have sex with men (MSM) will be conducted. Men in the&#xD;
      treatment condition will be compared to men receiving the control condition comprised of&#xD;
      standard of care counseling from the clinic plus a free bag of condoms and water-based&#xD;
      lubricants. This two-arm trial will test four hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To test the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based and theory-guided, intervention designed&#xD;
      to reduce STD incidence and risk of HIV acquisition/transmission among young African American&#xD;
      men (15-29 years old) having sex with men and presenting for STD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. Men randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed STDs at each of three follow-up assessments compared to those receiving&#xD;
      the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Men randomized to receive the intervention will report significantly fewer acts of&#xD;
      unprotected penetrative sex (penile-vaginal or penile-anal) between follow-up assessments&#xD;
      compared to those receiving the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Men randomized to receive the intervention will report having significantly fewer&#xD;
      unprotected penetrative sex partners (for penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex) between&#xD;
      follow-up assessments compared to those receiving the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4. Men randomized to receive the intervention will report having significantly fewer&#xD;
      negative experiences with condom use between follow-up assessments compared to those&#xD;
      receiving the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5. Men randomized to receive the intervention will demonstrate significantly greater&#xD;
      improvement in condom application skills, throughout the 12-month study, compared to those&#xD;
      receiving the control condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has termed AIDS a &quot;health crisis&quot; for&#xD;
      African Americans and has called for a heightened national response. The crisis is especially&#xD;
      dramatic in the South and it is now apparent that young African American men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (MSM) are exceedingly likely to be infected. Unfortunately, the ever-expanding HIV&#xD;
      epidemic experienced by this population has not been matched by equal attention to the&#xD;
      development of efficacious prevention programs. The proposed project expands upon an&#xD;
      NIMH-funded study (R21 MH066682-01A1) conducted by Dr. Crosby. His study of young African&#xD;
      American males found that a brief, clinic-based intervention reduced incidence of subsequent&#xD;
      STDs by about 50%. This brief, one-on-one, intervention program, known as Focus on the Future&#xD;
      (FOF), is a practical alternative to group-based safer sex programs that can be difficult to&#xD;
      translate from science into practice. The program is now classified as a &quot;Best Practice&quot;&#xD;
      intervention by CDC. This project will begin with an extensive formative phase designed to&#xD;
      adapt FOF to MSM. The adapted program will seek to &quot;sexualize&quot; condoms to promote their&#xD;
      consistent and correct use to better prevent STD/HIV. The program is uniquely flexible in&#xD;
      that it can be applied to MSM regardless of their HIV serostatus. The adapted program will be&#xD;
      tested by a two-arm efficacy trail. We will recruit 620 MSM (15-29 years of age) from a&#xD;
      publicly-funded STD clinic in Jackson MS. Men in the treatment condition will be compared to&#xD;
      men receiving the control condition comprised of standard of care counseling from the clinic&#xD;
      plus a free ditty bag of supplies from the &quot;condom and lube buffet&quot; (condom/lube&#xD;
      distribution). The trial will test four hypotheses: 1) Men randomized to receive the&#xD;
      intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STDs (by urine assay&#xD;
      and rectal swab) at a 6-month and a 12-month follow-up assessment) compared to controls. 2)&#xD;
      Men randomized to receive the intervention will report significantly fewer acts of&#xD;
      unprotected penetrative sex (penile-vaginal or penile-anal) between follow-up assessments&#xD;
      compared to controls. 3) Men randomized to receive the intervention will report having&#xD;
      significantly fewer unprotected penetrative (penile-vaginal or penile-anal) sex partners&#xD;
      between follow-up assessments compared to controls. 4) Men randomized to receive the&#xD;
      intervention will report having significantly fewer negative experiences with condom use&#xD;
      between follow-up assessments compared to controls. Given the dearth of evidence-based&#xD;
      options for intervening with this vulnerable population in clinical settings, demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy of the adapted program has important implications for U.S. public health efforts&#xD;
      directed towards the prevention of STD/HIV.&#xD;

    <description>This will be achieved through the use of a centralized text messaging service. Once each week (throughout the 12-month observation period) men will receive questions, via text. The data from these weekly questions will be cumulated to form &quot;3-month&quot; variables that correspond with the STD-testing intervals between baseline and the first follow-up assessment and between the first follow-up assessment and the second one (at 6 months), as well as the &quot;6-month&quot; variables corresponding to the STD-testing interval between the 6-month assessment and the final assessment at 12 months.</description>

    <description>Men receiving the control condition will be comprised of standard of care counseling from the clinic plus a variety of free condoms and water-based lubricants. They will also provide a specimen for STD testing, and receive text message questions for 12 weeks. The text messaging system will be used to collect self-reported dependent variables from men on a weekly basis. Texting will also serve as a constant method of contact between the PD and the enrolled men to remind them of follow-up assessments. In addition, the participants will complete the ACASI questionnaire to assess their sexual behavior, as well as demonstrate their condom application ability.</description>

    <description>Men receiving the treatment condition will receive text messages each week after their enrollment date and this will continue for 12 weeks to collect self-reported dependent variables. Text messaging will also be used to confirm and remind men about the day of each follow-up assessment. Each participant will also provide a specimen for STD testing, as well complete the ACASI questionnaire to assess sexual behavior and demonstrate their condom application ability. These participants will also be provided with a variety of free condoms and water-based lubricants. In addition, men in the treatment condition will also be enrolled in an education program.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of an education program. The education program includes providing the ability to enjoy condom use through improved skills related to finding the right &quot;fit and feel&quot; of condoms, using lubricants that are compatible with latex, negotiating condom use, negotiating sex, and talking with new and existing sex partners about ways to &quot;sexualize&quot; condoms.</description>
