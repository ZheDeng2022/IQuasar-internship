      Study aims: to compare two intervention strategies for bifurcation treatment - provisional&#xD;
      T-stenting (PTS) with drug-eluting stent (sirolimus eluting), with kissing balloon inflation&#xD;
      at the end of procedure - the best treatment strategy at the moment, with stenting of&#xD;
      bifurcation lesions with dedicated bifurcation drug-eluting stent BiOSS Lym.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The coronary bifurcation lesions pose a therapeutic problem with high rates of periprocedural&#xD;
      complications, higher rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. These are lesions&#xD;
      where stenting is not superior in comparison to balloon angioplasty in regard to side branch.&#xD;
      It was demonstrated many times, in literature and in daily practice, that angiographically&#xD;
      high grade ostial side branch stenosis is not flow limiting and do not cause ischemia,&#xD;
      therefore do not require treatment. From the other side, our own data with magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) before and after bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      demonstrated that occurrence of angiographic stenosis more than 70% in diameter is associated&#xD;
      with periprocedural myonecrosis in the region of side branch. This fact puts a very important&#xD;
      question about the mechanisms of this myonecrosis. If the jailed side branch has no&#xD;
      significant flow limiting stenosis, but there is some degree of residual ischemia, which&#xD;
      after some period of persistence could lead to myonecrosis, will mean that more aggressive&#xD;
      treatment of ostial stenosis is needed. It is interesting that the strategy of treatment is&#xD;
      very important, because techniques with second stent implantation (with primary purpose to&#xD;
      limit side branch (SB) ischemia) are associated with higher grade of troponin increase. Of&#xD;
      course this is association and not causality, despite that in randomized study it was&#xD;
      confirmed also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even after the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the treatment of coronary&#xD;
      bifurcation lesions, important basic problems remain. It was proposed that these problems are&#xD;
      related to non-dedicated design of conventional stent intended for treatment of straight&#xD;
      vessel segments. Thus any deformation of the stents during bifurcation implantation depends&#xD;
      on the stent cell shape, size and material properties (11). To resolve these problems it was&#xD;
      suggested to make dedicated bifurcation stents (1, 2, 11). However, the special &quot;dedication&quot;&#xD;
      per se is not defined and unclear as terminology - the stent could be dedicated for patient&#xD;
      fitting the anatomical characteristics of particular bifurcation point (vessel diameters,&#xD;
      angulations), giving better hemodynamic conditions; or stent could be dedicated for operator&#xD;
      to make the procedure quicker and safer, eliminating or limiting SB compromise. Probably the&#xD;
      best option is the combination of both characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently available stents on the market generally target the second requirement. Three&#xD;
      groups of stents are available at this moment - proximal main vessel (MV) stent (Axxess,&#xD;
      Devax, USA), MV stenting across the SB with different designs making possible permanent&#xD;
      access to SB and finally purely SB dedicated stents (Tryton, Sideguard, Biguard). Neither of&#xD;
      these stents did not match proximal - distal MV size difference nor take into account between&#xD;
      vessel angulations. The device success rate varies considerably (75% - 100%); however the&#xD;
      study with 100% success was performed in only 11 patients. For all other devices the success&#xD;
      rate is around 85%. The proximal MV stent and SB only stents require additional stent&#xD;
      implantation for non-intended vessel. Stents designed to have permanent access to SB are&#xD;
      implanted over 2 wires, which in reality makes the procedure more difficult and demanding&#xD;
      rather to simplify it (which was the primary intention of those stents). The reasons are&#xD;
      wires crisscrossing, wire-bias in proper orientation of device to SB (rotational and axial&#xD;
      positioning). This, along with requirement of larger guide catheter size explains why the&#xD;
      dedicated stents do not gain popularity in the interventional cardiology community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BiOSS Lim stent (Balton, Warsaw, Poland) is completely different from the above systems.&#xD;
      The stent is designed to be user friendly: it tracked over one wire and its profile is quite&#xD;
      low (1.08mm), which make it possible to implant it even through 5 Fr guiding catheter. The&#xD;
      stent fits the bifurcation anatomy - it matches the proximal - distal diameters of the main&#xD;
      vessel (MV); as it permits deformation in its mid-part it can adapt exactly on main vessel -&#xD;
      main branch angle angle, making wide opening to SB. If the SB must be dilated the stent&#xD;
      recrossing is very easy, because wider proximal and narrow distal parts give step-down at&#xD;
      carina tip region, in this way self direct wire to SB. The proximal and distal parts of the&#xD;
      stent work independently and SB could be safely dilated without need from kissing balloon&#xD;
      inflation as no deformation of contralateral wall strut. This simplifies and shortens the&#xD;
      procedure. And finally, the stent construction prevents carina displacement, as a basic&#xD;
      mechanism of side branch compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims: to compare two intervention strategies for bifurcation treatment - provisional&#xD;
      T-stenting (PTS) with drug-eluting stent (sirolimus eluting), with kissing balloon inflation&#xD;
      at the end of procedure - the best treatment strategy at the moment, with stenting of&#xD;
      bifurcation lesions with dedicated bifurcation drug-eluting stent BiOSS Lym.&#xD;
