  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome is clinically defined by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep and&#xD;
      symptoms, such as being tired. It can decrease the restfulness of sleep and decreases the&#xD;
      level of oxygen in the blood. Sleep apnea patients suffer from daytime sleepiness,&#xD;
      hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias,&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and premature death. There is significant evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that nighttime decreases in blood oxygen levels are the primary cause of many of&#xD;
      the abnormalities associated with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high prevalence of sleep apnea. Mild&#xD;
      sleep apnea is present in 17% of adults in the general population and moderate to severe&#xD;
      sleep apnea is present in 5.7% of adults. Among patients with heart failure the prevalence&#xD;
      skyrockets. Multiple studies have found the prevalence of moderate to severe sleep apnea to&#xD;
      be anywhere from 11-53% in heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is currently the standard of care for&#xD;
      sleep apnea sufferers regardless of the severity of their disease. In patients without heart&#xD;
      failure, CPAP therapy has numerous benefits and several long term studies have reported that&#xD;
      CPAP causes less cardiovascular disease as well as a long term improvement in cardiovascular&#xD;
      symptoms and mortality among patient with severe sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In heart failure patients, CPAP has shown some beneficial short term effects but evidence of&#xD;
      long term improvements in symptoms and mortality are lacking. Compliance with CPAP therapy&#xD;
      reduces systolic blood pressure, improves cardiac function, raises oxygen levels, and&#xD;
      increases exercise tolerance. On the other hand, CPAP has not been shown to affect survival&#xD;
      or number of hospitalizations in heart failure patients. Moreover, compliance with CPAP is&#xD;
      often poor and many people cannot tolerate it. This further limits the therapeutic&#xD;
      effectiveness of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether nocturnal oxygen administration via nasal&#xD;
      cannula alone can improve outcomes in congestive heart failure patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe sleep apnea. The effects of nocturnal oxygen administration will be assessed by using&#xD;
      biomarkers of heart stress and markers of whole body inflammation.&#xD;
