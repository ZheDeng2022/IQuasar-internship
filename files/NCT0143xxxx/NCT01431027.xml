  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic dysfunction refers to abnormal mechanical properties of the myocardium and includes&#xD;
      abnormal LV diastolic distensibility, impaired filling and slow or delayed relaxation-&#xD;
      regardless of whether the ejection fraction is normal or depressed and whether the patient is&#xD;
      asymptomatic or symptomatic. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated high prevalence of&#xD;
      diastolic heart failure (DHF). The quality of life of these patients is impaired and the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes are similar to those with heart failure with systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
      Therefore diastolic dysfunction has significant adverse economic impact that is expected to&#xD;
      grow further with time. Clinical characteristics alone may not be sufficient to diagnose&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction. A number of invasive and non-invasive parameters have been proposed to&#xD;
      diagnose diastolic dysfunction. Most of the presently used non-invasive parameters have a&#xD;
      number of limitations. High fidelity measurement of the left ventricular pressures is needed&#xD;
      to accurately diagnose diastolic dysfunction. Obtaining it in routine clinical practice is&#xD;
      impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol the investigators have proposed a novel non-invasive parameter called&#xD;
      'Torsional Hysteresis' as a measure of diastolic function. This will be measured using&#xD;
      non-invasive cardiac MRI technique. During left ventricular contraction and relaxation,&#xD;
      myocardium deforms. During cardiac cycle the myocardium goes back to baseline state prior to&#xD;
      beginning of each contraction. However the rate with which it returns to the baseline state&#xD;
      is variable. Torsion indicates relative wringing motion of the ventricle around a left&#xD;
      ventricular axis and is a global parameter of left ventricular deformation. The parameters&#xD;
      have defined a new parameter called torsional hysteresis based on non invasive cardiac MRI&#xD;
      assessment. The parameters have hypothesized that for diastolic dysfunction, the torsional&#xD;
      hysteresis area is increased as compared to no diastolic dysfunction group.&#xD;
