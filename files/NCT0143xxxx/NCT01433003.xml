      Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura / hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) is a rare,&#xD;
      life-threatening disorder. TTP/HUS causes multiple blood clots to form, which prevents blood&#xD;
      from reaching the brain and kidneys. TTP/HUS affects 3-5 people per million per year. Anyone&#xD;
      can develop TTP/HUS, but it is most common among 30-40 year olds, and women are twice as&#xD;
      likely as men to acquire the condition. TTP/HUS sometimes develops as a result of medication&#xD;
      use, pregnancy or cancer; however, for the majority of patients (80%) the cause of TTP/HUS is&#xD;
      unknown. In 1991, researchers discovered that plasma exchange was superior to plasma infusion&#xD;
      in treating idiopathic TTP/HUS. During plasma exchange the patient's blood plasma is removed&#xD;
      and replaced with healthy blood plasma. Without plasma exchange, the survival rate for&#xD;
      TTP/HUS is extremely low, with fewer than 5% of patients surviving. Treating TTP/HUS with&#xD;
      plasma exchange improved the survival rate to 80%. Although this represents a dramatic&#xD;
      improvement, researchers are still searching for methods to improve survival. No major&#xD;
      advances in treating TTP/HUS have occurred in the past 20 years. Recent research suggests&#xD;
      that high-dose plasma exchange may improve the survival of TTP/HUS patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether treating TTP/HUS&#xD;
      patients with high-dose versus standard-dose plasma exchange improves the treatment response.&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 150 patients with TTP/HUS from 9 centres across Canada over&#xD;
      three years. The investigators will evaluate whether high-dose plasma exchange improves the&#xD;
      treatment response, survival, and whether it reduces the number and volume of plasma exchange&#xD;
      procedures and duration of hospital stay.&#xD;

      Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura / haemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) is a&#xD;
      rare blood disorder with a high mortality rate of &gt;95% when left untreated. In 1991,&#xD;
      researchers discovered that treating TTP/HUS with plasma exchange vs. plasma infusion&#xD;
      dramatically improved the survival rate, from 60% to 80%.The optimal plasma dose for treating&#xD;
      TTP/HUS is unknown; however, recent research suggests that high-dose plasma exchange may&#xD;
      improve survival in patients with TTP/HUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Treatment of TTP/HUS with high-dose vs. standard-dose plasma exchange will&#xD;
      significantly decrease the composite outcome of 1) treatment failure at day 5 and/or 2)&#xD;
      non-response or death at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will conduct a multi-centre, parallel group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The investigators anticipate recruiting 150 eligible patients with idiopathic TTP/HUS&#xD;
      from 9 centres across Canada over 2.25 years. Patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      high-dose plasma exchange (125 ml/kg/day up to 10 L/day plasma volume) or standard-dose&#xD;
      plasma exchange (50-75 ml/kg/day; approximately 1-1.5 plasma volume). The primary composite&#xD;
      outcome includes treatment failure at day 5 or non-response or death from any cause at 2&#xD;
      weeks. Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the primary outcome,&#xD;
      non-response or death from any cause at month 1 and month 6, days to remission, duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay, number and volume of plasma exchange treatments, and cost minimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Team: Our multi-centre team is part of the Canadian Apheresis Group, which was&#xD;
      established in 1980 and currently operates in 30 centres across Canada. Collectively, the&#xD;
      Canadian Apheresis Group treats 150 TTP/HUS patients each year. Our team includes experienced&#xD;
      haematologists, nephrologists, epidemiologists and a biostatistician. The investigators have&#xD;
      successfully collaborated on several projects and have an excellent publication record (&gt;50&#xD;
      publications across more than 15 journals including the New England Journal of Medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline and Budget: Because TTP/HUS is a relatively rare disorder (an orphan disease), the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit patients over 2.25 years from across Canada to achieve a&#xD;
      sufficiently large sample size. A cost minimization study will be carried out in conjunction&#xD;
      with the RCT to provide insight into potential costing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Directions: If the investigators can demonstrate that high-dose plasma exchange&#xD;
      significantly improves the primary outcome, the investigators will pursue a multi-national&#xD;
      collaboration with American, Chinese and European Centres to investigate other important&#xD;
      outcomes including optimal dosing, cost-effectiveness and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This study has the potential to be the first major advancement in treating&#xD;
      TTP/HUS in twenty years.&#xD;
