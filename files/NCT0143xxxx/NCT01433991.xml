  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study which will be conducted in two parts: a&#xD;
      Phase 1b part comprising a dose escalation and an expansion cohort; and a Phase 2 part which&#xD;
      will comprise two cohorts. The purpose of the Phase 1b part is to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of E7050 and E7080 (lenvatinib) in combination in participants with&#xD;
      unresectable advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the subsequent Phase 1b expansion cohort&#xD;
      and Phase 2 cohorts, additional participants with recurrent glioblastoma or unresectable&#xD;
      Stage III or Stage IV melanoma and disease progression after prior systemic treatment will be&#xD;
      enrolled to confirm the MTD (expansion cohort) and to further explore the clinical activity&#xD;
      of E7050 and lenvatinib.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 1b: Number of Participants Who Experienced Any Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)- Combination Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Cycle length= 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as toxicity related to the combination therapy and was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). Hematological DLTs were Grade 4 neutropenia for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 days or Grade 3 neutropenia with fever (greater than [&gt;] 38.5 degree Celsius (°C) in axilla), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or lasting &gt;7 days and decrease of hemoglobin of Grade 4. Non-hematological DLTS were Grade 3 fatigue, or a 2 point decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must persist for &gt;7days, Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea must persist at Grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy, Grade 4 hypertension or Grade 3 hypertension not able to be controlled by medication and any Grade 3 or higher non-hematological laboratory abnormalities that require hospitalization.</description>

    <measure>Phase 1b: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Golvatinib in Combination With Lenvatinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Cycle length= 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1/6 participants experienced a DLTs, with the next higher dose having at least 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. MTD was determined by summarizing the number and percentage of participants with DLTs for the first cycle, by study dosing schedule, initial dosing level and overall for the dose escalation part. The RP2D of golvatinib in Combination with lenvatinib was MTD determined by Dose Escalation Committee (DEC) based on safety, PK and clinical data. DLT was defined as toxicity related to the combination therapy and was graded according to CTCAE v4.0.</description>

    <description>ORR was assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to less than (&lt;)10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive E7050 in combination with lenvatinib to identify a Maximum Tolerated Dose. Dose escalation will begin at low doses of both E7050 and lenvatinib, and then gradually increase in future cohorts until a recommended combination dose is identified. A dose of E7050 and lenvatinib to be used in combination in Phase 2 will be recommended (RP2 dose). Participants will continue on treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.</description>

             IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] at the Screening&#xD;
             and Baseline Visit (a separate Baseline assessment is not required if a negative&#xD;
             Screening pregnancy test was obtained within 72 hours before the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug). Females of child-bearing potential, if not practising total abstinence or&#xD;
             having a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia, must agree to use two highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception: e.g., 1) an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             intrauterine system (IUS); 2) a barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cup&#xD;
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) + spermicide (foam, gel, cream, etc.); 3) oral,&#xD;
             injected, or implanted hormonal contraceptives throughout the entire study period and&#xD;
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Use of a double-barrier method (i.e.,&#xD;
             use at the same time of a condom + occlusive cup [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] +&#xD;
             spermicide [foam, gel, cream, etc.]) is accepted as two highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception. The only participants who will be exempt from this requirement are&#xD;
             postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12&#xD;
             consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected&#xD;
             primary cause) or participants who have been sterilized surgically or who are&#xD;
             otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month&#xD;
             prior to dosing, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1&#xD;
             month prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use&#xD;
             the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Male participants who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a&#xD;
             condom + spermicide and their female partners, if of childbearing potential, must use&#xD;
             a highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Inclusion&#xD;
             Criterion #18) beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug,&#xD;
             throughout the entire study period, and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug,&#xD;
             unless the male participants are totally abstinent sexually or have undergone a&#xD;
             successful vasectomy with confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have&#xD;
             been sterilized surgically or are otherwise proven sterile (see Inclusion Criterion&#xD;
             #16).&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 2 investigative sites in the United States from 13 October 2011 to 01 March 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 40 participants were screened, of which 10 were screen failures and 30 participants were enrolled in the study. This study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: Phase 1b part and Phase 2 part. Study was terminated by the sponsor at the end of Phase 1b due to a change in corporate strategy, hence Phase 2 was not carried out. In this study, a single agent run-in period was conducted prior to the administration of combination treatment in treatment phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>DLT was defined as toxicity related to the combination therapy and was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). Hematological DLTs were Grade 4 neutropenia for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 days or Grade 3 neutropenia with fever (greater than [&gt;] 38.5 degree Celsius (°C) in axilla), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or lasting &gt;7 days and decrease of hemoglobin of Grade 4. Non-hematological DLTS were Grade 3 fatigue, or a 2 point decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must persist for &gt;7days, Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea must persist at Grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy, Grade 4 hypertension or Grade 3 hypertension not able to be controlled by medication and any Grade 3 or higher non-hematological laboratory abnormalities that require hospitalization.</description>

        <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1/6 participants experienced a DLTs, with the next higher dose having at least 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. MTD was determined by summarizing the number and percentage of participants with DLTs for the first cycle, by study dosing schedule, initial dosing level and overall for the dose escalation part. The RP2D of lenvatinib in Combination with golvatinib was MTD determined by DEC based on safety, PK and clinical data. DLT was defined as toxicity related to the combination therapy and was graded according to CTCAE v4.0.</description>
