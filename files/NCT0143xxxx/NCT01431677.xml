      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In individuals as they age, changes in muscle tissue can significantly affect their muscle&#xD;
      strength and exercise endurance. This process, known as sarcopenia, may lead to decreased&#xD;
      mobility and physical weakness, which is what we in general refer to as frailty. The causes&#xD;
      of sarcopenia and why it affects some individuals more than others are not known, but many&#xD;
      factors influence muscle physiology and function, including metabolic, hormonal,&#xD;
      environmental, and lifestyle factors. Researchers interested in identifying factors involved&#xD;
      in the start and progression of sarcopenia need of samples of human muscle tissue and cells&#xD;
      for laboratory investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To train researchers in the appropriate procedures for performing muscle biopsies and&#xD;
           collecting, labeling, and storing the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a data base of specific scientific studies evaluating the physiological and&#xD;
           metabolic function of muscle that can be used in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as&#xD;
           well as blood and urine tests, and will schedule a date for the muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a muscle biopsy, with tissue and cells taken from the upper part&#xD;
           of the thigh. A local anesthetic will be given for the procedure. Participants will also&#xD;
           provide a blood sample and have an electrocardiogram to evaluate heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a followup visit 1 week after the biopsy visit to evaluate the&#xD;
           healing process and provide any further treatment for the affected area, after which&#xD;
           they may fully resume normal activities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An important concept in pathologic aging is that in some individuals muscle strength and&#xD;
      exercise endurance are significantly decreased through both quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      changes in muscle tissue. This process, termed sarcopenia, leads to frailty, a syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by decreased mobility, weakness, and a very poor prognosis for survival,&#xD;
      although the causal pathway for this association is not known. The causes of sarcopenia and&#xD;
      why it affects some individuals more than others is not known. This is a complicated&#xD;
      scientific question because many factors influence muscle physiology and function, including&#xD;
      metabolic, hormonal, environmental, life-style, co-morbid medical problems and their&#xD;
      treatments, etc. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a long-standing interest in&#xD;
      sarcopenia and frailty and has established a number of observational studies aimed at&#xD;
      understanding the cause and course of these age-related conditions. It is our goal to try to&#xD;
      identify factors involved in the initiation and progression of sarcopenia and frailty, and to&#xD;
      develop therapies that can reverse or slow these processes. To identify molecular and genetic&#xD;
      changes that are associated with sarcopenia, it is crucial that human muscle biopsy specimens&#xD;
      be available for laboratory investigations. This proposal will enable the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Branch (CRB) to set up this procedure on the NIA Clinical Research Unit located on the fifth&#xD;
      floor at Harbor Hospital, and to hone the practical skills that will be needed for analyzing&#xD;
      muscle tissue from individuals in observational and interventional clinical trials. The goal&#xD;
      will be to become facile at performing muscle biopsies, collecting, labeling and storing the&#xD;
      samples, and to ensure that all equipment and expertise required to efficiently perform the&#xD;
      procedure are in place. 14 healthy volunteers will be accrued to the study, however after&#xD;
      this, the protocol will be kept open for the purpose of training other physicians or nurse&#xD;
      practitioners in the biopsy procedure.&#xD;
