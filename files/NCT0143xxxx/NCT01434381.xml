      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The malaria vaccine Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel may help block malaria parasites from developing&#xD;
      in mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites a vaccinated person, the vaccine should prevent&#xD;
      parasites from developing in the mosquito. As a result, the mosquito will not spread malaria&#xD;
      to the next person it bites. However, the vaccine will not directly prevent people from&#xD;
      getting sick with malaria. Researchers want to test the safety of and response to this&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety of the malaria vaccine Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be assigned to a study group to have either two or three doses of the vaccine.&#xD;
           Participants will have checkups after each dose of vaccine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The additional doses will be given 2 months or 2 and 4 months after the first vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular blood tests to check the level of the response to the&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be followed for up to 1 year after the last vaccine to have any additional&#xD;
           tests as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination or&#xD;
      eradication of this disease. Pfs25, a surface antigen of ookinetes in the mosquito stage of&#xD;
      P. falciparum, is a lead candidate for a malaria transmission blocking vaccine. Recombinant&#xD;
      Pfs25 has been conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA), and adjuvanted with&#xD;
      Alhydrogel(Registered Trademark). This open label, dose escalating Phase 1 study in malaria&#xD;
      naive adults, conducted at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for&#xD;
      Immunization Research (CIR) in Baltimore, Maryland, will determine initial safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the vaccine given on a 2-dose,3-dose, or 4-dose schedule. Thirty (30)&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled, with 5 receiving the low dose (8 micro g of conjugated Pfs25), 5&#xD;
      receiving the middle dose (16 micro g of conjugated Pfs25), and 20 receiving the high dose&#xD;
      (47 micro g of conjugated Pfs25). The high dose group will receive either 2, 3 or 4 doses of&#xD;
      vaccine, on a 0, 2, 4 and 10 month vaccination schedule. Volunteers will be followed for 12&#xD;
      months following the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs). Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA,&#xD;
      transmission blocking in a standard membrane feeding assay, and B and T cell responses.&#xD;
