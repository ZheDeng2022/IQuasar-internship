      This study will be a non-randomized trial consisting of patients with single level (C3 to C7)&#xD;
      symptomatic cervical disc disease who have not previously received fusion surgery at the same&#xD;
      level, and have failed to improve with conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks prior to&#xD;
      enrollment, or who present with progressive neurological symptoms or signs in the face of&#xD;
      conservative treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criteria for inclusion into the proposed clinical study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age: 18-60 years of age (inclusive and skeletally mature);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A diagnosis of symptomatic cervical disc disease, defined as image-confirmed&#xD;
             pathology: herniated disc, spondylosis, and/or loss of disc height. Spondylosis is&#xD;
             defined as image-confirmed disc desiccation, loss of disc height, bridging&#xD;
             osteophytes, and/or uncovertebral arthrosis. Loss of disc height is specified as a&#xD;
             measurement of at least 25 degrees less than an adjacent nonsymptomatic level, but&#xD;
             with a minimum of 1mm height remaining;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Functional neurological deficit (i.e., exhibits at least one sign associated with&#xD;
             cervical level to be treated, including abnormal reflex, decreased motor strength,&#xD;
             abnormal dermatome sensitivity, or pain in a dermatomal distribution);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptomatic level is C3-4, C4-5, C5-6 or C6-7 (one level);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Preoperative Neck Disability Index (NDI) greater than 30 points (considered moderate&#xD;
             disability; Vernon 1991);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unresponsive to conservative treatment for more than 6 weeks, and/or exhibits&#xD;
             progressive symptoms and/or signs of nerve root and/or spinal cord compression in the&#xD;
             face of conservative treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Not pregnant, nor interested in becoming pregnant within the follow-up period of the&#xD;
             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing and able to comply with the requirements defined in the protocol for the&#xD;
             duration of the study;&#xD;
