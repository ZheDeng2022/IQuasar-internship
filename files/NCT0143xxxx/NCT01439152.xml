             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mild blurry vision, either age-related or due to ocular or systemic disorder (e.g.&#xD;
             diabetes, dry eyes, cataracts, uncorrected refraction abnormality) may be allowed at&#xD;
             the discretion of the ophthalmologist if deemed as no constituting a predisposition to&#xD;
