    <textblock>
      A range of observational and epidemiological studies have shown that the lifetime risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection can be reduced by 70% through male circumcision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rwanda has a national plan to offer a voluntary male circumcision (MC) program to 2 million&#xD;
      adult men in 2 years as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy. To achieve this&#xD;
      goal, the government launched a national study, based on the WHO Framework for Evaluation of&#xD;
      Adult MC Devices, to assess the safety, efficacy and supremacy of the PrePex™ device when&#xD;
      compared to surgical circumcision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrePex device was developed to facilitate rapid scale up of non-surgical adult male&#xD;
      circumcision in resource limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rwanda validated the aforementioned endpoints via physicians in a Safety and Efficacy Study&#xD;
      (NCT01150370) and Randomized, Controlled Comparison Study (NCT01284088). The procedure was&#xD;
      bloodless, required no anesthesia, no sutures and no sterile settings, with 1 AE that was&#xD;
      managed with minimal intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence submitted to members of WHO, USAID, UNAIDS and the Bill and Melinda Gates&#xD;
      Foundation, and WHO audited the study site. The Safety and Efficacy study results were&#xD;
      published in the JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Sept 8, 2011, and&#xD;
      presented in CROI 2011 and AUA 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve its national &quot;catch up&quot; campaign with minimal burden to the overly strained health&#xD;
      system, which lacks physicians and surgical infrastructure, Rwanda needs to task shift the&#xD;
      procedure to nurses. This study is meant to test the Safety and Efficacy in the hands of&#xD;
      non-surgically trained nurses from the A1 and A2 cadres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male circumcision can reduce the lifetime risk of HIV infection by 60% in high risk areas&#xD;
      such as Sub Saharan Africa. In 2009, the US Government (USAID) reported that scaling up male&#xD;
      circumcision to reach 80 percent of adult and newborn males in 14 African countries by 2015&#xD;
      could potentially avert more than 4 million adult HIV infections between 2009 and 2025 and&#xD;
      yield annual cost savings of US$1.4 - 1.8 billion after 2015, with a total net savings of&#xD;
      US$20.2 billion between 2009 and 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are over 38 million adolescent and adult males in Africa that could benefit from male&#xD;
      circumcision for HIV prevention. The challenge Africa faces is how to safely scale up a&#xD;
      surgical procedure in resource limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rwanda has a national plan to offer a voluntary male circumcision (MC) program to 2 million&#xD;
      adult men in 2 years as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy. To achieve this&#xD;
      goal, the government launched a national study, based on the WHO Framework for Evaluation of&#xD;
      Adult MC Devices, to assess the safety, efficacy and supremacy of the PrePex™ device when&#xD;
      compared to surgical circumcision.&#xD;

      non-surgically trained nurses from the A1 and A2 cadres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate 75 subjects in training phase, 100 subjects in a pilot group and then&#xD;
      additional 415 in a pivotal group summing up to 590.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 503 subjects assigned to the Pivotal group will undergo standard PrePex procedure and&#xD;
      follow up and will be the main core of the study. An interim safety report will be prepared&#xD;
      after 100 subjects (Pilot Group). Up to 75 subjects will be enrolled to the Training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the safety and efficacy of the PrePex device when circumcision is&#xD;
      performed by nurses, among healthy adult men scheduled for voluntary circumcision, in&#xD;
      preparation for scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study duration per subject will be 8 weeks.&#xD;
