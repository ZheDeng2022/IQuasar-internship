  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study purpose: African Americans with hypertension and markers of metabolic syndrome (small&#xD;
      elevations in blood glucose, triglycerides and or weight) are at a high risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems. There is a circulating factor called&#xD;
      angiotensin II that increases risk and may be more important in African Americans who have up&#xD;
      to 20 times greater risk of losing kidney function and requiring dialysis. Research&#xD;
      Investigators, including those at the University of Michigan, found one drug (Ramipril) that&#xD;
      blocks angiotensin II effects significantly and improves kidney function in African&#xD;
      Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of The SAAVE Study is to determine whether the combination of two new blockers&#xD;
      (Valsartan and Aliskiren) of angiotensin II, are better able to lower blood pressure, also&#xD;
      improve some of the risk factors for cardiovascular problems and provide greater protection&#xD;
      to the heart and kidneys.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of Valsartan/Aliskiren will&#xD;
      provide incremental reduction in blood pressure when compared to traditional blockade of&#xD;
      Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) with ramipril. As an exploratory analysis, we&#xD;
      propose that the blood pressure effect will be associated with suppressing plasma aldosterone&#xD;
      levels, preserving the availability of nitric oxide, and preventing the development of&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Other variables of interest include changes from baseline in adiponectin,&#xD;
      Procollagen 1 and 3, osteopontin, cystatin C, and serum K+. In a nested cohort we will&#xD;
      determine the impact of novel dual RAAS blockade on left ventricular remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should our hypotheses be proven correct and novel dual RAAS blockade is more effective than&#xD;
      ramipril in reducing blood pressure, plasma aldosterone, preserving the availability of&#xD;
      nitric oxide, as reflected by an increase in asymmetric dimethly arginine (ADMA) levels, and&#xD;
      improves cardiovascular remodeling, this would have important implications for the long term&#xD;
      prevention of target organ damage and cardiovascular events in this high risk ethnic group.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Aliskiren/Valsartan (Valturna)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Valturna contains two prescription medicines in one tablet that work together to lower blood pressure. It contains aliskerin (Tekturna), a direct rennin inhibitor (DRI), and valsartan (Diovan), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Aliskerin reduces the effect of rennin, and the harmful process that narrows blood vessels. It also helps blood vessels relax and widen so blood pressure is lower. Valsartan can help lower blood pressure by blocking a potent chemical, angiotensin II, which leads to blood vessel constriction and narrowing.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ramipril</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Ramipril (Altace) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). It is a chemical compound that helps create a protein named angiotensin II. Angiotensin II can raise blood pressure by causing your blood vessels to narrow. Altace helps lower blood pressure by decreasing the amount of ACE the body makes. Ramipril has been proven by the investigators to stabilize decline in kidney function in African American patients with evidence of damage.</description>

    <intervention_name>Aliskerin/Valsartan and Rampiril</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will start on low dose Ramipril 10 mg or Valturna 150/160 at visit 2, and up-titrate to target dose of Ramipril 20 mg or Valturna 300/320 at visit 3. At visit 5, the addition of Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or amlodipine will be allowed to achieve the SBP target of &lt; 140 mmHg. High dose will then be maintained throughout the remainder of the study. In case of symptoms of low blood pressures, the study medication may be decreased to the low dose.&#xD;
(However, all non-study medication will be manipulated, initially.)</description>
