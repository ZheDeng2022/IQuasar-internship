    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, prospective, uncontrolled study to include 12 consecutive patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis of the liver and recurrent or refractory ascites. The main aim (primary&#xD;
      objective) of the study is to investigate the effect of treatment of ascites by the Sequana&#xD;
      medical pump on the renal and circulatory function in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory ascites. The secondary objectives are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of treatment for handling ascites, associated with changes in&#xD;
           the body weight of patients and their requirements for evacuation paracentesis during&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of treatment on bacterial translocation, by means of&#xD;
           determining bacterial DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of complications associated with treatment in the course of&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment on quality of life of the patients treated,&#xD;
           evaluated in questionnaires entitled Short Form-36 and CLDQ (chronic liver disease&#xD;
           questionnaire).&#xD;
