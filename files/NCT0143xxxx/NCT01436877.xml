      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MediTate Temporary&#xD;
      Implantable Nitinol Device (TIND) used to alleviate symptoms of Bladder Outlet Obstruction&#xD;
      (BOO) secondary to Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH).The TIND is inserted in the bladder neck&#xD;
      and prostatic urethra under local anesthesia for few days and taken out some 5 days later in&#xD;
      the doctors office.&#xD;
