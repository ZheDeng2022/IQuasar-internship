      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Childhood-onset dystonia is caused by a brain injury. It causes muscle contractions and&#xD;
      twisting movements that the person with dystonia cannot control. The term hemidystonia is&#xD;
      used when only one side of the body is affected. When dystonia starts during childhood, the&#xD;
      brain and nerves may not develop normally. People with hemidystonia can become disabled&#xD;
      because of the unwanted postures and twisting that dystonia causes. More research is needed&#xD;
      to determine how dystonia affects brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study brain function in people with hemidystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 40 years of age who developed hemidystonia before age 13.&#xD;
           Only one wrist may be affected by hemidystonia, and participants must have at least some&#xD;
           movement in that wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires five visits to the NIH Clinical Center: a screening visit and four&#xD;
           study visits. Each visit will last up to 3 hours. Visits will be scheduled about once a&#xD;
           week. The study procedures may be done in any order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. During the scan, participants will be asked to&#xD;
           move their hand at the wrist when they hear a tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor tests of arm movement, balance, and walking. These tests may also examine nerve&#xD;
           development and muscle tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions to study the electrical activity of the&#xD;
           muscles and brain. These sessions may also involve sensory tests. Participants will have&#xD;
           hearing tests before the first session and after the second session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment for hemidystonia will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      In childhood-onset hemidystonia, motor and sensory abnormalities pose a great challenge to&#xD;
      voluntary movement. In an effort to inform future methods of treatment of this disorder, this&#xD;
      study seeks to (1) characterize involuntary muscle activity, (2) explore neurophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms of involuntary muscle activity, (3) characterize abnormalities of sensation, (4)&#xD;
      assess performance on two sensorimotor tasks (voluntary postural control, and a&#xD;
      reach-to-grasp arm movement), and (5) explore brain abnormalities using imaging in&#xD;
      childhood-onset hemidystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dystonia group will consist of 40 individuals (age 7-40 years) with childhood-onset&#xD;
      hemidystonia. The control group will consist of 40 individuals within the same age range with&#xD;
      no neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study, in which multiple assessments will be performed over a short&#xD;
      period. Results in the dystonia group will be compared to results in the control group. Due&#xD;
      to the laterality of brain injury in hemidystonia, outcomes from both arms and cortical&#xD;
      hemispheres will be compared to each other. Outcomes within the dystonia group will be&#xD;
      correlated with validated dystonia rating scales as well as with the age at the time of&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Objective 1, we will analyze the timing of involuntary electromyographic (EMG) activity&#xD;
      and kinematics triggered in the dystonic arm during various tasks. In Objective 2, we will&#xD;
      investigate various types of intracortical inhibition (short intracortical inhibition, long&#xD;
      intracortical inhibition, contralateral silent period, and ipsilateral silent period) and&#xD;
      intracortical facilitation in motor cortical regions controlling the dystonic wrist flexor&#xD;
      during voluntary contraction of the wrist extensor using transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS). In addition, we will perform a coherence analysis between EMG activity in the wrist&#xD;
      flexor and extensor muscles and between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the primary&#xD;
      motor cortex and the contralateral wrist muscles. In Objective 3, we will test tactile sense&#xD;
      (spatial and temporal), vibration sense, and stereognosis of the hand. In Objective 4, we&#xD;
      will analyze seated limits of stability (voluntary postural control), and the timing and&#xD;
      amplitude of EMG activity and kinematics in the arm during a reaching and grasping arm&#xD;
      movement. In Objective 5, we will obtain brain scans with structural magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional connectivity MRI, and&#xD;
      functional MRI during a simple task.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 7 40 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health, with enough energy to carry out the assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and comply with instructions. Adults must be able to provide&#xD;
             their own consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Passive motion of at least 15 degrees extension and 15 degrees flexion from neutral of&#xD;
             both wrist joints&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to not drink caffeine or alcohol for 24 hours before each study session&#xD;
             because both agents can modify brain activity and may confound outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for individuals with dystonia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Childhood-onset (before 13 years of age) hemidystonia in one wrist. Diagnosis of dystonia&#xD;
        will be made based on the Hypertonia Assessment Tool (HAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Presence of any neurological disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with Dystonia:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Botulinum toxin injection in the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis in&#xD;
             the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of medicines for muscle tone (e.g., baclofen, trihexyphenedyl,&#xD;
             dantrolene sodium, tizanidine, or carbidopa/levodopa). If patients are taking these&#xD;
             medications daily, the treating physician will be contacted by the MAI to determine if&#xD;
             it is acceptable for the subject to temporarily discontinue the medication(s). If the&#xD;
             risk of weaning, or stopping the medication is deemed harmless, the MAI and/or&#xD;
             treating physician will determine a schedule to wean, or stop the medication. The goal&#xD;
             is for the subject to be off medication(s) for 24 hours prior to participating in&#xD;
             testing for this study. For these subjects, there will be at least 4 days between&#xD;
             scheduled research visits to avoid a prolonged time off medication(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for TMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
