  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relative risk of psoriasis and its severity are directly related to the body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI).Patients with psoriasis likely undergo a vicious circle where obesity and skin disease&#xD;
      reinforce each other. To investigate patients' opinion about their body weight (BW), the&#xD;
      possibility of dietary approach to psoriasis, and to examine the adherence and the effects of&#xD;
      hypo-energetic diet to maintain disease remission in obese patients a dedicated questionnaire&#xD;
      was administered to 200 consecutive patients (125 men and 75 women) with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      chronic plaque psoriasis investigating whether diet factors could influence psoriasis&#xD;
      severity and course. In second part of study, obese patients with psoriasis in remission&#xD;
      (PASI improvement ≥ 75%) for at least 12 weeks after methotrexate therapy were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive a hypo-caloric diet or free diet for 24 weeks, and then followed up for&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic plaque psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease associated with obesity in 13-34% of&#xD;
      cases. In recent years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased in almost all&#xD;
      developed countries.Obesity and a high body mass index have been shown to be risk factors for&#xD;
      the development of psoriasis and in large, prospective studies obesity precede the&#xD;
      development of psoriasis. More recently, obesity in adulthood has been shown to be a risk&#xD;
      factor also for psoriatic arthritis. On the other hand, ones psoriasis has been established&#xD;
      it may favor behaviors facilitating overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate patients' opinion about their BW, the possibility of dietary approach to&#xD;
      psoriasis, a specific questionnaire was administered to 200 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In a second part of the study, a 24-week&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded clinical trial was performed on a limited number&#xD;
      of patient to see whether hypo-caloric diet to maintain disease remission in obese patients&#xD;
      previously treated with methotrexate. Patients were recruited from those consecutively&#xD;
      admitted to the psoriasis outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Verona. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were: patients ≥ 18 year of age with moderate to severe psoriasis and a&#xD;
      BMI ≥ 30 and without psoriasis arthritis, who were treated with methotrexate and had obtained&#xD;
      a reduction in psoriasis severity of at least 75% (PASI 75) for the 12 weeks before enrolling&#xD;
      into the study. Exclusion criteria were other types of psoriasis (guttate, erythrodermic and&#xD;
      pustular psoriasis) and severe obesity (BMI &gt;35). All patients gave their written informed&#xD;
      consent before any study-related procedures were performed. All subjects were visited by two&#xD;
      dermatologists who recorded demographic, biometrical, and other relevant patient's data.&#xD;
      Visits were scheduled at screening, baseline, and every 4 weeks up to 24. Collected data&#xD;
      included age, sex, weight, height, BMI, psoriasis duration and concomitant medications. The&#xD;
      dermatologist who performed the PASI scoring was unaware of the randomization assignment.&#xD;
      Patients stopped methotrexate therapy and were randomly assigned either of two groups: the&#xD;
      first group received a low-calorie diet administered by a dietitian (intervention group)&#xD;
      whereas the second group did not receive any dietetic recommendation (control group).&#xD;
      Randomization was performed with the use of computer-generated random numbers and block size&#xD;
      of 4 subjects. Patients underwent clinical and nutritional follow-up every month. The&#xD;
      low-calorie diet was designed to achieve a loss of 5-10% of initial body weight. The caloric&#xD;
      restriction was 500 kcal below the resting energy expenditure, as evaluated by the&#xD;
      Harris-Benedict equation. Intervention group patients received a balanced diet scheme, based&#xD;
      on a caloric intake reduction related to BMI and sex (range: 1200-1500 kcal/d for women,&#xD;
      1300-1600 kcal/d for men). Relapses were considered as loss of 50% of PASI improvement score&#xD;
      from baseline pre-methotrexate value.&#xD;
