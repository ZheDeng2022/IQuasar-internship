      RATIONALE: AT9283 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/IIa clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of AT9283&#xD;
      in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase IIb dose of multikinase&#xD;
           inhibitor AT9283 in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document evidence of efficacy of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in plasma in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess target kinase inhibition by multikinase inhibitor AT9283 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential predictive molecular biomarkers in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive multikinase inhibitor AT9283 IV continuously over 72 hours. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days* for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients achieving benefit of treatment may continue for up to 6 more courses at&#xD;
      the discretion of the chief/principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Course length may be extended to a maximum 42 days to allow for recovery of blood&#xD;
      counts. Intrathecal therapy is permitted from course 2 onwards in patients with ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies including&#xD;
      molecular predictive biomarkers and ex vivo and in vivo measurement of kinase inhibition&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 42 days or until recovery&#xD;
      of blood counts (whichever is the sooner).&#xD;
