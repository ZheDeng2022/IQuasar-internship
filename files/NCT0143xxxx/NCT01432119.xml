  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of selective internal radiation (SIR)-Spheres with yttrium-90 attached and&#xD;
      cetuximab. Some participants will also take erlotinib with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yttrium-90 microspheres are designed to treat cancer that has spread to the liver.&#xD;
      SIR-Spheres are designed to deliver the radiation directly to the liver. This radiation may&#xD;
      cause the tumor cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab and erlotinib are drugs that are designed to block the epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a protein that helps cancer cells grow. Blocking the EGFR may stop&#xD;
      tumors from growing.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide which&#xD;
      group you will be in based on your medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 attached and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 attached, cetuximab, and erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it is decided which combination you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      of cetuximab based on when you join the study. Up to 3 dose levels of cetuximab will be&#xD;
      tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable doses of the combinations are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive a dose level of the SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 attached&#xD;
      based on the results of the &quot;break-through&quot; scan (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Group 2, you will also receive erlotinib. If you are tolerating&#xD;
      erlotinib well after 1 cycle, you may begin receiving a higher dose of erlotinib in Cycle 3&#xD;
      and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Break-through Scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a &quot;break-through&quot; scan within 29 days before receiving the SIR-Spheres with&#xD;
      yttrium-90 microspheres. This scan will measure the supply of blood in your lungs and will&#xD;
      also be used to check your liver. For this test, a small amount of radioactive material will&#xD;
      be injected into your liver and images will be taken to see how the material moves through&#xD;
      your lungs and liver. The radioactive material will be given through a catheter in a vein in&#xD;
      your groin. A catheter is a sterile, flexible tube that will be placed through your groin&#xD;
      artery into the artery leading to your liver while you are under local anesthesia. Your&#xD;
      doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this test will be used to determine if you will receive a full or partial dose&#xD;
      of SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 microspheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 microspheres on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only.&#xD;
      Before you receive the SIR-Spheres with Yttrium-90 microspheres, you will receive sedative&#xD;
      drugs by vein to put you to sleep. SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 microspheres will then be&#xD;
      given to you through a catheter in a vein in your groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are given the yttrium-90 microspheres, the catheter will be removed and pressure&#xD;
      will be applied to your groin to stop any bleeding. You will then be monitored for 6 hours to&#xD;
      check for any side effects. If needed, you will be given pain medication after the infusion.&#xD;
      Your study doctor will decide which pain medications to give you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab will be given by vein 1 time each week during Weeks 2-4 of Cycle 1, and then 1 time&#xD;
      every week for Cycles 2 and beyond. The first time you receive cetuximab, it will be given&#xD;
      over 2 hours. Every time you receive cetuximab after that, it will be given over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to receive erlotinib, you will take it by mouth 1 time each day starting&#xD;
      on Day 1 of Cycle 2. You should take it at the same time each day . You should take it on an&#xD;
      empty stomach either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. The study staff will give you&#xD;
      more instructions for taking erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before you receive the SIR-Spheres with yttrium-90 microspheres, your blood vessels will&#xD;
           be checked. For this test, you will receive an x-ray dye through the catheter that will&#xD;
           help the study staff look at the arteries leading to your liver and surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam and your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Weeks 2 and 4 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam and your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 4 weeks starting at the beginning of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam and your medical history will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will&#xD;
           include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You receive the study drugs for as long as you are benefitting. You will no longer be able to&#xD;
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you&#xD;
      are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. SIR-Spheres are FDA-approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat metastatic colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. Yttrium-90 microspheres are&#xD;
      FDA-approved for hepatic arterial therapy and the treatment of liver metastases. Cetuximab is&#xD;
      FDA-approved and commercially available to treat head and neck and colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Erlotinib is FDA-approved and commercially available to treat non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. The use of this combination to treat advanced cancer is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 136 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
