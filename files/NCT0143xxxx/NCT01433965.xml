      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lenalidomide can stop the growth of&#xD;
      leukemia stem cells and can be used to prevent the return of leukemia cells after a&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is determine whether lenalidomide can directly inhibit leukemic&#xD;
      stem cells in vivo and can be used to prevent the relapse of leukemia stem cells after&#xD;
      transplant. A concern with any post transplant intervention is the possibility of multiple&#xD;
      drug interactions, potential for graft versus host disease exacerbation and/or induction of&#xD;
      cytopenia. Therefore, the smallest doses of lenalidomide (5 mg) that has been used in this&#xD;
      setting will be utilized as dose level 1. Starting six months post-transplant, patients will&#xD;
      begin on a daily dose of lenalidomide. Dependent on the cohort, patients will receive 5 to 20&#xD;
      mg of lenalidomide post transplant. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by&#xD;
      the incidence of grade III-IV toxicities of all organs and grade II-IV GVHD. Duration of&#xD;
      treatment is six months.&#xD;
