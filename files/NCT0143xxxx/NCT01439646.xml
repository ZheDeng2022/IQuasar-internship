      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effect of Empirical Antifungal therapy on clinical outcome in high risk&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To know the current epidemiology of IFI and management approach in patients at high&#xD;
                risk of Invasive fungal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identify the risk factors associated with Invasive fungal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To comment on the appropriateness of empirical therapy used based on&#xD;
                proven/probable diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
                Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                All Non-neutropenic patients admitted in the intensive care/critical care unit who&#xD;
                are prescribed any form of pre-emptive / empirical Antifungal therapy during the&#xD;
                specified study duration period&#xD;
&#xD;
                Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Neutropenic patients Patients with proven invasive fungal infections where&#xD;
                antifungal therapy was initiated after the confirmation of Invasive fungal&#xD;
                infection/Candidemia Patients who received prophylactic antifungal agents&#xD;
&#xD;
                Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi Center (Dual-center - Fortis Hospital and Apollo Hospital) Retrospective,&#xD;
           Observational Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Patients: 100 in number&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective data will be collected for all patients admitted in intensive care&#xD;
      unit/Critical care unit (under the study investigators) who received any form of Empirical /&#xD;
      Preemptive (not prophylactic) Antifungal therapy (of any duration, irrespective of culture&#xD;
      positivity) as a suspected case of Invasive Fungal Infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following details of patients will be captured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics, primary and secondary diagnosis, co-morbidities, grade of infection, severity&#xD;
      of sepsis and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily hemodynamic parameters, routine blood tests including Total count and hematologic&#xD;
      profile, renal profile, Liver function tests, electrolyte status, additional tests whatever&#xD;
      was done as a course of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fungal C/S reports and any other sample culture reports&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment, Changes in therapy, Adjuvant therapy - for relevant cases, Any&#xD;
      Surgical procedures undertaken: e.g., surgical debridement, fasciotomy and dressing (as a&#xD;
      part of the standard treatment according to available guidelines) - for relevant cases, Any&#xD;
      additional invasive procedure (eg: Mechanical ventilation ), Reported adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of Risk factors for invasive fungal infections as detailed but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diabetes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of immunosuppressants (Eg. steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chronic Hemodialysis , TPN, Mechanical ventilation ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sepsis/Septic shock, Multiorgan dysfunction (more than one organ),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Non response to &gt; 4 days of broad spectrum antibiotics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Structural lung disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Major abdominal surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Multifocal colonization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A period of one year starting backwards from December 2010 till January 2010.( max. 100&#xD;
      patients retrospectively tracking back from Dec 2010 whichever comes first ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical tools such as &quot;Multiple logistic regressions&quot; model will be used to&#xD;
      analyze linkages between different parameters recorded in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality both Short term (while on antifungal therapy) and Long term (within 12 weeks&#xD;
           of completion of antifungal therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean Duration of ICU (Intensive Care Unit) / HDU (High Dependency Unit stay after&#xD;
           initiation of Antifungal Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common pathogens associated with Invasive Fungal Infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common empirical antifungal agents used in suspected Invasive Fungal Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean time for initiation of Antifungal therapy after suspicion of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean duration of antifungal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors in patients with proven/probable invasive fungal infections&#xD;
