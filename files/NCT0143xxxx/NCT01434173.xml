    <textblock>
      Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent used to treat common community-acquired&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and pelvic inflammatory&#xD;
      disease. In the clinical development program, moxifloxacin was associated with some hepatic&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions. To evaluate further the hepatic safety profile of moxifloxacin, a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study with nested case-control analysis will be conducted to assess the&#xD;
      rate of noninfectious acute liver injury among new users of moxifloxacin and of other&#xD;
      antimicrobials prescribed for similar indications, including amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus&#xD;
      clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, clarithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, and telithromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented in the population included in the HealthCore Integrated&#xD;
      Research Database (HIRD). Eligible patients are adults aged 18 years and older with&#xD;
      continuous enrollment in the HIRD for at least 6 months before their first claim for a&#xD;
      prescription for a study antimicrobial. Follow-up will start at the date of the first&#xD;
      prescription until the date of the earliest of the following events: noninfectious acute&#xD;
      liver injury, occurrence of an exclusion criterion, end of study period, disenrollment from&#xD;
      database, or death. Patients with chronic alcoholism or cirrhosis, infectious hepatitis,&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, or pregnant women will not be included.&#xD;
