      This study aim to test the hypothesis that human S.suis infections are associated in time and&#xD;
      space with outbreaks of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) virus or other&#xD;
      diseases in pigs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic agent which can cause severe systemic infection in humans&#xD;
      exposed to infected pigs or pig derived products. Over 700 cases have been reported&#xD;
      worldwide, most of them were in China and Vietnam in the last few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Vietnam, S. suis infection in adults is common, and patients with S.suis are often&#xD;
      admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD), a tertiary referral hospital&#xD;
      for infectious diseases in northern Vietnam. In 2007, 50 laboratory confirmed cases with&#xD;
      S.suis were reported at this hospital, and in 2010, 65 laboratory confirmed S.suis cases have&#xD;
      been identified by September. Pig breeding and pork consumption is popular in Vietnam, with&#xD;
      the majority of pigs and meat supply channelled from small-scaled un-controlled farmers and&#xD;
      slaughterhouses, which pose a great potential health risk to people involved in the chain. A&#xD;
      case-control study conducted in southern Vietnam showed that occupational exposure, raising&#xD;
      pigs at home and consuming high-risk dishes from pigs significantly increased the risk of S.&#xD;
      suis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that the incidence of human S. suis cases is possibly linked to the&#xD;
      occurrence of Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive System (PRRS) virus outbreaks in northern&#xD;
      Vietnam. In 2010, the disease has spread to over 30 provinces over the country, with many&#xD;
      outbreaks reported in northern provinces in the period from April to July. Field observations&#xD;
      in other countries showed that PRRS virus infection increased pig's susceptibility to S. suis&#xD;
      infection, including serotype 2 and 7. Therefore, PRRS virus outbreaks might have increased&#xD;
      the risk of S. suis transmission to humans through exposure to pigs with PRRS virus infection&#xD;
      and concomitant S. suis disease. Nevertheless, sufficient data are not available to confirm&#xD;
      or refute this hypothesis. Knowledge of spatial and temporal relationships between human&#xD;
      S.suis infections and disease outbreaks in pigs can increase our understanding of risk&#xD;
      factors for human S.suis infection and support disease prevention and preparedness in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;

        Population under study is the population from which cases of S.suis infection admitted to&#xD;
        NHTD arise. Sepsis patients are selected to present the population of interest under the&#xD;
        following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they are representative of the background exposure rate of the population from which&#xD;
             cases come from,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  their diagnosis is independent of the exposure of interest,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they are similar to the S.suis cases in terms of care seeking and referral patterns.&#xD;
