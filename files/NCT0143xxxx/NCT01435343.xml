      Second-line induction therapy with fludarabine, idarubicin, cytarabine,Granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor, in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) aged 65 or younger.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol corresponds to a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I-II study&#xD;
      designed to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of plerixafor with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in young patients with relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial is divided into pre-treatment and treatment periods (induction and&#xD;
      consolidation cycle(s) and consists of two general phases: an initial Phase I in which&#xD;
      escalating doses of plerixafor will be given to 4 groups, each with 3 patients; and a&#xD;
      secondary Phase II in which an additional patient group will be treated with the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) from Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-treatment period, all patients who provide written informed consent will be&#xD;
      screened and any patients who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who are finally included in the study should begin treatment within 7 days after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent document (ICD). The pre-treatment period begins when the ICD is&#xD;
      signed and enrollment occurs when the patient receives the first study drug of the treatment&#xD;
      regimen (i.e., Day 1 of the induction cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the induction cycle will consist of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day intravenously on&#xD;
      days 1 to 4, idarubicin 10 mg/m2/day intravenously on days 1 to 3, cytarabine 2 g/m2/day&#xD;
      intravenously on days 1 to 4, G-CSF 5 μg/kg/day subcutaneously from days 1 to 4, and&#xD;
      plerixafor intravenously from days 1 to 4. The dose of plerixafor will be escalated over 4&#xD;
      groups of three patients as follows: 240 μg/kg/day (120 μg/kg/12 h); 320 μg/kg/day (160&#xD;
      μg/kg/12 h); 400 μg/kg/day (200 μg/kg/12 h); and 480 μg/kg/day (240 μg/kg/12 h). If MTD is&#xD;
      observed with the first treatment dose of plerixafor the dose will be progressively&#xD;
      deescalated to 160 μg/kg/day (80μg/kg/12 h) on a first deescalating level or 240 μg/kg/day in&#xD;
      a single daily dose on a second deescalating level if no twice a day (BID) dose is tolerated.&#xD;
      Patient enrollment will be expanded to a total of 55 patients using MTD. If patients do not&#xD;
      achieve CR after one induction cycle they will leave the study and be followed according to&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) who are eligible for&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and have a donor will leave the&#xD;
      trial and receive allogeneic HSCT and will be followed according to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. Patients who achieve CR and are not eligible for allogeneic HSCT or do not have a&#xD;
      donor will receive two consolidations with cytarabine at 3 g/m2/12 hours on days 1, 3 and 5&#xD;
      along with Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) at 5 μg/kg/day on days 1 to 5 and&#xD;
      plerixafor at the same dose used in the induction cycle on days 1, 3 and 5, coinciding with&#xD;
      the days that cytarabine is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this protocol, a treatment cycle is defined as the first day of the study&#xD;
      drug administration regimens (Day 1) up to and including the day before the first day of the&#xD;
      treatment cycle immediately afterwards. The treatment cycles will begin after Day 28 but no&#xD;
      later than Day 85, counting from Day 1 of the treatment cycle immediately before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed in the three days before each cycle (see Appendix A). Follow-up,&#xD;
      outside the protocol in routine clinical practice, will be performed monthly during the first&#xD;
      year and at least every three months during the second year; notwithstanding, visits may be&#xD;
      more frequent at the discretion of each site or based on the clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment cycles will be administered while the patient is hospitalized. Clinical&#xD;
      procedures for the care of patients with acute leukemia require flexibility. However,&#xD;
      deviations from the study treatment defined in this section must be prospectively discussed&#xD;
      with the coordinator.&#xD;
