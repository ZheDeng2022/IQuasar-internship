  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a designed viral vector that can destroy cancer cells while leaving normal cells&#xD;
      largely unharmed. The virus also stimulates an immunological response by producing a special&#xD;
      factor (GM-CSF) to attract and promote the development of dendritic and T effector cells. It&#xD;
      forms the hypothesis that this regimen may be used for people who have failed current forms&#xD;
      of treatment and are recommended for cystectomy. It is with hope that this novel therapy will&#xD;
      be able to delay or potentially avoid cystectomy for this patient population. Bladder&#xD;
      instillation of this agent causes little long lasting side effects and may drastically&#xD;
      improve the stimulation of the immune system for local cancer cell death as well as&#xD;
      destroying those tumor cells that may have travelled to regional lymph nodes or distant&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the phase I/II CG0070 trial review, it became apparent that the use of CG0070 oncolytic&#xD;
      vaccine as an intravesical agent for oncolytic lysis of tumor cells, together with the&#xD;
      transcription of GM-CSF on site, may have distinct advantages. This first study showed&#xD;
      excellent tumor response rates of 48-77% depending on the dose schedule administered. All of&#xD;
      these patients had residual non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who have previously failed BCG&#xD;
      therapy at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the addition of a transduction agent such as DDM, the intravesical instillation of&#xD;
      CG0070 enabled uniform distribution of viral particles and exposure to the tumor during those&#xD;
      30-60 minutes instillations as contrast to the intra-tumor injection, intra-arterial or&#xD;
      intravenous injection of viral particles in other oncolytic viral trials. Some or most of&#xD;
      these delivering methodologies have obvious intrinsic imperfections and potential toxicity.&#xD;
      This unique opportunity of an relatively easy intravesical tumor exposure is difficult to&#xD;
      duplicate in other solid tumor models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The replication of CG0070 in the majority of patients during the first phase I/II trial&#xD;
      indicated tumor lysis with release of tumor specific or tumor associated antigens that have&#xD;
      been stably expressed, in abundant quantities during tumor cell death. Release of tumor&#xD;
      antigens have been the key elements, together with sufficient on-site GM-CSF, in stimulating&#xD;
      strong cross-presentation and confirmation signals to the antigen presenting cells such as&#xD;
      dendritic cells interacting with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This concept of a &quot;real time&quot; vaccine&#xD;
      like regimen is expected to compare favorably with other forms of cancer immunotherapy&#xD;
      treatment such as BCG in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is with this thought that CG0070 may find a success in this setting because of a&#xD;
      reasonably and proven complete response rate in residual and failed BCG bladder cancer&#xD;
      patients in the first phase I/II study (some cases with only one instillation). Of importance&#xD;
      as well, is the demonstration in the study data of a strong GM-CSF expression during its&#xD;
      replication phase. Those patients with carcinoma in situ disease and those with RB pathway&#xD;
      dysfunction were particularly responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore, desirable to formulate a protocol to encompass the specialty of this&#xD;
      oncolytic vaccine and the unique intravesical delivery to prove the efficacy by a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study. This opportunity allows a study on the CG0070's beneficial effects, if any,&#xD;
      on the standard of care for carcinoma in situ non muscle invasive bladder cancer patients&#xD;
      after they failed BCG therapy. The prognosis of this group presently depends mainly on early&#xD;
      radical cystectomy, which carries a high morbidity and decrease of quality of life generally&#xD;
      viewed as unacceptable for this group of older patients.&#xD;

             systemic steroid (exception: inhaled or topically applied steroids, and acute and&#xD;
             chronic standard dose NSAIDs, are permitted). Use of a short course (i.e., ≤ 1 day) of&#xD;

             the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Concomitant active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             autoimmune thyroid disease, uveitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Progressive viral or bacterial infection&#xD;

             administration of study vaccine hazardous to the patient, would obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events, or not permit adequate surgical resection.&#xD;
