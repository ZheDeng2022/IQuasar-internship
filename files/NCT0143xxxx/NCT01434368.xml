  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the clear importance of adolescence in the emergence of a number of disease states&#xD;
      and processes, there is surprisingly little known about how the endocrine and metabolic&#xD;
      events accompanying puberty in humans impact normal developmental neurobiology. Epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies have identified sexual dimorphisms in the prevalence of several neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and substance abuse. Many of these sex&#xD;
      differences emerge during or shortly after puberty and are maintained until the 5th-6th&#xD;
      decade of life. For example, the two-fold greater risk of unipolar depression in women&#xD;
      compared with men does not appear until adolescence, and prior to puberty girls are not at&#xD;
      increased risk relative to boys. Puberty is a structured, transitional process that can be&#xD;
      influenced by both nutritional factors and environmental stressors; nonetheless, the&#xD;
      variability in the timing and duration of puberty is largely determined by oligogenic&#xD;
      inheritance. Basic neuroscience research has demonstrated that hormonal events accompanying&#xD;
      puberty impact on many of the physiologic systems involved in the regulation of brain&#xD;
      function (e.g., the appearance of new neurons in a brain-region specific pattern, neuronal&#xD;
      remodeling, and the pruning of cortical connectivity). Additionally, not only does stress&#xD;
      during puberty increase the risk of disturbances in affective adaptation during adulthood,&#xD;
      but the events accompanying puberty modify stress responsivity (e.g., alterations in the&#xD;
      duration and peak response of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis hormones to&#xD;
      stressors). Moreover, animal work has demonstrated that neural connectivity differs in a&#xD;
      brain regional specific manner according to the stage of puberty (i.e., early versus late).&#xD;
      In humans, puberty also occurs in stages, and although the endocrinology of puberty,&#xD;
      surprisingly, has not been fully characterized with longitudinal data, studies have&#xD;
      documented that the physical changes measured by Tanner stages I to V are accompanied by&#xD;
      progressive increases in the secretions of both gonadal and adrenal steroids. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      there remains considerable variability in the timing and duration of this otherwise highly&#xD;
      structured reproductive transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to perform a longitudinal, naturalistic study examining changes in brain structure&#xD;
      and function, behavior, and stress responsivity in boys and girls across the pubertal&#xD;
      transition. Because the pubertal transition is defined by a complex series of physiologic&#xD;
      events that emerge sequentially over several years and involve changes in multiple endocrine&#xD;
      and growth systems, and because there is also considerable variability in the timing of these&#xD;
      events reflecting the influence of both genetic and environmental factors, puberty cannot by&#xD;
      delineated by age of the participants as has been done in most imaging and other&#xD;
      neurobiological studies of adolescence. The present study will formally bridge this gap by&#xD;
      defining pubertal events per se in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include healthy boys and girls whose pubertal status will be assessed, and&#xD;
      in whom endocrine, metabolic, and brain imaging measures will be evaluated at eight - ten&#xD;
      month intervals from age eight years (pre-puberty) until age 17 years (post-puberty).&#xD;
      Reproductive endocrine, metabolic, and physical measures will be employed to characterize the&#xD;
      stage and duration of pubertal development. Outcome measures will be derived via multimodal&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, metabolic measurements, and&#xD;
      evaluations of HPA axis function. Additionally, the impact of genetic variation on the&#xD;
      developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-institute proposal will employ a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the&#xD;
      effects on CNS function of the process of puberty in both boys and girls. This work will not&#xD;
      only serve to inform research on the mechanisms by which sexual dimorphisms in&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders develop, it will also have important implications for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of these disorders.&#xD;
