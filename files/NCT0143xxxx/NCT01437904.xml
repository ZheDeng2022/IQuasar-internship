      Outpatient tubeless Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) could potentially improve patient&#xD;
      care and result in significant cost savings for our hospital each year. If this pilot study&#xD;
      is successful, Queen's/KGH will lead a collaborative national multicentre trial to further&#xD;
      establish the role of this new approach in the surgical treatment of kidney stones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in eight human beings will develop kidney stones during their lifetime. Percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the standard minimally invasive surgical operation for the removal&#xD;
      of large kidney stones. Around the world, patients are routinely admitted to hospital&#xD;
      following PCNL. The reasons that outpatient PCNL has not been otherwise attempted are related&#xD;
      to the risk of bleeding and the need for an indwelling kidney drainage tube. Other than a&#xD;
      single publication from the mid-1980's, there have been no other publications regarding&#xD;
      outpatient PCNL up until this year, both from our group at Queen's University. We challenge&#xD;
      the need for hospitalization following PCNL provided that proper technique for percutaneous&#xD;
      renal access is used and patients are very carefully selected. In fact, we have safely&#xD;
      performed outpatient tubeless PCNL on over 5 patients to date and we have two related&#xD;
      published abstracts that were presented in 2008 at international Urology conferences in&#xD;
      Albuquerque, New Mexico and Shanghai, China. Our manuscript titled &quot;Totally tubeless&#xD;
      outpatient percutaneous nephrolithotomy: initial case report&quot; has been published in Advances&#xD;
      in Urology in 2009. Additionally, a second manuscript of ours titled &quot;Outpatient tubeless&#xD;
      PCNL: the initial case series&quot; is currently in press in the Canadian Urological Association&#xD;
      Journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient PCNL offers patients several potential benefits, including decreased pain due to&#xD;
      lack of nephrostomy tube, earlier and faster convalescence and lower rate of hospital&#xD;
      acquired infections and complications. Furthermore, outpatient PCNL may offer several&#xD;
      potential cost savings to the hospital and health care system, including the daily cost of an&#xD;
      inpatient hospital bed, the imaging and procedural costs of antegrade nephrostogram,&#xD;
      including the interventional radiologist's fee, the cost of nursing staff and the cost of&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics and other medications required by the hospitalized patient.&#xD;
      Conversely, outpatient PCNL could potentially result in additional costs if emergency visits,&#xD;
      readmissions and further interventions occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Synopsis This project is a pilot study that examines the safety, efficacy,&#xD;
      feasibility and potential cost savings of performing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis. If shown to be feasible, outpatient PCNL could result in significant&#xD;
      potential cost savings to the hospital and health care system, as normal care following PCNL&#xD;
      involves a 1-3 day hospital stay. The main objective of this pilot study is to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data necessary to develop a definitive national multicentre prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing outpatient PCNL to standard PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Patients can be successfully randomized to outpatient versus standard PCNL and&#xD;
      that outpatient PCNL will be a successful procedure.&#xD;
