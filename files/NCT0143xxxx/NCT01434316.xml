    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib and dinaciclib in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Veliparib and dinaciclib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of veliparib (ABT-888) and dinaciclib (SCH727965)&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for ABT-888 in combination with&#xD;
      SCH727965, determined by evaluating the feasibility, safety, dose-limiting toxicities, and&#xD;
      the maximally tolerated dose(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To confirm the safety of the combination of ABT-888 and SCH727965 in patients with known&#xD;
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888 both alone and in combination&#xD;
      with SCH727965.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of ABT-888 in combination with SCH727965, both in&#xD;
      surrogate tissues and in tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of the ABT-888/SCH727965 combinations in&#xD;
      subjects with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib and dinaciclib followed by expanded&#xD;
      doublet cohort studies of non-breast BRCA-proficient patients and BRCA-proficient triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, a safety doublet cohort for BRCA-deficient patients,&#xD;
      and cohorts of BRCA-associated TNBC (PARP inhibitor-naive and PARP inhibitor-resistant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1A: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and dinaciclib&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 8 and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1B: Patients receive veliparib and dinaciclib as patients in Part 1A. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1C: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7 of cycle 0. Patients then receive&#xD;
      veliparib PO BID on days 1-21 and dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 or days&#xD;
      1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients in the dose escalation phases of the trial must agree to biopsies of&#xD;
             normal skin, unless they undergo optional tumor biopsies; the mandatory biopsy&#xD;
             requirement can be waived at the discretion of principal investigator in the event of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must agree to provide an archival tissue block or paraffin sample from&#xD;
             archival tissue block (approximately 10 sections) for use in pharmacodynamic&#xD;
             correlative studies; however, patients are not considered ineligible if archival tumor&#xD;
             is not available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;&#xD;
             subjects must be willing to adhere to dose and visit schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic,&#xD;
             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for&#xD;
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an&#xD;
             anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); in addition, men&#xD;
             receiving treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of&#xD;
             testosterone by continuation of luteinizing-releasing hormone agonists; palliative&#xD;
             radiation therapy (XRT) can be administered on study after documented discussion with&#xD;
             the principal investigator; for patients in expansion cohorts, this must not involve&#xD;
             target lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded; patients with a history of&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) metastases that have been treated must be stable with no&#xD;
             symptoms for &gt; 3 months after completion of that treatment and off steroid treatment,&#xD;
             with image documentation required prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte&#xD;
             counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received SCH727965&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other medical conditions judged by the investigator to be clinically&#xD;
             relevant in the setting of this study, which may include active infectious processes,&#xD;
             intractable emesis, or chronic diarrheal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ABT-888 and SCH727965 are&#xD;
             anti-proliferative agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with ABT-888 and SCH727965, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with ABT-888 and SCH727965; these potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior seizure history who have experienced a seizure within the three&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment are excluded&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects on a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or CPY3A4 inducer who cannot be changed to&#xD;
             another medication are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (t-AML)/myelodysplastic&#xD;
             syndrome (MDS) or with features suggestive of AML/MDS&#xD;
