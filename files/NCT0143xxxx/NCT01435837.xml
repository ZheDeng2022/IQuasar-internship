      The purpose of the study, Effects of Interaction of Caffeine and Hydration on Voice&#xD;
      Performance, is to gather information about the effects of caffeine and hydration upon voice&#xD;
      performance. The research question involves whether systemic hydration may reduce degradation&#xD;
      on voice performance caused by caffeine ingestion. It is hypothesized that the hydration&#xD;
      conditions will result in a less degraded vocal performance as compared with the nonhydration&#xD;
      condition.The investigation involves abstention from any caffeine ingestion for 24 hours -&#xD;
      from 8pm the day before testing to 8am the morning of testing. In addition, preparation for&#xD;
      participation involves abstaining from ingesting any foods and liquids for 12 hours - from&#xD;
      8pm to 8am of the following morning. Each test will take about 10 minutes.&#xD;

      The objective of this investigation is to explore the interaction of water and caffeine on&#xD;
      voice performance through (a) acoustic measures of voice, and (b) aerodynamic measurements&#xD;
      (minimum lung pressure required to initiate phonation. The acoustic and aerodynamic&#xD;
      measurements were selected for this study in an effort to demonstrate the effects of four&#xD;
      levels of hydration and caffeine status on voice quality: 1) caffeine and water1 (i.e..,&#xD;
      Experimental Group 1 - ingestion of 200 mg of caffeine in conjunction with 500 ml of water),&#xD;
      2) caffeine and water2 (i.e., Experimental Group 2 - ingestion of 200 mg of caffeine in&#xD;
      conjunction with 1.0 liter of water), 3)caffeine only (i.e., Experimental Group 3: ingestion&#xD;
      of 200 mg of caffeine and no water), and 4) control (i.e. no ingestion of caffeine or water).&#xD;
      The research question involves whether systemic hydration may reduce degradation on voice&#xD;
      performance caused by caffeine ingestion. It is hypothesized that the hydration conditions&#xD;
      will result in a less degraded vocal performance as compared with the nonhydration condition.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that ingestion of 1.0 liter of water will have a greater&#xD;
      effect on voice performance than ingestion of 500 ml of water. An additional objective of&#xD;
      this study is to increase scientific knowledge of voice functioning by providing further data&#xD;
      about the effect of the interaction of water and caffeine on voice performance. The results&#xD;
      of this project may be a valuable addition to the scientific literature in vocology, and may&#xD;
      also contribute to prevention plans for minimizing vocal disturbances. Therefore, vocational&#xD;
      programs may include vocal prevention directions based on this study. In addition, knowledge&#xD;
      about prevention of voice disorders may be included in the academic curriculum of students&#xD;
      enrolled in training programs for professions involving substantial voice use.&#xD;
