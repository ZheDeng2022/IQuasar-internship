  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify that an infusion of hypertonic saline/colloids during&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary-bypass will reduce fluid overload and organ edema for cardiac patients with&#xD;
      expected long-CPB-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected beneficial effects are improved organ function for heart and lungs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid overloading with oedema formation is a regular finding following on-pump cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and may contribute to postoperative organ dysfunction. Myocardial oedema has been&#xD;
      reported to impair both systolic and diastolic function. An association between&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid loading and postoperative adverse outcome has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      cardiac patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has experience with the use of hypertonic saline/colloids in several experimental&#xD;
      studies (pigs). In these animal studies we have used hypertonic saline/colloids both as an&#xD;
      infusion during CPB or as an additive to CPB-prime. Both administration methods resulted in&#xD;
      significant reduction in fluid loading due to better intravascular volume preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One clinical study from our group observed reduced fluid load and an improved cardiac index&#xD;
      when an infusion of hypertonic saline/colloids was used during cardiac surgery. Patients&#xD;
      included in this study had a normal left ventricular function and no co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study includes patients with combination procedures, both aorta coronary bypass&#xD;
      and valve implantation, and expected long CPB-time.Time spent on CPB is a individual risk&#xD;
      factor negatively associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The investigators&#xD;
      believe high-risk patients will have even more benefit of reduced fluid loading. Their&#xD;
      tolerance for hypovolemia is lower and the incidence for hemodynamic instability first hours&#xD;
      postoperatively is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to receive either a continuous infusion of hypertonic&#xD;
      saline/colloids or acetated Ringer's solution during CPB. Accurate accounts of fluid&#xD;
      additions, blood loss and diuresis will be kept. Determination of cardiac output (C.O.),&#xD;
      intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), extravascular lung water (EVLW) and global end diastolic&#xD;
      volume (GEDV) will be monitored by use of the transpulmonary thermodilution technique&#xD;
      PiCCO速plus system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative and postoperative echo cor will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>As a target for effect the investigators have chosen to study improvements for organ function. Indexed values for cardiac output (CI) measured by the PICCO system will be a parameter for heart function, and lung function will be measured by EVLWI (extravascular lung water index), paO2/FiO2 -ratio and time spent in respirator. Additionally a strict account for fluid balance will be kept.</description>
