      Effect of enteral nutrition in the outcome of patients has the objective to determine the&#xD;
      effect of implementing a nutritional support protocol on the outcome of cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery patients, the main justification of the study its the prevalence of malnutrition over&#xD;
      the hospitalized patients and the way this complication influence the treatment efficacy, the&#xD;
      risk of complications over these patients, the costs, the prognosis, mortality and hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a control clinical trial, randomized and double blind.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition is a complication that occurs frequently in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      and influencing treatment efficacy, risks of complications, costs, prognosis, mortality and&#xD;
      hospital stay. Cardiac Cachexia is a complication that is characterized by weight loss and&#xD;
      suggests different mechanisms to explain it: poor diet, intestinal malabsorption, impaired&#xD;
      metabolism, loss of nutrients through the digestive tract or urinary tract, increased protein&#xD;
      loss and decreased anabolism, increased basal metabolic rate. It is reported a reduction in&#xD;
      mortality in cardiac patients with higher body mass index (BMI), this potential protective&#xD;
      effect is known as the obesity paradox. In a clinical study to determine whether BMI&#xD;
      influences the risk of mortality in acute decompensated heart failure, the authors compared&#xD;
      the BMI of 108 927 hospitalized patients and noted that hospital mortality was decreased as&#xD;
      BMI increased, decreasing the risk of death 10% for every 5 unit increase in BMI of patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, the enteral nutrition within the first 48hr after surgery, helps maintain the&#xD;
      integrity of the intestinal mucosa and reduces the secretion of catabolic hormones. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis shows that 85% of high-risk surgical patients tolerate enteral nutrition in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period. As a nutritional support in critically ill patients, enteral&#xD;
      keeps physiological mechanisms, a lower incidence of complications and low cost. Nutritional&#xD;
      support in critically ill patients has three objectives: to conserve body mass, modulate&#xD;
      immune function and metabolic response to moderate stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: To determine the effect of implementing a nutritional support&#xD;
      protocol on the outcome of cardiovascular surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: The investigators performed a controlled clinical trial in adult patients, both&#xD;
      genders admitted to the coronary intensive care UMAE. IMSS No.1, having undergone cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with or without pump. There will be a nutritional screening and patients with&#xD;
      malnutrition are included at random to group A (which will immunomodulatory individualized&#xD;
      diet) or group B (conventional nutritional treatment). The protocol will be given nutritional&#xD;
      support enterally during their hospital stay. The progress of nutritional status will be&#xD;
      measured by weight, BMI, albumin, transferrin, total count of lymphocytes and total proteins&#xD;
      in addition to the hospital stay, complications and mortality. A comparison of the effect of&#xD;
      individualized nutritional support with a standard control group will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: The results will be emptied in a database in Excel. The investigators will use&#xD;
      statistical packages: NCSS 2007 (01/07/1919) and SPSS (15.0). Qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      expressed as percentages, quantitative variables as mean and standard deviation if the&#xD;
      distribution is normal. The results will be analyzed according to intention to treat.&#xD;
      Comparison of nutritional status by various quantitative indicators will be made by paired t&#xD;
      test or Mann Whitney according to their distribution. Categorical variables were expressed as&#xD;
      proportions and compared using Chi Square test. All tests will be considered significant p&#xD;
      values less than 5%.&#xD;
