      Colonoscopy is an established technology that enables doctors to obtain live video from&#xD;
      inside patients' large intestines, which is essential for the diagnosis of numerous&#xD;
      intestinal illnesses. It consists of a long, flexible tube fitted with a light-source and&#xD;
      small video camera that transmits the images onto a display monitor. The doctor inserts the&#xD;
      scope into the anus, moves it into the rectum and then guides it slowly through the entire&#xD;
      colon. Because of the various twists and turns that are part of normal bowel anatomy,&#xD;
      advancing the scope through the entire colon is not always successful and can become&#xD;
      challenging when the scope forms loops inside the abdomen. Unfortunately, there is no way for&#xD;
      the doctor to see the shape of the scope inside the body other than what is seen from the&#xD;
      video at its front end, and so navigating the colon relies on instinct accumulated with&#xD;
      experience and the &quot;feel&quot; of the scope as loops begin to form. This is important because not&#xD;
      only can this loop formation cause pain, but it can also increase the likelihood of an&#xD;
      incomplete test. Incomplete tests matter because a major reason for performing colonoscopy is&#xD;
      colon cancer screening and surveillance; detecting early cancers at treatable stages and&#xD;
      looking for polyps that may be pre-cancerous growths. When colonoscopy does not advance&#xD;
      through the entire colon, parts are left unexamined where cancer may develop. A new&#xD;
      technology called &quot;ScopeGuide&quot; has been developed that uses magnetic coils embedded within&#xD;
      the scope to create a 3D image of the shape of the entire scope inside the body that is&#xD;
      projected onto the monitor for the doctor to see. This will show if loops are forming and&#xD;
      will provide information about how to eliminate loops once they have formed. In this research&#xD;
      study, the investigators will compare colonoscopy with the assistance of ScopeGuide to&#xD;
      colonoscopy performed in the standard fashion, to see if ScopeGuide results in more&#xD;
      successful procedures that are easier for the doctor and more comfortable for patients.&#xD;

      Summary of Research Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon and rectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      Canada. Colonoscopy is the preferred screening modality for CRC and has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease the likelihood of developing CRC as well as CRC-related mortality, particularly&#xD;
      through the detection and removal of potentially pre-cancerous polyps, with the aim of&#xD;
      preventing colon cancer, and for the diagnosis of early stage CRC that is more likely to be&#xD;
      treatable and result in long-term survival. However, recent evidence suggests that&#xD;
      colonoscopy has not been as universally protective against CRC as had been previously hoped,&#xD;
      particularly for proximal cancers located in the right colon. Theories as to why this might&#xD;
      be the case include speculation about altered biology of cancers that develop in the proximal&#xD;
      colon and technical issues relating to the performance of colonoscopy itself. In particular,&#xD;
      one of the problems is incomplete colonoscopy that fails to examine the entire colon to the&#xD;
      cecum, which may occur in 10-20% of cases. Furthermore, from a public health standpoint, a&#xD;
      considerable proportion of the population remain averse to undergoing colonoscopy,&#xD;
      particularly because of fears of procedure discomfort, decreasing the potential impact for&#xD;
      overall CRC reduction. Thus, optimizing the technical performance of colonoscopy and&#xD;
      improving its acceptance among patients is important for maximizing the possible benefits to&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common reasons for incomplete colonoscopy is excessive internal looping of&#xD;
      the endoscope. This looping has also been shown to be the major cause of patient discomfort&#xD;
      during the procedure. Experts agree that colonoscopy is most successful at reaching the cecum&#xD;
      and most comfortable for patients when the endoscope is kept in a straight position by&#xD;
      minimizing loop formation and reducing loops once they have formed. Thus, identification and&#xD;
      reduction of endoscope loops is critically important for the successful and comfortable&#xD;
      completion of colonoscopy. Over the years, several techniques have emerged to overcome loop&#xD;
      formation, including withdrawal of the endoscope with torque, abdominal wall pressure and&#xD;
      patient position changes, yet these are all done in a &quot;trial and error&quot; fashion. Despite this&#xD;
      limitation, these maneuvers form the cornerstones of current colonoscopy technique.&#xD;
      Technological innovations such as smaller caliber &quot;pediatric&quot; colonoscopes and &quot;variable&#xD;
      stiffness&quot; colonoscopes with adjustable rigidity have been introduced that have had moderate&#xD;
      success in diminishing patient discomfort and increasing rates of colonoscopy completion. Yet&#xD;
      despite these efforts to improve colonoscopy practice, the reality is that many procedures&#xD;
      are still done poorly. An audit of all colonoscopies performed in Winnipeg from 2004 to 2006&#xD;
      demonstrated a dismal completion rate of only 65%. Thus, something more clearly needs to be&#xD;
      done. In an effort to help improve colonoscopy from both the technical standpoint of the&#xD;
      endoscopist and also the comfort level of patients, Olympus has redesigned a previously&#xD;
      developed real-time imaging system that enables visualization of the shape of the entire&#xD;
      endoscope while it is inside the patient's body. This technology, called ScopeGuide (Olympus&#xD;
      America, Center Valley, PA), consists of electromagnetic coils embedded within the endoscope&#xD;
      that are detected by an external receiver dish, generating a 3D representation of the&#xD;
      endoscope that is displayed on a monitor. It is anticipated that by visualizing the entire&#xD;
      scope as it moves through the body, endoscopists will gain useful visual information about&#xD;
      loop formation and scope position that will enable greater technical success while creating a&#xD;
      more comfortable patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to perform a randomized, non-blinded colonoscopy study to&#xD;
      determine if real time visualization of the colonoscope using the new Olympus ScopeGuide&#xD;
      system is superior to conventional colonoscopy for the achievement of endoscopic procedural&#xD;
      outcomes and for an improved patient experience in terms of reduced discomfort and decreased&#xD;
      sedation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy at the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH)&#xD;
      will be considered for study enrollment. Eligible patients who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and who provide informed consent will be randomized to undergo&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy or colonoscopy with the assistance of the ScopeGuide system. The&#xD;
      control group will use Olympus CF-H180AL variable-stiffness, high-definition colonoscopes&#xD;
      that do not differ from the usual procedure and the investigational group will use Olympus&#xD;
      CF-H180DL variable-stiffness, high-definition colonoscopes equipped with ScopeGuide&#xD;
      capabilities. ScopeGuide will provide the endoscopist with a 3-dimensional image on the&#xD;
      monitor depicting the shape of the colonoscope inside the patient's body as it moves through&#xD;
      the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy will be performed as clinically indicated, either with or without the aid of&#xD;
      the ScopeGuide system. All patients will undergo a purgative bowel preparation followed by an&#xD;
      overnight fast prior to their colonoscopy according to standard clinical practice at UAH. At&#xD;
      the start of the colonoscopy, all patients will initially be given standardized doses of&#xD;
      conscious sedation medications consisting of midazolam 2 mg IV and fentanyl 25 mcg IV.&#xD;
      However, the procedure may be initiated without any sedation upon patient request. Additional&#xD;
      doses of sedative medications may be given at patient request or when the nurse or physician&#xD;
      believes that the patient is uncomfortable. In all cases, the endoscopist will attempt to&#xD;
      minimize the formation of loops within the colon and will straighten those loops whenever&#xD;
      possible. This will be achieved by conventional methods that rely on &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;instinct&quot; in&#xD;
      the control group and will be directed by the ScopeGuide visualization in the investigational&#xD;
      group. The endoscopist may use any technical maneuvers deemed necessary to facilitate&#xD;
      completion of the procedure, including the application of external abdominal pressure by the&#xD;
      nurse, the repositioning of the patient, or tightening of the variable-stiffness setting of&#xD;
      the colonoscope. Upon intubation of the cecum, the insertion distance of the colonoscope from&#xD;
      the anus to the cecal pole will be recorded as a marker of the straightness of the endoscope.&#xD;
      Any abnormalities detected during colonoscope insertion will be more closely inspected,&#xD;
      photographed and biopsied during subsequent colonoscope withdrawal. Furthermore, polyps will&#xD;
      also be preferentially removed during colonoscope withdrawal, which is the existing&#xD;
      standard-of-care. Any diagnostic or therapeutic applications that are required during the&#xD;
      colonoscopy are permitted as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant demographic and clinical information will be recorded prior to the procedure.&#xD;
      Additional data regarding procedural metrics, technical maneuvers, and sedation doses will be&#xD;
      recorded during the colonoscopy. At the conclusion of the colonoscopy, the endoscopist will&#xD;
      rate the procedural difficulty as &quot;usual&quot; or &quot;difficult&quot; and will also note the procedural&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, the patient will be kept in the post-endoscopy recovery area in the&#xD;
      usual fashion. Prior to discharge home from the recovery area, participants will complete a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale reflecting their degree of discomfort experienced during the procedure.&#xD;
