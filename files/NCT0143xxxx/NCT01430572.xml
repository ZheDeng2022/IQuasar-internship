  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of Votrient (pazopanib) and Afinitor (everolimus) that can be given to patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is designed to block different receptors in the cancer cells that ultimately are&#xD;
      responsible for the growth of the tumor and its blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to block a protein called mTOR inside the cancer cells, which is also&#xD;
      involved in cancer growth.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the combination of pazopanib and everolimus based on when you joined this study. Up&#xD;
      to 8 dose levels of pazopanib and everolimus will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable&#xD;
      side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pazopanib and&#xD;
      everolimus is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of pazopanib and everolimus is found, up to 14 more&#xD;
      participants may be enrolled to further study the safety of the drugs at that dose and the&#xD;
      efficacy of the drugs in a certain tumor group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib and everolimus are taken by mouth on an empty stomach (1 hour before meals or 2&#xD;
      hours after meals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-5 of Cycle 1 only, you will take pazopanib and everolimus together. First take&#xD;
      pazopanib and then take everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After those first 5 days, you will take pazopanib and everolimus every other day separately.&#xD;
      Starting Day 6 of Cycle 1, pazopanib will be taken every even day (6, 8, 10, and so on) .&#xD;
      Everolimus will be taken every odd day (7, 9, 11, and so on).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with Cycle 2, you will take pazopanib every even day (2, 4, 6, and on so) and&#xD;
      everolimus every odd day (3, 5, 7, and so on).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, you will be asked what about any drugs or herbal supplements that you&#xD;
      may be taking and if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded if it has been more than 3 days since screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and hepatitis&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ° Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan, x-ray, MRI scan, and/or PET scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) may be drawn for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 6 participants in the expansion part of the study will have blood (about 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. The study staff will tell you if&#xD;
      you will have this testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at&#xD;
      different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 5 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn before and 8 more&#xD;
           times up to 10 hours after taking the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn 1 more time for PK testing after 24 hours of&#xD;
           taking everolimus. If you could not have the 10 hour draw the day before, this will be&#xD;
           drawn at this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 6 of Cycle 1 and Day 3 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn 1 time for PK testing&#xD;
           after 24 hours of taking pazopanib. If you could not have the 10 hour draw the day&#xD;
           before, this will be drawn at this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn 1 time at the end-of-dosing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken&#xD;
      off study early if the disease gets worse, intolerable side effects occur, you develop new&#xD;
      health problems, or your doctor thinks that it is no longer in your best interest to receive&#xD;
      the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced renal cancer and certain types of advanced soft tissue sarcoma but&#xD;
      has not been approved for use in other cancer types. Everolimus is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection, to treat advanced&#xD;
      renal cancer, and to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous&#xD;
      sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of pazopanib and everolimus to treat advanced cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 62 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             progressing in severity, except alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Prior malignancy Note: Subjects who have had another malignancy and have been&#xD;
