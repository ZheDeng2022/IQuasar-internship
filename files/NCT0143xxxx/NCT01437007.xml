      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer in the liver can start in the liver (e.g., primary liver cancer or hepatocellular&#xD;
      cancer) or spread to the liver from cancers in other parts of the body (e.g. colon, pancreas,&#xD;
      gastric, breast, ovarian, esophageal cancers, cancer with metastases to the liver.) People&#xD;
      who have tumors that can be removed by surgery live longer than those whose cancer cannot be&#xD;
      removed. Chemotherapy can shrink some tumors in the liver, which also helps people to live&#xD;
      longer, and sometimes chemotherapy can shrink tumors enough that they can be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. However, most chemotherapy drugs do not work well on tumors in the liver. In this&#xD;
      study we are testing a new drug, TKM-080301, given directly into the cancer blood supply in&#xD;
      the liver circulation, to see if it will cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of TKM-080301 for cancer in the liver that has not&#xD;
      responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have inoperable cancer that has started in or&#xD;
      spread to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a liver angiogram (type of X-ray study) to look at the blood flow&#xD;
           in the liver and to place a catheter for delivery of the TKM080301.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a single dose of TKM-080301 given directly into the liver. After&#xD;
           the drug has been given, the catheter will be removed. They will have frequent blood&#xD;
           tests and keep a diary to record side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have two more doses, each dose given 2 weeks apart. {Before each dose,&#xD;
           participants will have another angiogram and catheter placement.}They may also have&#xD;
           liver biopsies to study the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two weeks after the third treatment (one full course), participants will have a physical&#xD;
           exam, blood tests, and imaging studies. If the tumor is shrinking, they may have up to&#xD;
           three more courses of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow up visits every 3 months for 2 years after the last course&#xD;
           and then every 6 months as required.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Metastatic liver disease is a life-limiting factor for patients with a variety of cancers.&#xD;
      For&#xD;
&#xD;
      unresectable liver metastases, the 5-year survival is &lt; 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For selected histologies the 5-year survival of resectable hepatic metastases ranges&#xD;
           from 20-60%, suggesting that control of liver metastases could result in prolonged&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I through III trials have shown that Hepatic Arterial Infusion (HAI) is safe.&#xD;
           However, agents used thus far in HAI have limited efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TKM-080301 is a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation containing siRNA against the PLK1&#xD;
           (polo-like kinase-1) gene product. More specifically, TKM-080301 is a type of LNP&#xD;
           formulation, referred to as SNALP (Stable Nucleic Acid Lipid Particles). PLK1 has been&#xD;
           validated as a molecular target and a prognostic factor in a variety of cancers.&#xD;
           Inhibition of PLK1 activity in proliferating cancer cells rapidly induces mitotic arrest&#xD;
           and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will offer HAI with TKM-080301 to patients with unresectable and/or life&#xD;
           threatening primary liver cancer or liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate feasibility of administering TKM-080301 via HAI and to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of TKM-080301 administered by HAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
           TKM-080301.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate response rate using RECIST, PET and EASL criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the conversion rate from unresectable to resectable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with unresectable colorectal, pancreas, gastric, breast, ovarian and esophageal&#xD;
           cancers with hepatic metastases; or primary liver cancer patients who have demonstrated&#xD;
           progressive disease following standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years old or greater with an ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable limits by standard of&#xD;
           practice guidelines prior to surgery or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This is a dose escalation phase-I study testing HAI of TKM-080301 for patients with&#xD;
&#xD;
      unresectable colorectal, pancreas, gastric, breast, ovarian and esophageal cancers with&#xD;
      hepatic metastases, or primary liver cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 54 patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive HAI with TKM-080301.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial dose will be 4 mg/m(2); treatment will be given every 2 weeks for up to 12&#xD;
           doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks. Patients whose tumors become resectable will&#xD;
           be offered this option; patients who show progressive disease will be taken off&#xD;
           treatment. All patients will be followed for survival.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal, pancreas, gastric, breast,&#xD;
             ovarian and esophageal cancers with hepatic metastases, or primary liver cancers&#xD;
             (Hepatocellular carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hepatic disease must be measurable per RECIST Criteria (version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hepatic disease should be deemed unresectable as per standard of care criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Evidence of limited unresectable extrahepatic disease on preoperative&#xD;
             radiological studies is acceptable if the life-limiting component of progressive&#xD;
             disease is in the liver.&#xD;

             leucovorin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
