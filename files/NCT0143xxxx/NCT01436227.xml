  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in&#xD;
      treating patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate safety and efficacy of treatment with pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) for 6&#xD;
      months in patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) who have a measurable VHL related&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate rate of growth over time in target lesions before and after pazopanib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate need for surgical intervention over time in patients who receive pazopanib and&#xD;
      compare to rate prior to receipt of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Create an annotated tissue resource from patients with VHL for use in future research&#xD;
      related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRECLINICAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate circulating factors in patients with VHL undergoing treatment with pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate relationship between VHL genotype and response to pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients benefitting from treatment may continue pazopanib&#xD;
      hydrochloride in the absence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>TTP will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test will be performed to test the difference in survival between prognostic groups. Regression analyses of survival data based on the Cox proportional hazards model will be conducted on TTP. The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated graphically and analytically, and regression diagnostics (e.g., martingale and Shoenfeld residuals) will be examined to ensure that the models are appropriate.</description>

    <description>Summary statistics, including frequency tabulation, means, standard deviations, median, and range, will be used to describe subject characteristics and marker data. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to test the association between two categorical variables, such as response and prognostic factors and discrete markers. The association among various continuous and discrete markers and response may be assessed first by the exploratory data analysis graphically and tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test.</description>
