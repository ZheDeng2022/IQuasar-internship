      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy given before surgery of soft tissue sarcoma decreases the size&#xD;
      of the tumor mass and the presence of malignant cells in its peripheral region. NBTXR3 and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells and increase the tumor shrinkage rendering&#xD;
      surgery more feasible or easier and achieve better local control of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This Phase I trial aims at evaluating the feasibility of the NBTXR3 injection in the&#xD;
      tumor, safety and the adequate dose of NBTXR3 when given with radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a single intratumor injection of NBTXR3 on day 1 and will receive&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy starting on day 2 up to completion of 5 weeks, 5 days a week of&#xD;
      treatment (50Gy, 2Gy/fraction). Then, all patients will undergo surgical resection of the&#xD;
      tumor 5 weeks later and will be followed for wound healing and toxicity assessment. A visit&#xD;
      of end of treatment will take place approximately 3-4 weeks after surgery. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for evaluation of their disease status and adverse events every 8 weeks until the&#xD;
      end of study.&#xD;
