    <textblock>
      The aim of this open-label, self-control study is to evaluate the efficacy of sertraline in&#xD;
      treating depression in Patients with Parkinson's disease. In addition, the investigators also&#xD;
      want to find out whether patient gets better quality of life when depression is improved.&#xD;

      Depression in PD is associated with more severe cognitive and functional impairments, a&#xD;
      faster progression of illness, worse quality of life, increase mortality and higher burden&#xD;
      for caregivers, when compare PD patients without depression. Depression accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 40-50% in PD patients, which is also well known as a main factor impacting on&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in negative way in the context of PD and even their&#xD;
      caregivers. In our previous cross-sectional study, the investigators have already studied the&#xD;
      prevalence of depressive symptoms in PD patients and also have proved how depressive symptoms&#xD;
      severely worsen HRQoL in PD patients in the area of the mainland China. In order to improve&#xD;
      HRQoL of PD, some interventions, for example, taking some antidepressants to improve&#xD;
      depression are urgently required. In addition, the investigators had already tested the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of Chinese version of the 39-item Parkinson's disease questionnaire&#xD;
      (PDQ-39) in mainland China, the paper about which already have been published in journal of&#xD;
      Zhejiang university science B (biomedicine and biotechnology) already, therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators can use the questionnaire of Chinese version of PDQ-39 to assess PD patients'&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of depression with antidepressant drugs is well established. In the last 20 years,&#xD;
      the application of antidepressant has risen mainly due to the introduction of the selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These drugs are now the most commonly prescribed&#xD;
      antidepressants in patients with depression in general. Regarding depression in the context&#xD;
      of PD, a recent survey in the U.S. showed that 63% of the prescriptions for depression in PD&#xD;
      were for SSRIs and only 7.5% for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The preference of SSRIs&#xD;
      over the older TCAs is supposedly based on their similar efficacy but better tolerability,&#xD;
      especially when compared with tertiary amines, such as amitriptyline or imipramine.&#xD;
      Sertraline is characterized by a low selectivity for serotonin relative to dopamine reuptake,&#xD;
      suggesting a favorable efficacy profile. There was a randomized study pointing out that both&#xD;
      sertraline and low-dose amitriptyline improved depressive symptoms in PD, and a significant&#xD;
      benefit on quality of life was observed only with sertraline. Still, more studies are needed&#xD;
      to demonstrate whether sertraline is effective to depression in PD patients. Further more,&#xD;
      there is no trial about the efficacy and safety of sertraline on depression in PD in mainland&#xD;
      China. It's necessary for us to initiate and conduct this trial in mainland China.&#xD;
