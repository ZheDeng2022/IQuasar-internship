  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been rapidly rising in Asian countries, more&#xD;
      and more screening colonoscopies are now being performed for prevention or early detection of&#xD;
      this fatal disease. Complete colonoscopy as indicated by caecal intubation is essential to&#xD;
      make it a reliable screening tool for colorectal cancer or polyps. Cecal intubation rate is&#xD;
      highly variable and dependent on individual experience. Colonic looping is the commonest&#xD;
      cause of incomplete colonoscopy. Magnetic endoscope imaging (MEI) is a non-radiological&#xD;
      imaging technique to provide real time, three-dimensional image and position of the&#xD;
      colonoscope during the procedure. It may facilitate straightening of colonic loops and hence&#xD;
      cecal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the benefit of MEI in term of cecal intubation rate across&#xD;
      endoscopists of all levels of experience by making use of the newly developed Endoscopy&#xD;
      Position Detecting Unit (UPD-3)by Olympus Optical Co, Ltd, Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare the&#xD;
      caecal intubation rate of colonoscopy being performed with and without UPD-3 guidance.&#xD;
      Colonoscopies performed by endoscopists with different level of experience will be randomized&#xD;
      to UPD-3 guided group or conventional group (no UPD-3 guidance). Patient controlled sedation&#xD;
      (PCS) containing propofol and alfentanil will be given to all patients. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that UPD-3 guided colonoscopy is associated with high caecal intubation rate&#xD;
      (complete colonoscopy), shorter time to caecum, less patient pain and lower sedative&#xD;
      medication requirement. A high caecal intubation rate facilitates a reliable colonoscopy&#xD;
      screening. Decreased colonic looping and shorter time to caecum may reduce patient discomfort&#xD;
      during the procedure. It may also facilitate learning and acquiring the skill of colonoscopy&#xD;
      in trainees.&#xD;

      Hypothesis UPD guided colonoscopy improves cecal intubation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design This is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the cecal intubation&#xD;
      rate of colonoscopy being performed with and without UPD guidance by endoscopists of&#xD;
      different levels of experience. The trial will be conducted in the Endoscopy Unit of a&#xD;
      university affiliated hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will have elective colonoscopy in the Endoscopy Unit during the study period,&#xD;
      and meet the following inclusion criteria are recruited. The colonoscopy will be done by 6&#xD;
      dedicated endoscopists with different levels of experience in performing colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPD-3 and the specific colonoscope with an in-built magnetic imaging facility (Olympus&#xD;
      Optical Co, Ltd, Japan) will be used in all examinations. A mobile sensor will be attached to&#xD;
      the assistant's hand, so that the hand position in relation to the colonoscope could be shown&#xD;
      in the imager screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient controlled sedation (PCS) will be given to all patients. It is delivered by means of&#xD;
      Graseby 3300 PCA pump (Graseby Medical Ltd), using a mixture of propofol (200mg in 20ml) and&#xD;
      alfentanil (0.5mg in 1ml) in a 25-ml syringe. The drugs will be delivered in response to&#xD;
      pressure on a hand-held button controlled by the patient. Each bolus (0.5ml) delivers 4.8mg&#xD;
      propofol and 12microgram alfentanil. No loading dose was used and the lock-out time of the&#xD;
      PCA machine was set at zero. All patients will be instructed in the use of the hand-held&#xD;
      button before colonoscopy. Nasal oxygen (2l/min) will be given to all patients, and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and blood pressure will be continuously monitored throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be randomized to either with the colonoscopist viewing the imager screen&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPD guided group: Both the colonoscopist and assistant will be viewing the imager screen&#xD;
      during the whole procedure. Information about colonoscopy looping will interpreted and&#xD;
      documented by the colonoscopist. Anterior-position view is the standard reference. When&#xD;
      abdominal compression is required, the assistant nurse should have the hand held probe&#xD;
      attached, such that abdominal compression is guided by the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional group (non- UPD guided): The imager screen will be turned to the other side such&#xD;
      that both the colonoscopist and assistant is blind to UPD images. When the colonoscopist&#xD;
      encountered looping as defined by paradoxical movement of the tip or disproportionate&#xD;
      advancement in endoscopic view to the shaft insertion, the colonoscopist is requested to&#xD;
      estimate the type of loop formed. The images will be captured for later interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is cecal intubation rate. Cecal intubation is defined as visualization of&#xD;
      appendix orifice and ileocaecal valve, procedure started by a trainee and taken over by&#xD;
      supervisor before caecal intubation is regarded as incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cecal intubation rate could be increased by at least 11% for trainee in a randomized&#xD;
      trial by Shah [14] and 16% for trainee and experienced endoscopist in another trial [15].&#xD;
      Since the overall cecal intubation rate in our Endoscopy unit without UPD guide is at least&#xD;
      90% already, the investigators expect a modest benefit from UPD guidance. Assume a difference&#xD;
      of 5% in caecal intubation rate (from 90% in conventional group to 95% in the UPD guided&#xD;
      group) with a power of 80% and a type I error of 5%, 2 sided analysis, 435 patients will be&#xD;
      needed in each group. Thus a sample size of 870 patients is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained before colonoscopy in the Endoscopy Unit, if the patient&#xD;
      fulfils the inclusion criteria. Block randomization will be done on a 1:1 basis, to ensure&#xD;
      equal number of UPD guided or conventional colonoscopies are done by each endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sealed non-opaque envelope (produced according to the computer generated random sequence)&#xD;
      will be opened to determine the appropriate limb of entry before scope insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not possible to blind the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The chi-squared test&#xD;
      (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate), Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test will be&#xD;
      used to compare categorical, parametric, and non-parametric data, respectively. A P value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned interim analysis will be conducted after recruiting 50% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected by the in-charged endoscopist and assistant after each&#xD;
      procedure in a standardized data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual rate It is expected that about 20 cases per week will be recruited for randomization.&#xD;
      The study could be finished in around 1 year time.&#xD;
