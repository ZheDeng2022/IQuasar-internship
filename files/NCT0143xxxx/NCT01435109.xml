    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic conditions and a leading cause of pain&#xD;
      and disability among adults. Many adults with OA have significant pain and functional&#xD;
      limitations, even though they receive some medical care for their OA. Efforts are needed to&#xD;
      help adults improve OA-related outcomes. This study will examine three different approaches&#xD;
      for helping adults manage their OA-related symptoms. The study will compare a patient-based&#xD;
      intervention (involving exercise, weight management, and cognitive behavioral pain&#xD;
      management), a provider-based intervention (involving provision of patient-specific&#xD;
      recommendations for care, based on evidence-based guidelines), and a combination of the two&#xD;
      interventions, relative to usual care among patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. The&#xD;
      interventions are relatively low cost and easy to disseminate, with the patient component&#xD;
      being telephone based. This study will provide novel, valuable information of the&#xD;
      effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of these three interventions in the context of&#xD;
      real-world clinical settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based guidelines emphasize that adequate management of osteoarthritis (OA) requires&#xD;
      a combination of both medical and behavioral modalities. However, many of the recommended&#xD;
      guidelines are not regularly incorporated into clinical practice, and the recommended&#xD;
      behavioral strategies (e.g. exercise and weight management) are not practiced by most&#xD;
      patients. Prior studies have examined strategies for improving patient behaviors to manage&#xD;
      OA-related symptoms, but few studies have examined provider-based interventions specifically&#xD;
      for patients with OA, or combinations of patient- and provider-based interventions. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare a patient-based intervention (involving exercise,&#xD;
      weight management, and cognitive behavioral pain management), a provider-based intervention&#xD;
      (involving provision of patient-specific recommendations for care, based on evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines), and a combination of the two interventions, relative to usual care. This study&#xD;
      will provide novel, valuable information of the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of&#xD;
      these three interventions in the context of real-world clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized controlled trial involving the following four study arms: 1)&#xD;
      Patient Behavioral Intervention for OA Only, 2) Provider Intervention for OA Only, 3) Patient&#xD;
      Behavioral Intervention + Provider Intervention for OA, and 4) Usual Care Control (no&#xD;
      intervention). Approximately 10 primary care practices in the Duke Primary Care Research&#xD;
      Consortium (PCRC) will be randomized to either the Provider Intervention or Provider Control&#xD;
      group. Within each clinic, patients with symptomatic knee and/or hip OA (n=560 total) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the Patient Intervention or Patient Control group. Participants&#xD;
      will be equally allocated between the four study groups, with randomization stratified&#xD;
      according to gender and race (white/non-white).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient behavioral intervention will be a twelve-month program that includes the&#xD;
      following elements: written educational materials (focused on exercise, weight management,&#xD;
      and cognitive behavioral pain management), an exercise video tailored for patients with lower&#xD;
      extremity OA, and telephone calls by a counselor to support behavior change. All participants&#xD;
      in the study will continue with any other usual medical care they receive for OA. The&#xD;
      provider intervention will involve giving information on patients' OA symptoms and treatment,&#xD;
      as well as patient-specific evidence-based recommendations for care. Providers will have&#xD;
      access to this information, as well as facilitated referrals for patient-specific treatment&#xD;
      recommendations (e.g. physical therapy, orthopedics), at the point of clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary time point for outcome assessment will be at 12-months. The investigators will&#xD;
      also assess a limited set of outcomes via telephone at 6-months, 18-months, and 24-months.&#xD;
      Following completion of study follow-up assessments, participants who were not assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two Participant arms will be given the materials for that intervention, and health&#xD;
      care providers who were not part of one of the two Provider arms will be given the&#xD;
      information involved in that intervention. The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      objective physical function (Short Physical Performance Test) and depressive symptoms&#xD;
      (PHQ-8). The main study analyses will compare outcomes between the four study groups. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
