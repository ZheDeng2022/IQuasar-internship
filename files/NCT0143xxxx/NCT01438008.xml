      Small amounts of sweet tasting sugar water reduces pain in babies during painful blood tests&#xD;
      and injections. The investigators do not know if sugar also reduces pain in babies already&#xD;
      receiving a continuous infusion of opioid analgesics. This project will help determine if&#xD;
      small amounts of sugar water reduce pain in babies already receiving a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      opioid analgesic during a heel lance procedure or nasogastric/orogastric (NG/OG) tube&#xD;
      insertions. The investigators hypothesize that infants who are receiving opioid analgesics&#xD;
      will have lower pain scores during their blood tests (heel lance) or NG/OG tube insertion,&#xD;
      when sucrose is given, compared to when water is given.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Sick infants nursed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) are exposed to large&#xD;
      numbers of repeated painful procedures during their hospitalization [1-6]. Effectively&#xD;
      reducing pain during these frequently performed and repeated painful procedures minimizes&#xD;
      short term behavioural and physiological responses to pain, and has the potential to reduce&#xD;
      long term adverse effects, including altered responses to subsequent pain [7] and increased&#xD;
      risk of adverse neurodevelopmental, behavioural, and cognitive outcomes [8] The effectiveness&#xD;
      of sucrose and other sweet solutions in the reduction of pain during painful procedures in&#xD;
      infants has been well established. Despite the large numbers of randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) of sweet solutions for procedural pain reduction in infants, there remain significant&#xD;
      knowledge and research gaps. One of the key unanswered questions is whether sweet solutions&#xD;
      reduce pain when given with concomitant opioid analgesics [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Sick infants in hospital need to have blood tests as part of their medical care.&#xD;
      Oral sucrose and glucose has shown to effectively reduce behavioural responses to pain and&#xD;
      pain scores during commonly performed painful procedures in preterm and term newborn infants&#xD;
      and infants up to 12 months of age. However, the investigators do not know if this also works&#xD;
      for infants already receiving a continuous infusion of opioid analgesics. The aim is to&#xD;
      establish preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of oral sucrose in reducing pain during&#xD;
      heel lancing or NG/OG tube insertion when concomitant opioid analgesics are being&#xD;
      administered, and to use the pilot data to inform a full scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Infants who are receiving opioid analgesics will have lower pain scores during&#xD;
      their blood tests (heel lance) or NG/OG tube insertion, when sucrose is given, compared to&#xD;
      when water is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To obtain preliminary data about the effectiveness of sucrose and&#xD;
      concomitant opioid analgesics compared to opioid analgesics alone during the painful&#xD;
      procedure of heel lancing or NG/OG tube insertion to inform a full scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To determine the acceptability of the interventions to infants' parents&#xD;
      and to use these results to help us calculate sample size for a subsequent full trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled pilot trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in an urban tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital NICU. The study&#xD;
      population is all infants who are inpatients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) who&#xD;
      are receiving a continuous infusion of opioid analgesics and who require a heel lance for the&#xD;
      purpose of medically-required capillary blood sampling or a NG/OG tube insertion. Study&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated to receive 24% sucrose solution or a placebo solution&#xD;
      (water). The maximum amount of the study solution will be administered according to the&#xD;
      infant's gestational age and according to the hospital's Sucrose policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;28 weeks gestation = maximum dose of 0.1 mL; 28-31 weeks gestation = maximum dose of 0.3 mL;&#xD;
      32-35 weeks gestation = maximum dose of 0.5 mL; &gt;36 weeks gestation = maximum dose between&#xD;
      0.5-1.0 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the difference in pain levels during the heel lance procedure&#xD;
      or NG/OG tube insertion in the study population as assessed by the Premature Infant Pain&#xD;
      Profile (PIPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include; i) total crying time; ii) skin conductance activity, a&#xD;
      valid, non-invasive, physiological measure of pain and stress in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: PIPP scores, crying time, and skin conductance activity will be&#xD;
      summarized using mean and standard deviation if normally distributed, and median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) if non-normally distributed. An intention to treat analysis will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), a validated seven-indicator multidimensional pain assessment tool which is extensively used in neonatal pain research. The scale consists of seven indicators including assessment of gestational age and behavioural state (contextual indicators), heart rate and oxygen saturation (physiological indicators), and facial actions-brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow (behavioural indicators), which are scored on a 0-3 scale and added for a total score of 0-21 Facial expression scores were also recorded on a 0-4 scale using a modified Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) at 30, and 60 seconds following the beginning of the procedure. The modified NFCS coded for the presence (1) or absence (0) of the 4 most common facial expressions in response to acute pain (brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow, and stretch open mouth).&#xD;
High values on both of these scales represent worse outcome (i.e higher pain intensity).</description>

        <title>Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP)</title>
        <description>The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), a validated seven-indicator multidimensional pain assessment tool which is extensively used in neonatal pain research. The scale consists of seven indicators including assessment of gestational age and behavioural state (contextual indicators), heart rate and oxygen saturation (physiological indicators), and facial actions-brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow (behavioural indicators), which are scored on a 0-3 scale and added for a total score of 0-21 Facial expression scores were also recorded on a 0-4 scale using a modified Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) at 30, and 60 seconds following the beginning of the procedure. The modified NFCS coded for the presence (1) or absence (0) of the 4 most common facial expressions in response to acute pain (brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow, and stretch open mouth).&#xD;
High values on both of these scales represent worse outcome (i.e higher pain intensity).</description>
