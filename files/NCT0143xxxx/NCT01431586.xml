  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to be conducted in humans for JDTic, a new chemical entity, with&#xD;
      evaluations focusing on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of JDTic&#xD;
      following administration of single oral doses. JDTic is a novel, selective κ opioid receptor&#xD;
      antagonist and is currently being developed by RTI International as a potential&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy to treat cocaine dependence. This study has the possibility of identifying&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose in humans and a surrogate measure of JDTic pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      activity. Data from this study will be used to plan for and define dose ranges for subsequent&#xD;
      studies, as well as to identify potential indicators of JDTic pharmacological activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JDTic-001 will be a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study&#xD;
      evaluating three planned escalating oral doses of JDTic in three planned cohorts of healthy&#xD;
      male subjects without a history of illicit drug use within the 12 months preceding the&#xD;
      Screening Visit, or other substances of abuse within the 12 months preceding the Screening&#xD;
      Visit. Each cohort of up to 8 eligible subjects will be enrolled sequentially to receive a&#xD;
      single oral dose of study drug under fasting conditions. JDTic dose escalation will occur&#xD;
      only if safety and PK data permit. A semi adaptive dosing plan will be followed such that the&#xD;
      first two dose cohorts will comprise 4 subjects each and the third planned cohort will&#xD;
      comprise 8 subjects. If adverse events (AEs) considered to be at least possibly related to&#xD;
      study medication by the Clinic Principal Investigator are noted in study subjects&#xD;
      participating in the first two cohorts, an additional 4 subjects will be dosed at the same&#xD;
      dose level as part of the affected cohort, unless otherwise determined by the Safety Review&#xD;
      Team (SRT) as guided by the JDTic-001 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). Should dosing&#xD;
      of additional subjects occur in the first cohort of subjects, then the second cohort of&#xD;
      subjects will also include 8 subjects. In each cohort, subjects will be randomized 3:1 active&#xD;
      drug: placebo in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned JDTic dose levels to be evaluated are 1 mg, 3 mg, and 10 mg; however, the actual&#xD;
      dose levels evaluated may be different, and/or additional dose levels may be added by&#xD;
      protocol amendment, depending on the safety and PK results of the lower doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic the day before dosing and will be confined to the&#xD;
      clinic for 6 nights, with safety and PK evaluations and assessments lasting approximately 125&#xD;
      hours following administration of study drug. Subjects will be required to remain confined to&#xD;
      the clinic for more than 6 nights if they experience persistent AEs that require observation&#xD;
      and/or the Clinic Principal Investigator or qualified designee (physician who is listed as a&#xD;
      subinvestigator on FDA Form 1572) considers it unsafe to release the subject from the clinic.&#xD;
      Additionally, alternate subjects admitted with Group 1 but not dosed may remain in the clinic&#xD;
      overnight for the possibility of being dosed with Group 2 and therefore would spend more than&#xD;
      6 nights in the clinic. Subjects will return to the clinic at 14 days after receiving their&#xD;
      dose for a follow-up visit. If, at this visit, changes in the POMS™ assessment are noted that&#xD;
      are considered significant in the Clinic Principal Investigator's opinion, or if a subject&#xD;
      has an ongoing AE, the subject will return to the clinic every 14 days (or sooner, if&#xD;
      clinically indicated) from the date of the follow-up visit until these changes/AEs have&#xD;
      resolved. Subject participation in the study will last up to 4 weeks, from screening through&#xD;
      the follow-up visit, depending on the date the subject's screening visit begins with respect&#xD;
      to the date he is dosed, and provided no additional follow-up visits are necessary.&#xD;
