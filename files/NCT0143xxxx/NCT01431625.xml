      AIM: To identify those mechanisms involved in the systemic and muscular response to exercise&#xD;
      treatment, in two different Obstructive Chronic Pulmonary Disease (COPD) phenotypes&#xD;
      (emphysema and non-emphysema). The investigators will evaluate the effect of exercise&#xD;
      training, on exercise outcomes, peripheral muscle strength measures, dyspnea and quality of&#xD;
      life indices, and markers of systemic inflammation and muscle repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: The investigators will study 30 COPD patients in GOLD II-IV stages, with&#xD;
      symptomatic disease. Patients will be differentiated into 2 different phenotypes:&#xD;
      predominant-emphysema and non-predominant emphysema (15 subjects for each group), according&#xD;
      to high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning images, and after the specific&#xD;
      analysis with the MeVisPulmo software. After patients are typified, they will be included in&#xD;
      the 12- wk training programme. MEASURES(pre&amp;post-training):Basic blood analysis, EKG,&#xD;
      spirometry, blood gases, pletysmography, gas diffusion, maximal inspiratory and expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (MIP,MEP), bioimpedanciometry, 1RM test and isometric strength determination, 6-min&#xD;
      walking test (6MWT), maximal and submaximal cycle-ergometry, and dyspnea using the Mahler's&#xD;
      Basal and Transitional Dyspnoea Indexes (BDI/TDI) and quality of life (Chronic Respiratory&#xD;
      Disease Questionnaire [(CRDQ]) evaluation. Besides, the investigators will measure blood PCR&#xD;
      and cytokines levels (IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, TNF-α, IGF-1, and MIC-A &amp; MIC-B). Muscle biopsies&#xD;
      will be made (quadriceps) for detection of TNF-α, TNFR-I, TNFR-II, IGF-1Ea and MGF, IGF-1R,&#xD;
      genes bound to biogenesis, markers of cell lesion-stress and myosin heavy chains (MyHC) type&#xD;

      Thoracic Society) and the SEPAR (Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery)&#xD;
      obstruction presenting moderate to severe airway obstruction (FEV1 &lt;60%) and a clinical&#xD;
      impact of their disease. Patients should be stable and appropriate therapy, and must not have&#xD;
      suffered exacerbations of the disease over a period of three months before the study, and&#xD;
      without treatment with oral corticosteroids for at least the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: 30 patients diagnosed at the Department of Pulmonology, Hospital Virgen del&#xD;
      Rocío de Sevilla, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Analyzing the effect size at the expense of an improvement in the&#xD;
      work achieved over 15 W in the stress test, and considering a standard deviation of this&#xD;
      parameter + / - 10W, allowing to detect differences in metabolic variables muscle, taking&#xD;
      some risks alpha &lt;0.05 and beta &lt; 0, 2 and calculating a percentage of losses of 15%, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate a sample size of 15 patients for each group (PC-size).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXIT CRITERIA OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient's clinical decompensation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of 3 or 5 consecutive sessions of the training program discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the initiative of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUPS AND STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective case-control, with a double oriented ex vivo and in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients differ in COPD &quot;dominance emphysema&quot; (15 patients) or COPD without &quot;predominantly&#xD;
      emphysema&quot; (15 patients) achieved according to objective criteria for quantitative methods of&#xD;
      a Computed Tomography High Resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the recommendations of the Helsinki Declaration on human&#xD;
      experimentation and security levels of data protection required by Law 15/1999 of December&#xD;

      informed consent of the individuals recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRAINING PROGRAM OF THE YEAR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a training program to be held for 12 weeks in sessions of 60 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. .- 20 minutes of bicycle ergometer with an initial load level of about 70% of baseline&#xD;
           peak oxygen consumption, increasing the load every two weeks as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Weightlifting in 2 sets of 6 reps of 5 simple exercises. These are held at a station&#xD;
           multigimnastyc (CLASSIC Fitness Center, KETTLER) and comprise: or simple arm flexion&#xD;
           (pull cable to the chest &quot;Chest pulls&quot;): effects on the latissimus dorsa, deltoids and&#xD;
           biceps. Sitting facing the tower drive, approaching the bar to the chest and then&#xD;
           extending your arms after you return to the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or simple extension of the arms (&quot;Shoulder press&quot;): Effects on the deltoids and triceps.&#xD;
      Sitting upright on the bench and held the weight to shoulder height, there will be extending&#xD;
      your arms above your head, slowly returning after bending arms to the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or arm flexion and extension against resistance (Butterfly &quot;Butterfly&quot;): Effects on the&#xD;
      pectoral and deltoid muscles. Sitting upright on the bench with your forearms and elbows on a&#xD;
      lever, takes it to the midline, giving way slowly to the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or leg stretching (&quot;Leg extension&quot;): Effects on the quadriceps. Sitting on the bench leg&#xD;
      extension is performed against resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or squats (&quot;Leg curls&quot;): Effects on the biceps femorals and calves. Lying prone on the bench&#xD;
      legs are bent against the weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resistance will be increased gradually from 70% of the maximum weight you can lift the&#xD;
      patient in a single maneuver (Test 1RM). Every two weeks the maximum weight is re-evaluated&#xD;
      to adjust the training load in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES, SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent baseline and after the training program the following tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analytical elemental, 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry and bronchodilator test simple: be held in a Datospir 92 at baseline and&#xD;
           after administration of 200 micrograms of salbutamol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood gases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  static lung volumes (FRC, RV, TLC) by plethysmography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of diffusion (DLCO) by single breath technique (equipment Masterlab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximum muscle pressures both inspiratory and expiratory, using a specific gauge (Micro&#xD;
           Medical, Rochester, USA) connected to a pressure transducer and a digital recording&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest CT (only at baseline): Phillips Tomoscan with Easy Vision workstation version 4.2&#xD;
           that allows densitometric analysis of lung parenchyma. Quantitative analysis of the&#xD;
           degree of emphysema was performed using the software 3D MeVisPULMO (MeVis Research,&#xD;
           Research Partner, University of Bremen, Germany). This is a prototype of software that&#xD;
           allows functional diagnosis based on CT images and in relation to the anatomical&#xD;
           compartments of the lung. Includes automated segmentation of the airway, lungs, lung&#xD;
           lobes and segments sublobar approach. This feature makes it especially useful to enhance&#xD;
           the diagnostic process in severe lung disease. The analysis software provides a regional&#xD;
           assessment MeVisPULMO allows proper parameters measured by CT lung, such as: the total&#xD;
           volume, mean density, pixel index or index of bullae (7.22).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of muscle strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Test one repetition maximum (1 RM test) measures the maximum amount of weight (in&#xD;
                kg) that can be raised in a single maneuver using a multigimnastyc station (Classic&#xD;
                Fitness Centre, Kettler, Postfach, USA). It can for each of the five exercise of&#xD;
                upper and lower limbs that are developed (chest pull, butterfly, shoulder press,&#xD;
                leg extension and leg curls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      maximal isometric quadriceps b.strength dominant. There will be a quad chair specially&#xD;
      prepared for this procedure (HUR Labs, Sanro) and using a dynamometer cable (Performance&#xD;
      recorder). There will be at least 3 maneuvers of maximal isometric force of 5 to 10 sec&#xD;
      duration. They are valid exercises that present a variability of less than 10%. The highest&#xD;
      value is taken as maximum force.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition: body compartments estimated greasy, non-fat and body water by&#xD;
           bioelectrical impedance power (Bodystat 1500, Isle of Man, United Kingdom). The BMI is&#xD;
           calculated by dividing weight (Kg) to height (m2) fat-free mass, Fat Free Mass (FFM) and&#xD;
           fat (FM) measured by bioimpedance (). FFM index (FFMi) ratio is calculated by the FFM&#xD;
           (kg) and height (m2). The loss of muscle mass is defined as FFM index &lt;16 kg/m2 for men&#xD;
           and &lt;15 kg/m2 in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Máximal with cycle ergometer and methodology already known (20), including:&#xD;
                Determining, from the respiratory gases, oxygen consumption, carbon production and&#xD;
                indirect anaerobic threshold, breathing pattern (minute ventilation, tidal volume,&#xD;
                frequency breathing), electrocardiographic monitoring and pulse oximetry during&#xD;
                exercise with heart rate control, blood pressure and dyspnea Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Submáximal of resistance cycle ergometer at 70% load achieved in the ultimate test,&#xD;
                with time control of resistance primarily, distance walked and control saturation&#xD;
                (pulse oximetry) and heart rate achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Test of the 6-minute walk, according to standard guidelines of the ATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of dyspnea and quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Indices of dyspnea and transition rate measures the functional deterioration, the&#xD;
                magnitude of the task and the magnitude of effort (Test of Mahler).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluation quality of life based on the specific questionnaire (CRDQ) proposed by&#xD;
                Guyatt for COPD patients and modified for your understanding in Spanish-speaking&#xD;
                subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of markers of inflammation and catabolism: It will perform a white blood cell&#xD;
           count by flow cytometry and measured the levels of CRP in blood samples by quantitative&#xD;
           real-time PCR. The detection of various cytokines, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, TNF alpha,&#xD;
           IGF-1 and MIC-A and MIC-B circulating is carried out by immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
           using specific kit for each markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quadriceps Muscle Biopsy: Biopsies were performed in the middle of the thigh, obtaining&#xD;
           samples of the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps muscle. Samples were obtained in an&#xD;
           outpatient setting. Some of the biopsies were fixed in formalin and included in paraffin&#xD;
           blocks and some will freeze with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ° C for subsequent&#xD;
           use in genetic and immunohistochemical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analysis of expression of genes selected, proceed to extract RNA from tissues previously&#xD;
      frozen in liquid nitrogen. This will be used Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). From isolated RNA&#xD;
      was performed reverse transcription using Superscript II RNase kit reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      (Invitrogen) and the resulting cDNA was used to carry out real-time quantitative PCR. The PCR&#xD;
      reaction was carried out by using fluorochromes such as SYBR Green or Taqman probes (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems). The following will be evaluated based on their genes into the muscle&#xD;
      transcriptome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNF-alpha and its two receptors (TNFR-I and TNFR-II), the two isoforms muscle IGF-1&#xD;
           (IGF-1EA and FGM) and its specific receptor (IGF-1R).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genes linked to the biogenesis: Paired box gene 7 (Pax7), M-cadherin and Myo-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers-cellular stress injury: adult isoforms demiosina heavy chain, both embryonic&#xD;
           (MyHC-emb) and perinatal (MyHC-peri).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical studies were performed in 5 um sections of paraffin tissue blocks&#xD;
      previously. These studies will detect markers such as myosin heavy chains (MyHC) I and II&#xD;
      (for typing and morphometric study fibrillar) N-CAM/CD 56 and Met (for quantification of&#xD;
      satellite cells in muscle tissue) and desmin (for determining the origin muscular). For&#xD;
      detection using the standard technique of immunoperoxidase-biotine.avidins (DakoCytomation,&#xD;
      Dako Denmark) with antibodies specific for each of the markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison of numeric variables between groups used nonparametric or parametric tests,&#xD;
      depending on their distribution (analysis of variance, Student's t test and Mann-Whitney). To&#xD;
      analyze the influence of training on the functional and morphometric variables were also&#xD;
      conducted an analysis of the percentage change [(post value - value pre / pre value) x 100].&#xD;
      To examine the relationship between different variables using the Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficients or Spearman, according to the distribution thereof. There will also be a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, multiple regression. Be considered statistically significant at p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. The dispersion of a mean value is expressed as mean ± standard deviation.&#xD;
