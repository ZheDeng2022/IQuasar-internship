    <textblock>
      The situation in Italy regarding radiation dose to patients undergoing Multidetector row&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (MDCT) scans is unclear despite Italian law require that each centre&#xD;
      check the Reference Dose Level (RDL) every two years. RDL in CT were first suggested in a&#xD;
      document of 1998 published by the European Commission (EUR16262/1998) based on the results of&#xD;
      an older survey in the UK from the late 1980s. Those RDLs, expressed in terms of Computed&#xD;
      Tomography Dose Index (CTDI) and Dose Length Product (DLP), are reported in the Italian law&#xD;
      (D.Lgs.187/00). However, in Italy there is no governmental authority comparable to the UK's&#xD;
      National Radiological Protection Board, deputed to dose evaluation and protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overview of the Italian situation is relevant in order to know the actual dose levels for&#xD;
      MDCT administered to patients both adults and paediatrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT imaging is rapidly growing and now represents an indispensable medical procedure for many&#xD;
      clinical conditions. The widespread availability and expanding use of multidetector CT (MSCT)&#xD;
      due to its high performance and very short acquisition times, has resulted in an increase in&#xD;
      both frequency of procedures and level of patient exposures from CT scan examinations, but&#xD;
      issues related to radiation, including potential risks, have been relatively neglected.&#xD;
      Particular attention should be given to CT scans in children, as they represent about 10% of&#xD;
      all the X-ray studies performed on them, accounting for about 75% of the total dose&#xD;
      administered. CT in children should be performed only when absolutely necessary as their&#xD;
      longer life expectation and sensitivity to X-ray radiations may increase the risk of causing&#xD;
      radiation-induced neoplasm's in later years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the 2000 report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of&#xD;
      Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) the frequency of CT examinations in countries with high healthcare&#xD;
      levels has increased by a factor of 8; with the mean effective dose increasing from 1,3 mSv&#xD;
      in the 1970s to 8,8 mSv per year per 1000 persons in the early 1990s. In Switzerland, Germany&#xD;
      and United Kingdom the increases in the number of reported CT examinations ranged between 39%&#xD;
      and 70% over just the period 1998-2002. The 2000 ISTAT report's estimated that 1479 CT&#xD;
      apparatus were installed in Italy performing a total of 3.327.750 CT examinations [3].&#xD;
      Considering an increase of 40% every 5 years, comparable to other European countries,&#xD;
      6.000.000 CT examinations can be estimated for 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to obtain a snapshot of Italian CT practice in adults&#xD;
      and children that is up-to-date in regards to information concerning multidetector 16- and&#xD;
      64- row CT. A second goal is to update the national reference dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should further establish a sustainable database for the ongoing collation of&#xD;
      further data from local surveys of CT. This will facilitate the analysis of trends and&#xD;
      periodic review of national reference doses for CT in a way similar to other European&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiology departments dealing with adult and paediatric CT in Italy will receive an&#xD;
      invitation to participate to the survey and a questionnaire regarding some important features&#xD;
      of their CT equipment. Four common protocols will be used for dose calculation: CT scan of&#xD;
      the head, lumbar spine, chest and abdomen. Cardiac CT data will be collected only for adults,&#xD;
      as in children other examinations, such as MR are commonly preferred to CT just for&#xD;
      radioprotection reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All radiology departments using a 16 or 64 multidetector CT will be sought for enrolment in&#xD;
      the study. Centres that perform at least 2000 MDCT examinations in either adults or&#xD;
      paediatrics in one year and do a regular quality control on their CT scanner will be included&#xD;
      in the survey list and divided according to their geographical site, namely the four&#xD;
      macro-areas of Northern Italy, Centre, Southern Italy and Islands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled centre will receive a standardized form to fill in. The main technical&#xD;
      parameters included in the questionnaire will be: CT scanner manufacturer, model and type,&#xD;
      characteristics of automatic modulation system (modulation directions and chosen image&#xD;
      quality level e.g. Noise Index and effective mAs). Tube voltage (kV), current (mA), tube&#xD;
      rotation time(s), slice thickness, total acquisition time (s), pitch, filtration should also&#xD;
      be given. For each patient examination Volumetric Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol)&#xD;
      and Dose Length Product (DLP) should be collected from the dose report. For the cardiac&#xD;
      protocol, a dedicated questionnaire will be distributed including typical cardiac parameters&#xD;
      in addition to those mentioned above. For the protocols performed on adults, data are&#xD;
      requested for normal patients (excluding those who were excessively small or large). For&#xD;
      children, the age at examinations and weight are included. Paediatric studies will be those&#xD;
      of persons less than 16 years old, as established by the Italian regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the accuracy of the console displayed values a medical physicist should&#xD;
      measure before starting the survey the CTDIvol following the European Guidelines&#xD;
      EUR16262/1998. Errors less then 10% between the measured and reported value will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each protocol will be analysed separately and descriptive statistical analysis of the main&#xD;
      parameters will be performed. These include sample size, range, median, mean value, third&#xD;
      quartile and percentage coefficient of variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be conducted over a period of twelve months. The data will be treated in an&#xD;
      anonymous way, with the centres being coded by alphabetical letters. The investigators&#xD;
      calculate that a sample size of 2,421 MDCT examinations for each protocol will be sufficient&#xD;
      to guarantee a confidence of 90% and an absolute error of 5% of the average dose, with simple&#xD;
      random sampling and assuming a conservative hypothesis that the population standard deviation&#xD;
      is five times that estimated in a similar German survey [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase the accuracy of the estimation the investigators will adopt a stratified&#xD;
      random sampling scheme that consists of stratification into the four geographical Italian&#xD;
      macro-areas and the random selection of a number of MDCT examinations proportional to the&#xD;
      population living in each macro-area. Stratification facilitates the tasks of data collection&#xD;
      and survey, and aides in removing a possible source of bias related to the different&#xD;
      frequency of MDCT apparatus, as MDCT services will be clustered into internally homogeneous&#xD;
      strata.&#xD;
