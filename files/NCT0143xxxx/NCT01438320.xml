      safe and has antiviral activity in people with hepatitis C.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is a serious chronic condition in the United States affecting&#xD;
      millions of people and is the cause of rates of hepatocellular carcinoma recently doubling in&#xD;
      the US. Treatment of hepatitis C is proven to be an effective secondary prevention of liver&#xD;
      cancer. Current standard antiviral treatments exclude 70-80% of hepatitis C patients from&#xD;
      therapies due to intolerable side effects. Our laboratory efforts identified a potential&#xD;
      novel approach to hepatitis C treatment and hepatocellular carcinoma prevention with&#xD;
      Quercetin, a heat shock protein inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Quercetin in hepatitis C&#xD;
      patients who have contraindications to standard antiviral treatment (both treatment naïve&#xD;
      patients who decline standard therapy, patients who previously had standard treatments with&#xD;
      relapse, as well as those who had intolerable side effects previously). The investigators&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that the flavonoid Quercetin inhibits hepatitis C viral production in&#xD;
      tissue culture, at least partially through its inhibition of heat shock protein expression.&#xD;
      This represents a novel mechanism for treating hepatitis C infection. Quercetin also has low&#xD;
      toxicity. These promising characteristics motivate the proposed Phase I study. Patients will&#xD;
      be recruited through the UCLA Pfleger Liver Institute and treated on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be closely monitored and reported. Viral load response will be evaluated as a&#xD;
      secondary endpoint. The anticipated total number of patients enrolled in the trial will be&#xD;
      20. All patients will be followed for 8 months after taking this first dose of study&#xD;
      medication. Patients exhibiting a viral load response will have extended follow-up, ranging&#xD;
      from a total follow-up of 12-24 months, to determine persistence of this response.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome for the study will be safety. The investigators will track various laboratory parameters including viral loads and see patients every 2 weeks during our drug phase which is 28 days. After that follow patients every month to see how long antiviral activity will persist if we do see a positive outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hepatitis C Viral Load Assessment with Quercetin Given Over 28 days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days during drug phase. Possibly this could go further for 32 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatitis C viral load will be monitored every 2 wks during the first 28 days when patients are taking Quercetin. After this period, if there is a positive antiviral activity that is seen, we continue to monitor viral load every month to see how long this effect will last.</description>

&#xD;
          -  All participants are either treatment-naïve and unwilling to be treated with standard&#xD;
