      Clinical data regarding the effects of dopaminergic drugs in idiopathic generalized&#xD;
      epilepsies are scarce. The general observation that antipsychotic agents (dopaminergic&#xD;
      antagonists) worsen seizures, has suggested that dopaminergic agonists would have&#xD;
      antiepileptic effects. However, this has never been clearly demonstrated, besides in few&#xD;
      limited studies (Mervaala, 1990 ; Quesney, 1980, 1981). More recently, Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET) investigations using dopaminergic markers (Fluoro-Dopa, SCH23390, DAT) have&#xD;
      shown dopaminergic deficits in several epileptic syndromes: ring chromosome 20 syndrome&#xD;
      (Biraben 2004), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Ciumas 2008), temporal lobe epilepsy (Bouilleret&#xD;
      2008), frontal lobe epilepsy (Fedi 2008). These data give rise to a renewal of interest for&#xD;
      the involvement of the dopaminergic neurotransmission in epilepsies. Based on our&#xD;
      experimental data from animal studies (see Deransart and Depaulis, 2002), the investigators&#xD;
      propose an original study investigating the involvement of the dopaminergic system in&#xD;
      idiopathic generalized epilepsies using behavioural as well as neurophysiological markers of&#xD;
      the dopaminergic response, in conditions where seizing activities in patients are facilitated&#xD;
      (EEG follow-up after sleep deprivation). This approach is based on the concept developed in&#xD;
      our laboratory concerning the involvement of the basal ganglia, and more precisely the&#xD;
      dopaminergic pathways, in the control of spike-wave discharges in idiopathic generalized&#xD;
      epilepsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess dopaminergic reactivity using a behavioural marker (i.e.&#xD;
      yawning) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy compared to matched healthy&#xD;
      controls after injection of either low dose of apomorphine or placebo. Other parameters will&#xD;
      be recorded as secondary outcomes: behavioural (blinking), biochemical (prolactin, GH) and&#xD;
      neurophysiological (Spike-Waves Discharge: SWD rating) markers. Safety parameters will be&#xD;
      recorded to assess tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data: hyperdopaminergic response in a model of absence-epilepsy in the rat.&#xD;
      Since the late 80's, our laboratory has demonstrated the existence of an endogenous neural&#xD;
      mechanism that controls the occurrence of epileptic seizures in different animal models, a&#xD;
      system based on the hypothesis that the basal ganglia modulate the synchronisation of&#xD;
      epileptic rhythmic activities (Depaulis 1994). The studies performed in GAERS (Genetic&#xD;
      Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg, a validated model of absence-epilepsy in rat) have&#xD;
      shown that inhibition of the main output structure of basal ganglia (i.e., the substantia&#xD;
      nigra pars reticulata) had antiepileptic effects (Depaulis 1994; Deransart 1996). Similarly,&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata as well as of the subthalamic&#xD;
      nucleus interrupts seizures (Vercueil 1998; Feddersen 2007). Systemic and intrastriatal&#xD;
      dopamimetics injections in GAERS also suppress seizures, whereas antagonists worsen them&#xD;
      (Warter et al, 1988; Deransart et al., 2000). Electrophysiological data showed respectively&#xD;
      decreased and increased activity of DA neurons during and at the end of absence-seizures&#xD;
      (Lücking et al. 2002). An increase in D3 receptor transcripts was also observed in adult&#xD;
      GAERS as compared to inbred non epileptic control rats (NEC), within the ventral striatum&#xD;
      (Deransart et al. 2001). These data suggest changes in the DA tone in GAERS with fully&#xD;
      developed epileptic phenotype. According to the key role of DA D3 neurotransmission in the&#xD;
      foetal cortical development (Levant B, 1995) and modulation of DA tone (Nissbrandt et al.,&#xD;
      1995; Gilbert et al., 1995; Kreiss et al., 1995), the researchers investigated whether the&#xD;
      putative impaired DA tone in GAERS correlates with functional changes in spontaneous and&#xD;
      quinpirole-induced yawning behaviour (Kurashima et al. 1995; Collins et al.2005). The&#xD;
      hypothesis of an increased dopaminergic tone in GAERS was thus addressed using pharmacology&#xD;
      and microdialysis. In GAERS and NEC (i) spontaneous and quinpirole-induced yawning behaviour&#xD;
      and (ii) changes in intra-accumbens dopamine contents induced by amphetamine and K+ and&#xD;
      measured by microdialysis were investigated. Spontaneous yawning was significantly decreased&#xD;
      in GAERS (0.3±0.2 yawn/hr, n=9) as compared to NEC (5.4±1.2, n=8) and Wistar Harlan rats&#xD;
      (9.7±2.3, n=7). Quinpirole-induced yawning was significantly increased in GAERS (29.4±4.9) as&#xD;
      compared to NEC (10.5±2.7) and Wistar-Harlan rats (22.6±3.5). Quinpirole also increased the&#xD;
      number of absence-seizures in GAERS (+47.4±8.6%). When compared to NEC, basal levels of DA&#xD;
      were 40% lower in GAERS whereas amphetamine and K+ produced a higher increase in&#xD;
      extracellular dopamine in GAERS. The increased quinpirole-induced yawning in GAERS may&#xD;
      account for an overexpression in D3 transcripts. The increased responsiveness of dopamine&#xD;
      transmission observed in GAERS after pharmacological manipulations, as compared to NEC,&#xD;
      suggests a &quot; hyperdopaminergic &quot; phenotype of GAERS. Altogether, these data support that&#xD;
      GAERS have an impaired DA tone that may be associated with the development of mechanisms&#xD;
      controlling absences seizures (Deransart et al, in preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, these data suggest that a phasic involvement (&quot; on request &quot;) of the basal&#xD;
      ganglia - notably under the influence of the dopaminergic neurotransmission - may underlie&#xD;
      the rapid changes in extracellular activity recorded in output structures of the basal&#xD;
      ganglia at the end of seizures in this model (Deransart 2003). Such a phasic functioning of&#xD;
      the dopaminergic system in the control of seizures could also reconcile with the apparent&#xD;
      discrepancy regarding the fact that seizures appear to escape chronic high-frequency&#xD;
      stimulations of the substantia nigra (Feddersen 2007). These data strengthen the need for a&#xD;
      re-appraisal of clinical approaches, especially based from a dynamic point of view regarding&#xD;
      the involvement of the dopaminergic system in epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involvement of the dopaminergic system in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Exposure to&#xD;
           dopaminergic antagonists, like antipsychotic drugs, increases the risk for the patients&#xD;
           to display epileptic seizures. The mechanism by which these treatments may lead to such&#xD;
           an aggravation remains unknown and, up to date, there is no pharmacological strategy to&#xD;
           decrease such a risk. Recent data suggested the involvement of the dopaminergic pathways&#xD;
           in several epileptic syndromes: a significant homogeneous decrease in striatal dopamine&#xD;
           uptake has been shown using PET in patients with epileptic seizures associated with ring&#xD;
           chromosome 20 mosaicism (Biraben, 2004). In this epileptic syndrome, patients display&#xD;
           prolonged seizures, reminiscent of an absence status epilepticus. A similar study, using&#xD;
           a marker for the dopamine transporter, recently reported a decrease in dopamine&#xD;
           re-uptake at the level of the substantia nigra in patients with idiopathic generalized&#xD;
           epilepsies (Ciumas, 2008). These data differ from what is observed in neurodegenerative&#xD;
           pathologies involving the dopaminergic system (e.g., Parkinson disease) where imaging&#xD;
           studies of the dopaminergic transmission show a decrease in synaptic terminals linked to&#xD;
           a progressive degenerative process. Data from epileptic patients rather suggest a&#xD;
           modulation of the expression of some dopaminergic receptors as well as dynamic changes&#xD;
           in the synaptic transmission. In line with our experimental data and the recently&#xD;
           published neuroimaging studies, the investigators propose that the reactivity of the&#xD;
           dopaminergic system displays special features specific to epileptic patients and may&#xD;
           constitute a risk-level marker for epileptic seizures. The conceptual framework of the&#xD;
           proposed translationnal study lies on the dynamic involvement of the dopaminergic system&#xD;
           and the assessment of its reactivity in epileptic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reactivity of the dopaminergic system in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Low doses of&#xD;
           apomorphine, a dopaminergic agonist, induce yawning and palpebral winking in healthy&#xD;
           subjects (Blin, 1990). Similarly, higher therapeutic doses induce yawning immediately&#xD;
           before therapeutic effect in patients with Parkinson's disease. These data suggest that&#xD;
           higher affinity of apomorphine to presynaptic receptor could be involved in promoting&#xD;
           yawning and blinking. The study of dopaminergic system response to low doses of&#xD;
           apomorphine, below the side-effects threshold (nausea, vomiting, hypotension) represent&#xD;
           an original, well-tolerated approach in both patients with epilepsy and healthy&#xD;
           subjects. Similar studies have already been published in patients with migraine (Cerbo,&#xD;
           1997) and cocaine users (Colzato, 2008) in order to study dopaminergic reactivity in&#xD;
           selected populations. The investigators propose to study dopaminergic reactivity in&#xD;
           patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy compared to matched healthy volunteers,&#xD;
           during prolonged EEG after sleep-deprivation, using apomorphine doses of 1 µg/kg and 5&#xD;
           µg/kg. Indeed, apomorphine 0.5 to 2 µg/kg increased spontaneous blinking rate and&#xD;
           yawning in healthy volunteers (Blin, 1990). However, a 10 µg/kg dose induced symptoms&#xD;
           such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and dizziness in migraineurs (Cerbo, 1997). The study&#xD;
           will focus on behaviour (spontaneous and apomorphine-induced yawning and blinking) and&#xD;
           EEG (spontaneous and apomorphine induced SWD) as compared to placebo. Prolactin and GH&#xD;
           dosing after apomorphine injection will provide a biochemical validation of dopaminergic&#xD;
           stimulating effect. Indeed, prolactin secretion is inhibited by dopamine from the&#xD;
           hypothalamus, while Growth hormone (GH) is stimulated. Thus, a decrease in prolactin and&#xD;
           an increase in GH reflect central dopamine availability. Dosing prolactin and GH&#xD;
           response to apomorphine subcutaneous injection represents a way to document the synaptic&#xD;
           effects of the drug, as previously described (Aymard, 2003; Friess, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project arises from concepts developed in our laboratory from experimental data obtained&#xD;
      in an animal model of epilepsy and from recent clinical data from the literature. It aims at&#xD;
      improving understanding of dopaminergic transmission dynamics in patients with epilepsy. It&#xD;
      could therefore promote the emergence of new markers of susceptibility to epileptic seizures&#xD;
      and constitute an opportunity to develop new pharmacological approaches based on dopaminergic&#xD;
      neuromodulation.&#xD;
