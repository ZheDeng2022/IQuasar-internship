  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only three medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol dependence (AD), namely disulfiram, naltrexone tablets and injection,&#xD;
      and acamprosate, however treatment success has been inconsistent. Thus, there exists a&#xD;
      substantial need for discovering ways to provide more effective treatments. Pre-clinical and&#xD;
      clinical evidence has clearly demonstrated that the noradrenergic (NE) system is involved in&#xD;
      the neurobiology of AD, thus representing an interesting new pharmacotherapy target and the&#xD;
      theoretical rationale for this proposal. Consistent with the concept that the NE system may&#xD;
      represent a new pharmacological target for AD, recent studies have shown that the prototype&#xD;
      alpha-1 NE receptor antagonist prazosin reduces alcohol drinking in different animal models.&#xD;
      Furthermore, clinical evidence has also confirmed that prazosin appears to be efficacious in&#xD;
      reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent individuals. While prazosin has a&#xD;
      significant side effect profile and must be taken three times a day, no other α1-blockers&#xD;
      have been investigated in alcohol research. Prazosin is a short-acting α1-blocker approved to&#xD;
      treat hypertension (HTN) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). After the approval of&#xD;
      prazosin in the 70's, other selective α1-blockers have been developed to treat HTN and/or&#xD;
      BPH. Among them, doxazosin has shown a more manageable and safer profile than prazosin. In&#xD;
      fact, doxazosin is a long-acting α1-blocker, thus it is taken only once/day. Doxazosin is&#xD;
      also less likely to give hypotensive side-effects. Thus, doxazosin is more commonly used in&#xD;
      clinical practice to treat HTN and/or BPH, than short-acting α1-blockers, such as prazosin.&#xD;
      Poor adherence to medications and/or side-effects represent important factors limiting the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for patients with AD. If effective for AD, doxazosin may&#xD;
      represent a simple, manageable and safe medication, which might be more easily transferable&#xD;
      to clinical practice. However, doxazosin has never been tested in AD. This project is a&#xD;
      10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject randomized clinical trial with&#xD;
      doxazosin (16mg once/day) in alcohol dependent (AD) individuals. This study attempts to&#xD;
      address whether doxazosin is an effective and safe pharmacotherapy for AD.&#xD;
