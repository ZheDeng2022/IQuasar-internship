    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant (BMS-927711)&#xD;
      compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by Pain Freedom&#xD;
      (headache pain intensity level reported as &quot;no pain&quot;) at 2 hours post dose using a four point&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) while identifying an&#xD;
      optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Pain Free Participants (Pain Freedom) at 2 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain freedom was defined as participants reporting a value of &quot;none&quot; on the four-point numeric rating scale (none=0, mild =1, moderate =2, severe =3) from baseline. Participants with baseline moderate pain or severe pain were included in the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Total Migraine Freedom at 2 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Total migraine freedom is defined as complete absence of migraine symptoms. A participant was positive for total migraine freedom at a particular time point if he/she reports the absence of: pain, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. This corresponds to reporting &quot;none&quot; on each of the four-point numeric rating scale (none =0, mild =1, moderate =2, severe =3) from baseline associated with these symptoms. Participants with baseline moderate pain or severe pain were included in the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs: from first dose to end of treatment visit (up to 7 weeks); SAE: from signing of informed consent to 30 days after the last dose (up to 11 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not related to study drug. A SAE was defined as an event which was fatal or life threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization, was significantly or permanently disabling or incapacitating, constituted a congenital anomaly or a birth defect, or suspected transmission of an infectious agent, or encompassed any other clinically significant event that could jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the aforementioned outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Sustained Pain Freedom From 2 to 24 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours to 24 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered to have sustained pain freedom if all of their reported pain readings in the interval are &quot;none&quot; on the four point numeric rating scale (no pain=0, mild pain=1, moderate pain=2, severe pain=3). The intervals are inclusive of the endpoints. Sustained pain freedom was analyzed with a Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test for general association that compares the ED90 to placebo, and controls for baseline pain severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Sustained Pain Freedom From 2 to 48 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours to 48 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered to have sustained pain freedom if all of their reported pain readings in the interval are &quot;none&quot; on the four point numeric rating scale (no pain=0, mild pain=1, moderate pain=2, severe pain=3). The intervals are inclusive of the endpoints. Sustained pain freedom was analyzed with a CMH test for general association that compares the ED90 to placebo, and controls for baseline pain severity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 41 centers in the United States. A total of 1026 participants were enrolled in the study, and 885 of these were randomized to treatment. Of the 141 participants who were not randomized, the main reason for non-randomization was participants no longer met inclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was divided into 3 phases: a screening/baseline phase (3-28 days), an acute treatment phase (up to 45 days during which participants were treated on 1 migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity), followed by an end-of-treatment visit within 7 days of administration of study drug.</pre_assignment_details>
