      Background: Cannabis is the most prevalent illegal drug used in France, and consequences&#xD;
      arising from the step of 'casual consumers'(1-10 joints/month). Side effects of cannabis are&#xD;
      now well documented: Trauma (driving after consuming cannabis), respiratory, cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and psychiatric and social problems. The general practitioner (GP) is the health&#xD;
      professional most viewed by adolescents. Brief interventions (BI) for adult alcohol use have&#xD;
      been shown to be efﬁcient. Some BI have been designed to inspect adolescents and consumption&#xD;
      of cannabis have been piloted, showing their feasibility, but no test has validated them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim : Does a BI conducted by general practitioners reduce consumption of canabis in 15 to 19&#xD;
      years old ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two preliminary qualitative studies (with adolescents and GP), were used to analyze the&#xD;
      difficulties of communication around cannabis use. The Scientific Committee has analyzed the&#xD;
      results and developed a workshop around BI, adapted to adolescents cannabis users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CANABIC is a quantitative study to validate use of BI with cannabis users: a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, clustered study, comparing an intervention group (IG) and a control group&#xD;
      (CG). The intervention is the achievement of the IB during a specific consultation. The&#xD;
      outcome is the consumption of cannabic (Number of joints / month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 3 french regions : Auvergne, Rhône-Alpes and&#xD;
      Languedoc-Roussillon. 150 GPs wil be recruited and randomized in intervention group or&#xD;
      control group (ratio 1 :1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each GP will inlcude 5 adolescents (i.e. a total of 750 adolescents) - . The number of&#xD;
      adolescents needed has been calculate with hypothesis of a significant difference of 30% in&#xD;
      consumption of cannabis between adolescents who beneficied of BI (IG) and those who do not&#xD;
      experienced BI ( CG) A pilot study has been conducted. Cannabis use by adolescents has&#xD;
      decreased. Their perception of cannabis has changed: they are aware of the harmful effects of&#xD;
      their consumption. This pilot study has improve many points of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease of 30% of consumption is expected (joints per month). Perception of cannabis by&#xD;
      adolescents will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate an IB adaptated to consultation with adolscents cannabis consumer in order to&#xD;
      provide a tool for GP in their daily practice.&#xD;
