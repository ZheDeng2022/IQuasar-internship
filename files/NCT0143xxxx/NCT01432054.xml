      The objective of this study is to create a Human Tissue Repository to be used as a resource&#xD;
      for future tissue repair research at KCI USA, Inc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study design is a multicenter study involving the collection of human biological&#xD;
      specimens in Subjects with various wound classifications and types for the purpose of a Human&#xD;
      Tissue Repository to be used as a resource for future tissue repair research at KCI USA, Inc.&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this study will have a 6mm tissue punch biopsy or equivalent tissue&#xD;
      specimen harvested from the healthiest margin of the wound. Tissue collection may occur at&#xD;
      Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Visit 2 may be combined with Screening, Visit 1. Subjects will have a&#xD;
      minimum of one (1) and a maximum of four (4) specimen collection visits. Specimens may be&#xD;
      collected from one or multiple different tissues (connective tissue, muscle, bone, and&#xD;
      dermis) at any or all visits. Each specimen will be placed in a separate appropriate vial.&#xD;
      Necrotic tissue with eschar and bodily fluids such as blood, wound fluid or sputum will not&#xD;
      be collected. Tissue from healthy, healing wounds will also be accepted. Tissue collection&#xD;
      visits shall occur at least twenty-four (24) hours apart. Ten (10) to twenty-five (25)&#xD;
      percent of the sites will be selected to collect all the specimens in cryovials containing a&#xD;
      pre-aliquoted amount (1.5mL) of RNAlater. Ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of the sites&#xD;
      will be selected to collect all the specimens in cryovials containing a pre-aliquoted amount&#xD;
      of HypoThermosol. The remaining sites will collect all the specimens in a vial containing no&#xD;
      diluents. All samples will be coded by the collection site prior to shipment to KCI.&#xD;

        Eligible subjects with acute or chronic wounds and whose wounds encompass one of the&#xD;
        following wound types will be enrolled: traumatic, diabetic, pressure ulcer, burns, or&#xD;
        dehisced wounds. Enrollment will continue up to 5 years. KCI may determine at any time that&#xD;
        sufficient samples have been obtained and cease enrollment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's wound is acute or chronic and classified as one of the following wound&#xD;
             types: diabetic, pressure ulcer, burn, traumatic or dehisced, and Subject signs the&#xD;
             separate informed consent form for the study. The consent process for tissue&#xD;
             collection should occur separately from any surgical consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is reported to be physically and mentally able and willing to comply with the&#xD;
             Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is between 18 - 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported presence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported presence of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported presence of Hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported presence of cancer in the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported presence or suspected presence of infection (indicated by signs and symptoms&#xD;
             of infection such as redness/swelling, or a positive culture, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of untreatable osteomyelitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Necrotic tissue with eschar present that cannot be debrided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a suspected or known intravenous drug user.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation of tissue which, in the judgment of the investigator, may pose venous or&#xD;
             arterial compromise.&#xD;
