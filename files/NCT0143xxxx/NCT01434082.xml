      The investigators are doing this study to look at sleep problems, daytime sleepiness, and&#xD;
      thinking and behavior patterns in children with arthritis and in children without arthritis.&#xD;
      Arthritis is a problem with joints. Some children have arthritis and some children do not&#xD;
      have arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disordered breathing is a sleeping problem in which some children snore and have pauses&#xD;
      in their breathing during sleep. It is associated with not enough or fragmented sleep, poor&#xD;
      school performance, problems paying attention, and behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not know how many children with arthritis have sleep problems, and how&#xD;
      it is linked to daytime sleepiness and children's learning, and behavior patterns compared to&#xD;
      children without arthritis. The investigators need to study both children with arthritis and&#xD;
      children without arthritis to learn more about these connections and to understand if they&#xD;
      are the same or different in children with arthritis and in children without arthritis.&#xD;

      Overview of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and their parent will be scheduled to come to the University of Washington&#xD;
           School of Nursing Sleep Laboratory for overnight polysomnography, and to complete&#xD;
           multi-sleep latency tests and a battery of neurobehavioral performance tests the next&#xD;
           day at a convenient time and day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children will be asked to complete a sleep, symptoms (pain, fatigue), behavior, and day&#xD;
           to day activity surveys, and the parent who accompanies the child to the laboratory,&#xD;
           will be asked to complete surveys assessing demographics, child's usual sleep, behavior,&#xD;
           school performance, health status, and family functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children will also be asked to spit in a container and urinate in a container upon&#xD;
           awakening in the morning after their sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare indices of sleep disturbances, risk factors, and type of sleep disordered&#xD;
           breathing(primary snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea) in&#xD;
           Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) to age, sex matched control children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare scores on neurobehavioral tests and daytime sleepiness; and to describe&#xD;
           associations between indices of sleep disturbances on neurobehavioral performance and&#xD;
           daytime sleepiness in JIA to age, sex matched control children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Describe and compare parent report of child's sleep habits, fatigue, behavior, school&#xD;
      performance, day-to-day activity, and family functioning in children with JIA to age, sex&#xD;
      matched control children.&#xD;
