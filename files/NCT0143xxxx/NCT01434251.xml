      Hypotension in the very preterm infant (gestational age [GA] &lt;32 wks) is a frequently&#xD;
      occurring clinical problem. Although no real consensus has been reached on the definition of&#xD;
      hypotension in these infants, in clinical practice a mean blood pressure (mean BP) in mmHg&#xD;
      lower than the GA age in weeks is considered to be the starting point for anti-hypotensive&#xD;
      therapy. However, although an association between neonatal hypotension and mortality/&#xD;
      morbidity exists, there is no evidence of causality between hypotension (meanBP &lt;GA in&#xD;
      completed weeks) and neonatal mortality/morbidity. In addition, using mean BP alone as the&#xD;
      indication of treatment of neonatal cardiovascular compromise without taking into&#xD;
      consideration the status of tissue perfusion may lead to unnecessary exposure of neonates to&#xD;
      vasoactive medication. This medication can be potentially harmful to these extremely&#xD;
      vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare neonatal mortality and short-term neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome (cerebral ultrasound during the first 7 days of life, advanced MRI indices of&#xD;
      structural brain injury at term GA) and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley scales&#xD;
      of infant development III [BSID-III] at 24 months) between two groups of very preterm infants&#xD;
      presenting with hypotension without clinical and laboratory evidence of compromised tissue&#xD;
      perfusion during the first 3 days of life. Hypotension will be defined as the mean BP (in mm&#xD;
      Hg) lower than the infant's GA (in weeks). Patients randomized to &quot;Group A&quot; will be treated&#xD;
      according to the treatment protocol operative in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of&#xD;
      the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU) while &quot;Group B&quot; will receive no cardiovascular&#xD;
      support for hypotension unless they have evidence of compromised tissue perfusion and&#xD;
      end-organ function ((i.e. near infrared-monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2)&#xD;
      &lt;50% despite optimized ventilatory support and FiO2 administration, plasma lactate &gt;6 mmol/L;&#xD;
      and/or urine output &lt;0.6 mL/kg/hour) or mean BP &gt;5mmHg lower than the current guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be no differences between the two groups&#xD;
      concerning short and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;

      Rationale: Hypotension in the very preterm infant (gestational age [GA] &lt;32wks) is a&#xD;
      frequently occurring clinical problem. Although no real consensus has been reached on the&#xD;
      definition of hypotension in the very preterm baby, in clinical practice a mean blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) in mmHg lower than the GA age in weeks is considered to be the starting point&#xD;
      for anti-hypotensive therapy. However, although an association between neonatal hypotension&#xD;
      and mortality and morbidity exists, there is no evidence of causation between hypotension and&#xD;
      neonatal mortality and morbidity (including neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 and 3 years of&#xD;
      age). In addition, using mean BP alone as the indication of treatment of neonatal&#xD;
      cardiovascular compromise without taking into consideration information on the status of&#xD;
      tissue perfusion may lead to unnecessary exposure of neonates to forceful vasoactive&#xD;
      medications potentially causing harm to these extremely vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare neonatal mortality and short-term (advanced MRI indices of structural&#xD;
      brain injury at 40 weeks' GA) and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley scales of&#xD;
      infant development III [BSID-III] at 24 months) between two groups of very preterm infants&#xD;
      presenting with hypotension without clinical and laboratory evidence of compromised tissue&#xD;
      perfusion during the first 72 postnatal hours (3 days). Hypotension will be defined as the&#xD;
      mean BP (in mm Hg) lower than the infant's GA (in weeks). Patients randomized to &quot;Group A&quot;&#xD;
      will be treated according to the treatment policy operative in the Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (NICU) of the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital/University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU)&#xD;
      while &quot;Group B&quot; will receive no cardiovascular support for hypotension unless they have a&#xD;
      mean BP lower than the current limit minus 5 mmHg and/or evidence of compromised tissue&#xD;
      perfusion and end-organ function and thus meet established criteria (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single-centre randomized non-blinded cohort study in the NICU at the UMCU of&#xD;
      preterm neonates &lt;30 weeks' gestation during postnatal days 0 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All preterm infants with a GA of &lt;30 weeks admitted on day of postnatal&#xD;
      life 0 to the NICU at the UMCU. Patients will be managed according to their randomization to&#xD;
      Group A or B until the end of postnatal day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients randomized to &quot;Group A&quot; will be treated for hypotension according to&#xD;
      the treatment protocol operative in the NICU at the UMCU. Patients randomized to &quot;Group B&quot;&#xD;
      will receive no cardiovascular supportive therapy irrespective of their BP value unless their&#xD;
      mean BP is &gt;5 mmHg below GA in weeks for 30 minutes and/or they have indirect clinical or&#xD;
      direct laboratory evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and/or end-organ dysfunction (i.e. rScO2&#xD;
      is &lt;50% despite optimized ventilatory support and FiO2 administration, plasma lactate &gt;6&#xD;
      mmol/L; and/or urine output &lt;0.6 mL/kg/hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As CO2 is the most potent regulator of cerebral blood flow (CBF), it is understandable why&#xD;
      changes in arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) has been associated with increased incidence of&#xD;
      peri-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIVH) in preterm neonates with significant hypercapnia and&#xD;
      with white matter injury (periventricular leukomalacia; PVL) in preterm neonates with&#xD;
      hypocapnia during the immediate postnatal period. Therefore, in the present study,&#xD;
      ventilation will be closely followed and PaCO2 values monitored and attempted to be kept&#xD;
      within normal limits (40-to-50 mmHg) during the first three postnatal days to control for the&#xD;
      potential impact of this confounding variable as far as the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are concerned (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine whether refraining (group B) from&#xD;
      anti-hypotensive treatment has a negative, positive or no effect on the composite outcome of&#xD;
      mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome (determined by BSID-III) at 24 months of age.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include 1) differences between the groups in the incidence of&#xD;
      PIVH during the first 7 postnatal days detected by head ultrasound, 2) differences in the&#xD;
      incidence of white matter injury PVL and gray matter injury not detected within the first 7&#xD;
      days by ultrasound using advanced MRI parameters of the brain at the adjusted postmenstrual&#xD;
      age of 40 weeks as well as the ability to maintain CBF autoregulation during the first three&#xD;
      postnatal days.&#xD;
