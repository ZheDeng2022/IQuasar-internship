    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving the patient special cells from a&#xD;
      donor called &quot;Modified T-cells&quot;. The goal is to assess the toxicities of T-cells for patients&#xD;
      with relapsed B cell leukemia or lymphoma after a blood SCT organ SCT or for patients who are&#xD;
      at high risk for relapse of their B cell leukemia or lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>Utilizing our initial trial experience, it was amended to include three (3) expansion cohorts. Cohort 1: patients with CD19+ relapse/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies occurring after allogeneic/autologous HSCT or solid organ transplant (SOT) infusion occurring following conditioning chemotherapy. Cohort 2:patients with CD10+ high risk B cell malignancies eligible for autologous HSCT followed by 19-28z CRA EBV-CTLs (auto-HSCT preparative regimen serves as conditioning chemotherapy. Cohort 3: patients with CD19+ high risk B cell malignancies eligible for allogeneic HSCT followed by consolidative 19-28z CAR EBV-CTLs (allo-HSCT preparative regimen serves as conditioning chemotherapy) Each expansion cohort has a target accrual of 6 patients treated with fixed CAR EBV-CTL dose (3x106 EBV-CTLs/kg) which has been demonstrated to be the ideal manufacturing dose.</description>

    <description>Following completion of the chemotherapy, genetically modified T cells will be given intravenously at one of 3 dose levels. After the infusion patients will be monitored clinically and with serial blood and marrow evaluations to assess toxicity, therapeutic effects, and the in-vivo survival of the genetically modified T-cells. A fixed CAR EBV-CTL dose (3x106 EBV-CTLs/kg) which has been demonstrated to be the ideal manufacturing dose allowing for multiple infusions and potential for multiple patient treatments per cell line generated will be used for all patients on this trial. Cohorts will be determined separately but cohort 3 will not begin to accrue until cohort 2 has treated three (3) patients without a DLT. Each patient is eligible for up to three (3) infusions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen will be the preferred conditioning chemotherapy prior to CAR T cell infusion for patients with CD19+ malignancy in cohort 1. Recommended chemotherapy regimen consists of single agent Cyclophosphamide at a dose of 3000 mg/m2/dose IV over 1 hour or 1500mg/m2/dose x 2 doses given daily over 1 hour given for 2 days (patients may received reduced dose of cyclophosphamide based on the clinical status of the patient at discretion of the treating physician and with written approval by the MSKCC PI of this study). Alternative cyclophosphamide or non-cyclophosphamide-based regimens based on the clinical status of the patient, disease burden, and likely-hood of response may be used at the discretion of the treating physician with written approval by MSKCC PI of the study. Conditioning chemotherapy will not be given prior to infusions # 2 and #3.</description>
