    <textblock>
      The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose and&#xD;
      best schedule of the combination of everolimus and sorafenib that can be given to patients&#xD;
      with malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Phase 2 of this study to learn if the combination of everolimus and sorafenib can&#xD;
      help to control malignant glioma. The safety of this combination will also be studied in both&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and&#xD;
           survival signaling pathways have been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor specific pathways in hopes of improving&#xD;
           treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity. Because molecularly targeted&#xD;
           agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that inhibits&#xD;
           multiple pathways is an appealing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and&#xD;
           tumor angiogenesis. Although most GBMs lack RAF mutations, targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK&#xD;
           pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by other genetic alterations&#xD;
           upstream from RAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a downstream component of the&#xD;
           PI3K/Akt pathway. Everolimus (everolimus; Novartis) is a novel oral derivative of&#xD;
           rapamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the PI3K pathway and the&#xD;
           RAF-MAPK pathway and in addition targets VEGF and PDGF, other active targets in&#xD;
           malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus in combination with&#xD;
&#xD;
      sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with no prior&#xD;
           bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           as determined in the phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 month progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior bevacizumab&#xD;
           exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as&#xD;
           determined in the phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 month progression free survival rate for AG patients with no prior bevacizumab&#xD;
           exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as&#xD;
           determined in the phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be&#xD;
           eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be &gt;= 18 years old with a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 60&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No more than 2 prior chemotherapies and 1 relapse. Prior bevacizumab therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase 1 /2 study of everolimus and sorafenib in patients with recurrent&#xD;
           highgrade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: Patients will be treated with daily everolimus (days 1-28) in combination with&#xD;
           sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Patients will be treated with the combination of sorafenib and everolimus.&#xD;
           Sorafenib will be taken daily for 7 days on, then 7 days off. Everolimus will be taken&#xD;
           daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is not a defined set maximum number of cycles that a patient may have. Patients&#xD;
           may continue with protocol therapy until criteria for Off Treatment is met. Patients&#xD;
           will then be followed every 3 months for survival status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be an accrual of approximately 3-6 eligible patients per cohort to the Phase&#xD;
           I component of the study. Patients removed at any time for toxicity are evaluable. Phase&#xD;
           I patients removed from study treatment within 28 days for reasons other than toxicity&#xD;
           may be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a total accrual of approximately 82 eligible patients to the Phase II&#xD;
           study (34 recurrent GBM with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, 16 recurrent Anaplastic&#xD;
           Glioma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, and 32 glioblastoma with prior exposure to&#xD;
           bevacizumab).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be&#xD;
             eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol. Malignant glioma includes&#xD;
             glioblastoma (GBM), Gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic&#xD;
             oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant&#xD;
             astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original&#xD;
             histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a malignant&#xD;
             glioma is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for&#xD;
             the release of their protected health information at all sites except the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No more than 2 prior chemotherapies and 1 relapse. Prior bevacizumab therapy is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: &gt;3 weeks for&#xD;
             biologic therapies or non-cytotoxic therapies, &gt;4 weeks for cytotoxic therapies, and&#xD;
             &gt;6 weeks for nitrosoureas. Any questions related to the definition of non- cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: 13 cis-retinoic acid (Accutane) as biologic therapy has a washout period of 14&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt;= 3.0 x 10^9/L, ANC &gt;= 1.5 X&#xD;
             10^9/L, platelet count of &gt;=100 x 10^9/L, and hemoglobin &gt;= 10 gm/dL), adequate liver&#xD;
             function (SGOT and bilirubin &lt; 2 times ULN), and adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;&#xD;
             1.7mg/dL or creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min) before starting&#xD;
             therapy. These tests must be performed within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
             Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by&#xD;
             MRI or CT scan. A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on&#xD;
             a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the steroid&#xD;
             dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI/CT&#xD;
             is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period&#xD;
             of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. Measurable disease is NOT required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: MRI is the preferable imaging method; CT scan may be used in cases where an MRI&#xD;
             cannot be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery and be &gt; 3 weeks from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent malignant glioma is not&#xD;
                  mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual&#xD;
                  disease post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the&#xD;
                  immediate post-operative period or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14&#xD;
                  days prior to registration. If the 96-hour scan is more than 14 days before&#xD;
                  registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased&#xD;
                  between the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required&#xD;
                  on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to registration;&#xD;
             except if patients underwent surgery within 12 weeks and pathology is consistent with&#xD;
             recurrent tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation&#xD;
             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or&#xD;
             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to taking the first dose of study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or&#xD;
             heparin may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be&#xD;
             measured prior to initiation of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined&#xD;
             by the local standard of care, until INR is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following modifications to the general eligibility criteria apply to Phase I patients&#xD;
        only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients may have had treatment for any number of prior relapses. Relapse is defined as&#xD;
        progression following initial therapy (i.e. surgery and radiation+/- chemo if that was used&#xD;
        as initial therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II patients must meet the following Eligibility Criteria in addition to the General&#xD;
        Criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had treatment for no more than 1 prior relapse (i.e. failed 2 lines&#xD;
             of treatment-initial therapy and therapy for first relapse) at 2nd relapse, treatment&#xD;
             per BTTC09-01 is an option. Relapse is defined as progression following initial&#xD;
             therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy). The intent&#xD;
             therefore is that patients had no more than 2 prior therapies (initial and treatment&#xD;
             for 1 relapse). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes&#xD;
             another surgical resection, this is considered as 1 relapse. For patients who had&#xD;
             prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a high-grade glioma&#xD;
             will be considered the first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior therapy with sorafenib, everolimus, or related&#xD;
             drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors (except bevacizumab), or&#xD;
             mTOR inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients has any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator s opinion&#xD;
             cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the&#xD;
             patient s ability to tolerate this therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy&#xD;
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients has an active infection or serious intercurrent medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients has any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug&#xD;
             metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must not be on enzyme inducing anti-convulsants. If patients were previously&#xD;
             on EIAEDs and these have been discontinued, patients must have been off the agent for&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks prior to first study drug administration. For patients who need to&#xD;
             start an AED or the AED needs to be changed, it is strongly recommended that all&#xD;
             efforts should be made to use a non-EIAED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other&#xD;
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Symptomatic&#xD;
