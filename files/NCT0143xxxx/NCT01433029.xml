    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to develop a method of rating videos of CAB procedures&#xD;
      that will produce a reliable assessment of a cardiothoracic surgical trainee's technical&#xD;
      proficiency. In addition, researchers also want to learn if using a video manual to train&#xD;
      raters can help improve rater reliability.&#xD;

      Cardiothoracic Surgeon:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive a DVD containing multiple videos of&#xD;
      different surgeons or surgical trainees performing CAB procedures. You will be trained by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI) on how you should rate the performance of each surgeon/trainee.&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in the Conventional Rater (CR) Group, you will receive conventional training&#xD;
           from the PI about how to rate the videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in the Video Rater (VR) Group, you will receive conventional training from&#xD;
           the PI about how to rate the videos. You will also receive a video rater training&#xD;
           manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive up to 38 different recorded procedures while you are on study. Each&#xD;
      procedure should last about 15 minutes. You will record the identification code that appears&#xD;
      at the beginning of each video, and the date and time that you viewed each video. You will&#xD;
      watch each video and then rate the performance of the surgeon/trainee using a checklist and a&#xD;
      Global Rating Scale. These rating documents will be given to you on a thumb drive that you&#xD;
      will either fill out on your computer or print out and fill in by hand. You will be given&#xD;
      more detailed instructions on how to fill out the checklist and rating scales by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your identity will be coded and blinded throughout the study. No identifying information will&#xD;
      be directly linked to your responses. Only the video identification numbers and your code&#xD;
      number will be used to identify the assessment data. The code key will be stored in a&#xD;
      separate computer or thumb drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have 1 month to view and rate all videos. You will be contacted 1 time each week by&#xD;
      the PI to monitor your progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have watched and rated all the videos, you will return the videos, your responses&#xD;
      (either on the thumb drive or on printed hard-copies), and the video rater training manual&#xD;
      (if you are in the VR group) in a pre-paid mailer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 raters may take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiothoracic Surgical Trainee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will fill out a form that asks about your&#xD;
      surgical experience. It will also ask about your age, sex, and initials, but these fields are&#xD;
      optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then use the ProXennon Surgical Headlight Camera System (a small camera that is&#xD;
      mounted in place directly over a high-intensity light that you wear on your head) to record&#xD;
      yourself performing CAB procedures. The main principal investigator (PI) will be present when&#xD;
      the system is being used to make sure that it is set up properly and to collect the videos&#xD;
      when the procedures are complete. No audio will be recorded. Each video will begin when the&#xD;
      dissection of a coronary artery has begun and will end when all manipulation of the&#xD;
      anastomosis is complete. You will record at least 6 separate anastomoses, or at least 2-3&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time taken to set-up the recording equipment will be documented by the PI for each&#xD;
      procedure. After each procedure, a questionnaire will be completed by the intra-operative&#xD;
      personnel (nurses, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, operative surgeon, assistant surgeon) that&#xD;
      contains questions about any interference from the recording equipment. Neither you nor the&#xD;
      intra-operative personnel will be identified in this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videos will be given a code number. The code key will be kept separately from the video&#xD;
      recordings. No identifying information will be directly linked to your videos. Only the&#xD;
      researcher in charge will have access to the code key. This is so the researcher will be able&#xD;
      to link the videos to the form you filled out at the beginning of the study describing your&#xD;
      surgical experience. All data will be presented in aggregate to protect participant identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after you have submitted your last recording&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The ProXennon Surgical Headlight Camera System is an&#xD;
      approved, standard method of recording CAB procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 22 trainees and up to 8 experienced surgeons may take part in this study.&#xD;
