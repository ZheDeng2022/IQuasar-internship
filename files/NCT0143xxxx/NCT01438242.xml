      The purpose of this study is to examine the potential impact of the assay in terms of&#xD;

      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genomind is sponsoring an open label study of Assay Guided Treatment (AGT) using the Genecept&#xD;
      Assay in adult outpatients with Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder. The Genecept&#xD;
      Assay is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory validated test being&#xD;
      researched to determine if having information about genetic variations impacts patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation will examine the potential impact of the Assay in terms of&#xD;
      depression severity as measured by change in CGI scale at 3 months. Secondary measures will&#xD;
      assess change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), Quality of Life Enjoyment&#xD;
      and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) and Zung self-rated anxiety scales at 3 months.&#xD;
      Additional measures include change in clinician treatment and diagnosis decisions and impact&#xD;
      on mediation side effects using the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser Side Effect Rating&#xD;
      Scale (UKU). Participant data will be compared to a matched control cohort to assess the&#xD;
      impact of the use of the Genecept Assay on medication adherence and total claims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of non-psychotic Major Depressive Disorder will be identified.&#xD;
      These patients and their treating clinicians will be recruited. The present study proposes to&#xD;
      enroll 1. Subjects (patients who are identified as eligible) and 2. Clinician study&#xD;
      participants (clinicians who are identified as responsible for the care of eligible&#xD;
      patients). This study will involve the collection of responses from both Subjects and&#xD;
      clinician study participants with the intention of correlating this information to Subject&#xD;
      genetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects and study participants will consent electronically on a secure study&#xD;
      portal. Patients and Clinicians must both consent to participate in order to proceed in the&#xD;
      study. After both subjects and clinician study participants have consent to participate, they&#xD;
      will each be asked to complete an electronic baseline survey. Once the baseline survey is&#xD;
      completed, the clinician will receive the Genecept Assay by mail and will then supervise&#xD;
      collection of a saliva DNA sample during a routine office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, month 1 and month 3, patient Subjects will be prompted to complete surveys which&#xD;
      include questions about their psychiatric symptoms, quality of life and medication side&#xD;
      effects. The 3 month patient assessment will also include a satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, clinician study participants will be prompted to complete a brief survey&#xD;
      containing questions about the patient's psychiatric history and severity of illness, current&#xD;
      treatment regimen and the treatment intentions of the clinician prior to receiving genetic&#xD;
      results. After receiving the results of the Assay, clinician study participants will again be&#xD;
      prompted to complete an online study survey containing questions related to the impact of the&#xD;
      Genecept Assay on treatment and diagnosis decisions. The subject will continue with treatment&#xD;
      as determined by the clinician study participant. At 3 months from baseline, clinician study&#xD;
      participants will again be asked to complete an online survey with additional questions&#xD;
      related to subsequent changes to the patient's treatment regimen and illness severity since&#xD;
      receiving/implementing the results of the Assay.&#xD;
