  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I study of combination therapy with SOM 230 and&#xD;
      FOLFIRI. We will utilize a sequential dose-escalation design to define the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of SOM 230 when combined with standard doses of FOLFIRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug SOM 230, also known as&#xD;
      Pasireotide long-acting release (LAR), in addition to standard therapy of FOLFIRI (5FU,&#xD;
      leucovorin, and irrinotecan) can shrink or slow the growth of gastrointestinal malignancies.&#xD;
      The safety of this drug in combination with standard chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) will also be&#xD;
      studied. The participant's physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory&#xD;
      findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Pasireotide LAR is safe and effective.&#xD;

             implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450&#xD;
             interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study&#xD;
