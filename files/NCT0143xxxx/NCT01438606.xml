    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to an HIV vaccine in&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults. Study researchers will also determine the maximum dose of the vaccine&#xD;
      that participants can safely receive.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many HIV vaccines that are in development use a virus vector to deliver the vaccine into the&#xD;
      body's cells in order to elicit an immune response. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a&#xD;
      vector that has been studied in animals. As an HIV vaccine vector, it has been shown to&#xD;
      prevent disease progression in monkeys infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (SHIV). This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to the VSV-Indiana (one type&#xD;
      of VSV vector) HIV gag vaccine in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. In addition, study&#xD;
      researchers will determine the maximum dose of the vaccine that can be safely tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Five groups of participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled, with each subsequent group receiving a slightly higher dose of the vaccine. Within&#xD;
      each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive the study vaccine or a placebo&#xD;
      vaccine. Study researchers will examine safety data and how participants react to the study&#xD;
      vaccine before enrolling the next group of participants. At baseline and Week 8, participants&#xD;
      will receive two injections of the study vaccine or placebo vaccine-one in each upper arm at&#xD;
      each time point. At the baseline study visit, all participants will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination; mouth examination; a medical and medication history review; and saliva, blood,&#xD;
      and urine collection. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires to assess mental status and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction&#xD;
      and pregnancy prevention. After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in the clinic&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects. For 7 days after the&#xD;
      vaccination, participants will record any side effects in a symptom log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits 3 days and 1 and 2 weeks after the baseline study&#xD;
      visit, at Week 8 for the second vaccination, 3 days and 1 and 2 weeks after the Week 8 visit,&#xD;
      and at Months 5 and 8. Follow-up study visits will include select baseline study procedures.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted annually for 3 years for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
