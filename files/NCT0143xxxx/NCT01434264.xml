  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Energy healing is among the most commonly used forms of complementary and alternative&#xD;
      medicine among cancer patients. There are, however, few studies on the effects of energy&#xD;
      healing for cancer and cancer associated symptoms and none of them are of a volume or quality&#xD;
      that allows reliable conclusions to be drawn. Qualitative studies on energy healing in&#xD;
      Denmark have demonstrated that the interventions are individualized and the expected outcomes&#xD;
      personalized. This research points to the need for a research design that can evaluate&#xD;
      personalized outcomes of individualized treatments and at the same time adhere to general&#xD;
      demands of external and internal validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of energy healing as an&#xD;
      individualized rehabilitative intervention to improve outcomes of personal choice among&#xD;
      persons who have completed a conventional intended curative treatment for colorectal, breast&#xD;
      and prostate cancer. The study is designed as a pragmatic clinical trial with personalized&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study attempts to maximize external validity by using a design that incorporates&#xD;
      important features of energy healing administered in real-life settings: 1a) allowing&#xD;
      participants self-selection to healing and non-healing control, 1b) assessing individual&#xD;
      participant-selected treatment goals, 1c) allowing the treatment to be performed in the&#xD;
      private clinics of the healers. To maximize internal validity similar to that obtained in a&#xD;
      randomized, clinical trial design, the study will 2a) randomize participants to&#xD;
      self-selection and randomized groups of intervention and control; and 2b) supplement the&#xD;
      assessment of personalized treatment goals with assessment of outcomes with standardized&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will account for a number of possible moderators of the effects, including 3a)&#xD;
      socio-demographics and 3b) previous experience with complementary and alternative treatment.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be assessed by questionnaires, physical measurements, data from&#xD;
      administrative registries as well as semi-structured interviews and participant observation.&#xD;
      Possible patterns in the various forms of data will be examined for concordances and&#xD;
      discrepancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the methods will be discussed in terms of their generalizability as a model for&#xD;
      evaluating personal outcomes of individualized treatments with high levels of external and&#xD;
      internal validity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to investigate whether &quot;energy healing&quot; as an individualized form of&#xD;
      treatment can improve personal concerns identified by the individual patient in the MYCaW&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects found will be larger for the primary, personalized, outcomes (MYCaW) than&#xD;
           when assessed with standardized measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that self-select energy healing will experience larger effects for primary&#xD;
           outcomes than patients that randomized to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary, personalized outcomes will change more during the course of the treatment&#xD;
           in the intervention groups than in the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes concern three independent but related areas: (1) Will energy healing have&#xD;
      a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect on secondary outcomes assessed with&#xD;
      standardized, validated instruments, including physical health survey, physical activity,&#xD;
      cancer-related QoL, depressive symptoms, and mood? (2) Will energy healing have a positive&#xD;
      impact on daily physical performance as subjectively described in dairies? (3) Will energy&#xD;
      healing influence participants' subjective experience of their illness and recovery? (4) Will&#xD;
      energy healing influence participants' self-reported burden of late effect after cancer&#xD;
      treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No significant effects of healing on secondary, standardized, outcomes (Physical health&#xD;
           survey, physical activity, QoL, Depressive symptoms, mood) are anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No significant effect on levels of daily physical performance as reported in diaries is&#xD;
           anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants that self-select energy healing will report significantly larger effects on&#xD;
           secondary outcomes than patients randomized to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No significant effect on participants' self-reported burden of late effects is&#xD;
           anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, it is expected that the qualitative analysis will inform whether the energy healing&#xD;
      provides participants with images that are embodied in their perception of self, illness and&#xD;
      recovery and whether this is acknowledged by participants as meaningful for them in the&#xD;
      particular situation in which they are embedded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTEHSES RELATED TO MEDIATION AND MODERATION OF EFFECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of factors are anticipated to mediate and moderate the effects of energy healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of healing will be larger, if participants o report higher levels of&#xD;
           &quot;absorption&quot; (i.e. &quot;openness to experience&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report higher expectations of benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report previous positive experience with CAM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report a positive attitude towards CAM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report prior experience with energy healing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  report faith in God or a higher spiritual power&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  experience a better healer-patient relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those that change their primary selected outcome over the course of treatment will score&#xD;
           higher on the questionnaire relating to the healer-patient relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, it is expected that the qualitative analysis will shed light on whether and how&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants subjectively express a change in their perception of self and illness&#xD;
           corresponding with the healer's recommendations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ritualization of the healing session provides for participants' subjective&#xD;
           acknowledgement of the healer-patient relationship;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative and qualitative data in combination are expected to confirm the following&#xD;
      hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the healer is able to ritualize, orchestrate and 'key' the performance of the healing&#xD;
           ritual by means of stylistic devices as e.g. the burning of incense, music, etc., and if&#xD;
           he/she is a skilled symbol manager, and if the participant subjectively acknowledge&#xD;
           these aspects, the participant will score high on standardized questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a number of issues will be explored relating to the value attributed to the&#xD;
      treatment by the participants. It will be explored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much money are the participants in the intervention groups willing to spend on this&#xD;
           kind of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How far a distance participants are willing to drive to receive this kind of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pragmatic trial allowing healers to adjust the intervention (energy healing)&#xD;
      to each participant and to undertake treatment-related communication as usual. The study is&#xD;
      designed to allow for analysis of the implications of self-selection by randomizing&#xD;
      participants to a self-selection arm and a randomized arm, each arm with corresponding&#xD;
      control groups. Finally, the study design allows participants to identify what they consider&#xD;
      to be their primary outcomes by using open outcome forms and semi-structured interviews in&#xD;
      conjunction with validated, standard measures. In order to encompass the expected variation&#xD;
      in primary outcomes and to investigate the interrelations of different types of outcomes, the&#xD;
      study is designed as a cross-disciplinary investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      125 persons for the treatment groups and 200 persons for the control groups will be recruited&#xD;
      in two ways; 1) Lists of patients who have completed their hospital treatment for colorectal,&#xD;
      breast and prostate cancer within the last 12 months will be extracted from The National&#xD;
      Patient Registry, and, 2) lists of patients who have completed intended curative treatment&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer within the last month will be provided by the involved hospital&#xD;
      departments from the Region of Southern Denmark. All patients considered eligible are&#xD;
      randomized to self-selection arm (SSA) or randomization arm (RA) and mailed: 1) A letter&#xD;
      inviting them to participate in the study, 2) Information about the study and the group they&#xD;
      are assigned to, 3) A baseline questionnaire, 4) An informed consent form, allowing them to&#xD;
      be contacted by the research team and a healer, and 5) A pre-paid return envelope. All&#xD;
      invited persons are then contacted by telephone in order to answer any questions they may&#xD;
      have concerning the study. Persons willing to participate are asked to complete the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and the informed consent form and return these. Persons who are unwilling to&#xD;
      participate will be asked for the reasons and a drop-out register will be established. After&#xD;
      two consecutive reminder calls and no response, a participant will be considered a drop-out&#xD;
      (see Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After allocation of participants to healers, the healers are contacted by telephone and&#xD;
      letter with information on the participants and repetition of the procedure to be followed.&#xD;
      The healers will arrange contacts to the participants who have been assigned to receive&#xD;
      energy healing within two days in order to agree on a date for the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All project procedures will be administered and organized using an encrypted ACCESS database&#xD;
      aligned with the study protocol procedures. Day-to-day data collection activities will thus&#xD;
      be based on computerized enquiries, and all procedural and unplanned events, such as i.e.&#xD;
      patient telephone calls, will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible participants are initially and before the first contacts randomized to SSA and RA by&#xD;
      a centralized, computerized procedure, e.g. the Minim (Minimisation Program for Allocating&#xD;
      Patients to Treatments in Clinical Trials). Stratified; The sample will be stratified&#xD;
      according to type of cancer and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the reception of baseline questionnaires and informed consent form from the group&#xD;
      randomized to the RA, the RA is further randomized to intervention and control groups by a&#xD;
      similar procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline questionnaires will be administrated before first treatment. Additional&#xD;
      questionnaire packages will be administered to the participants 10 days, 10 weeks and 18&#xD;
      weeks after baseline. Additionally, those in the healing intervention groups complete&#xD;
      questionnaire packages immediately before and after their third healing session. For&#xD;
      comparison the control groups complete a questionnaire package 6 weeks after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants from each of the four groups are asked to fill in an activity diary (conc.&#xD;
      activities from sleep to strenuous activity) and time consumption (minutes and hours) during&#xD;
      the day. The activity diary will be completed for seven days at baseline, seven days at week&#xD;
      10 and seven days at week 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative semi-structured interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 participants from each of the two intervention groups and control groups will be included&#xD;
      for qualitative interviews and participant observation. The interviews and&#xD;
      participant-observation will be conducted before and after the treatments and enable&#xD;
      comparison of dispositions and processes of change. Interviewees will be selected to&#xD;
      ascertain distribution in age and previous use of CAM (particularly energy healing). All&#xD;
      interviews will be recorded if the participants are comfortable with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant-observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 participants will be followed with 1 day's participant-observation before the first&#xD;
      treatment and 2 days' participant-observation after the final treatment in settings, which&#xD;
      the patient consider as important domains in his/her life and in the 'returning-to-life'&#xD;
      process. Further, participant-observation will be conducted in some of the clinics involved&#xD;
      in the trial.&#xD;
