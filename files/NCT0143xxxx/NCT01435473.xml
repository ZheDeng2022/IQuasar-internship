  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thromboembolic complications (TCs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgery, resulting in longer hospital stay, increased risk of early and&#xD;
      late post-surgical complications, early reoperation, neurologic and organ damage, and&#xD;
      potentially death. The true incidence of blood clots in pediatric surgical patients is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this study is to further our understanding of TCs, including&#xD;
      quantification, characterization and risk stratification. This study will ultimately allow&#xD;
      the development of effective tools for prevention and early identification of TCs, rather&#xD;
      than focusing on treatment alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is very limited data on TCs associated with cardiac surgery in pediatric patients. The&#xD;
      actual incidence of TCs in this context is not currently known reflecting a lack of clinical&#xD;
      suspicion, reporting biases, and/or the use of inappropriate diagnostic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with disruption of blood flow, platelet dysfunction&#xD;
      and activation, and blood hypercoagulability; all of which are contributing to clot formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All congenital heart defects are associated with blood flow disturbance but some are&#xD;
      associated with more extreme disturbances. The investigators hypothesize that not all types&#xD;
      of CHD repairs will be at the same risk of TCs based on the extent of blood flow disturbances&#xD;
      they cause. The investigators hypothesize that line location, difficulties in line insertion,&#xD;
      including multiple insertion attempts and longer duration of indwelling will be associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of TCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with inflammation and platelet activation, both of&#xD;
      which are potent contributors to blood hypercoagulability: CPB presents a hemostatic&#xD;
      challenge associated with an abundance of pro-thrombotic risk factors and an opposite&#xD;
      presence of pro-hemorrhagic risk factors. The investigators hypothesize that factors&#xD;
      associated with increased platelet activation and inflammation, and in consequence, greater&#xD;
      laboratory values of markers of platelet activation and inflammation, will be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of TCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation system activity in children is immature, hyporeactive and exhibits a high degree&#xD;
      of resistance to heparin and anticoagulation. The investigators theorize that lower levels of&#xD;
      coagulation system activity, presence of high-risk genetic polymorphisms, greater CPB&#xD;
      hemodilution, increased heparin requirement and lower blood heparin activity expressed by&#xD;
      anti-factor X activity (anti-Xa) concentration during CPB and greater requirement for&#xD;
      allogeneic blood will be associated for increased risk of TCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of consensus on clinical and laboratory signs/symptoms of active thrombosis&#xD;
      and on which patients should be routinely screened for TCs. One of the most difficult aspects&#xD;
      in the management of TCs is the fact that many episodes are asymptomatic or have non-specific&#xD;
      symptoms. Creating a risk stratification model including both clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities which could be indicative of TCs in the post-operative period in order to&#xD;
      identify patients who should undergo more targeted screening is the third aim of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many methods of TC management have limited effectiveness while highly effective methods are&#xD;
      often associated with much risk. The use of thrombolytics in children is rare and only&#xD;
      partially effective in many cases. The margin of safety for treatment is thought to be very&#xD;
      narrow; the reported frequency of major bleeding episodes varies from 5% to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of TCs are suboptimal, early surgical and long-term complications for survivors are&#xD;
      frequent. The creation of risk stratification models for suboptimal surgical outcomes, PTS&#xD;
      syndrome and, lower functional health status after surgery will be the fourth and final aim&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
