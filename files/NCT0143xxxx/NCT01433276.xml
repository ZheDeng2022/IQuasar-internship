      Indication: Resuscitation in pts with hemorrhagic shock due to multiple injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, open label RCT in pts. with traumatic hemorrhagic shock in RS Hasan Sadikin&#xD;
      Hospital, Indonesia.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hemorrhagic shock is a cause of death in trauma.Fluid resuscitation to ensure stable&#xD;
      hemodynamics and microcirculation by rapidly restoring circulating plasma volume could be a&#xD;
      cornerstone of managing trauma patients. Excessive fluid accumulation particularly in the&#xD;
      interstitial tissue should be avoided. Hypertonic solution shows promise in restoring&#xD;
      intravascular volume expansion and microcirculation with less fluid infusion in hypovolemic&#xD;
      patients. This study investigated efficacy and safety of hyperosmolar Na lactate(Totilac®)&#xD;
      for resuscitating traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with multiple injuries with grade III hemorrhagic shock and RTS ≥4 received std&#xD;
      initial fluid resuscitation of upto 2 liters of isotonic crystalloid. They also got similar&#xD;
      dose of either hyperosmolar Na lactate or ringer's lactate. Hemodynamic status, fluid balance&#xD;
      and and safety was recorded during the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Trauma is still an important cause of death and disability worldwide.Trauma patients often&#xD;
      experience fluid deficits. In addition to apparent blood loss, fluid deficit might also occur&#xD;
      secondary to generalized alterations of the endothelial barrier, resulting in diffuse&#xD;
      capillary leakage and fluid shift from the intravascular to the interstitial compartment.&#xD;
      Severe volume deficits after trauma result in hemorrhagic shock that further leads to the&#xD;
      decrease of tissue perfusion, especially to vital organs and inadequate delivery of oxygen&#xD;
      and nutrients necessary for normal tissue and cellular function. Subsequently, inadequate and&#xD;
      inappropriate management of hemorrhagic shock frequently results in the development of post&#xD;
      trauma multiple organ failure which increases the morbidity and mortality of the patients.&#xD;
      Consequences of hypovolemic shock (hemorrhagic shock) due to bleeding are one of the major&#xD;
      causes of death in trauma patients. Therefore, fluid replacement to reverse shock and to&#xD;
      restore perfusion to vital organs appears to be fundamental in the management of the trauma&#xD;
      patient, after ensuring an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective control of hemorrhage and adequate intravenous fluid administration to restore&#xD;
      intravascular volume and maintain the tissue perfusion is crucial for saving the patient's&#xD;
      life and resuscitation can exacerbate cellular injury caused by hemorrhagic shock, if&#xD;
      resuscitation is not performed properly. The type of fluid used for resuscitation plays an&#xD;
      important role in this injury pattern. However, when, how and which fluids are ideal in&#xD;
      regards to fluid resuscitation remains controversial. The concept that early, aggressive&#xD;
      large - volume resuscitation by administration of isotonic crystalloids in volumes 2 to 3&#xD;
      times the estimated blood loss has been widely accepted and practiced; it has even became the&#xD;
      standard-of-care adopted by the ATLS for the treatment of trauma casualties (ATLS congress).&#xD;
      In patients with prolonged hemorrhagic shock frequently associated with interstitial fluid&#xD;
      deficits in addition to intravascular blood volume, resuscitation fluids were needed to&#xD;
      replace the intravascular volume loss and replenish interstitial deficits. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that aggressive fluid resuscitation improved survival with better function of&#xD;
      patient's vital organ patient's with less frequent renal failure. However, aggressive fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation can lead to fulminant pulmonary failure &quot;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS)&quot; and appears as an early cause of death after severe hemorrhage. Moreover, it was&#xD;
      observed that aggressive fluid resuscitation in uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock to attempt to&#xD;
      increase blood pressure to normal resulted in increased bleeding from injured vessels,&#xD;
      hemodynamic decompensation, and increased mortality, and led to cellular injury when compared&#xD;
      to no fluid resuscitation or hypotensive resuscitation (permissive hypotension). Therefore a&#xD;
      novel resuscitation strategy that overcomes those issues in the near future is still&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperosmolar solutions of various concentrations (1.8%-7.5%) have been investigated as&#xD;
      resuscitation solutions in vitro, as well as animal and clinical studies, with promising&#xD;
      results. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that small volume of hypertonic&#xD;
      saline solution is able to restore hemodynamics in traumatic shock patients. Small volume of&#xD;
      hypertonic solutions stabilize arterial pressure and cardiac output, improve microvascular&#xD;
      flow (increases renal, mesenteric, total splanchic and coronary blood flow), control&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, with no deleterious effects on immune functions. Moreover, in&#xD;
      hemorrhagic shock models, Hyperosmolar solution has immunomodulatory effects including&#xD;
      attenuation of immune-mediated cellular injury, modulating the post-trauma immune response,&#xD;
      decreasing neutrophil excitation, decreasing inflammation, neutrophil-endothelial binding,&#xD;
      lung damage, and bowel injury. This hypertonic solution was more effective than isotonic&#xD;
      crystalloids in minimizing the inflammatory response (especially neutrophil cyto-toxicity)&#xD;
      and in preventing lung and liver reperfusion injury, as well as in improving intestinal blood&#xD;
      flow. Improved survival rate in traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients treated with hypertonic&#xD;
      solution were reported in several trials. The beneficial effect of hypertonic saline has been&#xD;
      shown related to its hypertonicity characteristic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proprietary solution containing hyperosmolar sodium lactate (Totilac) is a hyperosmolar&#xD;
      solution with a physiological concentration of potassium chloride and calcium chloride.&#xD;
      Totilac with small volume administration during volume deficits in post cardiac surgery&#xD;
      patients improves cardiac output, oxygen delivery, urine output, attenuates metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis and maintains stable hemodynamic better compared to isotonic crystalloid.&#xD;
      Administration of small dose of Totilac in patients with dengue shock syndrome also improved&#xD;
      hemodynamic status and microcirculation. High lactate content in this solution offered more&#xD;
      benefit in shock patients when compared to other hypertonic solutions as lactate has been&#xD;
      known to act as energy substrate in mitochondrion containing cells and can be easily&#xD;
      metabolized in hypoxia. Hypertonicity related effects of hyperosmolar sodium lactate solution&#xD;
      in addition to lactate effect may offer at least similar benefits in hemorrhagic shock&#xD;
      patients, though until now there is no clinical study conducted to prove efficacy of Totilac&#xD;
      in hemorrhagic shock. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Totilac as&#xD;
      resuscitative fluid regimen in traumatic shock hemorrhagic patients.&#xD;
