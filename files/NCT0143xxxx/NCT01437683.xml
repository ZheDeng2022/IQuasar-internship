      The primary objective of the protocol is to study the long-term outcome of a large group of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This outcome is to be described in terms of activity, participation, quality of life,&#xD;
      SOCIO-professional outcome and impact on caregivers, and in relation to health care&#xD;
      provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is to measure the impact on functional outcome of several predictive&#xD;
      factors, and their relative importance on outcome. Our principal hypothesis is that&#xD;
      SOCIO-professional and health provision factors play a major role on long-term outcome,&#xD;
      further even than initial severity of brain injury.&#xD;

      This work represents a part of a larger collaborative prospective study called PariS-TBI&#xD;
      (Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in the Parisian area) financed by the French National&#xD;
      Authority for Health. The PariS-TBI study was undertaken in 2005, to provide epidemiological&#xD;
      data. Patients aged 15 or more were included if they had sustained a severe TBI in the&#xD;
      Parisian area, defined by an initial Coma Glasgow Score (GCS) of 8 or less. During a&#xD;
      20-months period, all consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria were recruited by&#xD;
      mobile emergency services. Data from patients' demographics, injury characteristics, acute&#xD;
      and post acute phase were collected prospectively. Patients were evaluated through a phone&#xD;
      interview at one year post traumatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 504 patients were included, of which 257 were alive at the end of acute care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations of the present work will be undertaken between four and six years after brain&#xD;
      injury for survivors. Patients of the initial cohort will be contacted twice through phone&#xD;
      call or post. Information about this follow up study will be given orally and through written&#xD;
      form. Informed consent of patient or legal advisor will be obtained before setting an&#xD;
      appointment for the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will take place either in the patient's place of living, or in a clinical setting&#xD;
      in the hospitals Broussais, Paris, France or Raymond POINCARE, GARCHES, France, according to&#xD;
      the patient's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trained neuropsychologists will lead the evaluations, during an interview with the&#xD;
      patient and the informal care giver, defined as the person (family member or friend), most&#xD;
      responsible for day-to-day decision making and care for the patient. If a patient refuses the&#xD;
      interview, a short questionnaire will be proposed to him by the neuropsychologist by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and pre-traumatism clinical data will be available from the initial study, as&#xD;
      well as data on type and severity of traumatism, and on evolution during acute care. Early&#xD;
      outcome data include cognitive disability (Dysexecutive Questionnaire), global participation&#xD;
      (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended), and return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessed through the present study will include an evaluation of deficiencies: presence&#xD;
      and importance of motor sequelae, cerebellar dysfunction, visual or auditive deficiencies,&#xD;
      epilepsy, chronic pain. Cognitive deficiencies will be assessed through the Neurobehavioural&#xD;
      Rating Scale-Revised, the Dysexecutive Questionnaire, and a questionnaire of complaints from&#xD;
      the patient and from his informal care giver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities will be evaluated by the Barthel index. Capacity of motor vehicle driving will be&#xD;
      assessed. Participations will be measured globally with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended,&#xD;
      and specifically by a SOCIO-professional integration questionnaire and the BICRO-39 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed through the EuroQoL questionnaire, and a global evaluation&#xD;
      of the patient's quality of life on a 0-10 numeric scale from the patient and from his care&#xD;
      giver. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on patients' pathway and intensity of clinical care will be collected: the clinical&#xD;
      pathway from acute care to home or health care facility discharge, a quantification of&#xD;
      clinical follow up and rehabilitation. The patient's environment (place of living, presence&#xD;
      of informal carers) will be assessed, as well as modality of return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will include data on financial compensations and intensity of formal home&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the quality of life of the informal care giver and an evaluation of the burden of&#xD;
      care will be collected, using the ZARIT questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploitation of this large data base will enable an up-to-date description of the long&#xD;
      term outcomes of severe TBI patients in the Parisian area. It will be used to clarify the&#xD;
      role of several factors on long term activities, participations and quality of life for&#xD;
      severe TBI patients, the hypothesis being that factors directly related to the severity of&#xD;
      the traumatism play a smaller role in long term outcome than SOCIO-environmental&#xD;
      characteristics such as professional category, intensity of rehabilitation care, presence of&#xD;
      informal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be conducted with the R® statistical software. Association between&#xD;
      various predictive factors and outcome (GOSE, BICRO-39, EuroQoL) will be assessed through&#xD;
      UNIVARIOUS tests, followed by multivarious regression models, using a backward selection&#xD;
      strategy to select relevant variables.&#xD;
