      The purpose of this study is to determine a suitable dose of the human norovirus GII.4&#xD;
      challenge pool(CIN-1;031693) that induces illness in approximately 50% of susceptible&#xD;
      subjects that would be useful for evaluation of vaccines and antivirals.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Score at least 70% on a test of understanding of this research study.&#xD;
