  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cardiac abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis are already reported from the 50's, in&#xD;
      studies of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Further studies have shown that these cardiac&#xD;
      changes were caused not only by the myotoxic effects of alcohol, but also are present in many&#xD;
      patients regardless of etiology of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes are characterized by abnormalities of systolic contraction in patients&#xD;
      undergoing physical or pharmacological stress, changes in diastolic function and&#xD;
      electrophysiological changes in a clinical condition known as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      Increased QT interval and the pre-ejection time changes are common in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no studies have evaluated the clinical relevance of changes in the heart of cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients, or their relationship with the prognosis of affected patients. Til now, researches&#xD;
      are based on strict echocardiographic parameters, not including several modern methods of&#xD;
      assessment of cardiac systole and diastole. New techniques, such as two-dimensional strain,&#xD;
      can bring new diagnostic and prognostic information, and it is not reported in the&#xD;
      literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the morphological and functional&#xD;
      cardiac changes in patients with cirrhosis and their prognostic role by evaluating new&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic readings.&#xD;

    <description>Identify the occurrence of adverse events as defined as:&#xD;
death due to liver failure, characterized by development of severe liver injury with impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy in a person who previously had well-compensated liver disease.&#xD;
either upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, characterized by hematemesis (vomiting of blood or coffee-ground like material) and/or melena (black, tarry stools).&#xD;
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, characterized by as an ascitic fluid infection without an evident intraabdominal surgically-treatable source.&#xD;
liver transplant.</description>
