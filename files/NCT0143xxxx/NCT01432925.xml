      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an ulcerative disease endemic&#xD;
      in West Africa. It often leads to functional limitations. Treatment was by extensive surgery,&#xD;
      until in 2005 gradually antibiotic treatment for eight weeks with rifampicin and streptomycin&#xD;
      was added. Observation of Buruli ulcer lesions of limited size during antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      showed that during treatment there is a paradoxical increase of the lesion, with a decrease&#xD;
      of the lesion after week 14. Current WHO protocols advise to decide whether surgery is needed&#xD;
      four weeks after the start of antibiotics. This might be too early in the healing process.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that delay in surgery is safe, and that it results in a&#xD;
      reduction of the number of surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of this study is to compare the need for surgical treatment in standard&#xD;
      timing of surgery at the end of eight weeks antimicrobial treatment with a policy to postpone&#xD;
      surgical treatment until week 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are to study whether postponing surgery leads to less extensive surgery&#xD;
      and a change in frequency of functional limitations;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized for surgery at week 8 after start of antibiotic treatment and&#xD;
      week 14 after start of treatment. Reasons for treating doctors to decide to intervene with&#xD;
      surgery will be according to current clinical practice and will be clearly defined in this&#xD;
      protocol. Standard care of eight weeks of rifampicin and streptomycin will be given. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed and lesional size using acetate sheet recordings will be used&#xD;
      during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with a clinical picture of Buruli ulcer disease confirmed by&#xD;
      diagnostic tests in the districts covered by the Buruli ulcer centers in Lalo and Allada,&#xD;
      Benin. Patients who are pregnant, have a contraindication for general anaesthesia and&#xD;
      children below three years old will be excluded. 130 Patients in each treatment arm will be&#xD;
      included to detect a difference in percentage of patients needing surgery of 20 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome measure is the number of patients healed&#xD;
      without surgery. Secondary outcome measures are the extent of surgery by measurement of&#xD;
      lesional size, functional limitations after the end of treatment and one year after the start&#xD;
      of treatment and the duration of admission.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a clinical picture of Buruli ulcer disease in the districts covered by&#xD;
             the Buruli ulcer centers in Lalo and Allada, Benin, will be included at start of&#xD;
             antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All stages of the disease will be included. Only patients with confirmed disease by&#xD;
             direct microscopy following acid-fast staining or PCR will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients not on the standard treatment of eight weeks of rifampicin and streptomycin&#xD;
             for any reason, will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with macrolide or quinolone antibiotics, or antituberculous medication, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients not compliant with the antibiotic therapy will be excluded as well.&#xD;

&#xD;
