  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a vegetable-based diet, physical activity&#xD;
      program, and stress reduction training will reduce or maintain PSA levels, an indicator of&#xD;
      prostate cancer progression, in men who have had their prostate gland removed following a&#xD;
      prostate cancer diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following surgery or radiation of a primary early-stage prostate cancer (PrCA), one in three&#xD;
      patients will experience an elevation in serum prostate antigen (PSA) within 10 years. For&#xD;
      men whose primary treatment was prostatectomy, a PSA rise virtually always signals the spread&#xD;
      of PrCA. After such evidence of recurrence, the &quot;standard&quot; treatment is medical or surgical&#xD;
      castration. Castration results in reducing the PSA about 85% of the time, but it makes no&#xD;
      difference whether such treatment occurs before or after the appearance of clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of recurrence. This time interval between the first rise in PSA and symptom appearance may be&#xD;
      many years. The most salient fact, however, is that castration does not prolong men's lives&#xD;
      and it is not certain whether it even meaningfully delays symptom appearance in men who&#xD;
      receive the treatment at the first sign of biochemical recurrence. Castration also has&#xD;
      significant side effects including osteoporosis (bone loss), decreased muscle mass,&#xD;
      impotence, and urinary incontinence. Because PrCA is usually a disease of older men, many&#xD;
      will succumb to other diseases before they ever develop a symptom related to metastatic PrCA.&#xD;
      For this large fraction of men, a treatment with deleterious affects on quality of life and&#xD;
      no clear overall survival benefit may not be a good choice. The protocol the investigators&#xD;
      propose will be performed instead of medical or surgical castration, which is not medically&#xD;
      indicated at this point in the course of PrCA. Castration can and will be offered to these&#xD;
      men at the first clinical symptom or sign of metastatic cancer, at which time those men will&#xD;
      come off this study. It also is important to note that if the intervention results in&#xD;
      reductions in PSA then the investigators will offer it to all men who had been randomized to&#xD;
      the control condition initially. The investigators will conduct this randomized study in 60&#xD;
      asymptomatic men who have undergone radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland) as&#xD;
      their primary therapy of biopsy-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and subsequently&#xD;
      have been found to have rising PSA levels, indicating an early recurrence of the cancer. Half&#xD;
      (30) of these men will be randomized to usual care (watchful waiting) and the other half to&#xD;
      an intervention consisting of a vegetable-based diet, program of physical activity timed to&#xD;
      the natural rhythm of the day (i.e., circadian, or &quot;around the day&quot; - basically to timing of&#xD;
      their exercise to improve their sleep cycles), and mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      (consisting of meditation and other stress-reducing techniques). The intervention will&#xD;
      continue for three months, followed by monthly booster sessions for 9 months. Data will be&#xD;
      collected on compliance with the intervention and other factors that could modify the&#xD;
      intervention or confuse our interpretation of its effect. The overall goal of the study will&#xD;
      be to see the effect of making these behavioral and attitudinal changes on PSA levels, an&#xD;
      indicator of disease progression in these men. The therapies the investigators will study are&#xD;
      completely non-toxic and behavioral in nature.&#xD;
