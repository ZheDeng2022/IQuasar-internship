      This prospective, multi-center, single blinded study aims to compare the influence of two&#xD;
      different catheter ablation strategies, on long-term ablation outcome in terms of AF&#xD;
      recurrence and quality of life (QoL) in patients presenting with coexistent AF and AFL. The&#xD;
      two strategies to be evaluated are 1) the ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)&#xD;
      with or without flutter (AFL) ablation (AF ± AFL) versus 2) AFL ablation alone.&#xD;

      Specific Aim: This prospective single blinded study aims to compare the influence of two&#xD;
      different catheter ablation strategies, on long-term ablation outcome in terms of AF&#xD;
      recurrence and quality of life (QoL) in patients presenting with coexistent AF and AFL. The&#xD;
      two strategies to be evaluated are 1) the ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)&#xD;
      with or without flutter (AFL) ablation (AF ± AFL) versus 2) AFL ablation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Ablation of AF ± AFL results in better long-term procedure outcome than&#xD;
      AFL-ablation alone in patients with a documented history of AF and AFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Coexistence of AF and AFL is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Patients&#xD;
      with these arrhythmias experience symptoms such as palpitation which is often described as a&#xD;
      sudden irregular fluttering sensation in the chest, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness and fainting&#xD;
      attacks. These symptoms make the patients anxious and tired and seriously compromise their&#xD;
      QoL (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has emerged as the best therapeutic option in&#xD;
      drug-refractory AF cases and often used as a first-line therapy in AFL (2). Several studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated significant improvement in QoL following catheter ablation (CA) when&#xD;
      patients have either AF or AFL (3-9). However, very little is known about the impact of CA on&#xD;
      QoL in patients presenting with coexistent AF and AFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No standard treatment guidelines exist for coexistent AF and AFL. Determining the best&#xD;
      ablative approach for this type of patient remains a challenge. Roithinger et al (10)&#xD;
      postulated that the mechanism of AFL in patients presenting with both arrhythmias could be&#xD;
      organization of AF to AFL. However, it is not always possible to determine which is the&#xD;
      predominate arrhythmia. In some cases, AFL ablation can eliminate AF and AFL, and is a less&#xD;
      extensive procedure than AF ablation. As the two arrhythmias are inter-twined, it is possible&#xD;
      that AFL ablation alone may be sufficient to cure both arrhythmias. Should an AF ablation be&#xD;
      required at a later date, there is no supportive data suggesting that the second procedure is&#xD;
      associated with additional complications. Therefore, performing an AFL ablation alone does&#xD;
      not expose the patient to any unwarranted risk. (11) Several published studies have reported&#xD;
      on a variety of ablation strategies for different types of AF, to include paroxysmal,&#xD;
      persistent and long standing persistent, with variable results on AF recurrence. (12-16)&#xD;
      Compared to previous studies, the scope of the APPROVAL study is narrowed to include patients&#xD;
      with AF falling into the 'paroxysmal' category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized trial, Wazni et al compared the outcome in PV disconnection alone for AF&#xD;
      versus PV disconnection plus cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for AFL. They concluded that in&#xD;
      patients with coexistent AF and AFL, comparable long-term outcome in terms of arrhythmia-free&#xD;
      existence was observed among patients undergoing either AF ablation only or AF+AFL ablation.&#xD;
      Performance or lack of performance of AFL ablation along with AF ablation, did not&#xD;
      significantly affect the long-term outcome. Therefore, the APPROVAL study allows group 1&#xD;
      patients to undergo the AFL ablation or not undergo the AFL ablation based on physician&#xD;
      discretion, with the belief that an AFL ablation in this setting will not affect the outcome.&#xD;
      Ablation of AFL for the treatment of AF / AFL, followed by anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy&#xD;
      for 3 months is a commonly used approach. QoL assessment focuses on the physical, social and&#xD;
      emotional consequences of illness. The subjective perception of 'illness intrusiveness', and&#xD;
      how the disease burden affects the general well-being are of great interest in this&#xD;
      population.(17) Several standardized questionnaires are available to quantitatively assess&#xD;
      QoL. In this study, 4 of those will be used, namely Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36&#xD;
      (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HAD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare long-term procedure-outcome, following AF with or without AFL ablation versus AFL&#xD;
      ablation alone, in patients presenting with both PAF and AFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, single blind randomized study would enroll 86 patients presenting with&#xD;
      documented symptomatic PAF and typical isthmus dependent AFL that are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Recurrence of atrial arrhythmia: any episode of AF/AT longer than 30 sec will be&#xD;
      considered as a recurrence. Episodes that occur during the first 3 months after the procedure&#xD;
      (blanking period) will not be considered as recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Change in QoL score from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients would be randomly assigned to either AF±AFL ablation (group 1) or AFL&#xD;
      ablation only (group 2). In group 1, AF ablation will be performed in all cases. In addition,&#xD;
      the physician will also perform an AFL ablation if any one of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient demonstrates spontaneous right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter upon arrival&#xD;
           for the ablation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter is inducible anytime during the ablation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient spontaneous converts to right-sided isthmus-dependent flutter anytime during&#xD;
           the ablation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2, all patients will undergo ablation of AFL only. Because QoL could be affected by&#xD;
      a placebo effect of the procedure, the patients will be blinded to their group assignment.&#xD;
      Baseline QoL surveys will be collected for all patients prior to their ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard mapping and ablation techniques will be conducted at the discretion of the&#xD;
      physician, with RF lesions administered at the location determined by the randomization&#xD;
      assignment. This includes pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and ablation of extra-pulmonary&#xD;
      triggers detected by standard mapping procedure for AF (18) and cavo-tricuspid isthmus&#xD;
      ablation for atrial flutter (2). The endpoint of the procedure is defined as the termination&#xD;
      or non-inducibility of AF or AFL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follow-up will last for one year. Following ablation, patients will be discharged on&#xD;
      their previously ineffective AADs which will be continued for 90 days (blanking period). The&#xD;
      blanking period allows time for the inflammatory process to subside. AADs will be&#xD;
      discontinued after the blanking period for all patients. If a patient suffers a recurrence of&#xD;
      an atrial arrhythmia, the primary end point will be met and the AAD therapy may be&#xD;
      administered at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will use an event recorder for 5 months after ablation, and will be asked to&#xD;
      transmit their rhythm every time they experience symptoms compatible with arrhythmias, and at&#xD;
      least twice a week even if asymptomatic. Any episode of AF/AT longer than 30 sec after the 3&#xD;
      month blanking period will be considered as a recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 7 day Holter monitor will be worn at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 month time points after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL surveys will be self-administered at the 3 and 12-month time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not pose any additional risk to the patient. The risks are the same for both&#xD;
      groups and are the same as those for a standard atrial fib or flutter ablation. Per standard&#xD;
      of care, ablation procedures are not scheduled for pregnant patients. A pregnancy test is&#xD;
      routinely performed prior to the ablation procedure to confirm that the patient is not&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no risk associated with study withdraw since the study is collecting only routine&#xD;
      data, and there are no protocol specific follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probability of requiring a repeat ablation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probability of arrhythmia recurrence (AF and/or AFL) after AF ± AFL ablation was reported&#xD;
      to be between 52% [Scharf et al (19)] to 58% [Husser et al (20)]. According to Scharf et al,&#xD;
      the recurrence of typical flutter alone after AF ± AFL ablation was 12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence of typical flutter among patients undergoing AFL ablation alone, has been&#xD;
      reported to be 11% [Bertaglia et al (21)] to 12% [Luca CT et al (22)]. However, the&#xD;
      cumulative probability of recurrence of combined AF and AFL in this AFL ablation only&#xD;
      population has been 50% at 2 years and 58% at 3 years.(21) Therefore, the overall probability&#xD;
      of going for a redo ablation after AF ± AFL ablation compared to that of AFL ablation alone&#xD;
      is not be significantly different (52% vs 50%, p&gt;0.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding risks associated with a repeat procedure, no additional identifiable risks have&#xD;
      been reported for patients undergoing a second procedure (19) (23). However, potential study&#xD;
      subjects will be advised that standard procedural risks would be present with a repeat&#xD;
      procedure. These include cardiac tamponade CVA, esophageal fistula, pulmonary vein stenosis,&#xD;
      bleeding, myocardial infarction, death and injury to the cardiac conduction system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: The subject may not incur any benefit by participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination and power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported success rates from previous studies were used to determine the minimal difference of&#xD;
      outcome (effect size). Published results indicate that the observed success rate (freedom&#xD;
      from arrhythmia) has been 65% in group 1 and 30% in group 2. The sample size necessary to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of 35% for the primary outcome was determined using alpha = 0.05 and&#xD;
      power = 0.80 (beta= 0.20). The minimum required sample size (two-sample parallel design test&#xD;
      for superiority model) for each group came out to be 43 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A central database will be created which will hold all the eligible subjects. Permuted block&#xD;
      randomization method will be used for treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables will be reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The categorical&#xD;
      variables will be reported as number of cases (n) and percentage. The bivariate analyses for&#xD;
      comparing the characteristics across the two study groups will be performed using Student's&#xD;
      t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. A stratified&#xD;
      sub-analysis will be performed for assessing outcome across AF and AF+CTI groups with a&#xD;
      multivariable risk-adjusted model. A two-tailed p value of &lt;0.05 is considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Time series analysis will be performed, using Kaplan Meier test and multivariate&#xD;
      analysis with Cox proportional-hazards model, to compare recurrence at follow-up. SAS 9.2&#xD;
      (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be used for statistical analysis. Statistical testing&#xD;
      will compare Group 1 &amp; 2, as well as provide a subanalysis of Group 1 (with and without AFL&#xD;
      ablation).&#xD;
