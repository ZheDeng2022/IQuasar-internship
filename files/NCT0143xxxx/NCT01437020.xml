    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infection caused by parasites carried by sand flies. The&#xD;
      parasites cause fever, weight loss, and enlargement of the spleen and liver. They can also&#xD;
      affect the blood and immune system. One possible treatment for VL involves an experimental&#xD;
      drug called SCH708980, which may help to prevent the immune system from becoming suppressed&#xD;
      and worsening the VL. Researchers want to give the drug along with AmBisome(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark), which kills the parasites, to see if it is a safe and effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the safety and effectiveness of SCH708980, alone and combined with&#xD;
      AmBisome(Registered Trademark), as a treatment for visceral leishmaniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals 18 to 60 years of who have been diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis in the&#xD;
           past 4 to 5 days, are HIV-negative, and are willing to stay in the hospital for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will come from and be treated at the Kala-Azar Medical Research Center&#xD;
           in Muzaffarpur, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a two-part study. Participants will be assigned to only one part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam; blood, urine,&#xD;
           and stool samples, spleen or bone marrow samples; spleen measurements; a chest xray; and&#xD;
           a heart function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 participants will be separated into two groups: a larger group will have a&#xD;
           selected dose of the study drug followed by AmBisome 7 days later, and a smaller group&#xD;
           will have a placebo treatment followed by AmBisome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 participants will have either the study drug or a placebo plus AmBisome, based on&#xD;
           the test results from the Part 1 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be monitored in the hospital for 30 days, and will have the&#xD;
           following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine and stool samples (day 14)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spleen measurements (days 8, 14, 21, and 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spleen or bone marrow sample (day 30 only). Participants who still have VL symptoms will&#xD;
           give another sample on day 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6 months after the start of treatment, participants will have a follow-up visit with&#xD;
           spleen measurements, blood and stool samples, and possible spleen or bone marrow samples&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis, which can&#xD;
      be fatal if left untreated. The majority of VL cases are found in resource-poor regions,&#xD;
      including India (Bihar), Bangladesh, Brazil, Nepal, and Sudan. VL pathogenesis has been&#xD;
      linked to an overproduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, which can&#xD;
      promote parasite replication and disease progression. Experimental models have shown that&#xD;
      IL-10 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of VL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study has two parts. Part 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalating design to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of SCH708980 used in combination with&#xD;
      AmBisome(Registered Trademark). Part 2 will be a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel design. A total of 50 subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in part 1 of the study. A group of 10 subjects will be observed for 7 days prior to&#xD;
      receiving AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on the 8th day, as part of the control&#xD;
      group. Subsequently, 40 subjects (10 subjects/group) will receive a single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion of SCH708980 (0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) followed by a single IV&#xD;
      infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) 7 days later. The first 2 subjects from&#xD;
      each dose group to receive SCH708980 will be followed for 3 days after the drug is&#xD;
      administered before treatment is initiated in the remaining 8 subjects in that group. Also,&#xD;
      all individuals in each group will be followed for 7 days after AmBisome(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) is administered before the next higher dose-level group is enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Dose escalation will continue to the next dose level unless dose-limiting toxicities occur in&#xD;
      &gt; 20% of subjects in any cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose level of SCH708980 to use in part 2 of the study will be decided 30 days after the&#xD;
      start of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) treatment in the group receiving the highest dose in&#xD;
      part 1. Randomization and accrual for part 2 of the study will begin at this time. The&#xD;
      highest safe dose of SCH709890 (&lt; 20% of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity) will be&#xD;
      administered to subjects, not to exceed 10 mg/kg. Thirty subjects (n=10 subjects/group) will&#xD;
      be randomized to 1:1:1 to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed&#xD;
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (3.75 mg/kg) on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A single IV infusion of SCH708980 (less than or equal to 10.0 mg/kg) on day 1 followed&#xD;
           by a single IV infusion of AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (5 mg/kg) on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A single dose of placebo on day 1 followed by a single IV infusion of&#xD;
           AmBisome(Registered Trademark) (10 mg/kg) on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCH709890 and placebo will be administered over 60 minutes, while AmBisome(Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) will be administered over 120 minutes.&#xD;
