    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by chronic hyperglycemia&#xD;
      resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infantile onset diabetes mellitus is not uncommon metabolic disorder in children, with rising&#xD;
      in the incidence in the last few years. Infants with onset of diabetes mellitus at age less&#xD;
      than one year are likely to have transient or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus or rarely&#xD;
      type one diabetes, all infants with onset of diabetes at less than one year of age need to&#xD;
      undergo genetic evaluation for monogenic diabetes as is most commonly due to activating&#xD;
      mutations in either of the genes encoding the two subunits of the adenosine&#xD;
      tri-phosphate-sensitive potassium channel (potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J&#xD;
      member 11 and adenosine tri-phosphate-binding cassette, sub-family C, member 8) as those&#xD;
      patients will respond to therapy with sulphonylurea lead to good glycemic control and&#xD;
      management of other comorbid factors. Evaluation with auto-immune antibodies may be warranted&#xD;
      in infants with onset of diabetes in late infancy as the chances of type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      presenting in late infancy has been reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic conditions in&#xD;
      childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from large epidemiological studies worldwide indicate that on an annual basis, the&#xD;
      overall increase in the incidence of type one diabetes is around three percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increase in incidence of type one diabetes mellitus throughout the world especially,&#xD;
      marked in young children, Registries in Europe suggest that incidence of type one diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus were highest in the youngest age-group (0-4 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the disease is cellular-mediated autoimmune&#xD;
      destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The triggers for the autoimmune attack are not fully understood, but it is now widely&#xD;
      accepted that both environmental and genetic factors contribute to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strongest gene for type one diabetes mellitus, is located in the major histocompatibility&#xD;
      complex Class II region on chromosome 6, at staining region 6p21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental factors can influence expression of type 1 diabetes and this can be suggested&#xD;
      by the identical twins, when one twin has type 1 diabetes, the other twin only has it 30%-50%&#xD;
      of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that only 10% of those who are genetically predisposed to type one&#xD;
      diabetes actually develop the disease; however, that percentage appears to be changing and&#xD;
      environmental factors may play an increasingly important role in determining risk.&#xD;
