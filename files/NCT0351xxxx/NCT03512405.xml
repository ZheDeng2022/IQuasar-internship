      This phase I/II studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and blinatumomab and to see how&#xD;
      well they work in treating participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back&#xD;
      or has not responded to the treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of combination immunotherapy with blinatumomab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab by evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution,&#xD;
      time course and duration. (Phase 1) II. Determine the recommended phase 2 schedule of&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy with pembrolizumab and blinatumomab. (Phase 1) III. Evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-leukemia activity of combination immunotherapy blinatumomab and pembrolizumab as&#xD;
      assessed by overall response rate (complete response [CR] or CR with incomplete recovery&#xD;
      [CRi]). (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate time to response (CR or CRi) and response duration. (Phase 2) II. Estimate&#xD;
      overall survival and event-free survival. (Phase 2) III. Determine the number and proportion&#xD;
      of patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after treatment of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and blinatumomab. (Phase 2) IV. Determine the number and proportion of patients&#xD;
      who receive pembrolizumab maintenance and the proportion continuing for up to 1 year. (Phase&#xD;
      2) V. Estimate the minimal residual disease rate. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore evolution of T cell subsets at various points in treatment (T naive, T effector, T&#xD;
      effector memory, T central memory, CD4, CD8). (Phase 2) II. Evaluate PD-L1 expression levels&#xD;
      on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts and blasts counts overtime. (Phase 2) III.&#xD;
      Evaluate PD-1/PD-L1 expression on subsets of T cells. (Phase 2) IV. Evaluate the clonal&#xD;
      evolution of leukemic blasts in response to treatment. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 15 of cycle 1&#xD;
      and days 1 and 22 of cycles 2 -5, and blinatumomab IV on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      35-42 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve complete response have the option to receive blinatumomab IV for up to 4&#xD;
      additional cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;
