    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-site phase II therapeutic trial of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and bavituximab in patients with locally advanced HCC. Locally advanced or metastatic HCC is&#xD;
      defined as disease that is not amenable to surgical and/or locoregional therapies. Subjects&#xD;
      must not have received prior systemic therapy for advanced HCC in keeping with the first-line&#xD;
      setting of this study. Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigators and using&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria, will be the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiation on treatment, all patients will sign an informed consent form. Only&#xD;
      patients with histological proved HCC will be eligible for treatment. Tissue, either from&#xD;
      archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples or a new biopsy of a target lesion will be&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study therapy is defined as treatment with both pembrolizumab and bavituximab. Patients will&#xD;
      receive trial treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason. Subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue study therapy after an initial investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1 defined progression&#xD;
      as long as they meet the following criteria: 1) investigator assessed clinical benefit and 2)&#xD;
      subject is tolerating study therapy. Subjects will be discontinued from study therapy upon&#xD;
      the evidence of further progression, defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in&#xD;
      tumor burden from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new&#xD;
      measurable lesions). New lesions are considered measurable if the longest diameter is at&#xD;
      least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15&#xD;
      mm). Any new lesion considered non-measurable may become measurable and therefore included in&#xD;
      the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for&#xD;
      pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at least 15 mm. For&#xD;
      statistical analyses that include the investigator-assessed progression date, subjects who&#xD;
      continue treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progression will&#xD;
      be considered to have investigator-assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial&#xD;
      progressive event irrespective of confirmation on subsequent imaging. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for survival regardless of treatment discontinuation for any reason, unless they&#xD;
      withdraw their consent to be followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase for each patient will begin on the initiation of study drug on Cycle 1&#xD;
      Day 1 (C1D1). Patients will continue study treatment until disease progression (or until&#xD;
      discontinuation of study therapy in patient receiving pembrolizumab and bavituximab beyond&#xD;
      progression), discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the study ends. A&#xD;
      safety follow-up is mandatory at 30 days post the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy, safety, and correlative assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule&#xD;
      of Visits and Procedures (section 6.0). Safety assessments will include hematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, and thyroid tests as well as ongoing evaluations of adverse events. Tumor&#xD;
      response will be assessed radiographically every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks, then every&#xD;
      12 weeks thereafter until disease progression (or until discontinuation of study therapy in&#xD;
      patients receiving pembrolizumab or bavituximab beyond progression), loss to follow-up, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent. Patients with radiological progression using RECIST may continue on&#xD;
      study treatment if in the investigator's assessment the patient is experiencing clinical&#xD;
      benefit and tolerating the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Limiting Toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, enrollment will be limited to 10 patients with no more than two patients enrolled&#xD;
      per week. A safety committee comprised of the investigators and institutional GI Disease&#xD;
      Orientated Team will monitor the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the first&#xD;
      10 patients prior to enrolling the remainder of the trial. The period for evaluating DLTs&#xD;
      will be from the time of the first administration of study treatment through Study Day 28.&#xD;
      DLTs will follow the guidelines provided in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If three or more DLTs occur during this period, enrollment will be suspended and the safety&#xD;
      committee will make a determination of whether to reduce the bavituximab dose to 1 mg/kg.&#xD;
      After the DLT safety assessment period for the initial 10 patients, enrollment may proceed&#xD;
      for the remainder of the trial provided at least one patient has either a complete or partial&#xD;
      response by RECIST 1.1 and patient safety will be evaluated on a regular basis by the&#xD;
      institutional data safety monitoring committee (DSMC). A DLT will be defined as any treatment&#xD;
      related toxicity in the list below that occurs during the DLT evaluation period. Toxicity&#xD;
      that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is&#xD;
      excluded from this definition. The following will be considered DLTs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 4 immune-related adverse events (irAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any ≥ grade 3 colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to grade 1 within 5 days of the initiation&#xD;
           of maximum supportive care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to grade 2&#xD;
           within 5 days of the event despite optimal medical management including systemic&#xD;
           corticosteroids or does not downgrade to grade 1 or baseline within 14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver transaminase elevation &gt;8 x ULN or total bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any ≥ grade 3 non-irAE, except for the exclusions listed below&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition excludes the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 fatigue ≤ 7days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pituitary, and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is&#xD;
           managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement&#xD;
           therapy and the patient is asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any grade&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 infusion-related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid&#xD;
           prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not associated with fever or systemic infection that&#xD;
           improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia will be&#xD;
           considered a DLT regardless of duration or reversibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is not associated with clinically significant bleeding&#xD;
           that requires medical intervention, and improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolated grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs&#xD;
           or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolated grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with clinical&#xD;
           signs/symptoms or findings on imaging consistent with pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival follow-up phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are no longer receiving any study treatments and have experienced disease&#xD;
      progression will enter survival follow-up, regardless of whether they have initiated&#xD;
      subsequent anticancer therapy. Survival follow-up information (by chart review, phone call or&#xD;
      clinic visits) will be collected approximately every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent or study termination.&#xD;
