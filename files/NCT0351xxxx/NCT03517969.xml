    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) and carboplatin with or without&#xD;
      docetaxel works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). M6620 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving M6620, carboplatin and docetaxel may work better in treating patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer compared to carboplatin and docetaxel alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the difference in response rate (either achievement of prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      [PSA] reduction of greater than 50% or radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of the combination of berzosertib (M6620) (VX-970, berzosertib)&#xD;
      and carboplatin as compared to the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the difference in time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group&#xD;
      (PCWG)2 criteria of the combination of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) and carboplatin as&#xD;
      compared to the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe radiographic progression-free survival and progression-free survival by PCWG3&#xD;
      criteria in both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from&#xD;
      baseline tumor biopsy with response to the combination of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) and&#xD;
      carboplatin and the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the safety and adverse events from the combination of M6620 (VX-970,&#xD;
      berzosertib) + carboplatin as well the combination of docetaxel + carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Comparison of overall survival in the two arms of the study. II. Explore response rate,&#xD;
      time to PSA progression, radiographic progression-free survival, and progression-free&#xD;
      survival by PCWG3 criteria in patients who initially receive docetaxel + carboplatin after&#xD;
      crossover to M6620 + carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the relationship with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detected from&#xD;
      baseline circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) with response to the&#xD;
      combination of M6620 and carboplatin and the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin, and&#xD;
      describe alterations seen in cfDNA (and optional tumor biopsy) at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (docetaxel, carboplatin): Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes&#xD;
      and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 or carboplatin alone on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients have&#xD;
      PSA progression or radiographic progression may crossover to Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (carboplatin, berzosertib): Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and berzosertib IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up between 30-42 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with allergy or intolerance to docetaxel, grade 2 neuropathy are allowed on&#xD;
             study, but if randomized to Arm A will receive carboplatin as a single agent (area&#xD;
             under curve [AUC] 5) rather than docetaxel+carboplatin; they must be fit for&#xD;
             carboplatin chemotherapy as determined by the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a lesion (bone or soft tissue) amenable to image-guided percutaneous&#xD;
             biopsy adequate for next generation sequencing (NGS), and planned to undergo core&#xD;
             biopsy after trial registration but prior to cycle 1 day 1 of therapy; confirmation of&#xD;
             adequacy of this biopsy material for NGS is NOT required for initiation of therapy; if&#xD;
             elective biopsies are not being performed at the treating institution due to&#xD;
             preparations or precautions related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this&#xD;
             requirement can be waived on discussion with the trial principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib), carboplatin and docetaxel on the&#xD;
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response&#xD;
             inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of carboplatin and&#xD;
             M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to planned cycle 1 day 1 of study treatment;&#xD;
             patients on an oral anti-neoplastic such as an oral hormonal agent, PARP inhibitor or&#xD;
             oral experimental agent should discontinue &gt;= 14 days prior to planned cycle 1 day 1&#xD;
             of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1), except for grade 2 anorexia, alopecia,&#xD;
             neuropathy, and fatigue, for which resolution is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) or carboplatin; (patients with allergy to&#xD;
             docetaxel will be allowed on study, but docetaxel will be excluded from their&#xD;
             treatment regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving treatment with ototoxic or nephrotoxic medications that cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued at least 7 days before first dose of carboplatin and for the duration of&#xD;
             the study; inadvertent or short-term use on study will not cause a subject to be&#xD;
             ineligible; if a short course of therapy with nephrotoxic or ototoxic medication is&#xD;
             anticipated and required, carboplatin should be discontinued until 7 days after this&#xD;
             course is completed; patients on continuous medications that are potentially&#xD;
             nephrotoxic who have had no evidence of nephrotoxicity from these medications at study&#xD;
             entry are allowed to continue those medicines on trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore,&#xD;
                  concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole,&#xD;
                  itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or&#xD;
                  inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St.&#xD;
                  John's Wort) is prohibited; because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
                  changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
                  reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of; Patient Drug&#xD;
                  Information Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients; as part of&#xD;
                  the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the&#xD;
                  risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to&#xD;
                  be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
                  herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because they do not develop&#xD;
             prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency (HIV)-positive participants with detectable viral load and/or&#xD;
             CD4 count =&lt; 300 are ineligible due to increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; HIV-positive patients with undetectable viral&#xD;
             loads and CD4 counts &gt; 300, and not on interacting antiretroviral therapy may be&#xD;
             eligible after discussing with the principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
