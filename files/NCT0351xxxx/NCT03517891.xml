  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is increasing, particularly among Hispanics. Rapid weight gain during&#xD;
      childhood increases the risk of obesity in childhood and in adulthood, also increasing the&#xD;
      risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. This can be prevented with&#xD;
      interventions during early in life that address multiple risk factors associated with the&#xD;
      early development of obesity. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test an intervention&#xD;
      to promote baby activation and improve their sleep patterns and feeding patterns from birth&#xD;
      to 12 months of age. For this purpose, pregnant women participating in the Special Nutrition&#xD;
      Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program in Puerto Rico will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the control group (usual care within the program) or to the WIC + group (usual&#xD;
      care + intervention). The intervention will focus on age-appropriate physical activity for&#xD;
      children, healthy sleep and limited time on the screen, healthy dietary patterns and growth&#xD;
      monitoring. The content will be delivered with a multimedia approach (web platform, mobile&#xD;
      messages and telephone follow-up). If successful, this intervention could be adopted by the&#xD;
      WIC program in Puerto Rico to help prevent childhood obesity among its participants. This&#xD;
      will help improve the health of minorities and eliminate health disparities among Hispanics&#xD;
      and other at-risk groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infant obesity is increasing in the US, particularly among Hispanics. Rapid weight gain&#xD;
      during critical periods of infancy increases the risk of obesity in childhood, continuing&#xD;
      into adulthood. This could be prevented through multifaceted programs that address multiple&#xD;
      risk factors (e.g., physical activity, sleep, eating behaviors and parental skills). Evidence&#xD;
      on successful lifestyle interventions for childhood obesity prevention often promote a&#xD;
      comprehensive approach delivered at multiple levels (i.e., individual, family, and community)&#xD;
      and delivered through population-level programs. One such program is The Special Supplemental&#xD;
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC serves low-income women who are&#xD;
      pregnant and/or have infants and/or young children, groups that are among those at the&#xD;
      greatest risk of early weight gain. Our long-term goal is to prevent infant obesity through a&#xD;
      structured curriculum that provides a combination of key messages and activities designed to&#xD;
      promote sound parenting skills that support and sustain healthy lifestyle (i.e.,&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate exercises for 'infant activation', sleep and healthy eating&#xD;
      behavior) beginning at birth. The proposed intervention is an integrated novel approach&#xD;
      leveraging current WIC outreach practices and technology for complementing the current&#xD;
      standard of care of the WIC Program. The investigators will assess the clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      of this novel complementary intervention among caregivers of infants (0 and 12 months) who&#xD;
      are participants of the Puerto Rico WIC program through a cluster-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in 20 WIC clinics located within the San Juan Metropolitan Area of Puerto Rico. In this&#xD;
      design, an equal number of clinics will be randomized to the control or intervention arm. The&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention will focus on age-appropriate infant's physical activation, healthy&#xD;
      sleep and sedentary patterns, and healthy diet quality, by improving parenting skills.&#xD;
      Intervention content will be delivered through a combination of technology (multi-media&#xD;
      computer-based platforms and mobile messages) and individual counseling (phone and in-person&#xD;
      follow-up). Participation in the intervention will begin during the last trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy and will continue until the infant is 12 months of age. The investigators have&#xD;
      already tested the information of such an intervention among a small group of 10&#xD;
      mother-infant dyads during their first year of life, with excellent acceptability. Our main&#xD;
      outcome is infant rate of weight gain at 12 months of age. Secondary outcomes include: 1)&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors, such as objectively measured hours of infant movement, sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors and sleep; 2) diet quality score (which includes breastfeeding and amount of intake&#xD;
      of each food group); 3) other feeding practices (i.e. spoon-feeding, addition of foods to the&#xD;
      bottle). The research plan also includes a detailed evaluation of the cost of the&#xD;
      intervention as a modification of the current WIC curriculum.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Cluster-randomized controlled trial in 14 WIC clinics. We will randomly assign 7 clinics to the intervention arm and 7 to control (usual care) arm. The intervention will combine key messages and activities designed to promote sound parenting skills that support and sustain healthy lifestyles beginning at birth until the infant is 12 months of age. Participants will be recruited at the WIC clinics during in the last trimester of pregnancy. The primary, intention-to-treat, analysis will evaluate the effect of the intervention on excessive weight gain and rate of weight gain from birth until 12 months. The intention-to-treat approach will allow us to evaluate the expected effect of adding the proposed intervention to the current WIC curriculum. Secondary analyses will include effects of the intervention on objective measures of infant activation, sedentary behaviors and sleep, diet quality, and feeding practices.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>We will use a random allocation process for each clinic with the exception of the 2 satellite clinics which will be randomly assigned separately to ensure assignment of 1 satellite clinic per treatment arm. Additional attention to the distribution of the satellite clinics is deemed necessary as the flow of participants at these sites differs from other clinics due to extended working hours and location of facilities (shopping malls). Randomization will take into account the number of pregnant participants per clinic as well as breastfeeding statistics as an important determinant of future infant obesity. Changes in clinic location and service hours have been documented during the course of the study to account for operational changes implemented by our community partner in response to extraordinary events.</masking_description>

    <ipd_description>The proposed research will gather data on the effects of a lifestyle intervention to prevent infant obesity: self-reported socio-demographics, lifestyles (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, screen time), health-related variables, compliance to the intervention, anthropometrics, objective assessments of physical activity and sleep and dried blood samples. Dried blood samples will be stored for future analysis, which may include nutritional biomarkers, inflammatory, oxidative stress biomarkers, and epigenetics. Results will be presented to CCRHD and NIMHD Officials regularly. Findings will be reported at Program Project Meetings and other scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. Data will not be disseminated outside the University of Puerto Rico until the established study outcome measures have been published.
