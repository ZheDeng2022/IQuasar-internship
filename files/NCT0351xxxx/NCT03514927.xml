    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well high-intensity focused ultrasound works in treating&#xD;
      participants with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer. High-intensity focused&#xD;
      ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to deliver a strong beam which may target and&#xD;
      destroy a specific part of the prostate, while minimizing damage to surrounding structures&#xD;
      and tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Histologic assessment of cancer kill in the post high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)&#xD;
      needle biopsy and excised treated lobe 2-4 weeks after treatment with HIFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Radiologic assessment of areas suspicious for residual cancer in the treated lobe on&#xD;
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and/or contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)&#xD;
      2-4 weeks post-HIFU (immediately prior to radical prostatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assessment of differences in tumor microenvironment, specifically upregulation of the&#xD;
      immune system, before and after HIFU treatment on both the treated and untreated lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assessment of HIFU parameters needed to achieve dose-escalation, in the event that such&#xD;
      escalation is needed per our study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU PHASE: Participants undergo mpMRI and CEUS pre-HIFU treatment and then CEUS post-HIFU&#xD;
      treatment. Participants then undergo HIFU treatment over 2-2.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSTATECTOMY PHASE: Within 2-4 weeks post-HIFU treatment, participants undergo mpMRI 1-2&#xD;
      days prior to radical prostatectomy. On the day of surgery, participants undergo CEUS prior&#xD;
      to radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean percentage of viable clinically-significant prostate cancer (Gleason pattern 4 or 5) after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by calculating the mean percent of viable cancer tissue remaining after HIFU using two different measurements: histologic examination of excised prostate specimen and histologic examination of post HIFU needle biopsy. Each of these two measurements will be investigated independently using two types of analyses as follows: percent viable cancer in excised prostate specimen and percent viable cells using post-HIFU needle biopsy. Will calculate the mean percent viable cancer across patients along with a corresponding 95% confidence interval based on all 32 fully evaluable patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean detection level of immunological factors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For this will use data collected from IHC on a panel of markers, obtained from both biopsy specimens obtained in the non-treated lobe at the time of biopsy (pre-HIFU) and right before RP (post-HIFU) revisiting them same pre-HIFU biopsy sites. Will compare mean IHC levels of each antibody examined in the pre-HIFU contralateral biopsy to the post-HIFU biopsy obtained from the same site. Mean IHC levels for each antibody will be compared using exact tests and analysis of variance.</description>
