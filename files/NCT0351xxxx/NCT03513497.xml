  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the expression of IFI16 and AIM2 in gingival tissues in an inflammatory&#xD;
      response using an acrylic mouthguard (also referred to as a stent) induced bacteria&#xD;
      overgrowth method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A maximum of 72 Adult subjects will be recruited from the patients, students&#xD;
      and staff at the University of North Carolina, as well as the general population in or near&#xD;
      Chapel Hill NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history, demographics, (height/weight), urine based pregnancy test, vital signs (to&#xD;
      include blood pressures, and pulse) standard dental clinical measures (to include plaque&#xD;
      index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and clinical attachment level), alginate&#xD;
      impressions taken for fabrication of an acrylic stent (mouthguard), 2 gingival biopsies, 2&#xD;
      subgingival (below the gumline) plaque samples, and Scaling Root planing (SRP)/or adult&#xD;
      prophylaxis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 72 subjects will be enrolled. Specifically, a sufficient number of adults 18 years&#xD;
      and older will be screened until 36 healthy (PPC-A) subjects and 36 subjects with severe&#xD;
      periodontal disease (PPC-G) will be enrolled. Eligibility for study participation will be&#xD;
      determined during the screening session. Barring dropout, subject participation will include&#xD;
      1 to 8 visits lasting over a maximum period of 42 days. The last 3 visits (visit 5-8) will&#xD;
      depend on the individual need of the subject for providing SRP. Clinical data and medical&#xD;
      history data will be collected at the screening visit to ascertain eligibility. All subjects&#xD;
      will have dental plaque and a gingival biopsy collected at baseline. Enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      be included in an experimental gingivitis model Stent-Induced Biofilm Overgrowth (SIBO) for&#xD;
      21 days. Individuals will return for safety checks every week during the 21-day period. At&#xD;
      21-days, plaque samples and a gingival biopsy will be collected. For diseased individuals SRP&#xD;
      will initiate during the 21-day visit at the SIBO quadrant. Visit 6 (28 days) will include&#xD;
      the post-biopsy follow up, prophylaxis (for healthy individuals) and SRP (diseased&#xD;
      individuals). Subjects receiving SRP may have 2 additional visits (visit 7 at day 35 and&#xD;
      visit 8 at day 42) for completing the SRP of all quadrants and will be dependent on&#xD;
      individual need. Medical histories, demographics, height and weight, clinical and biological&#xD;
      data described above will be recorded and stored on a secure server located at the University&#xD;
      of North Carolina. Each participant enrolled into the study will have a unique identification&#xD;
      number that has been stripped of any information that could be used by non-study members to&#xD;
      identify the subject.&#xD;

    <description>Customized acrylic mouthguards extended to cover approximately 2 mm over gingival margins will be fabricated for each subject. Stents will form a seal and rest on the gingiva, but will be relieved on the tooth and tissue side except for the occlusal surfaces to avoid disturbing plaque or gingival tissues. Acrylic stents will cover the area in one sextant where no brushing and flossing teeth is to occur for 21 days.</description>
