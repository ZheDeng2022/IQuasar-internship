    <textblock>
      This study is for men and women who participate in the YMCA's Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      (YMCA's DPP) and have been diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There&#xD;
      will be no administration of study drug. The purpose of this study is to see if participation&#xD;
      in the YMCA's DPP will result in weight loss and improvement in the liver in patients with&#xD;
      fatty liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will visit Weill Cornell Medical College's Gastroenterology and&#xD;
      Hepatology clinic to review their medical history, physical examination, complete a survey,&#xD;
      and conduct imaging tests (FibroScan, ultrasound, DEXA scan) for their baseline visit. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected as part of standard practice. An additional blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      for storage. Subjects will complete 9 out of 16 weekly sessions. The YMCA's program will be&#xD;
      conducted at Weill Cornell Medical College Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the YMCA program for about 1 year and an additional 1 year in the&#xD;
      long-term follow-up for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Men and women over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnosed with Non-alcoholic Fatty liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Detailed eligibility reviewed when contacting the study team.&#xD;

    <description>Determine the effect of the YMCA's Diabetes Prevention Program on NAFLD as determined by comparison of liver enzymes pre- and post- program - we'll look at the changes of ALT levels to determine the aforementioned. We will perform these diagnostic tests in order to determine the effectiveness of the 16 weeks of sessions.</description>

    <measure>Determine if Liver Fat via Fibroscan Controlled Attentuation Pattern score has decreased as a result of YMCA program</measure>
    <time_frame>104 weeks from the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the amount of liver fat as determined by Fibroscan Controlled Attenuation Pattern (CAP) score in patients with NAFLD pre- and post- participation in the diabetes prevention program with the YMCA. The CAP range should be 100-400, without any sub-scales reported. Lower values in the range represent less 'fat', making it a better score.</description>

    <description>The Gastroenterologists of Weill Cornell Medical College that are associated with this trial want to implement the YMCA's DPP in the NAFLD population as a structured lifestyle modification/educational intervention. The hypothesis is that the NAFLD patients who complete the YMCA's DPP will also have weight loss and improvement in hepatic steatosis. Importantly, positive results in this New York City-based pilot study would provide a strong rationale for determining whether such a program could be useful to treat NAFLD at established YMCA DPP sites across the country.</description>
