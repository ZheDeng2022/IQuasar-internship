        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be receiving treatment in an ICU or in an acute care setting (e.g.,&#xD;

             likely to be bacterial in origin, as follows (Please refer to Appendix B):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Compelling objective evidence of bacterial infection and a known site of&#xD;
                  infection: Objective evidence would be met with a grossly purulent site of&#xD;
                  infections, Gram stain evidence, confirming a bacterial pathogen from normally&#xD;
                  sterile fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal fluid, etc.),&#xD;
                  having either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater &gt; 12,000/mm3 or &lt; 4,000/mm3 or &gt; 10%&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Current treatment with intravenous antibiotics for the acute bacterial infection (i.e.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction defined by at least one of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  to (≥) 65 mmHg (implies fluid resuscitation alone does not raise MAP to ≥ 65&#xD;
                  mmHg), with onset time being the time of vasopressors are initiated (end of&#xD;
                  surgery if initiated in surgery), with adequate fluid resuscitation defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;

                       perfusion). If vasopressin is used, it must be given in conjunction with&#xD;
                       another vasopressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Respiratory Dysfunction is defined as the acute need for mechanical ventilation&#xD;
                  and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of &lt;250 (or &lt; 200 when lung is the site of infection) with&#xD;
                  onset time being time of intubation prior to first qualifying PaO2:FiO2 (if&#xD;

             of the first blood draw yielding a qualifying result (point of care device INR results&#xD;
             must be confirmed by local laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by platelet count that meets any of the below&#xD;
             criteria, and having an onset at the time of the first blood draw yielding a&#xD;
             qualifying result.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥ 20,000/mm3 and ≤ 30,000/mm3 that upon retesting after platelet transfusion is &gt;&#xD;
                  30,000/mm3 (qualifying at the time of the first blood draw yielding a result ≥&#xD;
