  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess a new biphasic release sildenafil formulation (N4S001), developed by N4&#xD;
      Pharma. The N4S001 tablet contains a total of 100 mg sildenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N4S001 tablet is designed to provide a faster onset of release and a longer therapeutic&#xD;
      window compared to currently marketed sildenafil products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, open-label, four-arm crossover study in up to 12 healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following treatments will be dosed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Visit 1: N4S001 tablet containing 100 mg sildenafil (fasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Visit 2: N4S001 tablet containing 100 mg sildenafil (fed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Visit 3: Viagra film-coated tablet containing 50 mg sildenafil (fasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Visit 4: Viagra film-coated tablet containing 50 mg sildenafil (fed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate release layer of each N4S001 tablet will be radiolabelled to contain 4 MBq&#xD;
      (megabecquerel) 99mTc at time of dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pharmacoscintigraphic clinical study will be undertaken to quantify the scintigraphic&#xD;
      kinetics and extent of dispersion of the immediate release portion of the N4S001 tablet in&#xD;
      the oral cavity, and to measure sildenafil and its main metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil,&#xD;
      in the blood plasma. The study will comprise an open-label, four-treatment crossover study in&#xD;
      up to 12 healthy male volunteers. All subjects will receive four treatments throughout the&#xD;
      study. The initial fast onset release portion of each N4S001 tablet will be radiolabelled to&#xD;
      enable the dispersion characteristics of this part of the formulation to be investigated&#xD;
      in-vivo. The immediate release portion of the N4S001 tablet will be radiolabelled to contain&#xD;
      approximately 4 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) at time of dose (TOD). Blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      at pre-defined times to allow pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of drug absorption of the&#xD;
      N4S001 tablet and of the reference product, Viagra 50 mg film coated tablets. Blood pressure&#xD;
      will be recorded at set time intervals to assess the effects of the N4S001 tablet against the&#xD;
      reference product. Subjects will also assess the taste acceptability of the N4S001 tablet&#xD;
      using a 7-point categorical scale and oral examinations will be completed to assess any local&#xD;
      oral effects of N4S001.&#xD;
