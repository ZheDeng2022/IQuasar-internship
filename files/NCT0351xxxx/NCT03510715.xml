      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab (75 or 150 milligrams [mg] depending on body weight&#xD;
      [BW]), administered every 2 weeks (Q2W), on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)&#xD;
      levels at Week 12 of treatment in children and adolescents with homozygous familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) of 8 to 17 years of age on top of background treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment on LDL-C&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters (eg, apolipoprotein B&#xD;
           [Apo B], non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C], total cholesterol&#xD;
           [Total-C], high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], lipoprotein a [Lp (a)],&#xD;
           triglycerides [TG], apolipoprotein A-1 [Apo A-1] levels) after 12, 24, and 48 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab up to 48 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 10 active centers (which screened at least 1 participant) in 10 countries worldwide. Overall, 20 participants were screened between 31 August 2018 and 4 January 2019, of whom 2 were screen failures. Of the 10 centers which screened participants, 9 centers enrolled at least 1 participant.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) at Weeks 12, 24 and 48: ITT Analysis/On-treatment Analysis</title>
        <description>Adjusted LS means and standard errors were obtained from the MMRM model to account for missing data using all available post-baseline data from Weeks 4 to Week 48 regardless of status on- or off-treatment used in the model (ITT analysis). Although separate analyses of all available data (ITT analysis) and only data collected within a defined time window (On-treatment analysis) were planned, if all values used in the ITT approach were within the on-treatment time window, the on-treatment analysis would be identical to the ITT analysis, thus the results would be identical and a single outcome measure presenting the results for both types of analysis would be provided.</description>

        <description>Tanner stage defines physical measurements of development in children and adolescent based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. Participants were evaluated for pubic hair distribution, breast development (only females) and genital development (only males), and classified in 3 categories as: Prepubescent (defined as a person just before start of the development of adult sexual characteristics), Pubescent (defined as a person at or approaching the age of puberty), Postpubescent (sexually mature or a person who has completed puberty).</description>
