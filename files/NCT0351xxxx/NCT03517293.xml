      AHA and ACSM recognize lack of exercise is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), and other CVD risk factors such as obesity. It is important to note that CVD&#xD;
      is the sixth leading cause of death and children are more likely to be undiagnosed due to&#xD;
      their age and lack of symptoms. Further, according to the CDC, over one-third of children and&#xD;
      adolescents are overweight or obese and at increased risk of CVD. Although many programs for&#xD;
      children aim to decrease CVD risks and obesity few, if any, programs begin the intervention&#xD;
      during prenatal development. Our preliminary findings suggest that regular maternal exercise&#xD;
      improves cardiovascular health (lower heart rate, increased heart rate variability),&#xD;
      normalizes body fat composition, and improves nervous system and motor tone even after birth.&#xD;
      Norepinephrine is essential for fetal development, influences many tissues (heart, nerve&#xD;
      cells, skeletal muscle, and fat cells), and can stimulate growth factors. It is believed that&#xD;
      exercise hormones, such as norepinephrine, released during maternal exercise influence these&#xD;
      growth factors during development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that regular maternal exercise during pregnancy&#xD;
      will improve the health of offspring before and after birth as evidenced by lower resting&#xD;
      heart rate, increasing heart rate variability improved neurological maturation, and decreased&#xD;
      adiposity. We have three specific aims to test this hypothesis through the Enhanced Neonatal&#xD;
      Health and Neonatal Cardiovascular Efficiency Developmentally (ENHANCED) by Mom project (IRB&#xD;
      approved #12-002524). Aim 1 will establish the association between maternal exercise during&#xD;
      pregnancy and the heart health of offspring before and after birth. Aim 2 will determine the&#xD;
      relationship between modes of regular maternal exercise and neonate neurological and muscular&#xD;
      maturation as this relates to health of the child after birth. Aim 3 will elucidate the&#xD;
      influence of different modes of maternal exercise during pregnancy on fetal and infant body&#xD;
      composition as this relates to risk of obesity and CVD disease. These studies will provide&#xD;
      novel insight into how different types of maternal exercise during pregnancy influence the&#xD;
      overall health of offspring. Furthermore, these findings may have significant implications on&#xD;
      the public health as it may provide evidence of pregnancy as the earliest intervention for&#xD;
      attenuating cardiovascular disease risk of children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown alarming increases in some of the major modifiable risk factors for&#xD;
      heart disease (cholesterol, blood pressure, adiposity) in young children. We have previously&#xD;
      found an association between self-reported exercise during pregnancy and improved heart&#xD;
      measures of the fetus and neonate. In addition, a limited number of studies in which exercise&#xD;
      was self-reported have demonstrated improved heart and adipose measures in the fetus or&#xD;
      neonate with effects that persist into childhood. Previous prenatal exercise intervention&#xD;
      studies using a prescribed exercise regimen have demonstrated the feasibility of such an&#xD;
      approach; however, these studies have focused on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes such&#xD;
      as birth weight. At this point, there is a gap in our understanding as to how carefully&#xD;
      controlled, regular maternal aerobic exercise programs may lead to improvements in&#xD;
      cardiovascular and adiposity risk factors in utero and in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this project is that maternal exercise during pregnancy will&#xD;
      improve the health of the offspring. Specifically, the objectives of the research proposed in&#xD;
      this application are to determine the effects of regular maternal exercise on heart function,&#xD;
      adiposity, and neur0motor function of offspring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data gathered will be the first documentation, by direct measurement, of the effects of&#xD;
      maternal aerobic exercise on selected heart and obesity outcomes during the prenatal and&#xD;
      postnatal periods. The potential impact of the proposed research on public health education&#xD;
      regarding heart disease and obesity prevention is of public import.&#xD;
