  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and characterise an imaging strategy for&#xD;
      biology-guided individualisation of the proton therapy plan to improve patient outcome and&#xD;
      quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron-emission tomography (PET) studies reflecting glucose metabolism, hypoxia and&#xD;
      physical changes of proton-irradiated tumour tissues will be performed. Patients with head&#xD;
      and neck cancer will be studied, as these individuals frequently experience recurrences&#xD;
      within the radiation field, often with limited therapeutic options. Severe side-effects and&#xD;
      functional impairment, deteriorating patients' quality-of-life, limited the use of&#xD;
      dose-escalation in recent feasibility studies of photon therapy guided by individual&#xD;
      PET-response. However, proton therapy, currently being introduced in the Netherlands,&#xD;
      improves the precision of radiotherapy and thereby limits the side-effects caused by&#xD;
      irradiation of neighbouring healthy tissues. Therefore, in proton therapy dose-escalation to&#xD;
      improve patient outcome is less restricted by toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using PET-studies of two hallmarks of radioresistance, glucose metabolism and hypoxia,&#xD;
      side-by-side, before and early in-treatment, the predictive ability of both PET-techniques&#xD;
      for local recurrence-free survival will be compared. A treatment plan adapted to the&#xD;
      individual response measured by both procedures and compute tumour-dose and toxicity, will be&#xD;
      simulated, thereby substantiating feasibility of image-guided adaptive replanning.&#xD;
      Simultaneously to biological responses, proton therapy-induced physical changes will be&#xD;
      studied. These atomic changes, dependent on tissue-composition and dose-deposition, are&#xD;
      measurable by PET. It is expected that activation-PET to measure tissue-changes during&#xD;
      therapy, a potential new biomarker of treatment efficacy, toxicity but also accuracy of&#xD;
      treatment plan execution. Activation-PET will be related to earlier-mentioned PET-imaging of&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical-technological project paves the way for an interventional trial of PET-guided&#xD;
      treatment personalisation. Activation-PET will also serve as biomarker and quality control&#xD;
      for proton therapy and support the current development of specialised in-beam PET-technology.&#xD;
      These PET-techniques together will help us to individualise treatment, which is of great&#xD;
      importance for the success and cost-effectiveness of proton therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Proton therapy (PT), currently being introduced in the Netherlands, delivers&#xD;
      radiation dose more conformal than photon radiotherapy, therefore healthy tissue damage is&#xD;
      expected to be lower and at least similar tumouricidal effects are described. This increases&#xD;
      the therapeutic window of radiotherapy which could be used for intensified treatment to&#xD;
      patients prone to locoregional failure. From photon radiotherapy it is known that&#xD;
      stratification of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is possible&#xD;
      using different positron-emission tomography (PET-)techniques. Distribution of tumour&#xD;
      hypoxia, a main cause of resistance to radiotherapy, and glucose metabolic need have been&#xD;
      described. PT, in contrast to photon therapy, results in activation of endogenous atoms in&#xD;
      the irradiated tissues which can be measured using PET and reflect dose deposition and tissue&#xD;
      composition. This provides a unique application of PET in this treatment modality as quality&#xD;
      assurance of proton therapy and potentially as biomarker of tissue response to proton&#xD;
      therapy. The main hypothesis is that early during PT, PET is capable of discerning a subset&#xD;
      of patients with increased risk of locoregional failure with a univariate hazard-ratio of at&#xD;
      least 4.0. At this time point, treatment intensification would still be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether early changes in hypoxia between baseline and in the (end of&#xD;
      the) second week of proton therapy are predictive for time-to-local recurrence in patients&#xD;
      with HNSCC (primary). Secondary objectives include: to compare the role of hypoxia-PET to&#xD;
      more readily available PET of glucose metabolism, to describe spatial conformity between the&#xD;
      PET-scan and the location of the recurrence, to determine the potential of adaptive&#xD;
      replanning based on two-timepoint PET-imaging. In a pilot setting the feasibility of&#xD;
      activation PET in a clinical setting for quality assurance of PT-plans and potential&#xD;
      biomarker of PT-induced tissue changes will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, single-arm, observational cohort study with invasive measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults diagnosed with primary, unresected invasive HNSCC, planned for PT Â±&#xD;
      systemic therapy with curative intent with at least one measurable lesion larger than 2 cm at&#xD;
      baseline (n=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients are asked to undergo one additional baseline 18F-FAZA PET-scan&#xD;
      (hypoxia) at baseline 18F-FDG PET-imaging (glucose metabolism) is already performed during&#xD;
      clinical work-up. Both 18F-FAZA and 18F-FDG PET-scans will be repeated in the (end of the)&#xD;
      second week of PT, unless no hypoxia is witnessed at baseline, then only the 18F-FDG PET-scan&#xD;
      is repeated. In a pilot setting, 10 patients are asked to further undergo activation&#xD;
      PET-scanning immediately after PT in the first, second and last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the percent change in hypoxic&#xD;
      tumour volume between baseline PET and interim PET of hypoxia and the percent change in total&#xD;
      lesion glycolysis between baseline PET and interim PET of glucose metabolism. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Each PET-acquisition will be performed in radiotherapy position using fixation&#xD;
      devices (mould mask). The procedures of PET-imaging of 18F-FAZA (hypoxia) and 18F-FDG&#xD;
      (glucose metabolism) each involve preparation (hypoxia: none, glucose metabolism: 6h fasted),&#xD;
      intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical, a waiting period in solitude (hypoxia: 2 h,&#xD;
      glucose metabolism: 1 h), followed by PET-acquisition (hypoxia: 10-20 min, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism: 5-10 min). Occurrence of infusion-related reactions (e.g. allergy) is highly&#xD;
      unlikely. The radiation burden attached to each of these procedures are 6.8 mSv (hypoxia) and&#xD;
      2.9 mSv (glucose metabolism). The pilot substudy requires immediate transfer from PT-gantry&#xD;
      to scanner followed by a 30-min PET-acquisition three times, resulting in an additional&#xD;
      radiation burden of ~0.5 mSv per procedure. All other procedures are part of clinical&#xD;
      protocol. There will be no individual benefit for enrolled subjects. Financial compensation&#xD;
      for study-related travel expenses have been arranged. However, where possible, each study&#xD;
      procedure will be combined with a regular visit to the PT-facility.&#xD;

    <description>This is defined as the length of time (days) that the patient survives since study registration without any signs or symptoms of locoregional HNSCC assessed by structured clinical and radiological (clinical) follow-up (paragraph 8.5). If at close-out date of the study, there are no signs of locoregional recurrence, the patient will be censored to the date of the most recent follow-up examination. Distant recurrence/progression and second cancers diagnosed before locoregional recurrence and death in absence of locoregional recurrence are not considered events of interest, but will be considered as competing risk events in the analysis of this endpoint. The 2-year cumulative incidence rates will be estimated from the curves and its associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>

        In the Netherlands, 85% of patients that will be treated by PT , which includes&#xD;
        HNSCC-patients, will be selected using a model-based approach (MBA). For every potential&#xD;
        PT-patient an in silico comparison between a PT-plan and XRT-plan will be made to determine&#xD;
        the amount of dose to relevant organs at risk (OARs). Using models of normal tissue&#xD;
        complication probability (NTCP), which describe the relationship between dose and the risk&#xD;
        of complications, the difference in NTCP ( NTCP) between PT and XRT is estimated. Cases&#xD;
        that surpass a predefined threshold and thus are expected to significantly suffer from less&#xD;
        toxicity from PT than XRT, will be accepted for PT and form the base population of this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
