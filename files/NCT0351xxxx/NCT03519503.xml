      General objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of one-year infant prophylaxis using&#xD;
           lamivudine (3TC) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to prevent post-natal transmission&#xD;
           through breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the biological mechanisms involved in postnatal HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the long-term safety of infant prophylaxis using either 3TC versus LPV/r on&#xD;
           child development (growth, somatic and mental health), mortality, adrenal function,&#xD;
           liver function, full blood count and mitochondrial toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the final efficacy data of 50 weeks of infant prophylaxis using either LPV/r&#xD;
           or 3TC, since some mothers may have resumed breastfeeding after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To profile miRNA in breast milk according to maternal HIV status and HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the influence of maternal milk on infant gut inflammation in an in vitro&#xD;
           3D-intestinal model (CACO-2 cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will comprise all ANRS 12174 PROMISE-PEP trial participants who&#xD;
      completed the 50 week follow-up and are not HIV infected. An estimate of 881 mother-child&#xD;
      pairs from the ANRS 12174 PROMISE- PEP will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is structured in two parts. The 'clinical &amp; biological safety' component involves&#xD;
      a cross sectional survey. A clinical and neuropsychological examination of participants will&#xD;
      be conducted. In addition one venous blood sample will be collected to evaluate children HIV&#xD;
      status, full blood count, liver &amp; adrenal function and mitochondrial toxicity. Capillary hair&#xD;
      follicles will be collected from 100 children in Zambia to study their genome integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'mechanisms' component includes biological assays to be conducted on breast milk samples&#xD;
      previously collected from HIV infected, transmitting or non-infected mothers enrolled at ANRS&#xD;
      12174 PROMISE-PEP trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Long term survival, mortality rate, measurements of infant growth (length&#xD;
      and weight), somatic and neuropsychological development of the 5 year old children enrolled&#xD;
      in the ANRS 12174 PROMISE- PEP trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: HIV seroconversion since last PROMISE PEP trial visit, full blood count,&#xD;
      liver function, adrenal function, serum lactate. Number of mitochondrial DNA copies per cell&#xD;
      &amp; percentage of mitochondrial DNA deletion for mitochondrial toxicity. Number of micronuclei&#xD;
      &amp; number of Ɣ-tubulin spot per cell to study genomic toxicity.&#xD;

      Background Besides optimal efficacy, Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV(PMTCT)&#xD;
      strategies must have a very good safety profile (1). Indeed, very large quantities of&#xD;
      children will be exposed to these strategies, and the vast majority of them will not&#xD;
      eventually be infected. Because in utero HIV exposure followed by one year of antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment (i.e at the time of infant embryogenesis and maturation) may have long-term&#xD;
      consequences, such as hampering child development, an evaluation of safety beyond the end of&#xD;
      prophylaxis is necessary to get a comprehensive knowledge of the true benefits/risks balance&#xD;
      of PMTCT strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review of the state of the art identified several knowledge gaps in the current&#xD;
      understanding of Mother To Child Transmission (2). The role of HIV breast milk cell&#xD;
      reservoirs in the HIV transmission through breastfeeding is still unclear. The effect of&#xD;
      immune factors present in breast milk of HIV infected mothers on HIV population dynamics is&#xD;
      also unknown as well as the permeability of infant's gut mucosa and the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      on HIV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANRS 12174 randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00640263)&#xD;
      evaluated 3TC and LPV/r as infant Prep drugs for 50 weeks in HIV uninfected babies at day 7,&#xD;
      with monthly follow-up. In addition, breast milk samples were collected four times during&#xD;
      follow-up with infant plasma and cell pellets collected at weeks 6, 22 and 38, and infants&#xD;
      Dried Blood Spots (DBS) every 3 months. The final results showed that both 3TC and LPV/r&#xD;
      achieved very low rates of transmission with an excellent clinical tolerance and no&#xD;
      difference between arms in terms of efficacy or safety. In total, 1103 infants completed the&#xD;
      final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents a unique opportunity to i) investigate the mechanisms of HIV-1 post-natal&#xD;
      transmission, iii) to assess long-term safety of LPV/r and 3TC and ii) to estimate the final&#xD;
      efficacy of infant peri-exposure prophylaxis (PreP), since some children were still exposed&#xD;
      at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the four ANRS 12174 PROMISE-PEP trial sites, namely East&#xD;
      London (South Africa), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Lusaka (Zambia) and Mbale (Uganda).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Biological safety component At enrolment, children will be assessed for&#xD;
      hospitalisation events since the end of the ANRS 12174 PROMISE-PEP trial, mortality rate,&#xD;
      growth, neurodevelopment, mitochondrial and genomic toxicity, and blood biochemical&#xD;
      parameters such as full blood count, liver function and the level of adrenal hormones. All&#xD;
      biological assays and explorations in this study will be carried out blindly, Mitochondrial&#xD;
      DNA depletion study: DBS will be collected from all children at enrolment. Samples will be&#xD;
      randomized and only 50 samples from Burkina Faso, Uganda and Zambia will be analysed (N=150)&#xD;
      as it give us enough power to detect the statistical inferences within the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genome integrity study:The genome integrity assessment will include 50 children from each of&#xD;
      the two PROMISE-PEP arms selected by randomization. (n=100 in total). The Zambian site is the&#xD;
      only one with the necessary expertise and laboratory equipment for freezing cells. Therefore,&#xD;
      the genome integrity study will only be conducted at this site. As a source of adherent&#xD;
      cells, plucked hairs will be collected and frozen in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assessed through a battery of tests; the Kaufman Assessment Battery for&#xD;
      Children - Second edition (KABC-II), the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second&#xD;
      Edition (M-ABC2), the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA)-visual, the Strengths and&#xD;
      Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ25) designed to evaluate the main neuropsychological domains&#xD;
      considered to be affected in HIV pediatric disease. Children will be evaluated when they are&#xD;
      over 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'mechanisms' component includes biological assays to be conducted on breast milk samples&#xD;
      previously collected from HIV infected, transmitting or not transmitting mothers enrolled at&#xD;
      ANRS 12174 PROMISE-PEP trial. Two studies will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first study will investigate the specific microRNAs found in exosomes present in&#xD;
           breast milk that are linked to regulation immune pathways. We propose to investigate the&#xD;
           different miRNA profile in human breast milk in correlation to HIV status and HIV&#xD;
           transmission. We also hypothesize that the involved pathways on may be linked with the&#xD;
           local mucosal immunity of the mother breast but also with the gut mucosal immunity of&#xD;
           the recipient child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second study will focus on the effect of breast milk effect on the cytokine profile&#xD;
           of infant's intestinal cells. We aim to determine 1/ the enterocyte cytokine profile&#xD;
           exposed to breast milk compounds; 2/ the influence of milk on the transcytosis of&#xD;
           T-lymphocytes, both HIV-infected and HIV negative.&#xD;
