      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diseases related to human papillomavirus (HPV) include warts, lesions, and cancers. ICL is&#xD;
      idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia. People with this rare disease get more HPV-related&#xD;
      diseases than other people do. The diseases are more severe and harder to treat in people&#xD;
      with ICL. Researchers want to see if the vaccine GARDASIL 9 can help people with ICL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of the vaccine GARDASIL 9 in people with ICL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 with ICL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and pregnancy&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral rinse collection. Participants will gargle a small amount of a saline solution,&#xD;
           then spit it into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will separate the&#xD;
           blood and keep some parts for research. The rest will be returned to the participant&#xD;
           through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination for HPV-related disease. Female participants will have a Pap test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect swabs from some participants skin or genital lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 3 doses of the study vaccine over 6 months as a shot in the upper arm&#xD;
      or thigh muscle. They will repeat the screening tests each vaccine visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will record their temperature and side effects for several days after&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have visits after vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 follow-up visits in the 18 months after the last vaccine. They will&#xD;
      repeat most of the baseline tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As observed in other immunocompromised individuals with selective or combined T cell&#xD;
      deficits, the prevalence and morbidity of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease is&#xD;
      increased in patients with idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphocytopenia (ICL). The high burden and&#xD;
      aggressive clinical course of HPV-associated disease in patients with ICL requires the&#xD;
      development of effective preventive measures in this specific population. The protection from&#xD;
      a broader range of HPV types offered by the 9-valent vaccine is expected to be particularly&#xD;
      beneficial in this population. This applies even to patients with a history of type-specific&#xD;
      HPV-associated disease, as this population may remain at a higher risk of acquisition of&#xD;
      infection with new oncogenic HPV types even with increasing age. However, the immunogenicity&#xD;
      of vaccines and in particular HPV preventive vaccines has never been systematically studied&#xD;
      in patients with ICL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a phase 2, open-label study to assess the immunogenicity of the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 9-valent HPV recombinant vaccine GARDASIL 9 in patients&#xD;
      18- through 70-years-old with ICL, irrespective of HPV serostatus, presence of HPV-associated&#xD;
      diseases, or previous immunization with bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine, as well as&#xD;
      healthy controls matched to the ICL patient group for age and gender. The study will take&#xD;
      place at a single site (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD).&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline for history and/or clinical evidence of&#xD;
      HPV-associated disease. Those with a history of or current HPV skin or mucosal disease will&#xD;
      undergo clinically indicated evaluation and be referred for clinical care as needed. We will&#xD;
      administer the vaccine in a population of ICL patients ranging in age from 18 through 70&#xD;
      years old according to the standard 3-dose schedule approved by the FDA for individuals 9&#xD;
      through 45 years of age, with the second and third doses administered at least 2 months and&#xD;
      at least 6 months, respectively, after the first dose. Follow-up visits will occur 1 and 18&#xD;
      months after completion of the vaccination schedule. Blood will be collected at each study&#xD;
      visit for safety and immunogenicity testing.&#xD;
