           1 study site in Tanzania (TZ): 1 site at Mbeya Medical Research Centre (MMRC) under the&#xD;
           National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggest H56:IC31 may be more efficacious if administered while patients are&#xD;
      still on treatment. Following the national guidelines for TB treatment in South Africa and&#xD;
      Tanzania, we will obtain sputum samples from patients towards the end of treatment at about&#xD;
      the same time they are obtained within the national TB control programmes, and if the sputum&#xD;
      is smear negative, the criterion for successful treatment within TB programmes, the&#xD;
      individual will be eligible for randomization and vaccination towards the end of their&#xD;
      six-month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a proof of concept TB vaccine study, HIV positive individuals have been excluded&#xD;
      as it is not yet known what effect HIV infection may have on the immune response to the&#xD;
      vaccine. However, HIV positive individuals are an important population to include in future&#xD;
      studies should efficacy be demonstrated in this study.&#xD;

All unblinded persons must take care to not reveal individual participant treatment assignments to any blinded member of the study team. There is an unblinded contact person at the sponsor's site in order to manage queries from the unblinded site staff or the unblinded monitors in the trial.&#xD;
The study vaccine manager (and designee) should be a designated site team member, such as the study pharmacist. Unblinded site staff must not participate in the evaluation of adverse events.&#xD;
