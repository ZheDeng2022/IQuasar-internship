  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if drinking beetroot juice (BRJ) is beneficial for aging&#xD;
      patients. We hope to determine the effect of BRJ on exercise performance. BRJ improves&#xD;
      exercise performance in athletes and normal people. We are trying to determine if BRJ&#xD;
      improves exercise performance in aging patients. We will be comparing the effects of BRJ&#xD;
      versus the effects of a placebo (BRJ without the nitrates that are naturally occurring in&#xD;
      beets and other similar foods). It is thought that the benefits of BRJ may come from its&#xD;
      natural nitrate content. Although BRJ is available for purchase in grocery stores, for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study it is considered investigational, which means that it has not been&#xD;
      approved as a medical therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts separated by a 14 day wash-out. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either the BRJ or placebo during the first part. During the second part&#xD;
      they will receive the opposite of what they had during the first part. This is considered a&#xD;
      double-blind study, which means neither the subjects nor the investigators will know what&#xD;
      form (BRJ or placebo) a subject is receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit One (Screening) 1-2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the screening visit is to explain all aspects of the study. It will also&#xD;
      determine if subjects can participate in the study. Subjects will provide a complete medical&#xD;
      history and undergo a physical exam. They will have their blood drawn (about 1.5 teaspoons)&#xD;
      and provide a urine sample. They will also practice the entire neuromuscular function&#xD;
      exercise test. During this test, the strength of their muscles will be determined by having&#xD;
      them kick, push and/or pull back as hard as you can while their leg is strapped to an&#xD;
      exercise device. A vital signs monitor will measure your blood pressure, heart rate, and&#xD;
      rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the remainder of the study subjects will be instructed to consume their normal diet.&#xD;
      However, they will be asked to avoid eating foods high in nitrate such as beets, spinach, and&#xD;
      collard greens the evening before each visit. They will be asked to refrain from the use of&#xD;
      antibacterial mouthwash, such as Listerine or Cepacol, during the study. Chewing gum,&#xD;
      alcohol, and food and drinks containing caffeine (coffee, tea, chocolate, and soft drinks)&#xD;
      should be avoided 24 hours prior to each visit. They will be asked to fast for 12 hour prior&#xD;
      to each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Two - Approximately 5 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of this visit a catheter (small, flexible, sterile plastic tube) will be&#xD;
      placed through a vein in one of the subject's arms. This is for collection of blood samples.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn four times during this visit. Each draw will be 6 mL or about 1.2&#xD;
      teaspoons. The first blood draw will check nitrate and nitrite levels. They will then have a&#xD;
      breath test to check nitric oxide. They will then drink 140 mL (about 2/3 of a cup) of BRJ&#xD;
      (or placebo). Blood and breath samples will be obtained every hour. Heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be measured at the same times the blood and breath samples are obtained.&#xD;
      Subjects will then rest quietly in a private room for about 2 hours after ingestion of BRJ&#xD;
      (or placebo) then will perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neuromuscular function test that was practiced during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing the exercise test they will undergo a muscle biopsy of their thigh&#xD;
           muscle. First, the area will be sterilized and numbed with an injection. Next, a small&#xD;
           incision (about ¼ inch) will be made and a small biopsy needle will be used to collect a&#xD;
           small sample of your muscle (about the size of a pencil eraser). This will be performed&#xD;
           on the leg opposite of that used during the neuromuscular test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One final blood and breath sample will then be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will then be provided a 7 day supply of BRJ (or placebo) and will continue to&#xD;
           drink two bottles (about 5 oz) every morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will also be provided with an activity tracker. This will be worn at the hip&#xD;
           during all waking hours except when bathing or swimming. This monitor will measure total&#xD;
           activity time and sedentary time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Three - 1-2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the research center with the empty BRJ bottles. At this visit a&#xD;
      single blood (1.2 teaspoon) and breath sample will be collected. Subjects will then complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire to rate how tired they felt during the previous week. They will be provided&#xD;
      another 7 day supply of BRJ (or placebo) and will continue to drink two bottles every&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Four - Approximately 5 hours Subjects will return to the research center and&#xD;
      undergo the same procedures as they did in Study Visit Two. They will also complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire that will rate how tired they felt during the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout After visit four subjects will undergo a 14 day washout period where they will not&#xD;
      drink the BRJ (or placebo). There are no dietary restrictions at this time; subjects may&#xD;
      consume caffeine, alcohol, gum, mouthwash, etc. Subjects will then repeat Study Visits Two,&#xD;
      Three, and Four again. However, during this they will be given the opposite form of BRJ you&#xD;
      had received before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Five Subjects will repeat the procedures completed during Study Visit Two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Six Subjects will repeat the procedures completed during Study Visit Three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Seven Subjects will repeat the procedures completed during Study Visit Four.&#xD;
