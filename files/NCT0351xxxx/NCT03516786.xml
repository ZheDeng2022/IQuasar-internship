  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the recovery after cesarean section in&#xD;
      patients who will receive Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) as a part of multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      using Postoperative quality of recovery scale.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several researchers had evaluated the effectiveness of QLB in controlling postoperative pain&#xD;
      in different patient populations. In these studies, the effectiveness of the QLB was mainly&#xD;
      assessed by postoperative pain scores and analgesia consumption, rather than adapting any of&#xD;
      the more comprehensive recovery scales .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative quality of recovery scale (PostopQRS) is a relatively new recovery score, which&#xD;
      was first published on 2010, and was designed to be a tool for assessment of multiple domains&#xD;
      in recovery. In this assessment tool, recovery was defined as return to the pre-surgery base&#xD;
      line scores or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the recovery after cesarean section in&#xD;
      patients who will receive Quadratus Lumborum Block QLB as a part of multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      using Postoperative quality of recovery scale.&#xD;
