  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between daily&#xD;
      consumption of NRPT, over a six-month (26-week) period, and changes in liver fat&#xD;
      accumulation, compared to placebo and change from Baseline in healthy volunteers. In&#xD;
      addition, an exploratory assessment of markers of inflammation and liver fat metabolism will&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
