  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease, stroke and TBI are frequently observed brain disorders, causing&#xD;
      significant morbidity. For none of these disorders, there are in vivo diagnostic biomarkers&#xD;
      available that allow determination of disease burden, patient-specific prognosis and therapy&#xD;
      follow-up. However, they all share a similar mechanism that may cause accumulation of tau&#xD;
      oligomers in the brain, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive and/or behavioral impairment.&#xD;
      Until recently, the only way to quantify synaptic density and tau deposition was using&#xD;
      post-mortem immunohistochemistry. Now, in vivo Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of&#xD;
      synaptic density has become possible trough development of 11C-UCB-J, a levetiracetam-based&#xD;
      radioligand, expressing high affinity and specificity for SV2A. Furthermore, the novel&#xD;
      radioligand 18F-MK-6240, specifically targeting tau deposits, was clinically implemented in&#xD;
      our center. Through PET-MR, we can visualize the cascade of tau deposition, synaptic loss and&#xD;
      degeneration of grey and white matter and relate these pathologic features to cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral deterioration. The goal of the study is to: 1) measure tau deposition and loss of&#xD;
      synaptic density in these conditions as a potential measure for disease load 2) determination&#xD;
      of the mid-term (2 years) monitoring capacity of combined functional-structural PET-MR&#xD;
      imaging 3) relate progression of the imaging markers to cognitive and/or behavioral decline&#xD;
      and 4) determination of the optimal combination of PET-MR metrics for early identification&#xD;
      and risk-stratification of cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction in de novo patients.&#xD;
