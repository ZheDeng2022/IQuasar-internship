      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with HFNC (group&#xD;
      A) compared to administration of oxygen therapy by Venturi mask (group B, standard therapy)&#xD;
      in terms of reaching of endotracheal intubation criteria during acute respiratory failure due&#xD;
      to severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Respiratory rate (RR) at rest ≥30 bpm or presence of respiratory distress&#xD;
      (severe dyspnoea at rest or use of accessory respiratory muscles or abdominal paradox); PaO2&#xD;
      / FiO2 ≤250 during oxygenation with Venturi Oxygenation mask at FiO2 = 50% administered for&#xD;
      at least 60 minutes; Diagnosis of pneumonia as the sole cause of acute respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Randomization: 150 consecutive patients will be randomized either to High Flow Nasal Cannula&#xD;
      Oxygenation (75 patients, HFNCO with flow ≥ 60 L/min and FiO2 to maintain SpO2 ≥ ) or Venturi&#xD;
      Mask Oxygenation (control, 75 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from both groups will be treated with antibiotic therapy according to the IDSA/ATS&#xD;
      2007 guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia and the IDSA/ATS 2016 guidelines for&#xD;
      hospital-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAJOR CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac or respiratory arrest Breathing pauses with loss of consciousness Severe hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability Need for sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINOR CRITERIA (maintained for ≥1h):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction ≥30% of the value of the PaO2/FiO 2 compared to baseline Increased 20% if PaCO2&#xD;
      PaCO2 previous ≥40mmHg Worsening alertness as increased by one degree on the Kelly scale&#xD;
      Persistence or onset of respiratory distress Vital parameters, Kelly scale and arterial blood&#xD;
      gas analysis (BGA) will be performed on admission, and at 1, 24, at 48 hours, at the&#xD;
      achievement of clinical stability, and whenever there is a clinical worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in HFNC arm will continue HFNC oxygenation until clinical stability,&#xD;
      defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body temperature ≤ 37°C and ≥36°C for 24 consecutive hours Good ability in swallowing CRP and&#xD;
      WBC normalization trend than the admission exams Hemodynamic stability Lack of respiratory&#xD;
      distress SpO2 94-98% The primary outcome variable is the proportion of patients who reach the&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation criteria - regardless of the actual intubation rate - within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours of treatment. The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population&#xD;

      1.1 Basic information Pneumonia is still the most important infectious disease in terms of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and is one of the most common causes of hospitalization for acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure. The aim of this trial is to compare the use of High Flow Nasal Cannula&#xD;
      (HFNC) oxygenation versus standard oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemia due to&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Rationale The oxygenation through HFNC allows the use of high concentrations of oxygen&#xD;
      administered by a high gas flow, heated and humidified. This device allows both higher FiO2&#xD;
      and the presence of a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with a greater gas exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Aims OF THE STUDY 2.1 Primary aim The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      of treatment with HFNC (group A) compared to administration of oxygen therapy by Venturi mask&#xD;
      (group B, standard therapy) in terms of reaching of endotracheal intubation criteria during&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia 2.2 Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-day mortality gas exchange improvement in-hospital length of stay adverse events as per&#xD;
      prior&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Design This is randomized, open, controlled, multicenter study 3.2 Number&#xD;
      of patients The sample size is 150 patients. The enrolled subjects will be randomized in two&#xD;
      Arms: Arm 1, intervention, 75 patients treated with HFNC, minimum flow ≥ 60L / min, FiO2 such&#xD;
      as to maintain a SpO2 ≥ 92%, and Arm 2, reference technique, 75 patients treated with oxygen&#xD;
      with Venturi mask, with FiO2 as to maintain a SpO 2 ≥ 92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Duration of the study The estimated time to complete the recruitment of cases is 12&#xD;
      months. Each subject will be followed from enrolment until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Evaluation 3.5.1 Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the achievement of the following endotracheal intubation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one of major criteria Or&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least ≥2 of the minor criteria maintained for at least 1 consecutive hour:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAJOR CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac or respiratory arrest Breathing pauses with loss of consciousness Severe hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability Need for sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINOR CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction ≥30% of the value of the PaO 2 / FiO 2 compared to baseline Increased 20% if PaCO2&#xD;
      PaCO2 previous ≥40mmHg Worsening alertness as increased by one degree on the Kelly scale&#xD;
      Persistence or onset of respiratory distress&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 days mortality after admission. improvement of respiratory exchanges compared to baseline,&#xD;
      rated at 1, 24 and 48 hours and at the achievement of clinical stability with arterial blood&#xD;
      gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rate of adverse events length of hospital stay. 3.5.3 Follow-up At 30 days from admission,&#xD;
      each subject will be assessed, possibly through telephone contact, to determine the status of&#xD;
      life (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDIED POPULATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA 4.1 Examined population The studied population&#xD;
      consists of individuals with pneumonia presenting to the Emergency Departments 4.2&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria (see appropriate section)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. SCREENING PROCEDURES, RANDOMISATION, MASKING 5.1 Randomization The statistician of the&#xD;
      study will make randomization, preparing a list generated by the computer using a special&#xD;
      program. The experimenter center will receive a group of envelopes progressively numbered,&#xD;
      opaque, sealed in order to avoid any opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Masking This study is open, not being justified a possible double masking technique or&#xD;
      sham procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. SCHEDULE AND STUDY PROCEDURES The study is divided into a baseline visit, followed by 1&#xD;
      visit at 1 hour, in the next 24 hours, followed by another visit during the 48-hour and the&#xD;
      last when clinical stability is achieved The patient then will be followed until discharge&#xD;
      and with a visit or a follow-up interview after 30 days of admission to determine the status&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Clinical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      collection of history (prior and concomitant diseases), and any concomitant therapies&#xD;
      complete physical exam only at baseline respiratory symptoms at each evaluation vital signs&#xD;
      during each evaluation dyspnea assessment at every clinical evaluation, using the Borg scale&#xD;
      axillary body temperature (BT) every 8 hours Kelly scale assessment at each evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Laboratory evaluations Unless otherwise specified, the following tests will be performed&#xD;
      on admission, 24 hours and then every 48 hours until discharge criteria are reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBC: (5 mL in EDTA); Biochemistry: blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum sodium, potassium,&#xD;
      glucose, ALT, AST, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), bilirubin, C-reactive protein, albumin (5 mL&#xD;
      whole blood); lactates: performed at baseline and subsequent blood gas controls (3 mL of&#xD;
      whole blood) pregnancy test on the urine sample (only at baseline) The arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis (BGA) with the calculation of PaO2/FiO2 will be performed on admission, at 1, 24, at&#xD;
      48 hours, and at the achievement of clinical stability, and whenever there is a clinical&#xD;
      worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Instrumental exams Routine chest x-ray on admission, as well as whenever a clinical&#xD;
      deterioration occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Examinations plan 6.4.1 Baseline medical exam For each patient it will be made physical&#xD;
      examination and lab evaluation as described previously Then it will proceed to randomization&#xD;
      as indicated in § 5.2. 6.4.2 Treatment period The doctor in charge is free to perform all&#xD;
      measurements, including BGA, as needed to assess the patient's condition. These will be in&#xD;
      the clinic folder but they are not part of the data analyzed for the study, with the&#xD;
      exception of blood gas analysis necessary to determine the minor intubation criteria (§&#xD;
      3.5.1). Such measures will be noted for determination of primary endpoint, but they will not&#xD;
      be used for the measurement of gas exchange trend (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of secondary endpoint, after 24 hours, 48 hours and the achievement of&#xD;
      clinical stability should be measured and recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      vital parameters (BP, HR, RR). The BT is measured every 8 hours with other vital parameters&#xD;
      evaluation of dyspnea using both the Borg scale and the Kelly scale adverse events BGA during&#xD;
      the treatment with lactate measurement (maintaining the HFNC and oxygen therapy with a mask&#xD;
      as defined for randomization) and evaluation of P/F ratio, A-a difference of O2 and arterial&#xD;
      O2 consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hours after randomization there will be rated the severity score the SAPS-II scale and the&#xD;
      SOFA score in case of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 48 hours there will be performed blood samples (CBC, biochemistry, CRP) until the&#xD;
      clinical stability is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intubation criteria are reached, the study must be regarded as concluded. For patients&#xD;
      enrolled in HFNC arm, the ventilatory support therapy using HFNC must be continued until the&#xD;
      clinical stability, considered as the fulfillment of the following clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After attainment of all clinical stability, there will be an attempt to remove HFNC and to&#xD;
      put the patient in Venturi mask, with the same FiO2 as the HFNC used before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step will be considered definitive when one hour after the attempt the SpO2 remains&#xD;
      94-98% and the absence of respiratory distress or FR &lt;25 acts per minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in Venturi group, as soon as clinical stability is reached through the&#xD;
      fulfillment of clinical stability criteria, the successive evaluation takes place at the time&#xD;
      of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4.3 End-study medical examination The visit will take place at the end of the study at the&#xD;
      time of discharge or when intubation criteria will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      vital parameters (BP, HR, RR) respiratory symptoms using both the Borg and the Kelly scale&#xD;
      SpO2 6.4.4 Observations to 30 days or in case of unplanned evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 days of enrolment the patient will be requested via telephone interview of the&#xD;
      subject or of the reference family:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is alive any hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. STUDIED TECHNIQUES The two techniques in this trial are widely known and used for oxygen&#xD;
      therapy, although still lacks a comparative assessment of efficiency in the case examined in&#xD;
      this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. ASSESSMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AIMS 8.1 See appropriate section on Outcome measures 9.&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 Studied population The study population consists of adult and&#xD;
      consenting subjects, from to the ER population diagnosed with pneumonia as the unique cause&#xD;
      of acute respiratory and PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 250 during oxygen with Venturi mask with FiO2 50%&#xD;
      administered for at least 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Study design The study follows the randomized, controlled design vs. standard open&#xD;
      intervention. Randomization is defined by the main statistician. The center receives a set of&#xD;
      disposable sealed envelopes, opaque, prepared by the main statistician in blocks in&#xD;
      accordance with procedures stored by itself. Each subject enrolled will receive the treatment&#xD;
      indicated inside the envelope with the lowest number available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Outcome measures of the study See appropriate section on Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Study hypothesis The study aims to evaluate the null hypothesis according to the&#xD;
      proportion of patients reaching the primary endpoint does not differ in its populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.5 Sample size The aim of the study is the null hypothesis examination, which indicates that&#xD;
      the groups in the two populations are the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the proposed sample of 75 subjects in both the two groups (a total of 150 subjects), the&#xD;
      study has a power of 80% to give statistically significant results. This calculation assumes&#xD;
      that the proportion of subjects that reach the primary endpoint is approximately the 60% of&#xD;
      the control group and that the treatment in question is able to reduce this proportion of&#xD;
      35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6 Patients enrolling and follow-up Overall, it is expected to enrol approximately 150&#xD;
      patients. The estimated duration of enrolment is about 12 months. Considering the period of&#xD;
      follow up of the patients, the expected study duration is approximately 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7 Analysis plan 9.7.1 Primary variable analysis The primary variable is the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who meet the criteria for endotracheal intubation - regardless of the actual&#xD;
      intubation - during the treatment until the achievement of the clinical stability criteria.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population. The proportion of subjects&#xD;
      qualified as a &quot;failure&quot; related to the achievement of the criteria for intubation will be&#xD;
      analyzed by contingency tables (chi-square) accompanied by the confidence interval of the&#xD;
      difference, by the relative risk estimates and by the NNT, if applicable. It may also be&#xD;
      analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of subjects who achieved the outcome at a set time (secondary analysis), if&#xD;
      relevant, will be tabulated by relative confidence intervals for the difference and estimated&#xD;
      odds-ratios for daily intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7.2 Secondary variables analysis The Secondary endpoints include both continuous and binary&#xD;
      distribution variables. The 30-day mortality will be analyzed by contingency tables and using&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression, considering as membership population these three&#xD;
      categories: HFNC, Venturi (if randomized to standard after treatment maintained until the end&#xD;
      of observation) and Mixed (if randomized to standard treatment and subsequently transferred&#xD;
      to HFNC before the observation term)&#xD;
