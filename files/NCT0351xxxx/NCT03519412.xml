    <textblock>
      In this study, MMRd metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who failed standard&#xD;
      therapies will undergo treatment with pembrolizumab, while RAS-extended mutated&#xD;
      MMR-proficient mCRC patients will be tested for o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)&#xD;
      expression (IHC) and then for MGMT promoter methylation. MGMT IHC-negative, promoter&#xD;
      methylation positive patients will be treated with temozolomide (TMZ). Patients progressing&#xD;
      under temozolomide will be tested for tumor mutational burden (TMB) and proceed to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab if TMB is &gt; 20 mutations/Mb. The primary study hypothesis is that tumors with&#xD;
      acquired resistance to temozolomide become hypermutated and are sensitive to pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      Arethusa consists of three different phases - SCREENING Phase, PRIMING phase, and TRIAL&#xD;
      Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SCREENING PHASE: MMR-Deficient (MMR-D) patients will proceed directly to TRIAL Phase&#xD;
           (cohort D) to be treated with pembrolizumab. RAS mutant MMR-Proficient (MMR-P) patients,&#xD;
           instead, are further tested for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene expression&#xD;
           (MGMT) status in tissue (MGMT protein IHC and MGMT promoter methylation). MGMT IHC&#xD;
           negative and promoter methylated patients will proceed to PRIMING phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRIMING PHASE: MMR-P patients showing negative MGMT protein and high levels of MGMT&#xD;
           promoter methylation in tissues will receive TMZ therapy until progression. Two tumor&#xD;
           biopsies will be taken prior to starting therapy and at progression to determine the&#xD;
           mutational load. Patients with a mutational load &lt; 20 mutations/megabase will go&#xD;
           off-study. Patients with a mutational load &gt;20 mutations/megabase, will proceed to trial&#xD;
           phase no longer than week 5 post TMZ-ML.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TRIAL PHASE: Eligible patients, i.e. MMRD patients (cohort D) and patients with a TMZ-ML&#xD;
           &gt; 20 mutations per megabase at TMZ-ML (cohort P), will be treated with pembrolizumab 200&#xD;
           mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease&#xD;
           progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
