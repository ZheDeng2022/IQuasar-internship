  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medicare is requesting outcome data on patients who received Prolaris testing and were&#xD;
      prescribed active surveillance (AS). In order to ensure appropriate patient care, it is&#xD;
      important to understand how this added prognostic information influences the selection and&#xD;
      durability of AS and corresponding clinical outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, this&#xD;
      study will evaluate how frequently men with low disease-specific mortality (DSM) risk based&#xD;
      on Prolaris CCR score and who meet NCCN low-risk criteria initially select AS (AS selection).&#xD;
      This study also will assess how long Prolaris-tested men who initially select AS remain on&#xD;
      this course before proceeding to definitive treatment (AS durability), and whether AS&#xD;
      duration impacts biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis risk in these men. This&#xD;
      retrospective, observational and multi-site study will combine patient CCR scores with&#xD;
      longitudinal clinical data to address these questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, retrospective, observational study in men diagnosed with localized&#xD;
      PrCa who had Prolaris testing prior to the treatment decision. The study will collect&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, pathologic, and Prolaris test data from medical records and Myriad's&#xD;
      Prolaris database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of BCR or metastasis, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first, among Prolaris-tested men who were at low risk of DSM (≤3.2%), who also met&#xD;
      NCCN low-risk criteria, and who were initially treated with AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the frequency of AS selection among all&#xD;
      men who had low DSM risk, as determined by Prolaris testing and AS durability among&#xD;
      Prolaris-tested men with low DSM risk who selected and initiated this treatment.&#xD;
