  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPI) are rarely used in part because of their&#xD;
      design complexity. Although many implementation frameworks do address the importance of EBPI&#xD;
      characteristics, adapting and modifying EBPIs to enhance usability has not been a focus.&#xD;
      User-centered design (UCD) approaches, which have been successful in creating hardware and&#xD;
      software tools that are accessible and compelling to use, have the potential to modify EBPIs&#xD;
      so that they are accessible and compelling to clinicians. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      UCD driven modifications to EBPI usability (target mechanism) will result in enhanced&#xD;
      clinician ability to deliver EBPI elements competently, and that better competence results in&#xD;
      better patient reported outcomes. The investigators will modify Problem-Solving Therapy for&#xD;
      Primary Care (PSTPC) because it is the EBPI used in Collaborative Care (CC). Our aims are to&#xD;
      (1) identify usability problems clinicians encounter with PST-PC (2) create a clinician&#xD;
      driven modification of PST-PC and (3) compare the modified version of PST-PC to traditional&#xD;
      PST-PC on usability, clinician competence and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

      High quality delivery of evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) in primary care&#xD;
      medicine is a function of many variables, including clinician training and ready access to&#xD;
      EBPI decision support. Importantly, quality is also driven by the clinician's ability to&#xD;
      implement the therapeutic elements of EBPIs to fidelity and with competence. Even when&#xD;
      clinicians undergo rigorous training, and find the intervention components useful in care,&#xD;
      clinicians significantly drift from the original protocol because the processes, structure&#xD;
      and elements of care frequently clash with clinician productivity and the shifting needs of&#xD;
      the patient populations they serve. Clinicians in low resource settings like federally&#xD;
      qualified health centers (FQHCs) report that while elements of EBPIs are important, their&#xD;
      design is cumbersome, complex, overwhelming, inflexible, and minimize the nonspecific factors&#xD;
      clinicians feel are crucial for quality delivery of care. In short, EBPIs demonstrate low&#xD;
      usability (i.e., the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve&#xD;
      specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of&#xD;
      use. Although many implementation science (IS) frameworks do address the importance of EBPI&#xD;
      characteristics, adapting and modifying EBPIs to enhance usability has not been a focus. User&#xD;
      centered design (UCD) approaches, which have been successful in creating hardware and&#xD;
      software tools that are accessible and compelling to use, have the potential to modify EBPIs&#xD;
      so that they are accessible and compelling to clinicians. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      UCD-driven modifications to EBPI usability will result in enhanced clinician ability to&#xD;
      deliver EBPI elements competently (target), and that better competence results in better&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes. The investigators will modify Problem-Solving Therapy for Primary&#xD;
      Care (PST-PC) because it is the EBPI used in Collaborative Care (CC). To prepare for a larger&#xD;
      trial to test hypotheses regarding the impact of EBPI usability on uptake, fidelity and&#xD;
      competence, the aims of this R34 are: Aim 1: Discover Phase (3 months). Using iterative and&#xD;
      participatory methods, the investigators will interview 10 clinicians from FHQCs affiliated&#xD;
      with the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WWAMI) region Practice Research&#xD;
      Network (WPRN, a collaborative group of primary care practices to facilitate innovative&#xD;
      community-based research), and observe the clinicians using PST-PC to identify usability&#xD;
      challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Design/Build Phase (6 months) After identification of potential targets, the research&#xD;
      team will work with the original 10 clinicians to engage in a rapid cycle of iterative&#xD;
      prototype development and testing of PST-PC modifications. The build of these modifications&#xD;
      will include the development of intervention prototypes for user testing and refinement with&#xD;
      input from these care managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test Phase (15 months). The research team will test and compare the PST-PC&#xD;
      modification (mPST-PC) to unmodified PST-PC in a small randomized clinical trial (RCT). Six&#xD;
      newly identified clinicians will be randomized to the two conditions; each will see five&#xD;
      patients for a total of 30 patients (15 in each arm) in the trial. H1: Modifications&#xD;
      developed in the Design/Build phase for targets identified in the Discover Phase will result&#xD;
      in better usability compared to traditional PST-PC. H2: Clinicians randomized to mPST-PC will&#xD;
      certify faster, and will deliver PST elements more competently than clinicians randomized to&#xD;
      PST-PC. H3: mPST-PC will be more effective than PST-PC on improving clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      functional disability and change in depression symptoms over time.&#xD;

    <description>This is a four item measure of intervention acceptability, where each item is rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 = not at all acceptable and 5 = very acceptable. each group will be compared on the degree they find the training they participated in acceptable after they complete training.</description>

    <measure>User Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>We will compare clinician ratings of intervention burden of PST and the new intervention 6 months after they certify in their intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The User Burden Scale is a 20-item scale that assesses six domains of user burden: use, physical burden, time/social burdens, mental/emotional burden, privacy concerns and financial burdens. The scale is calculated item measure of perceived burden of use that covers 6 domains: difficulty of use, emotional burden, physical burden, time and social burden, financial burden and privacy. Each item is rated on a 04- scale, with a maximum score of 80 (high burden) and minimum score of 0 (low burden). We will compare the ratings of intervention burden between groups to determine if the new intervention is considered less burdensome than the traditional model.</description>

    <time_frame>We will rate nine therapy sessions per clinician over a six month period.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 20 item scale, where each item rates clinician competencies in the delivery of PST, using a 0 (not competent) to 5 (expert level) scale. Higher scores indicate greater competence. IN this use case, we will be measuring the time to which clinicians receive their first score below 3 (average) on the PST Adherence Checklist</description>

    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>We will compare clinician ratings of intervention usabilty of PST and the new intervention 6 months after they certify in their intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item scale with each item ranked on a five point system of low to high usability. The scale score is calculated by adding the item scores and multiplying by 2.5. A score of 68 or better is considered to be above average usablilty. As score less than 68 s considered to be poor usability. In this study, a score of 80 or more is considered our cut off for high usability. We will compare the two training programs on usability with this scale.</description>
