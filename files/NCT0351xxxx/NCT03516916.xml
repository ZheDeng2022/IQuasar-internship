  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The formation of a colostomy following surgery for rectal cancer changes body image,&#xD;
      challenges patient practical skills and threatens quality of life. As the oncological results&#xD;
      have improved over the last decades the number of survivors from rectal cancer who have to&#xD;
      adjust to a cancer free life in their own homes is increasing. To enable the identification&#xD;
      of the patients with stoma-related reduced health-related Quality of life (HRQoL) in a quick&#xD;
      and reliable way we recently developed the Colostomy Impact Score (CI-score) comprising 7&#xD;
      items of stoma related factors with significant impact on HRQoL. The purpose of the present&#xD;
      project is to perform an international validation of the CI-score and to demonstrate its&#xD;
      applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The construct validity of the CI-score will be studied internationally on crosssectional&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with permanent colostomy after abdominoperineal excision (APE) or&#xD;
      Hartmann's procedure in Denmark, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Turkey,&#xD;
      Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Lithuania, Israel, Portugal, South Africa, Australia and China. This&#xD;
      will be done by testing the CI-score against five anchor questions stoma impact on HRQoL, the&#xD;
      5 Level version og the EuroQol measuer (EQ-5D-5L) and version 3.0 of the Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ&#xD;
      C30 questionnaire v3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the challenges related to having a stoma may vary with different demographic,&#xD;
      socioeconomic and cultural factors. Supplementary data on stoma care, demographics and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status will be gathered to study the impact of patient-related factors and&#xD;
      cultural differences on HRQoL in rectal cancer survivors with an ostomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study has three main aims: 1) To identify demographic and&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors influencing stoma impact and HRQoL, 2) To asses reliability and to&#xD;
      validate the translated and cross-cultural adapted CI score internationally in multiple&#xD;
      different centres, across a variety of patient groups and across cultural, religious,&#xD;
      socioeconomic and physical borders and 3) To investigate if differences in everyday stoma&#xD;
      care and -costs across countries and cultures affect CI or HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International validation will be conducted as a retrospective cohort study on patients with a&#xD;
      permanent colostomy after curative intended surgery more than 12 months prior to inclusion.&#xD;
      Local health care professionals will identify includable patients and register relevant&#xD;
      clinical information on each patient from the hospital chart. Most centres will include&#xD;
      patients from national or regional databases, some will however include conveniently if a&#xD;
      database is not available. Our international collaborators will be responsible for sending&#xD;
      out and collecting the questionnaires and returning the completed questionnaires to the&#xD;
      undersigned. In countries with sufficient internet accessibility and -infrastructure the data&#xD;
      collection will be web based i.e. patients are sent a link to the redcap-database for them to&#xD;
      enter their answers directly. Some centres will employ paper versions of the questionnaires.&#xD;
      In areas with substantial number of illiterates investigator led interviews can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the CI-score is a construct based on a formative model, statistical analysis based on the&#xD;
      Classical Test Theory(CCT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) cannot be applied. However, the&#xD;
      following aspects of validity and reliability from the Consensus-based Standards for the&#xD;
      selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist15-17 can and will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content validity: Comprehensiveness and relevance of the questions in the CI-score have been&#xD;
      ensured with the way of the development of the CI-score with the starting point in a Basic&#xD;
      Stoma Questionnaire developed by an expert group supplemented by patients ensuring that all&#xD;
      possible factors affecting stoma function/impact was included before regression analysis lead&#xD;
      to the seven weighed questions1. After translation and cross-cultural adaptation&#xD;
      face-validity of each translated CI-score will be assessed again by the collaborators before&#xD;
      inclusion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity: This will be tested with hypothesis-testing. Hypotheses regarding mean&#xD;
      differences and expected correlations between scores of instruments are formulated a priori.&#xD;
      Hypotheses on how the CI-score and HRQoL are related to other factors are formulated a&#xD;
      priori. For convergent validation the CI-score will be tested against 5 anchor questions (not&#xD;
      validated) and the EORTC QLQ C30+ the colorectal specific CR29 (validated). Cross-cultural&#xD;
      validity: See translation section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability: For a randomly selected subgroup in each country the CI-score and anchor&#xD;
      question will be administered twice with an interval of approximately 2 weeks. The two&#xD;
      administrations will be independent and both the setting when answering and the forms of&#xD;
      administration will be similar for the individual patient. For ensuring stable patients an&#xD;
      extra question on recent changes in stoma function will be added to the retest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation of the CI-score will be managed by the lead institution with few exceptions&#xD;
      (Turkey, Russia, Israel) and will follow the translation procedure recommended by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization. All translations are produced by a forward-backward procedure. The&#xD;
      latter procedure is performed to ensure, that the original meaning of the concepts is&#xD;
      derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original Danish version of the CI-score has already undergone a professional translation&#xD;
      to English. A professional translation agency will perform the translation of the English&#xD;
      version to languages in the included countries. All questionnaires/Case Report Forms (CRF) to&#xD;
      be filled in by patients will undergo the same translation procedure as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A master version of the questionnaires will be collected into a booklet. On this basis, a&#xD;
      RedCap database will be constructed to allow for direct electronic data entry by patients.&#xD;
      Patient not able to access the web-based system, will fill in a paper version of the booklet.&#xD;
      According to variation between populations in respect to practically illiterate's&#xD;
      investigator lead data collection will be allowed. However, this should be agreed by the&#xD;
      local investigation and the steering group in the planning of the data collection and&#xD;
      included as individual amendment to the final protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity: Convergent validity will be studied by testing the CI-score on&#xD;
      APE/Hartmann-patients against two measures of HRQoL; the anchor-questions assessing the&#xD;
      overall stoma-impact on HRQoL, the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire version 3.0 and the EORTC QLQ&#xD;
      CR29. Construct validity will furthermore be assessed by hypothesis-testing assessing the&#xD;
      direction and magnitude of the expected correlations. Test-retest reliability will be studied&#xD;
      on a subgroup in all included countries. Also, we will include questions on background&#xD;
      demographics, socioeconomic status, everyday stoma care and -costs thereby enabling&#xD;
      investigation of the practical and economic aspect of living with a stoma varying from&#xD;
      country to country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed separately for each country. The correlations between&#xD;
      total CI-score, anchor questions and the EORTC questionnaire results will be calculated for&#xD;
      all participating patients according to the guidelines for the scores. For each CI-score&#xD;
      group (minor CI/major CI) the mean EORTC QLQ C30-score will be calculated, testing the&#xD;
      overall difference of impact on HRQoL between the CI-score groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the anchor-questions, the patients are divided into two HRQoL groups of those reporting&#xD;
      no/minor or some/major impact on HRQoL. Relationship between CI-score and HRQoL group will be&#xD;
      illustrated in box-plot for each country, where we expect statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in median CI-score between the two HRQoL groups. Differences will be tested by&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. A contingency 2 by 2 table will be used to assess the degree of&#xD;
      agreement between the two CI-score groups and the two HRQoL groups. Based on this, the&#xD;
      sensitivity for the score will be calculated for each country. The added questions about&#xD;
      irrigation and stoma-bag change frequency will be compared country-wise. Univariate&#xD;
      regression analysis, descriptive analysis and estimation of impact on HRQoL will be&#xD;
      performed. Test-retest reliability will be evaluated using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient&#xD;
      and Cohens' Kappa.&#xD;
