      This phase I trial studies the molecular profile of breast cancer in Ugandan patients with&#xD;
      stage IIB-III breast cancer. Creating a molecular profile of breast cancer my help doctors&#xD;
      learn more about biological factors associated with breast cancer in Ugandan patients with as&#xD;
      well as measure the benefits of locally available diagnostic studies and the possibility of&#xD;
      providing treatment via oral medication.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIMEN COLLECTION: Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples&#xD;
      for analysis via next generation sequencing to identify novel pathways in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: Patients are invited to participate in a treatment study. Patients receive&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, methotrexate PO QD on days 1, 8, and 15, and&#xD;
      capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Sensitivity, defined as the proportion of women with a particular receptor detected by PCR, among those women who had the receptor detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using IHC as the gold standard. Will also calculate the percent agreement between PCR and IHC, and compute the kappa statistic with 95% CIs to assess receptor status agreement between reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and IHC.</description>
