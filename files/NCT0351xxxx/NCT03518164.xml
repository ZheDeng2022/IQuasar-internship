  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a surgery performed from the front of the&#xD;
      neck in which damaged discs are removed and a bone graft is inserted into the space to allow&#xD;
      the bone to grow together to set up a bridge or fusion between the bones of the spine. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an advantage to using autograft (bone&#xD;
      material taken from the patient's own hip) or allograft (bone material derived from other&#xD;
      sources) when performing ACDF. Both of these materials are routinely used by surgeons in ACDF&#xD;
      surgeries. Neither is experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who participate in this study will be randomized to receive either allograft or&#xD;
      autograft bone for the surgery. They will receive the 2 level ACDF surgeries routinely&#xD;
      employed by the surgeons. The same screw-plate fixation will be used for all subjects in the&#xD;
      trial and the same allograft material will be used for all subjects who are randomized to the&#xD;
      allograft arm of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A determination will be made as to whether there is a difference in fusion rates associated&#xD;
      with the choice of either allograft bone or autograft bone based on the subjects' x-rays one&#xD;
      year post surgery. The study will also determine whether there are differences in clinical&#xD;
      and functional outcomes associated with the choice of bone graft as measured by&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes instruments collected. In addition, the study will examine whether&#xD;
      there are differences in clinical and radiographic outcomes based on choice of bone graft for&#xD;
      the subgroup of smokers participating in the study. Overall hospitalization costs will also&#xD;
      be obtained and compared as an indication as to whether one method or the other may be&#xD;
      superior from a financial standpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized multicenter trial. Approximately 200 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at 12 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Up to 250 subjects may be&#xD;
      enrolled to account for screen failures. Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School is the&#xD;
      coordinating center for the study. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is&#xD;
      an advantage to using autograft (bone material taken from the patient's own hip) or allograft&#xD;
      (bone material derived from other sources) when performing ACDF. Both of these materials are&#xD;
      routinely used by surgeons in ACDF surgeries. Neither is experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a computer randomization program, the central study coordinating site will randomize&#xD;
      subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either the autograft or allograft arm of the trial. Surgery is&#xD;
      then scheduled in the routine manner. The same ACDF surgeries routinely employed by study&#xD;
      surgeons will be performed with screw-plate fixation using the same Medtronic system for all&#xD;
      surgeries. In addition, all surgeons will use the same allograft struts, also be provided by&#xD;
      Medtronic [Cornerstone].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management will be the usual and customary procedures followed by the spine&#xD;
      surgeons participating in the trial. This would include a wound check at some point in the&#xD;
      first two weeks following discharge with clinical and radiographic studies performed at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after the index surgery. Baseline and 1 year&#xD;
      postoperative X-rays will be collected for the study. As the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the&#xD;
      evaluation of fusion is the presence of bridging trabecular bone across an intended fusion&#xD;
      interspace as well as the lack of motion between the spinous processes at the treated levels,&#xD;
      dynamic plain film radiographs in neutral, flexion and extension will be obtained to&#xD;
      determine fusion status. Neuroradiologists will review the subjects' 1 year radiographs. If&#xD;
      these images are unable to definitively clarify whether a fusion has occurred at the 1 year&#xD;
      time point, then CT scan examinations would be obtained as standard of care to make the&#xD;
      determination. Review of these CT scans for the trial would also be performed by a blinded&#xD;
      study radiologist. Sagittal and coronal reconstructed views will be generated. All subjects'&#xD;
      imaging studies will be reviewed by a Board certified radiologist certified in&#xD;
      neuroradiology. The flexion and extension cervical spine radiographs would be obtained to&#xD;
      determine motion between the spinous processes and the presence of bridging trabecular bone.&#xD;
      This will include preoperative and postoperative (1 year) imaging in which the&#xD;
      neuroradiologist will be blinded to the readings of any outside radiologists or surgeons. At&#xD;
      1 year, the neuroradiologist will provide a binomial response of either &quot;fused&quot; or &quot;not&#xD;
      fused&quot;. Partial fusions will be considered not fused for the purposes of this study. The&#xD;
      decision of the blinded neuroradiologist will be final regardless of the surgeon's&#xD;
      impressions of the imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject visits will occur at the patients' standard of care clinical visits at&#xD;
      baseline/screening and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post-surgery. Study&#xD;
      questionnaires and routine physician evaluations will be completed at each of these visits.&#xD;
      X-rays will be collected and reviewed at the baseline and 1 year visits. A CT scan will be&#xD;
      collected at 1 year only in the event that radiographs cannot determine whether fusion has&#xD;
      occurred. Subjects will be monitored for adverse events at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications related to the cervical and the iliac regions will be carefully observed. In&#xD;
      the cervical spine, the complications would include: persistent neck pain, persistent arm&#xD;
      pain, new neurological findings, instrumentation failure, fusion failure, dysphagia, and&#xD;
      voice issues (hoarseness and/or weakness). Specific to the iliac patients, complications&#xD;
      related to pain, bleeding, infection, development of meralgia paresthetica, pelvis fracture,&#xD;
      or other findings related to the iliac harvest would be catalogued. If reoperation is&#xD;
      necessary, this will be recorded on a Report of Second Cervical Surgery as well the reason&#xD;
      for the reoperation. Complications such as graft dislodgement, extrusion, or collapse will be&#xD;
      noted. Instrumentation failure resulting in screw and/or plate fracture will be recorded.&#xD;
      Reoperations for any reason will be identified and specific observation will be made as to&#xD;
      whether a pseudoarthrosis was present as the rationale for the reoperation. In addition,&#xD;
      clarification as to whether surgery was needed for an adjacent segment issue next to a&#xD;
      previously successful fusion will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to concerns with swallowing dysfunction following anterior cervical surgery, all patients&#xD;
      in the study will be evaluated prior to the surgery and at routine follow-up time points with&#xD;
      the Dysphagia Short Questionnaire (DSQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers will be included in the study and their patient-reported status with respect to the&#xD;
      level of use of nicotine containing products will be documented at each visit. All smokers&#xD;
      will be encouraged to quit smoking prior to the surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both disease- specific and general patient outcomes will be analyzed at regular intervals.&#xD;
      Outcomes related to neck pain, arm pain, and neurological abnormalities will be assessed. The&#xD;
      following patient-reported outcomes measures will be administered to subjects prior to&#xD;
      surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, 1 year and 2 years: DSQ, PROMIS-PF, EQ-5D-5L,&#xD;
      NDI, and VAS (arm and neck and iliac crest-if applicable).&#xD;
