    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in patients with the recurrent lesion(s) post-surgery or the&#xD;
      untreated mCRC. After stratification with respect to ECOG PS score, chemo regimen, primary&#xD;
      tumor location and KRAS and BRAF genotype (complete wild-type/primal type), eligible patients&#xD;
      are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive HLX04 (Arm A) or Bevacizumab (Arm B) in&#xD;
      combination with one of the protocol-defined chemotherapies, modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or&#xD;
      XELOX for mCRC until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or achieving an&#xD;
      operable contingency, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
