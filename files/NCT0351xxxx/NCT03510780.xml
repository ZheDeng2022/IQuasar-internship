  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the most positive documented outcomes of periodontal regenerative therapy (PRT) in&#xD;
      intrabony defects (IBDs) have been achieved with a combination of bone grafts ( BGs) and a&#xD;
      regeneration material like membranes in guided tissue regeneration ( GTR) or enamel matrix&#xD;
      derivative (EMD) in Induced Periodontal Regeneration ( IPR) technique. Among the graft&#xD;
      materials only autogenous bone grafts ( ABGs).and demineralized freeze-dried bone allografts&#xD;
      (DFDBA), are considered regenerative materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polypeptide growth factors revealed a potential application in PRT periodontal because are&#xD;
      the biological mediators during wound healing and regeneration and autologous platelet&#xD;
      concentrates ( PC) constitute a safe and convenient approach to deliver them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among PC, platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF) belongs to a group of second-generation blood&#xD;
      autologous products prepared by peripheral blood centrifugation without any nonclotting&#xD;
      agent, so to obtain a dense three-dimensional clot architecture that concentrates platelets,&#xD;
      fibrin, leukocytes, cytokines, and sustain cellular migration. This clot is then compressed&#xD;
      to obtain elastic and very strong membranes that can be used directly as membranes or as a&#xD;
      ﬁlling agent, after chopping, alone or in combination with BGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate that PRF is effective in promoting bone regeneration (BR) when&#xD;
      used alone or in combination with BG during oral/ periodontal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are very few published clinical controlled trials that compare the results of&#xD;
      PRF + BGs to the outcomes of PRF / BG alone in the treatment of IBDs and no study about PRF +&#xD;
      ABG in the same defects. Only one case report tested the use of PRF + ABG mixed with bovine&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite in the treatment of insufficient alveolar ridge width in aesthetic area. The&#xD;
      aim of the present study is to verify if the combined use of PRF + ABG in the management of&#xD;
      IBDs may be a treatment modality clinically &quot;not inferior&quot; to that with EMD + ABG.&#xD;

      Experimental Design. This is a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes 12 months after two treatment modalities&#xD;
      of IBDs: PRF + ABG into defects in the test subjects( TS); EMD + ABG in the control subjects&#xD;
      ( CS). The patients enrolled exhibit unfavourable IBDs and all experimental sites will be&#xD;
      accessed with a simplified papilla preservation flap ( SPPF) procedure. The filling material&#xD;
      (ABG) is common to both treatments: therefore, the investigation will focus on the addictive&#xD;
      effect of PRF used in place of EMD. EMD is chosen as the active control ( AC) as it is&#xD;
      currently considered as the biological &quot;gold standard&quot; agent for the treatment of IBDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-inferiority trial ( NIT) is designed to prove that using PRF instead of EMD could&#xD;
      achieve a similar result, reducing the treatment's cost and allowing the clinicians to use&#xD;
      autogenous material only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AC (comparator) is present, but the investigators do not include a third experimental arm,&#xD;
      a group of IBDs treated using Open Flap Debridement ( OFD) alone, as it is widely accepted in&#xD;
      NITs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimate of the AC effect vs. placebo is assumed from a recent meta-analysis, by the&#xD;
      Lower Bound of a 95% Confidence Interval ( CI) of the mean of EMD + ABG, while an OFD&#xD;
      estimate from the corresponding 95% CI Lower Bound is adopted by Venezia (2004). The&#xD;
      difference between estimates is set as the added benefit of the AC and as a ground for the&#xD;
      assay sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. 44 patients affected by moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, will be&#xD;
      selected for the study. Each patient will participate in the study with a single experimental&#xD;
      site. The participants will receive verbal and written information and they will sign a&#xD;
      consent form approved by the Ethical Committee of the G. D'Annunzio University of Chieti -&#xD;
      medical faculty. The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of&#xD;
      1975, revised in Tokyo in 2004. Four months before the surgical treatment, all 44 patients&#xD;
      will undergo SRP by ultrasonic instruments and hand curettes and motivational instructions on&#xD;
      oral home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority margin. A reliable estimate of the expected clinical attachment level ( CAL)&#xD;
      gain from an EMD + ABG treatment is drawn from a recent meta-analysis, reporting on 548 IBDs&#xD;
      in 434 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAL Gain Median was M=3.76 (SD=1.07) with 95% . Prudently the CI Lower Bound (3.48 mm) is&#xD;
      chosen as estimate of EMD + ABG CAL gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By literature, CAL gain obtainable by OFD surgical treatments alone is 2.47 mm. The&#xD;
      differential effect of using EMD amounts about 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the 95% - 95% method (the Fixed Margin approach), a magnitude equal to the&#xD;
      AC's expected effect (1 mm) is chosen for the M1 margin, to guarantee the new treatment's&#xD;
      efficacy. For clinical relevance, a second M2 margin is prefigured to preserve at least a&#xD;
      further 50% (0.5 mm) of the comparator's effect. Both M1 and M2 will be adopted for the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Randomization. Not knowing a priori whether the collected data will meet the&#xD;
      assumptions and the conditions making sensible an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), the sample&#xD;
      size will be initially calculated for an analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With one-tail , an α == 0.05, a power 1-β = = 0.90 and a SD = = 1.07 mm 1, a sample size of&#xD;
      20 patients per group is needed to detect the margin M1 = 1 mm in CAL gain between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that it will became possible to conduct an ANCOVA, the sample size sufficient to&#xD;
      detect an M2 margin will be calculated. If to detect a ∆M1=1 mm with ANOVA a total sample&#xD;
      size of N=40 will be required, adjusting for baseline values allowed to halve the margin&#xD;
      (∆M2=0.5) adding only 2 more patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each defect will be assigned a defect number and will be randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment regimens. Assignment will be performed by a custom made computer-generated table.&#xD;
      To conceal allocation, opaque envelopes will be assigned to the specific experimental site&#xD;
      and will be opened during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements.Complete oral and periodontal examinations will be performed for each&#xD;
      patient 3 months after SRP. These included FMPS, FMBS, PPD, CAL, and gingival recession ( GR)&#xD;
      for six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual/ palatal,&#xD;
      mid-lingual/palatal, and disto-lingual/palatal sites). Clinical measurements at experimental&#xD;
      sites will be recorded using a University of North Carolina (UNC-15, HuFriedy, Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois, USA) periodontal probe. The measurements will be taken immediately before surgical&#xD;
      treatment (baseline) and 1 year after treatment, by the same experienced examiner, who will&#xD;
      be masked to the treatment..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Measurements. Preoperative and 3- 6- 12-months postoperative intraoral&#xD;
      standardized radiographs will be taken by the paralleling technique using an individual&#xD;
      film-holder device consisting of a bite block rigidly connected to an acrylic dental splint&#xD;
      to achieve identical film placement at each evaluation. Pre- and postoperative radiographs&#xD;
      will be evaluated by two experienced clinicians who will be masked with respect to the&#xD;
      provenience of the radiographs and the clinical measurements. The positions of alveolar crest&#xD;
      level and of the bottom of the defect distance and will be marked by a pencil on the&#xD;
      radiographs and bottom of the defect will be measured by a millimeter grid. Linear distances&#xD;
      between the most coronal interproximal alveolar crest level and the bottom of the defect will&#xD;
      be obtained by counting the grids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique. All the surgeries will be performed by the same experienced clinician.&#xD;
      Both in TS and CS, after local anaesthesia, mucoperiosteal SPPFs will be raised. The flap&#xD;
      will be extended to the teeth mesial and distal to the tooth to be treated and, if necessary,&#xD;
      mesial and distal vertical releasing incisions will be performed to allow more visibility and&#xD;
      defects accessibility. After flap elevation, vestibular flap mobility will be tested to&#xD;
      ensure that primary closure of the wound could be achieved through tension -free suturing.&#xD;
      The granulation tissue adherent to the alveolar bone will be removed to provide full access&#xD;
      and visibility to the root and bone surfaces; SRP will be performed, but no osseous&#xD;
      recontouring. Autogenous corticocancellous BG material will be collected using bone scrapers&#xD;
      in both the TS and CS adjacent areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, root surfaces in the CS will be conditioned for 2 minutes with 24%&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then thoroughly rinsed with saline solution.&#xD;
      Before EMD application, single internal mattress suture at the defect- associated interdental&#xD;
      area to reach primary closure of the papilla in the absence of any tension will be prepared&#xD;
      by 4-0 sutures and left loose to apply EMD and the ABG. EMD will be applied to the entire&#xD;
      root surfaces of the CS as well as to the alveolar bone; then, ABG will be applied&#xD;
      alternatively with EMD into the IBD according to the &quot;sandwich&quot; technique until the IBD will&#xD;
      be completely filled. Finally the flap will be repositioned and sutures completed by&#xD;
      interrupted sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the TS, after the defect debridement, the PRF membrane cut into small pieces and mixed&#xD;
      with the ABG will be placed within the IBDs until they will be completely filled. Then the&#xD;
      other two PRF membranes in each patient will be adapted over the grafted defect extending&#xD;
      over the periphery of the defect in the buccal and lingual directions in order to cover all&#xD;
      the graft and recontour the bone architecture. Finally the flap will be repositioned and&#xD;
      horizontal mattress and interrupted sutures will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Processing. Since direct comparisons about single outcomes is the trial's scope, a&#xD;
      multiple univariate analysis is chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is CAL gain at 12 months. Changes in PPD, GR and bottom of&#xD;
      the defect distance are secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relying on previous studies and literature reporting a ρ between baseline- and gain-score in&#xD;
      the order of 0.7. an ANCOVA (on gain scores with baseline scores as covariate) is designed as&#xD;
      the main analysis. Furthermore, by virtue of the expected correlation, sample size could be&#xD;
      reduced to ¼.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, an ANOVA is performed as well, both for comparison and as a reference in sample&#xD;
      size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority is assessed by mean of CI of the main outcome's gain-scores difference&#xD;
      between the two treatments. For the non-inferiority to be established, the CI Upper Bound&#xD;
      should neither touch nor overrun the margin. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed similarly.&#xD;
