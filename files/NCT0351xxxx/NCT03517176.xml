      CEND-1, Gemicitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study of CEND-1 in combination with nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine administered weekly for&#xD;
      three weeks followed by one week off over 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biologic activity of&#xD;
      CEND-1 in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are undergoing&#xD;
      combination therapy with nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine. CEND-1 is a tumor-penetrating peptide&#xD;
      (scientifically also known as iRGD) that activates a drug transport mechanism specifically in&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study involves an initial dose escalation phase with four different CEND-1 dose levels, first&#xD;
      as a monotherapy (during 1-week run-in), followed by combination therapy with nabpaclitaxel&#xD;
      and gemcitabine (one 28-day treatment cycle). A subsequent expansion phase with approximately&#xD;
      28 subjects will assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      treatment using two different CEND-1 dose levels.&#xD;

    <description>Safety of ascending dose levels of CEND-1 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel will be evaluated. Patients will receive an IV bolus of CEND-1 on Day 1 of the 1-week run-in period. This is followed by one treatment cycle (28 days) with the CEND-1 / nab-paclitaxel (125mg/m^2) / gemcitabine (1000mg/m^2) combination given on Days 1, 8, 15.</description>

Treatment cycles will be repeated every 4 weeks based on toxicity and response. Treatment may continue as long as there is perceived benefit or until disease progression.</description>
