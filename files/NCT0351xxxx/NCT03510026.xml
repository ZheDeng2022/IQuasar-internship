    <textblock>
      Electrosurgery is fundamental to the precise, fast and bloodless preparation of internal&#xD;
      thoracic artery grafts in cardiac surgery. The PEAK PlasmaBlade is a monopolar&#xD;
      electrosurgical device that uses pulsed radiofrequency energy to generate a plasma-mediated&#xD;
      discharge along an insulated electrode, creating a cutting edge while the blade stays near&#xD;
      body temperature. The aim of this study is to compare the histological samples, cardiac&#xD;
      computed-tomography of graft patency, and clinical outcomes of patients after off-pump&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting with preparation of the internal thoracic arteries by a&#xD;
      conventional electrosurgical device and the PlasmaBlade.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Electrosurgery is fundamental to the precise, fast and bloodless preparation of internal&#xD;
      thoracic artery grafts in cardiac surgery. The fundamental performance of electrosurgical&#xD;
      dissection is created by using a continuous radiofrequency energy waveform, which thermally&#xD;
      ablates soft tissue, leaving a collateral damage zone of 100-400 µm. The basic mechanism of&#xD;
      tissue ablation and dissection in electrosurgery involves Joule heating of the conductive&#xD;
      tissue by electric current, that leads to vaporization and ionization of the water content in&#xD;
      the tissue adjacent to the electrode, and ultimately to vapor expansion and tissue&#xD;
      fragmentation. Tissue heated below the vaporization threshold remains in place, but can&#xD;
      undergo thermal denaturation determined by the temperature levels and duration of the&#xD;
      hyperthermia. Thus, to confine the collateral damage zone in tissue, both of these factors&#xD;
      should be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to continuous radiofrequency energy, pulsed electric waveforms with burst&#xD;
      durations ranging from 10 to 100 µsec applied via an insulated planar electrode with 12 µm&#xD;
      wide exposed edge produces a plasma-mediated, precise dissection of tissues with a lower&#xD;
      collateral damage zone ranging from 2 to 10 µm. The greatly reduced zone of thermal damage,&#xD;
      compared to conventional electrosurgical devices, may provide faster healing and less&#xD;
      scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEAK PlasmaBlade (Medtronic Advanced Energy, Portsmouth, NH USA) (FDA 510(k), CE-No.&#xD;
      540861, Model Number PS200-040) is an electrosurgical device that uses pulsed radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy to generate a plasma-mediated discharge along the exposed rim of an insulated blade,&#xD;
      creating an effective, precise cutting edge while the blade stays near body temperature.&#xD;
      Plasma is an electrically conductive cloud created when the energy contacts tissue. This&#xD;
      conductive cloud or &quot;plasma&quot; allows the radiofrequency energy to cross at much lower overall&#xD;
      power levels. This use of less energy via plasma results in lower operating temperatures and&#xD;
      less thermal damage. This technology has been shown to effectively dissect ophthalmologic and&#xD;
      cutaneous tissues as precisely as a scalpel with the hemostatic control of conventional&#xD;
      electrosurgery in clinical and experimental settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrating on bypass grafts, the thoracic internal arteries (ITAs) demonstrate our most&#xD;
      valuable conduit for revascularization of the coronary arteries. Compared to pedicled&#xD;
      arteries, skeletonized ITAs have demonstrated a tendency to better long term patency.&#xD;
      Additionally, skeletonized conduits are useful in expanding the number of anastomoses per&#xD;
      patient and reducing the incidence of sternal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a dissection device that provides precise preparation, including optimal bleeding&#xD;
      control without overly damaging the surrounding tissue, might be an optimizing factor for the&#xD;
      protection of these valuable bypass grafts. The aim of this study was to compare the&#xD;
      histological assessment, cardiac computed-tomography and clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
      following off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with preparation of the ITAs by&#xD;
      conventional electrosurgery and the PlasmaBlade.&#xD;
