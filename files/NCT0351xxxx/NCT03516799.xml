  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to innovatively extend acupuncture research in adult oncology to&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults (AYA) by piloting a tailored acupuncture protocol for pain&#xD;
      management in AYA in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP's) Center for Integrative&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is an integrative medicine (IM) with a growing evidence base that is often&#xD;
      incorporated into comprehensive pain management in adult oncology. However, it is&#xD;
      under-utilized and under-researched in pediatric oncology, especially with adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults (AYA). Acupuncture is a promising palliative therapy to manage pain and improve&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) of AYA. AYA are underserved and typically endure more morbidity and&#xD;
      longer treatments than younger patients. More than half report at least three debilitating&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms and their QOL is significantly lower compared to norms, with symptoms&#xD;
      being the greatest contributor to poor QOL. Not surprisingly, AYA identify pain management as&#xD;
      an unmet need, leading a majority of AYA to want information on IM or seek it for treatment.&#xD;
      Given the potential benefit of acupuncture for addressing unmet needs of AYA by reducing&#xD;
      physical suffering, and the established difficulty with pain management using conventional&#xD;
      methods, there is a critical need to establish the efficacy of acupuncture for pain&#xD;
      management in AYA. The few studies that have evaluated acupuncture in pediatric oncology,&#xD;
      demonstrating it to be safe, accepted, and associated with symptom relief are uncontrolled,&#xD;
      retrospective, and/or unprotocolized, and none focus on AYA. To establish the evidence base&#xD;
      for acupuncture in AYA oncology, research is needed to determine and test optimal acupuncture&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
