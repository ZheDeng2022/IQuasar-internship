  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been established that greater amounts of vigorous intensity physical activity lead to&#xD;
      improved health outcomes. Interestingly, the response of biologically active substances,&#xD;
      called myokines, differs according to exercise intensity. As such, the current study aims to&#xD;
      compare the difference in the response to irisin according to different exercise intensities&#xD;
      in both normal weight subjects and individuals living with obesity. This study will compare&#xD;
      continuous moderate intensity physical activity to high intensity physical activity against a&#xD;
      control condition. Furthermore, this study will determine whether differences in exercise&#xD;
      intensity are associated with better insulin sensitivity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although exercise is recognized as a cornerstone in the management of obesity and diabetes,&#xD;
      previous research has shown substantial inter-individual variability following an exercise&#xD;
      intervention. As of now, the mechanisms underlying the cardio-metabolic response to exercise&#xD;
      have not been fully elucidated. When accounting for genetic factors, only 20-30% of the&#xD;
      response is explained, which indicates that other factors must contribute to this&#xD;
      exercise-related cardio-metabolic response. Exercise stimulates the release of myokines,&#xD;
      which have been shown to play a critical role in health. However, the contribution of these&#xD;
      myokines to the cardio-metabolic response is unknown. Furthermore, the regulation of myokines&#xD;
      according to different exercise stimuli (i.e., exercise intensity) is unclear. It is&#xD;
      suggested that altering specific exercise parameters can reduce the variability in the&#xD;
      response and increase the proportion of participants who obtain the expected physiological&#xD;
      adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to: 1) determine whether high intensity interval training&#xD;
      (HIIT) generates a greater secretion of irisin compared to moderate (MOD) aerobic exercise in&#xD;
      individuals living with obesity and in those with a normal weight; 2) investigate whether the&#xD;
      increase in irisin during exercise is associated with insulin sensitivity in individuals&#xD;
      living with obesity and in those with normal weight; and 3) determine whether differences&#xD;
      exist between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will use a randomized controlled crossover design to perform this&#xD;
      study in which 40 participants (aged 19-50) will be recruited into two groups (n = 20 obese,&#xD;
      n = 20 normal weight). Each group will be randomized into three conditions: 1) an acute bout&#xD;
      of MOD aerobic exercise: 35 minutes of cycling at 50% of heart rate reserve (HRR), 2) an&#xD;
      acute bout of HIIT aerobic exercise: cycling at 50% of HRR for 5 minutes followed by 2&#xD;
      minutes of cycling at 85-90% of HRR consecutively for a total of 35 minutes, and 3) a control&#xD;
      condition: blood draws matched for exercise time will be taken while the participant remains&#xD;
      seated. The primary outcome measure will be insulin sensitivity using the Matsuda Index. The&#xD;
      primary exposure variable will be the acute secretion of irisin during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: It is hypothesized that: 1) an acute bout of HIIT aerobic exercise will&#xD;
      generate a greater plasma irisin secretion compared an acute bout of continuous MOD aerobic&#xD;
      exercise; 2) increased irisin will be positively associated with greater insulin sensitivity;&#xD;
      and 3) differences will be observed between individuals living with obesity and those with a&#xD;
      normal weight.&#xD;
