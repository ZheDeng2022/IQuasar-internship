    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-200, an investigational drug delivery&#xD;
      system, in combination with nivolumab is safe and tolerable in patients with muscle-invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer (MIBC) who are scheduled for radical cystectomy (RC) during an 84-day dosing&#xD;
      cycle induction period comprised of four consecutive 21-day dosing cycles.&#xD;
