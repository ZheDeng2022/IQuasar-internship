  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is caused by chronic liver diseases, varices exist in 30 - 60% of patients&#xD;
      with liver cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding is one of the most important complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis, accelerating the progression of decompensation to a stage at which the patient is&#xD;
      at an extremely high risk of death. Endoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      varices, However, periodic endoscopic screening in all cirrhotic patients might unnecessarily&#xD;
      induce an invasive and expensive procedure, ultimately increasing not only the medical&#xD;
      workload of endoscopy units, but also the financial burden of patients. To avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      endoscopy in low- risk patients, some simple, non-invasive and accurate tests have been&#xD;
      developed to identify EVs. Such as Transient elastography (TE) , which is a noninvasive tool&#xD;
      that measures liver stiffness (LS) correlating to liver fibrosis stage. Moreover, the&#xD;
      LS-spleen size-to-platelet ratio score (LSPS), which is a combination of three simple&#xD;
      examination methods (LS, spleen size and platelet count) has been established to accurately&#xD;
      predict EVs in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, investigators design this cross-sectional&#xD;
      study to assess these non-invasive tests in predicting the presence of EVs in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is a result of excessive extracellular matrix deposition in the liver in&#xD;
      response to chronic inflammatory injury triggered by chronic liver diseases. And Cirrhosis is&#xD;
      classified in 2 distinct clinical stages, compensated (Currently, both terms : &quot;compensated&#xD;
      advanced chronic liver disease(cACLD)&quot; and &quot;compensated cirrhosis&quot; are acceptable) and&#xD;
      decompensated, defined by the presence or absence of overt clinical complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy). Portal hypertension is a&#xD;
      frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, a contributing fator for ascites and hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, and a direct cause of variceal hemorrhage. An increase in portal pressure&#xD;
      leads to the development of portosystemic collateral circulation, of which varices are the&#xD;
      most important clinical feature. In accordance with the Baveno II consensus conference,&#xD;
      esophageal varices (EVs) were classified as absent, small (diameter &lt; 5 mm) or large&#xD;
      (diameter ≥ 5 mm). The presence of red wale marks on the variceal wall in EVs was also&#xD;
      recorded. EVs at a high risk for bleeding were defined according to the Baveno V criteria as&#xD;
      large EVs or small EVs with red signs or EVs in patients with Child-Pugh class C disease.&#xD;
      varices exist in 30 - 60% of patients with liver cirrhosis, depending on the severity of&#xD;
      Portal hypertension. The yearly rate of development of new cases is 5 - 10% , whereas the&#xD;
      growth rate from small to large varices ranges between 5 and 30 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variceal bleeding is the most important and the most lethal complication of cirrhosis,&#xD;
      accelerating the progression of decompensation to a stage at which the patient is at an&#xD;
      extremely high risk of death. Therefore, the diagnosis, prevention, and management of EVs are&#xD;
      important for patients with cirrhosis. And screening for EVs in all patients with cirrhosis&#xD;
      is also strongly recommended across guidelines and consensus statements. Endoscopy is the&#xD;
      gold standard for the diagnosis of varices, and is recommended as the screening method to&#xD;
      identify those who should undergo prophylactic treatment when the diagnosis of cirrhosis is&#xD;
      made. Nonselective β-blockers significantly reduce the bleeding rate in more than half of&#xD;
      patients with high-risk EVs (HEVs). However, as the prevalence of HEVs at any given point in&#xD;
      time is 15 - 25%, the majority of subjects undergoing screening endoscopy either do not have&#xD;
      varices, or have varices that do not require prophylactic therapy. Therefore, periodic&#xD;
      endoscopic screening in all cirrhotic patients, especially low-risk groups, might&#xD;
      unnecessarily induce an invasive and expensive procedure, ultimately increasing not only the&#xD;
      medical workload of endoscopy units, but also the financial burden to patients, as the number&#xD;
      of patients with chronic liver disease increases and their survival improves. Furthermore,&#xD;
      compliance may be limited, because even asymptomatic patients may be required to repeatedly&#xD;
      undergo an unpleasant endoscopic procedure, which usually requires conscious sedation&#xD;
      decreasing work productivity, It also carries rare but serious complications. Patients might&#xD;
      be reluctant to receive endoscopy and become discouraged in starting preventive measures. All&#xD;
      of these reasons lead to decline in patient compliance with treatment and follow-ups.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, the endoscopy-related complications reported by a related article is close to 0.1%&#xD;
      of incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid unnecessary endoscopy in low-risk patients, some simple, non-invasive and accurate&#xD;
      tests have been developed to identify EVs. Transient elastography (TE) is a noninvasive tool&#xD;
      that measures liver stiffness (LS) correlating to liver fibrosis stage. While LS also shows&#xD;
      potential in the prediction of EVs, its role is still under debate. Moreover, the LS-spleen&#xD;
      size-to-platelet ratio score (LSPS), which is a combination of three simple examination&#xD;
      methods (LS, spleen size and platelet count) has been established to accurately predict EVs&#xD;
      in patients with cirrhosis. And recent Baveno VI recommended the combination of transient&#xD;
      elastography and platelet count for ruling out HEVs in patients with chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is a correlation between these non-invasive tools and the presence of EVS or&#xD;
      HEVs, the optimal cut-offs and their validities vary in the different studies with different&#xD;
      etiologies. In addition, the qualities of EVs assessment have not been provided in these&#xD;
      studies. Therefore, investigators design this cross-sectional study to assess these&#xD;
      non-invasive tests in predicting the presence of EVs in patients with cirrhosis. This could&#xD;
      prevent unnecessary endoscopy with related complications and costs. And the results of&#xD;
      noninvasive tests will be compared with endoscopy (ie, the gold standard for diagnosing EVs).&#xD;
