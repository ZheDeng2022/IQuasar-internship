  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder. High magnitude and long-duration voucher-based&#xD;
      abstinence reinforcement is one of the most effective treatments for alcohol and drug&#xD;
      addiction and can maintain abstinence over extended periods of time, but practical methods of&#xD;
      implementing these interventions are needed. Workplaces could be ideal and practical vehicles&#xD;
      for arranging and maintaining abstinence reinforcement over long time periods. Investigators'&#xD;
      research on a model Therapeutic Workplace has shown that employment-based abstinence&#xD;
      reinforcement, in which participants must provide alcohol- or drug-free urine samples to&#xD;
      maintain maximum pay, can maintain alcohol and drug abstinence. Now investigators need to&#xD;
      develop effective and economically sound methods to arrange long-term exposure to&#xD;
      employment-based abstinence reinforcement. Investigators are proposing to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and economic benefits of a Wage Supplement Model of arranging long-term&#xD;
      exposure to employment-based abstinence reinforcement. Under this model, successful&#xD;
      Therapeutic Workplace participants are offered abstinence-contingent wage supplements if they&#xD;
      obtain and maintain competitive employment. Governments have used wage supplements&#xD;
      effectively to increase employment in welfare recipients. The Wage Supplement Model harnesses&#xD;
      the power of wage supplements to promote employment, while simultaneously using the wage&#xD;
      supplements to reinforce drug and alcohol abstinence. The intervention will combine 3&#xD;
      elements -- the Therapeutic Workplace, Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported&#xD;
      employment, and abstinence-contingent wage supplements. IPS is a supported employment&#xD;
      intervention that has been proven effective in promoting employment in adults with severe&#xD;
      mental illness. Under this model, participants will be exposed to the Therapeutic Workplace&#xD;
      to initiate abstinence and establish job skills. To promote employment and prevent relapse to&#xD;
      drug use, participants will receive IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplements. A&#xD;
      randomized trial will evaluate the effectiveness and economic benefits of the&#xD;
      Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement Model in promoting employment and sustaining drug&#xD;
      abstinence. Participants will be enrolled in the Therapeutic Workplace for 3 months and then&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a Usual Care Control group or an IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage&#xD;
      Supplement group for one year. Usual Care Control participants will be offered counseling and&#xD;
      referrals to employment and treatment programs. IPS Plus Abstinence-Contingent Wage&#xD;
      Supplement participants will receive the IPS intervention and abstinence-contingent wage&#xD;
      supplements. This novel intervention could be an effective and economically sound way to&#xD;
      promote long-term employment and drug abstinence.&#xD;
