      This main objective of this feasibility study is to begin to quantify the relationship&#xD;
      between patient activity levels following knee replacement surgery and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims The primary objective of this study is to compare step count and activity levels&#xD;
      with key outcome measures - including pain scores and painkiller usage - to determine whether&#xD;
      more active people have better recovery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean weekly step count between pre surgery and 6 weeks post surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily activity level of participant as measured by step count automatically on commercial step counter at one minute granularity from up to one week before surgery up to 6 weeks post surgery. Step count data for days which are deemed non compliant (not wearing device long enough) will be ignored. Total average daily step count (for compliant days) each week will be reported.&#xD;
The outcome measure we plan to use will be the mean daily step count from the 6th week post op. The baseline will be the mean step count from the 1 week prior to surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Daily Pain Score over 6 weeks following surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to record their NRS-11 (Numeric Rating Scale) pain level in the morning, afternoon and evening daily in a paper diary for six weeks after surgery. NRS-11 is an integer scale from 0-10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing worst pain possible.&#xD;
The outcome measure will be the mean pain score from the 6 week post op period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean weekly Oxford Knee Score for 6 weeks following surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the 6 weeks following surgery, at the end of each week patients will be asked to fill in the 12 question Oxford Knee Score (OKS) questionnaire which will result in an integer score from 0-48 for each week.&#xD;
The outcome measure will be the mean OKS over the 6 week post op period.</description>
