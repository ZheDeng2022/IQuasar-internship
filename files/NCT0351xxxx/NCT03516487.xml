    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, oral single and multiple dose-escalation, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is evaluating SYNB1618 in healthy volunteers (HV)&#xD;
      and subjects diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited metabolic disorder that&#xD;
      occurs in people who are missing an enzyme that the body needs to use phenylalanine (Phe).&#xD;
      Eligible subjects receive investigational product (IP) in the clinic and undergo safety&#xD;
      monitoring, evaluations, and subsequent follow-up after IP administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, kinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SYNB1618&#xD;
      within the following 2 study parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 comprises a single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted over 4 days in HV male and&#xD;
      female subjects in up to 6 dose cohorts (3 treated:1 placebo) to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) within the single-dose range studied. Up to 24 HV subjects are planned&#xD;
      for enrollment in this part of the study. Following attainment of the MTD in HV, a SAD cohort&#xD;
      of up to 4 subjects (male and female, ≥ 18 years old) previously diagnosed with PKU will be&#xD;
      enrolled (3 treated:1 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 comprises a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting (6&#xD;
      treated:2 placebo) over 10 days in HV male and female subjects in up to 4 cohorts at doses&#xD;
      not exceeding the MTD from the SAD part of the study to identify the MTD of SYNB1618 within&#xD;
      the multiple-dose range studied. Up to 32 HV subjects are planned for enrollment in this part&#xD;
      of the study. Once the highest MAD cohort and the SAD PKU cohort are completed, a&#xD;
      multiple-dose cohort of male and female subjects (≥ 18 years old) previously diagnosed with&#xD;
      PKU are evaluated. Up to 20 subjects with PKU are planned for enrollment in the MAD PKU&#xD;
      cohort (12 treated:8 placebo).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity is graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Adverse events (AEs) are reported based on clinical laboratory tests, vital sign and weight measurements, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and any other medically indicated assessments, including subject interviews, from the time informed consent is signed through the end of the safety follow-up period.&#xD;
AEs are considered to be treatment emergent (TEAE) if they occur or worsen in severity after the first dose of study treatment. TEAEs are considered treatment-related if relationship to study drug is possibly related, probably related, or definitely related.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clearance of SYNB1618 From Feces</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>SYNB1618 transit through the gastrointestinal tract is measured with fecal quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays from fecal samples collected at baseline, daily during the dosing period, at the time of discharge from the inpatient unit, and weekly thereafter for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of investigational product (IP) until a subject has a negative SYNB1618 fecal test. SYNB1618 clearance reflects a test value of below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) occurring after the indicated number of days following the last dose of IP.</description>
