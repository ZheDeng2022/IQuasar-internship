      Cognitive impairment is a significant health problem in the United States, resulting in costs&#xD;
      over $100 billion a year. We will provide an efficient, effective, and financially&#xD;
      intelligent solution to Primary Care Physician's to identify cognitive impairment in the&#xD;
      earliest stages, delay progression through appropriate treatment, and to afford patients the&#xD;
      opportunity to make future plans at a time when symptoms are mild and patients are able to&#xD;
      make informed decisions concerning financial and life activities. This has the potential to&#xD;
      delay devastating effects of cognitive impairment, and to lessen the financial burden on the&#xD;
      health care system in the United States.&#xD;

      Cognitive dysfunction in the elderly population, ranging from simple forgetfulness to a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, can impact one's quality of life and ability to function in&#xD;
      daily activities. It is crucial that decline be detected as early as possible in order to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the cause is treatable, and to employ appropriate treatment, if applicable.&#xD;
      The majority of older patients rely on their primary care physician for the bulk of their&#xD;
      healthcare needs, but there is a lack of sensitive tools available, and there is a lack of&#xD;
      physician's time to use the tools, leading to a failure to provide therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      at the earliest stages of loss to potentially slow the progression of disease. Psychology&#xD;
      Software Tools, Inc. (PST) has developed the Computer Assessment of Memory and Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (CAMCI), a computerized screening tool for detection of early signs of cognitive&#xD;
      decline, which has been shown to be more effective in the identification of patients with&#xD;
      subtle cognitive loss than the tools most frequently used within the primary care physician&#xD;
      (PCP) office. CAMCI would provide an option for PCPs and clinicians to provide therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention prior to a diagnosis of dementia. Recent additions to Current Procedural&#xD;
      Terminology (CPT) codes permit insurance reimbursement for neuropsychological testing by a&#xD;
      computer, including time for the physician's or clinical psychologist's interpretation and&#xD;
      reporting. The introduction of this new revenue stream for PCPs and clinicians, coupled with&#xD;
      the characteristics of being brief and self-administered make CAMCI an attractive option for&#xD;
      improving early intervention, providing an intelligent business solution for healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, and a useful and effective tool that allows physicians to better evaluate and&#xD;
      serve their patients. The specific aims included in the current project focus on activities&#xD;
      required to successfully move CAMCI to commercialization by extending support for late stage&#xD;
      research and product development, including regulatory strategy and intellectual property&#xD;
      development, data collection to replicate key studies, product extension through increasing&#xD;
      minority representation, and development of a measure of meaningful change. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      is to streamline commercialization of CAMCI, and to provide a useful and effective tool in&#xD;
      the detection of cognitive dysfunction to physicians, the providers of the majority of&#xD;
      healthcare to the elderly population, to improve efficiency and effectiveness of clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

Shared data will include computerized task scores, neuropsychological test scores, and full analytical codes used to process and analyze the data. Workflows will be described and documented to allow replication of results from the raw data.&#xD;
Data and corresponding documentation will be made available through Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/), in addition to any potential requirements on software sharing by journals.&#xD;
The PI or Co-Investigators will disseminate results from this research through presentations at public lectures, scientific institutions and meetings, and/or publication in major journals. The PI and Co-Investigators will adhere to the NIH Grants Policy on Sharing of Unique Research Resources including the Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources: Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts on Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources.</ipd_description>
