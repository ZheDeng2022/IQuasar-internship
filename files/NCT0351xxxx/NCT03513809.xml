  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous breathing efforts in patients with respiratory failure connected to mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, has been associated with strong respiratory muscles activity. However, these&#xD;
      mechanisms may will be present in patients with acute lung deseases who are breathing with no&#xD;
      ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that spontaneous breathing during acute respiratory failure could induced lung&#xD;
      inflammation and worsen lung damage. Hereby, the connection to a ventilatory support tool,&#xD;
      may protect the lungs from spontaneous ventilation-induced lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, our aim is to determine the effects of spontaneous breathing in acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure patients, on lung injury distribution; and to determine whether early&#xD;
      controlled mechanical ventilation can avoid these deleterious effects by improving air&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;

      Prospective clinical protocol in patients admitted to the ICU of the Hospital Clínico&#xD;
      UC-Christus, Santiago de Chile, with diagnosis of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but&#xD;
      who are still ventilating spontaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital admission, patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study protocol. Patients will be monitored conventionally&#xD;
      according with hospital protocols (continuous ECG, SpO2, invasive arterial pressure, and&#xD;
      intermittent arterial blood gases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An EIT belt will be installed around the patient thorax connected to Enlight impedance&#xD;
      tomography monitor (Dixtal, São Paulo, Brazil). EIT data will be recorded during periods of 3&#xD;
      minutes for offline analysis. Regional distribution of ventilation will be analyzed by&#xD;
      dividing the image in four ROIs, each covering 25% of the ventro-dorsal distance encompassing&#xD;
      the whole lung area. In addition we will estimate recruitment-derecruitment, and&#xD;
      overdistention, regionally. In addition, pendelluft phenomena, and spatial patterns of&#xD;
      regional deformation will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patient inclusion, the first EIT and physiological data acquisition will be recorded&#xD;
      (hemodynamics, respiratory variables, arterial blood gases, plasma samples). The data&#xD;
      acquisition will be repeated every 6 hours from enrollment until intubation, or upto 24 hours&#xD;
      of follow up, after which the patient will only be followed for clinically relevant outcomes.&#xD;
      If within 24 hours of inclusion the attending physician decides intubation and connection to&#xD;
      MV, an extra assessment of EIT, clinical data and blood samples will be performed. After&#xD;
      intubation these assessments will include MV data and will be repeated hourly for the first 6&#xD;
      hours, and then at 12, 18 and 24 hours thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after intubation and initial stabilization, a fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided&#xD;
      distal-protected small volume bronchoalveolar lavage (FODP mini-BAL) will be performed. This&#xD;
      early BAL will be used as representative of the previous period of spontaneous ventilation.&#xD;
      After 48 hours of controlled MV a new BAL will be performed, at the same regions than the&#xD;
      first BAL, to compare the changes in the pattern of regional inflammation. For each BAL one&#xD;
      or two aliquots of 20 ml of warmed (37°C) sterile isotonic saline will be administered and&#xD;
      subsequently recovered in dorsal (lateral inferior) and ventral segments (medial lobe or&#xD;
      lingula). The first recovered aliquot will be discarded while the remaining BAL fluid will be&#xD;
      rapidly filtered through a sterile gauze and spun at 4°C at 400 x g for 15 min. The&#xD;
      supernatant will be centrifuged at 80,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C in order to remove the&#xD;
      surfactant-rich fraction and then divided into aliquots and frozen at - 80 °C for subsequent&#xD;
      cytokine and mechanotransduction markers determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * BAL samples will only be collected if the attending physician determines that this&#xD;
      procedure is clinically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine analysis in serum, BALF and tissue supernatants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels in plasma at time to inclusion,&#xD;
      intubation, and 24 and 48 hours after intubation. BALF will be analyzed to determine&#xD;
      quantification of neutrophils, cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10) and TGF-β&#xD;
      (extracellular cytokine with mechanotransduction proprieties) at intubation time and 48 hours&#xD;
      after intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas Exchange, Hemodynamics, and Ventilatory Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time of physiological acquisition we will collect arterial and central venous blood&#xD;
      gases (if central venous catheter is present). We will assess hemodynamics (arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, central venous pressure, central venous pressure inspiratory swings, heart rate),&#xD;
      and ventilatory parameters. While patients remain in spontaneous ventilation we will assess&#xD;
      respiratory rate, ventilatory pattern, and Borg dyspnea score. After intubation and&#xD;
      connection to MV we will collect full ventilatory data from the pneumotach system for later&#xD;
      analysis of flows, pressures and volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the clinical protocol we don´t have previous data about distribution of ventilation&#xD;
      between dependent and non-dependent lung regions during spontaneous ventilation. Therefore,&#xD;
      we calculated sample size based on an expected effect size of 0.5, with a standard deviation&#xD;
      two times larger, between the period of spontaneous ventilation before intubation, and the&#xD;
      period of controlled MV after intubation. For a power of 0.8 and a two-sided error of 0.05&#xD;
      the calculated sample size is 32. However, of the included patients, only a fraction will be&#xD;
      intubated, so we calculated that 60 to 80 patients must be included during the 4-year period,&#xD;
      to complete the required number of patients available for before-after analysis. We will&#xD;
      express values as means - standard deviation (SD) or median - range where appropriate. The&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to test data for normality. Groups will be compared using&#xD;
      Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, one-way (repeated-measures) analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) or Kruskal- Wallis test. Interactions between groups and time will be assessed with&#xD;
      two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. The Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests will be applied&#xD;
      for post hoc comparisons. The statistical analyses will be conducted by SPSS v.20.0.0&#xD;
      software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA), and GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software,&#xD;
      San Diego, CA, USA).&#xD;
