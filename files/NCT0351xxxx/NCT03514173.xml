  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject of the observation study with accompanying employee survey is the evaluation of a&#xD;
      patient remote monitoring system (Vital Sync from Medtronic, hereinafter abbreviated as&#xD;
      &quot;Vital Sync&quot;) in intensive care medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research project is to determine whether the use of Vital Sync on an&#xD;
      intensive care unit is accepted by medical and nursing staff and can be integrated into&#xD;
      everyday work as an additional visualisation and analysis tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care medicine, patient monitoring has become a standard that has led to a&#xD;
      significant improvement in patient safety in recent decades. At the international level,&#xD;
      minimum requirements for patient monitoring have been set out in guidelines and&#xD;
      recommendations that represent milestones in patient safety, such as the Helsinki Declaration&#xD;
      for Anaesthesiology and the Vienna Declaration for Intensive Care. With advances in digital&#xD;
      health, there are new options for patient monitoring that may improve patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of the Internet of Things has recently gained in importance. While the personal&#xD;
      computer (PC) was long regarded as a prerequisite for making technologies accessible to&#xD;
      people, the use of computer-supported electronic infrastructures has become ubiquitous.&#xD;
      Today, more and more everyday devices are equipped with electronic circuits (microchip,&#xD;
      memory chip), blurring earlier boundaries between hardware and software. In an intensive care&#xD;
      unit - an environment with high operational reliability - ubiquitous computing means that the&#xD;
      processing and visualization of medical data must not be limited to typical workstations at&#xD;
      the patient's bedside. Instead, the accessibility of data relevant to medical decisions&#xD;
      should result from clinical workflows, leading to the targeted provision of information as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although various remote patient monitoring systems from commercial providers are already&#xD;
      available, little is known about how they can effectively support clinical processes. At the&#xD;
      Charité, the working group &quot;Data Science in Perioperative Care&quot; of the Clinic for&#xD;
      Anaesthesiology with focus on operative intensive care Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin,&#xD;
      Campus Virchow and Campus Mitte is systematically evaluating the integration of such novel&#xD;
      technologies with special consideration of the socio-technical dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-implementation phase, 15 ICU staff members (physicians, nurses and respiratory&#xD;
      therapists) will be involved into a semi-structured interview study. Results from this&#xD;
      pre-implementation study will be validated via two independent surveys involving ICU staff&#xD;
      members (n&gt;100). In the post-implementation phase, two semi-structured interview studies will&#xD;
      be conducted with key stakeholders of the ICU until data saturation is reached (n=5-10). The&#xD;
      focus of this post-implementation interview studies will be to analyse the usability of the&#xD;
      installed remote patient monitoring system as well as the success of the implementation and&#xD;
      its contributing factors.&#xD;
