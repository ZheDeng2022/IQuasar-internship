      Â· The target population for our study is women who present in their last clinic visit before&#xD;
      delivery and are scheduled for an elective cesarean section. In that visit, the provider will&#xD;
      notify the research team in order for the subject to be screened for the study. If the&#xD;
      subject consents to participation, written informed consent will be obtained by&#xD;
      person-to-person contact. The PI, study coordinator, or a collaborator will be responsible&#xD;
      for the informed consent. After in-formed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized&#xD;
      to the following study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will undergo regular consenting only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group I (e-confirmed consent only) will receive an electronic invitation to complete&#xD;
      the consent process electronically and will proceed through the Confirmed Consent system&#xD;
      prior to arrival to labor and delivery on day of surgery, which is the routine patient flow&#xD;
      at this time. After completion of the survey, the subject will sign the regular paper consent&#xD;
      for the procedure as standard in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group II will undergo the same intervention as group II but the COMRADE survey&#xD;
      questionnaire will be obtained by phone or in person after the completion of the paper&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;

      4.1 Screening, Recruitment, and Consenting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Under the direction of the PI, trained research staff will be available 24/7 to screen&#xD;
           and con-sent patients according to study protocol. Patients will be enrolled at the time&#xD;
           a decision for planned repeat cesarean after VBAC counseling is made in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After informed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to the study group or&#xD;
           the control group. A screening log will be used to track all patients approached for the&#xD;
           study. Women will only be randomized in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment: We will recruit all pregnant patient's decision was made for scheduled&#xD;
           cesarean after VBAC counseling made by their managing clinical team who do not meet any&#xD;
           of the ex-clusion criteria listed below. Once the inclusion criteria for our study are&#xD;
           met, the primary team will inform the patient about the study and ask her authorization&#xD;
           to contact one of the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consenting process: Written consent will be obtained by direct person-to-person contact.&#xD;
           The principal investigator, study coordinator, or a collaborator will be responsible for&#xD;
           the informed consent. Non-English-speaking subjects are anticipated to be part of the&#xD;
           study population and informed consent will be provided in their primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reassured that participation in the study is voluntary and will not&#xD;
      interfere with diag-nose or treatment of her condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive the same care and expertise as any other patient treated in our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Randomization and Masking A confidential computer-generated simple randomization scheme&#xD;
      (using STATA 14, Dallas, TX) will be prepared and provided on an ongoing basis to our study&#xD;
      coordinator. A randomization log with group assignment, subject name, and medical record&#xD;
      number will be used to track the randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be included in the analysis by intent-to-treat once the randomization&#xD;
      assignment has been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Interventions The control group will undergo regular consenting only. At our unit&#xD;
      consent for an elective ce-sarean delivery occurs in the same day of surgery, few hours&#xD;
      before the procedure in a private room in labor and delivery while awaiting surgery. The&#xD;
      COMRADE questionnaire (our primary outcome) will be obtained after the completion of the&#xD;
      paper consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group I (e-confirmed consent only) will receive an electronic invitation to complete&#xD;
      the consent process electronically and will proceed through the Confirmed Consent system&#xD;
      prior to arrival to labor and delivery on day of surgery, which is the routine patient flow&#xD;
      at this time. The COMRADE questionnaire (our primary outcome) will be obtained prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of the traditional consent (as in control group) before the completion of the&#xD;
      paper consent form, in order to assess satisfaction and understanding of the e-confirmed&#xD;
      consenting process completed before the procedure. After completion of the survey, the&#xD;
      subject will sign the regular paper consent for the procedure as standard in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group II will undergo the same intervention as group II but the COMRADE survey&#xD;
      questionnaire will be obtained after the paper consent is obtained in order to assess whether&#xD;
      both methods combined together improve the subjects' satisfaction of the consenting methods&#xD;
      and better understanding of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Survey Collection This is our primary outcome. Before the subject has the procedure, our&#xD;
      research staff will be collecting a survey assessing understanding of procedure and&#xD;
      satisfaction, please see attached survey with appli-cation. This survey will be obtained&#xD;
      according to the interventions detailed in sections 3 &amp; 4.3&#xD;
