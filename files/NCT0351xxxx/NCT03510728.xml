  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large scale surveys indicate that approximately 68% of college students drink alcohol every&#xD;
      month and 40% of college students engage in heavy episodic drinking. Despite&#xD;
      prevention/intervention efforts, problematic alcohol consumption among college students&#xD;
      continues to result in an estimated 1,800 deaths and 600,000 injuries annually, and&#xD;
      epidemiological studies demonstrate no appreciable decrease in risk among college students.&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed research is to improve extant college-drinking interventions by&#xD;
      advancing the dissemination methodology and the intervention content (Specific Aim 1). As a&#xD;
      methodological improvement, rapid advances in mobile computing makes ecological momentary&#xD;
      interventions (EMIs) increasingly feasible. EMIs refer to interventions that can be delivered&#xD;
      multiple times and &quot;in the moment&quot;. EMIs can optimize the timing and location of the&#xD;
      intervention while also increasing the dose of the intervention. To improve the intervention&#xD;
      content, the researchers will examine protective behavioral strategies (PBS) to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol problems, not just alcohol use. PBS are behaviors that one can engage in immediately&#xD;
      prior to, during, and immediately following alcohol use that limit alcohol use and/or&#xD;
      alcohol-related harm. Research suggests that PBS use can protect individuals from alcohol&#xD;
      problems above and beyond its effect on reducing alcohol use. The primary purpose of this&#xD;
      research is to provide a more powerful test of a PBS intervention's effects on&#xD;
      alcohol-related consequences by using a technology-based intervention methodology (i.e.,&#xD;
      EMI). Participants will be randomized into to a fully crossed, 3 (Standard BMI, BMI with a&#xD;
      PBS component, control) X 2 (PBS-based EMI, Ecological Assessment Only) design. These 6&#xD;
      conditions will answer several critically important research questions (Specific Aim 2): a)&#xD;
      does the addition of a PBS component improve the efficacy of a standard BMI, b) does a&#xD;
      PBS-based EMI improve efficacy over the standard, single session BMI, c) does the combination&#xD;
      of motivation-based intervention (BMI) with a skills-based intervention (EMI) yield even&#xD;
      greater decreases in consequences (i.e., moderation). A final purpose of this research is to&#xD;
      examine PBS norms, PBS perceived effectiveness, and motivation to change PBS use as novel&#xD;
      mediators of the improved interventions. Results can be used to disseminate more effective&#xD;
      college drinking interventions that are cheaper and more efficacious.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous alcohol use among college students is a significant public health concern that has&#xD;
      resulted in the development of numerous interventions. Although motivational interviewing&#xD;
      components are effective at reducing problematic alcohol consumption among college students&#xD;
      via reductions in descriptive norms (i.e., the perceived drinking by peers), the effects of&#xD;
      single-session brief motivational interventions (BMIs) on alcohol use and consequences are&#xD;
      relatively short-lived (i.e., 3 months). Guided by a harm-reduction perspective, researchers&#xD;
      have become increasingly interested in how protective behavioral strategies (PBS) can impact&#xD;
      alcohol consequences beyond the effects of reduced alcohol consumption. PBS have been found&#xD;
      to be a robust predictor of alcohol-related problems controlling for consumption, and&#xD;
      multiple intervention studies have found that PBS mediates intervention effects. Few studies,&#xD;
      however, have examined the efficacy of PBS-related intervention components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1a: The researchers will augment and improve extant college alcohol&#xD;
      interventions by developing and rigorously evaluating an added PBS component to an existing&#xD;
      BMI with demonstrated efficacy to further reduce alcohol-related consequences beyond what is&#xD;
      explained by reduced consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional goal of this research is to deliver PBS in a way that capitalizes on newer&#xD;
      technologies that allow for the repeated in vivo delivery of alcohol interventions. Given the&#xD;
      widespread use of handheld devices among the college population, ecological momentary&#xD;
      intervention (EMI) shows great promise in producing lasting behavior for a modest cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1b: The researchers will develop a technology-based, college-drinking ecological&#xD;
      momentary intervention (EMI; a newer, less explored methodology) that is disseminated using&#xD;
      mobile, hand-held devices, which can be used in vivo with every drinking episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterizing Intervention Efficacy. The researchers intend to demonstrate that adding a&#xD;
      PBS-focused component can increase efficacy beyond standard single-session BMIs while keeping&#xD;
      costs minimal. Although the researchers predict that the PBS-based EMI will effect greater&#xD;
      and more lasting decreases in alcohol consequences beyond standard intervention, it is&#xD;
      important to verify that cheaper, single-session alternatives are not as effective (i.e.,&#xD;
      PBS-based BMI). Therefore, the researchers intend to implement a 2 (EMI, Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Assessment only [EMA]) by 3 (no single-session intervention control, standard BMI, BMI plus&#xD;
      PBS component) factorial design. The researchers will characterize the efficacy of the&#xD;
      BMI+PBS and EMI over traditional, single-session BMIs in several ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2a: The researchers will examine whether the EMI methodology effects greater and&#xD;
      more lasting behavior change as compared to the EMA assessment conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish Specific Aim 2a, the researchers will examine the main effect of assessment&#xD;
      (EMI vs. EMA) to demonstrate that the EMI conditions yield better longitudinal outcomes&#xD;
      regardless of the single-session intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2b: The researchers will examine whether the PBS intervention component leads to&#xD;
      reduced alcohol related consequences as compared to a standard BMI, even with a&#xD;
      single-session intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish Specific Aim 2b, the researchers will examine the main effect of the&#xD;
      single-session intervention to demonstrate that a single-session BMI that has been enhanced&#xD;
      by the PBS component will yield superior longitudinal effects relative to a BMI without the&#xD;
      PBS component regardless of assessment style (EMA or EMI); the researchers further expect&#xD;
      both BMI groups to be superior to the no-intervention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2c: The researchers expect the EMI to moderate the single-session intervention,&#xD;
      such that the PBS-BMI coupled with EMI will yield superior longitudinal outcomes on drinking&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers expect the PBS intervention component to be most efficacious when delivered&#xD;
      in vivo during high-risk, alcohol use situations (i.e., EMI), where student motivation and&#xD;
      perceived norms about drinking are most challenged. By using a 2X3 design, the researchers&#xD;
      will be able to verify the synergistic interaction and characterize the effect size of the&#xD;
      relative superiority of the PBS single-session component coupled with the PBS-based EMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of Behavior Change. Unlike the BMI, which relies upon motivation and descriptive&#xD;
      norm changes, the researchers expect the PBS intervention component to have different&#xD;
      mechanisms of behavior change. Specifically, the PBS component is an intervention that&#xD;
      emphasizes skill use rather than motivation. Further, when coupled with EMI, which is a&#xD;
      direct behavioral intervention, the PBS component will effect change by targeting specific&#xD;
      behaviors as opposed to drinking motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To characterize the differential mechanisms of behavior change across the&#xD;
      single-session and EMI interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers expect key differences in the mediating variables across interventions&#xD;
      conditions. The researchers will examine PBS norms, PBS perceived effectiveness, and&#xD;
      motivation to change PBS to ascertain how the researchers can best effect increases in PBS&#xD;
      use in college populations.&#xD;
