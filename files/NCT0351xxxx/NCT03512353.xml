  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to describe the safety profile of carfilzomib plus dexamethasone&#xD;
      regimen in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with 1 to 3 prior lines&#xD;
      of therapy at study entry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study in adults with RRMM in US community oncology&#xD;
      centers. Adults with 1-3 prior lines of therapy at study entry are eligible to be screened&#xD;
      for participation. Patients refractory to their last line of treatment are eligible to&#xD;
      participate as long as their last line of treatment did not include a proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
      (PI). The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days for bone marrow&#xD;
      assessments and up to 21 days for all other assessments, up to 12 cycles of treatment, and a&#xD;
      30-day safety follow-up period following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-item questionnaire used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered on day 1 of each treatment cycle. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).&#xD;
For each of these scales, scores range from 0 to 100. For the GHS and 5 functional scales a high score indicates better global health status/functioning and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. For the 9 symptom scales, a high score indicates a higher level of symptoms, and a negative change from Baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last Cycle of Treatment in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Core 30 (C30)</title>
        <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-item questionnaire used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered on day 1 of each treatment cycle. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).&#xD;
For each of these scales, scores range from 0 to 100. For the GHS and 5 functional scales a high score indicates better global health status/functioning and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. For the 9 symptom scales, a high score indicates a higher level of symptoms, and a negative change from Baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Last Cycle of Treatment in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Core 30 (C30)</title>
          <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30-item questionnaire used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered on day 1 of each treatment cycle. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).&#xD;
For each of these scales, scores range from 0 to 100. For the GHS and 5 functional scales a high score indicates better global health status/functioning and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. For the 9 symptom scales, a high score indicates a higher level of symptoms, and a negative change from Baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Cycle 7 Day 1 in Average EORTC QLQ-C30 Scores During Cycles 8 to 12 in Participants Who Completed 12 Cycles of Treatment</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 was administered on day 1 of each treatment cycle. EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).&#xD;
For each of these scales, scores range from 0 to 100. For the GHS and 5 functional scales a high score indicates better global health status/functioning and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. For the 9 symptom scales, a high score indicates a higher level of symptoms, and a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.&#xD;
Change was calculated as the difference in the average score from cycles 8 to 12 and the score on cycle 7 day 1.</description>

            <description>Participants received carfilzomib administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion twice-weekly for up to six 28-day cycles followed by once-weekly for another six 28-day cycles. The carfilzomib dose was 20 mg/m² on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1, 56 mg/m² for the remaining days of cycle 1 (days 8, 9, 15, and 16) and then on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle for cycles 2 to 6, and 70 mg/m² on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle for cycles 7 to 12.&#xD;
Participants also received dexamethasone either orally or by IV infusion at a dose of 20 mg once daily on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of cycles 1 to 6 and at a dose 40 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 of cycles 7 to 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last Cycle of Treatment in EORTC QLQ Multiple Myeloma Module (MY-20) Scores</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a 20-item questionnaire used in clinical research to assess health-related quality of life in multiple myeloma patients. Questions are answered on a 4-point scale from 1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'.&#xD;
The QLQ-MY20 includes four domains (Disease Symptoms, Side-Effects of Treatment, Body Image and Future Perspective).&#xD;
Domain scores are calculated as averages and transformed to range from 0 to 100.&#xD;
For the Disease symptoms and side-effects of treatments scales a higher score represents a higher level of symptoms/problems and a negative change from baseline value indicates reduction (i.e. improvement) in symptoms. For the body image and future perspectives scales a higher score represents a higher level of functioning, and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

For the body image and future perspectives scales a higher score represents a higher level of functioning, and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement.&#xD;
Change from baseline is the difference in the average score from cycles 2 to 6 and the score on cycle 1 day 1.</description>

          <description>EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a 20-item questionnaire used in clinical research to assess health-related quality of life in multiple myeloma patients. Questions are answered on a 4-point scale from 1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'.&#xD;
The QLQ-MY20 includes four domains (Disease Symptoms, Side-effects of Treatment, Body Image and Future Perspective).&#xD;
Domain scores are calculated as averages and transformed to range from 0 to 100.&#xD;
For the disease symptoms and side-effects of treatment scales a higher score represents a higher level of symptoms/problems and a negative change from baseline value indicates reduction (i.e. improvement) in symptoms.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Because of the limited sample size, no meaningful conclusions on the study objectives can be made.</limitations_and_caveats>
