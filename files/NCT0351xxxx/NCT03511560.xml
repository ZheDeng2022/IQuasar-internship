  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one year, prospective, randomized, open-label trial examining once versus twice&#xD;
      daily tacrolimus dosing regimen using two preparations, extended-release Tacrolimus (Envarsus&#xD;
      XR) versus twice daily Tacrolimus (Prograf). It will examine kidney function between the two&#xD;
      groups using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and also examine one-year kidney&#xD;
      outcomes, including graft loss and patient death. Patients will be followed for up to 1 year&#xD;
      during the open-label study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite lower rates of acute rejection and short-term improvements in patient and graft&#xD;
      survival, the rate of late allograft loss following kidney transplantation has remained&#xD;
      unchanged. Achievement of therapeutic, minimally toxic, tacrolimus concentrations early&#xD;
      (within 30 days), after transplantation, is known to be important since achieving it has been&#xD;
      associated with a lowered risk of acute rejection. The investigators hypothesize that using&#xD;
      extended release tacrolimus (Envarsus XR, Veloxis), will provide more stable, more effective,&#xD;
      and less toxic levels of tacrolimus in renal allograft recipients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to analyze the impact of the blood concentration normalized by the dose&#xD;
      (C/D ratio) on kidney function after renal transplantation in experimental group that will be&#xD;
      treated with Envarsus XR and the standard of care (SOC) group treated with twice a day&#xD;
      tacrolimus.&#xD;
