  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to demonstrate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of CNSA-001 in reducing blood phenylalanine concentrations in participants with&#xD;
      hyperphenylalaninemia due to primary tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BH4 is an essential cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan&#xD;
      hydroxylase, fatty acid glycerylether oxygenase, and nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Primary&#xD;
      tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (PBD) is caused by deficiency of GTP cyclohydrolase I&#xD;
      (GTP-CH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), or sepiapterin reductase (SR) that&#xD;
      impairs the biosynthesis of BH4 or by defects in BH4 recycling (pterin-4a-carbinolamine&#xD;
      dehydratase [PCD] or dihydropteridine reductase [DHPR] deficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of 2 cohorts, with each cohort assessing 2 dose&#xD;
      levels of CNSA-001 via intra-patient escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, only adult participant(s) (≥18 years) will be enrolled. After the first adult&#xD;
      participant(s) have completed the study, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data, including preliminary efficacy, for&#xD;
      the adult participant(s). If the data display no safety issues and provide for the prospect&#xD;
      of clinical benefit in participants ≥12 months to &lt;18 years old, then the eligibility&#xD;
      criterion for age at time of enrollment will be expanded to include children (≥12 months).&#xD;
