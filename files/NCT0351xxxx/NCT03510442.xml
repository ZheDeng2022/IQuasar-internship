      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory conditions can cause symptoms like fevers, arthritis, and rash. Systemic&#xD;
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is one of these conditions. So is adult-onset Still s&#xD;
      disease (AOSD). Their causes are unknown. Researchers want to learn more about these&#xD;
      conditions. This includes genetic changes and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study sJIA and AOSD in children and adults over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with known or suspected sJIA, AOSD, or similar inflammatory condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 visit. It may be outpatient or they may be admitted to the clinic.&#xD;
      The visit may last up to 5 days. Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Musculoskeletal exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about overall health and quality of life, disease activity, functional status,&#xD;
           and cognitive ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pictures taken of their skin, joints, or spine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and stool tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans or X-rays of joints with arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy. The skin will be numbed. The top layers of a small area will be scraped&#xD;
           off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a joint aspiration may provide a fluid sample. The joint will be&#xD;
      prepared, then fluid is removed by needle. A corticosteroid may be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a bone marrow biopsy may provide sample cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be seen by NIH specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the participant s family and healthy volunteers may give blood or saliva samples&#xD;
      for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may repeat some study tests every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history, genetics and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), adult-onset Still s disease (AOSD) and related&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions. One of seven subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), sJIA&#xD;
      contributes disproportionately to the morbidity and mortality of JIA and is considered by&#xD;
      many to be the most severe JIA subtype. sJIA typically presents with fever of unknown origin&#xD;
      and arthritis, together with evanescent skin rash, serositis, hepatosplenomegaly and&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy. It is strongly associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which&#xD;
      has a high fatality rate when untreated. AOSD is phenotypically similar to sJIA in&#xD;
      presentation, progression and association with MAS, however it develops after the 16th&#xD;
      birthday. The causes sJIA and AOSD are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sJIA and AOSD are diagnoses of exclusion and there are often delays in their diagnosis due to&#xD;
      the stringency of their classification criteria. There is no diagnostic test for sJIA/AOSD&#xD;
      and there exists significant overlap with other conditions. The manifestations and severity&#xD;
      of disease can differ among patients, further delaying the diagnosis. There is also&#xD;
      considerable variability in both patient response to therapy and long-term outcomes, and&#xD;
      there exist no therapeutic or prognostic biomarkers to guide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given our limited understanding of the causes, treatments and prognostic factors of sJIA, we&#xD;
      developed this protocol to longitudinally follow patients with sJIA/AOSD and investigate&#xD;
      these topics. The specific goals of this protocol include: 1) Establishing a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with sJIA/AOSD and assembling a detailed set of longitudinal clinical information;&#xD;
      2) Identifying genetic factors that cause or influence susceptibility to sJIA/AOSD; 3)&#xD;
      Determining the functional relevance of genes and variants that influence sJIA/AOSD; and 4)&#xD;
      Developing a molecular library of patient biological samples which may be used to further&#xD;
      investigate sJIA/AOSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will undergo screening history, physical examination and&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation. At times, we may ask for permission to evaluate additional family&#xD;
      members. We will collect peripheral blood samples for genetic and functional studies from&#xD;
      affected patients, unrelated healthy volunteers and in some cases patients family members. We&#xD;
      will ask permission to perform whole genome/exome sequencing. We also may ask some patients&#xD;
      to undergo skin biopsy for research purposes. This study aims to elucidate genetic factors&#xD;
      that contribute to sJIA/AOSD and related conditions and to determine their implications on&#xD;
      inflammatory pathophysiology. By so doing, we hope to identify novel therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      inflammatory disease.&#xD;

        below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients less than 16 years of age will be considered to have sJIA if they meet the&#xD;
             ILAR criteria for sJIA.&#xD;
&#xD;

          1. Patients 16 years of age and older will be considered to have AOSD if they meet the&#xD;
             Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD (including a negative ANA and RF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may be considered to have a diagnosis of AOSD if they met criteria for&#xD;
             diagnosis in the past but do not still have present evidence of disease.&#xD;
