      Patients who have completed have completed a cumulative dose of &gt;=120miligram/kilogram oral&#xD;
      isotretinoin within the last 30 days, and has mild to moderate acne scarring will be&#xD;
      randomized, into a right-left comparison study using Fraxel DUAL (Solta Medical) laser on one&#xD;
      side of the face, and no treatment on the other side of the face. Subejcts will receive&#xD;
      treatments at week 0, week 4, and week 8. Photographs will be taken after each treatment, 7&#xD;
      days after each treatment, and 4 months after last treatment. Photographs will be reviewed by&#xD;
      blind assessors who will analyze the pre- and post-treatment photographs to measure change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15 patients who are over 18 years or older, have completed a cumulative dose of&#xD;
      &gt;=120miligram/kilogram oral isotretinoin within the last 30 days, and has mild to moderate&#xD;
      acne scarring will be randomized, into a right-left comparison study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One side of the face will be randomized to NAFR treatment and other side to control (no&#xD;
      treatment) using a random number generator. Subjects will apply topical anesthetic&#xD;
      (Benzocaine / Lidocaine / Tetracaine 20% / 8% / 4% Ointment) to the entire face one hour&#xD;
      prior to treatment. The NAFR operator will be notified of which side is to be treated with&#xD;
      NAFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure blinded evaluations, the same unblinded investigator will perform all the laser&#xD;
      treatments, whereas efficacy evaluations will be performed by two trained and experienced&#xD;
      evaluators who are blinded to the treatment assignment. Evaluations for adverse effects will&#xD;
      be carried out by the unblinded NAFR (during and immediately post treatment) and the two&#xD;
      blinded investigators at prescribed intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser procedure will be performed to the entire assigned half of the face with Fraxel DUAL&#xD;
      (Solta Medical) with the following settings: 1550 nanometer; 35 to 40&#xD;
      millijoules/microthermal zone, treatment level from 7 to 10, corresponding to treatment&#xD;
      coverage of 20% to 35%. The treatment protocol was modified slightly depending on the&#xD;
      individual scar characteristics (depth, width, and type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive a total of three laser treatments using NAFR. Successive treatments&#xD;
      will be separated by 1 month. During all treatments, pain will be assessed as ''mild,&#xD;
      moderate, or severe.'' Post-treatment instructions will include the use of a mild soap,&#xD;
      sunscreen in the morning, and a non-comedogenic moisturizing cream in the evening twice daily&#xD;
      for three days. Oral valacyclovir (1 gram daily) will be prescribed for patients for&#xD;
      prophylaxis of herpetic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographic documentation using identical camera settings, lighting, and patient positioning&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline, before each treatment session, 7-days after each session, and 4&#xD;
      months after the final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound healing will be assessed after 7 days of each treatment and at the end of the study (4&#xD;
      month after last treatment) in all patients. This will be performed by 2 blinded evaluators&#xD;
      who will analyze the pre and post-treatment photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints will be improvement of acne scarring, assessment of treatment&#xD;
      tolerability (adverse effects, pain assessment, and patient satisfaction and preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in acne scarring will be graded by two independent blinded physicians using a&#xD;
      quartile grading scale (1 = 1% to 25%, 2 =26% to 50%, 3 =51% to 75%, 4 = &gt;76%). All grading&#xD;
      physicians will be blinded to the total number of treatments and which photographs were&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up at 4 month after last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations for immediate and delayed adverse effects of the treatments, including erythema,&#xD;
      edema, blistering, crusting, scarring, and hyperpigmentation, graded on a 4-point scale (0 =&#xD;
      absent, 1= mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) will be carried out at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also assess the intensity of pain post-treatment using a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (0 = absence of pain, 10 = most-severe pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment of efficacy would be reflected by their judgment of which side of the face&#xD;
      responded best to treatment. Patient preference can then be assessed at the end of the study&#xD;
      asking, &quot;would you recommend NAFR treatment for acne scarring to others?&quot;&#xD;
