    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective randomized controlled study comparing the postoperative&#xD;
      outcome after cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer patient after using restrictive or&#xD;
      individualized goal-directed fluid replacement strategy (GDT). Aim of this study will be to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that intra-operative SVV-guided fluid optimization during ovarian cancer&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduces the postoperative length of hospital stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cost-effective,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. GDT will be more beneficial in cases of PDS compared to IDS or cytoreductive procedures&#xD;
           of shorter duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. GDT improves intraoperative tissue perfusion/ oxygenation and improves immediate&#xD;
           postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively fluid of choice in both groups will be lactate-free crystalloid at 1.0&#xD;
      ml/kg/h for maintenance and gelofusine for fluid bolus of 3ml/kg over 5 minutes. In group C&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid therapy will include maintenance fluid and replacement of the surgical&#xD;
      loss. Aim will be to maintain MAP &gt; 65 mmHg, CVP 8-12 cm H2O and urine output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/h.&#xD;
      In group G intraoperative fluid therapy will be targeted to SVV &lt;13%, SVI &gt; 35ml/m2/ beat,&#xD;
      SVRI more than equal to 1900 dynes-sec/cm-5/m2 in addition to clinical parameters like MAP,&#xD;
      CVP and urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes will be cost of&#xD;
      surgical treatment episode (admission till fit to discharge), postoperative morbidity survey&#xD;
      (POMS) and 30 day morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      Aims &amp; objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that intra-operative SVV-guided fluid&#xD;
      optimization during ovarian cancer cytoreductive surgery -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduces the postoperative length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GDT is more cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. GDT will be more beneficial in cases of PDS compared to IDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. GDT reduces postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer is usually associated with significant fluid shift&#xD;
      attributable to suboptimal nutritional status, prolonged preoperative starvation,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood and fluid loss, pharmacological vasodilation by neuraxial (epidural) and&#xD;
      systemic anaesthetic drugs, intraoperative evaporative loss and the vasodilation due to&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response to surgery (SIRS), which was comparatively more in case of&#xD;
      ovarian surgery. This results in hypotension and altered hemodynamics in the intra-operative&#xD;
      and immediate&#xD;
&#xD;
      post-operative settings and the need for rigorous hemodynamic monitoring in the perioperative&#xD;
      period. Among 3 different strategies, liberal or conservative one is associated with risk of&#xD;
      overhydration, whereas restrictive therapy can cause hypoperfusion and related complications.&#xD;
      A goal-directed fluid therapy has been shown to optimise intravascular volume in major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, which is the key determinant of cardiac output and oxygen delivery to&#xD;
      tissues. This strategy results in use of more advanced hemodynamic monitors and increased&#xD;
      costs thereof, and possibly, more total fluid requirements. A restrictive fluid strategy&#xD;
      targeting physiological parameters alone, utilizes less costly modalities of monitoring and&#xD;
      less overall fluid infused. But total healthcare cost associated with reduced rate of&#xD;
      complications and thereby less hospital stay can neutralize that extra-cost of advanced&#xD;
      monitoring (approximately Rs 8,000 per patient for consumables) and become more cost&#xD;
      effective. The current standard of care in Tata Medical Center (TMC) has been a fluid therapy&#xD;
      guided by clinical parameters. Although there is strong evidence supporting goal-directed&#xD;
      approach to perioperative fluid therapy in case of major abdominal surgery, which has also&#xD;
      been incorporated in enhanced recovery protocol and adopted worldwide, there is no such&#xD;
      evidence for gynaec-oncological surgery, especially in ovarian cancer. So, investigators&#xD;
      would like to conduct the proposed study to find-out the optimal fluid management strategy&#xD;
      for ovarian cytoreductive surgery. As previously mentioned, investigators' data might&#xD;
      indicate that the standard approach may lead to tissue hypoperfusion and approximately 2-3&#xD;
      liters of deficit which needs replacement under monitoring in order to avoid fluid overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arguably, all patients of major cytoreductive surgery should require goal directed therapy&#xD;
      and therefore randomization can potentially harm a subset of patients who would then receive&#xD;
      restricted therapy instead of goal directed therapy. However, the standard regimen which is&#xD;
      currently used in our setting is restrictive and SVV is also being increasingly used&#xD;
      routinely only at the clinician's discretion including in ovarian cancer cases. Therefore no&#xD;
      harm is anticipated from this intervention in either group. The only implication is of cost&#xD;
      and resources; goal directed therapy has resource implications- both in terms of availability&#xD;
      of machine and additional cost to the patient due to the consumables. A non-randomized&#xD;
      prospective observational study would be feasible but will not be able to select which&#xD;
      patients would benefit maximum from GDT due to selection bias. Therefore, a randomized study&#xD;
      may help to identify a select group of patients who might benefit the maximum and therefore&#xD;
      SVV directed fluid administration could be further stratified to be cost-effective due to&#xD;
      reduction of postoperative length of hospital stay and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From personal communication investigators know that, 3 trials of perioperative fluid therapy&#xD;
      are ongoing now in India. Out of those 3 trials, 2 are in abdominal surgery and one is in&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) surgery. Other cancer centers expressed&#xD;
      interest to undertake similar trial in ovarian cytoreductive surgery. Therefore investigators&#xD;
      may collaborate with other centers in future for a larger study based on the results;&#xD;
      however, at present a single institutional study will be conducted to minimize bias&#xD;
      associated with heterogeneity in surgical practice on cytoreduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help investigators to guide fluid therapy in the perioperative period in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients undergoing cytoreductive surgeries. This study should also help to&#xD;
      find a strategy to prevent both fluid overload as well as under filling to avoid hypo&#xD;
      perfusion and organ damage in this vulnerable group of patients. This strategy can even be&#xD;
      adopted in other patient populations undergoing colorectal, hepatobiliary, thoraco-abdominal&#xD;
      and HIPEC surgeries. These data will also inform whether a stratified approach can be adopted&#xD;
      to selectively use SVV monitoring according to the predicted surgical complexity, type of&#xD;
      cytoreduction and duration of surgery to optimize resources and improve cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks This study will utilize an existing technology, which is already in use. Therefore SOPs&#xD;
      will be followed including reporting of adverse events, monitoring, documentation and safety&#xD;
      reporting. The intervention is fluid bolus guided by advanced haemodynamic parameters (EV1000&#xD;
      monitor). Therefore risks are theoretical only. Risks related to the invasive procedures are&#xD;
      same in both arms, which include pneumothorax, haemothorax, haemo-pneumothorax, bleeding,&#xD;
      catheter-related infection and peripheral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site of Study OT complex and Intensive Care Unit, Department of Anaesthesiology &amp; Critical&#xD;
      Care, Tata Medical Center, Kolkata&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Structure Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized controlled trial - Patients and assessors will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: All ovarian cancer patients undergoing major debulking surgery at TMC Kolkata&#xD;
      (except- completion staging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design was based on a retrospective audit at TMC that found the current median&#xD;
      postoperative length of stay to be 10 days after cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer. To&#xD;
      detect a reduction of 2 post-operative days with median postoperative length of stay to be 10&#xD;
      days in the restrictive group and 8 days in the goal directed group with a SD=3 days for 80%&#xD;
      power at a significance level of 0.05, 37 patients are needed in each group (Total=74). As&#xD;
      there is a difference in the median postoperative length of stay between the PDS and IDS&#xD;
      group as mentioned earlier, at least 20 patients in each of the IDS and PDS groups would be&#xD;
      needed for both the goal directed and restrictive group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the study would continue till each of the four combinations: Goal Directed (IDS), Goal&#xD;
      Directed (PDS), Control (IDS) and Control (PDS) have at least 20 patients. To account for&#xD;
      possible 10% attrition rate/ loss to follow up, 44 patients would be required in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to having higher median LOS in hospital, patients undergoing PDS are more likely&#xD;
      to have ascites, major peritoneal stripping, higher surgical complexities and intraoperative&#xD;
      fluid loss. Therefore, pre-randomization stratification will be done for type of surgery.&#xD;
      Patients would be enrolled separately into PDS and IDS groups. Then for each group, patients&#xD;
      would be randomized to get the standard or the goal directed therapy mentioned in the sealed&#xD;
      envelopes based on computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization and inclusion into a study arm, patients will be excluded in an event of&#xD;
      the following: the procedure is abandoned/ open and close, duration of procedure is less than&#xD;
      4 hours, and any critical incident during operation (i.e. major blood loss/ medical&#xD;
      condition/ shock) requiring intense fluid resuscitation. Following factors will be analyzed&#xD;
      for univariate and multivariate analysis: ASA status, duration of surgery in minutes,&#xD;
      surgical complexity score, intraoperative fluid loss, total vs. partial peritonectomy,&#xD;
      comorbidities (Possum-P), massive blood loss and transfusion. Analysis will be on a per&#xD;
      protocol basis as well as intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the envelope would be opened after induction of GA, the patient will be blinded to&#xD;
           the group she is allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative data will be collected by the ICU Consultant/ medical officer and&#xD;
           Gynaec-oncosurgery team, who would not be part of the study and unaware about the&#xD;
           allocation will follow up patients and decide on fitness to discharge. Outcome will also&#xD;
           be verified according to predefined criteria by other clinicians from Gynaec-oncosurgery&#xD;
           team, who are not aware about the allocated study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses and all summary tables and listings will be prepared using SASÒ&#xD;
      release 8.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Standard descriptive summaries will&#xD;
      include the N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous&#xD;
      variables, and the number and percent for categorical variables. All statistical test of&#xD;
      comparison will be based on 5% level of significance.&#xD;
