  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab when given with glycosylated recombinant&#xD;
      human interleukin-7 (CYT107) works in treating patients with urothelial carcinoma that has&#xD;
      spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (inoperable), or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. CYT107 is a&#xD;
      biological product naturally made by the body that may stimulate the immune system to destroy&#xD;
      tumor cells. Giving atezolizumab and CYT107 may work better in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced, inoperable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma compared to atezolizumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of the investigational treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical activity and toxicity of the investigational treatment&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR), as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and&#xD;
      immune-related (ir) RECIST, and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. The CBR, PFS, DOR, and OS in all patients and patients stratified by PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      levels in the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. The safety and toxicity of addition of CYT107 to atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the immune correlates of the clinical activity of the investigational&#xD;
      treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the effect of the investigational treatment combination on the number and&#xD;
      phenotype of tumor-specific T cells in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Investigate for evidence that the investigational treatment combination increases the&#xD;
      exposure of bladder cancer-specific antigens (e.g., cancer/testis antigens or neoantigens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Investigate changes in tumor microenvironment that correlate with response or provide&#xD;
      information on potential actionable causes for lack of clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Investigate the potential that administration of atezolizumab with CYT107 may perturb the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of CYT107.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: Patients receive CYT107 intramuscularly (IM) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and&#xD;
      atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1. Following cycle 1,&#xD;
      patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles with atezolizumab repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;
