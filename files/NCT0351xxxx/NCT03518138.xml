    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) study designed to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Q-122 for the treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) versus placebo. Participants who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria following the Screening/Run-In period will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms; blinded Q-122 or placebo for a period of 28 days. All participants will be&#xD;
      followed for a 2-week, drug-free, follow-up period after their last dose of blinded&#xD;
      Q-122/placebo before termination from the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are significant in postmenopausal women with the most effective&#xD;
      medications for relief being hormonal preparations. Non-hormonal medications have&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy but at a far lower level than estrogen replacement therapy. For women&#xD;
      with a history of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and is&#xD;
      not an option for women receiving endocrine therapy including tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AI). Breast cancer survivors, and women receiving endocrine therapy in&#xD;
      particular, have a high rate of problematic hot flashes. In an open label Phase 1 study of&#xD;
      the safety and activity of Q-122 in breast cancer patients taking TAM or an AI, 8 of 9 women&#xD;
      who received at least 1 dose of 100 mg and 10 of 11 women who received at least 1 dose of 200&#xD;
      mg had a reduction in hot flashes of 2 or more per day, the FDA criteria for anti-VMS&#xD;
      activity. This study will define the effect of Q-122 versus placebo in a population of women&#xD;
      with a history of or current breast cancer who have an average of 50 or more moderate to&#xD;
      severe hot flashes per week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be a female, aged between 18 - 70 years on the day of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a history of or current breast cancer and currently taking tamoxifen or an&#xD;
             aromatase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. On a stable dose of TAM or an AI for a minimum of 30 days before the Screening Visit&#xD;
             and no anticipated need to change the dose for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Experience an average of at least 50 moderate to severe hot flashes/week for the 2&#xD;
             weeks immediately preceding the Run-In Visit (i.e., during the Screening period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If on thyroid medication, on a stable dose for a minimum of 30 days before the&#xD;
             Screening Visit and no anticipated need to change the dose for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to complete the daily participant diary, attend all study visits, and&#xD;
             participate in all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Childbearing potential, pregnancy, or lactation except in patients who are on stable&#xD;
             dose of AI in combination with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists such as&#xD;
             Zoladex, Leuprolide (Lupron) or equivalent. Non-childbearing potential is defined as&#xD;
             physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a partial or complete hysterectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has had a bilateral tubal ligation or fallopian tube inserts or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal (amenorrhea &gt; 1 year) confirmed by levels of follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH levels may be lower in menopausal women treated&#xD;
                  with tamoxifen when compared with FSH levels appropriate for confirming menopause&#xD;
                  in women not treated with tamoxifen. For those patients who are on stable dose of&#xD;
                  tamoxifen, confirmation of menopause is based on the clinical opinion of the PI&#xD;
                  and medical monitor on a 'case-by-case basis'.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Currently experiencing undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women with advanced breast cancer (Stage 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Greater than 60% reduction in the frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes during&#xD;
             the 1-week single blind Run-In period or inability to correctly record hot flashes&#xD;
             and/or drug dosing in the participant diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participation in another clinical or surgical trial within 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
             or during the study without the prior written consent of the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gastrointestinal, liver, kidney or other conditions which could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of Q-122 at PI discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Untreated overt hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have any other medical condition, clinically important systemic disease or significant&#xD;
             co-morbidities or any finding during Screening that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator puts the participant at increased risk by participation in this study, or&#xD;
             that may affect the reliability of participant diary entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known inability to complete all study visits and study assessments for scheduling or&#xD;
             other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2; Participants with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 may be enrolled on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis if approved by the Medical Monitor and if the participant is not&#xD;
             deemed at increased risk of adverse effects based on body habitus and cardiovascular&#xD;
             health.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women with a history of, or current evidence of, abuse of alcohol or any drug&#xD;
             substance, or who regularly drink more than 3 standard drinks per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Uncontrolled systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mmHg on&#xD;
             3 consecutive readings within the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Abnormal laboratory findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hemoglobin &lt; 9.5 g/dL (g/L); or any abnormal values that are deemed clinically&#xD;
                  significant by the investigator should be discussed with the medical monitor&#xD;
                  before being deemed ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Fasting ALT, AST, GGT, or bilirubin greater than twice the upper limit of normal&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. In the opinion of the investigator, have substantial risk of disease progression&#xD;
             within the 3 months following screening and/or who potentially may require further&#xD;
             treatment for their breast cancer during the study period including follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any other reason which in the investigator's opinion makes the participant unsuitable&#xD;
             for a clinical trial.&#xD;
