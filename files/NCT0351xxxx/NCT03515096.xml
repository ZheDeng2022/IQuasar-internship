      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of eltrombopag vs rhTPO in complete response&#xD;
      in patients after HSCT in China. This is a post-marketing, interventional, single-center,&#xD;
      double-arm, prospective, open-label, equivalent, randomized controlled study in adult&#xD;
      patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in China. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      consecutively from the study sites during the enrollment period. The enrolled patients will&#xD;
      be given eltrombopag or rhTPO under the conditions of informed consent and frequent&#xD;
      monitoring according to the clinical guideline.&#xD;

      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an important method to treat malignant&#xD;
      tumor of blood system, and promoting platelets after HSCT is one of the important factors to&#xD;
      determine the success of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the main effective method to treat thrombocytopenia after transplantation is to&#xD;
      preventively transfuse platelets. However, this method can cause platelet transfusion related&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease(GVHD), increase the risk of reaction and infection associated with&#xD;
      blood transfusion, easily produce platelet related and specific antibodies (HPA), which&#xD;
      seriously affect the curative effect of platelet infusion and even render platelet&#xD;
      transfusion invalid. Besides, study has shown that the effective rate of platelet transfusion&#xD;
      is 30%-70%, and the application of platelets in clinic is limited because of the shortage of&#xD;
      blood supply at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) is a glycoprotein molecule modified by full-length&#xD;
      glycosylation and is of a similar pharmacological effect with endogenous thrombopoietin&#xD;
      (TPO). TPO is a specific cytokine of megakaryocyte, which can promote the proliferation and&#xD;
      maturation of macronuclear progenitor cells by binding to the receptor c-mpl. In addition,&#xD;
      the chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) approved rhTPO for the treatment of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia after tumor chemotherapy in 2006. The study shows that rhTPO can increase&#xD;
      the mean value of platelet count in the low period of platelet, shorten the time of low&#xD;
      platelet, and improve the peripheral blood platelet aggregation rate in the bone marrow&#xD;
      depression period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is the first oral non-peptide receptor (TPO-R) agonist, which can induce the&#xD;
      proliferation and maturation of macronuclear progenitor cells via the Janus kinase (JAK)&#xD;
      /signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. In 2008, the U.S. FDA&#xD;
      approved the use of eltrombopag for the treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and&#xD;
      it has been widely used in tumor patients with thrombocytopenia after chemotherapy. Tanaka et&#xD;
      al. have proved that eltrombopag can improve the average elevation of the platelet count in&#xD;
      the bone marrow depression period in patients with stem cell transplantation. Besides, within&#xD;
      the 9 patients receiving transplantation, the complete response of patients with primary and&#xD;
      secondary thrombocytopenia were 60% and 71% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, studies showed that rhTPO could promote the recovery of platelet count, effectively&#xD;
      reduce the infusion of platelet, decrease the risk of transplanting hemorrhage in acute&#xD;
      leukemia patients after allo-HSCT. However, it is not clear that the effect of eltrombopag on&#xD;
      improving platelet count after the treatment of HSCT. In addition, the comparison of efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of eltrombopag vs rhTPO on platelet recovery after HSCT in clinical trial is not&#xD;
      investigated. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      eltrombopag and rhTPO in improving the recovery of platelet count after HSCT, which will&#xD;
      provide a better method to recover platelet after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Eltrombopag vs rhTPO in complete&#xD;
      response in patients after HSCT in China. To be more precise, Eltrombopag is taken 50 mg po&#xD;
      daily from day 1 until platelet is completely effectively recovered after HSCT, while rhTPO&#xD;
      is given by subcutaneous injection 15000 u daily from day 1 until platelet is completely&#xD;
      effectively recovered after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete response (CR) is defined as a platelet count more than 50×109/L without injection of&#xD;
      platelet for 7 days. Partial response (PR) is defined as a platelet count more than 30×109/L&#xD;
      without injection of platelet for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 21 days' treatment, a follow-up of all patients will be performed every week in the&#xD;
      following 3 months.&#xD;
