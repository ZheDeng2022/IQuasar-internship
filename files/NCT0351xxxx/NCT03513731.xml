  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, single site safety and efficacy study&#xD;
      in subjects suffering from chronic lumber back pain due to facet joint osteoarthritis&#xD;
      comparing a single ADRC injection generated with the TransposeÂ® RT system into the facet&#xD;
      joint.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will fall into two categories: treatment group (20 subjects) and non-treatment or&#xD;
      control group (20 subjects). The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure&#xD;
      and receive facet joint osteoarthritis treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5 ml&#xD;
      adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into the point of injury. The control group will receive a&#xD;
      5 ml corticosteroid injection into the point of injury&#xD;
