  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine within-person variations of different contexts (time, physical,&#xD;
      psychosocial and affective) of active life engagement, and how these variations predict a set&#xD;
      of physiological indicators and health-related outcomes among community-dwelling older&#xD;
      people. Specifically, this study has the following objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To investigate within-person variations in different contexts (i.e., time,&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial, and affective) of active life engagement and interactions of these&#xD;
      contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To examine how within-person variations in different contexts (i.e., time,&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial, and affective) of active life engagement and interactions of these&#xD;
      contexts may associate with a set of cardiovascular indicators measured on daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To examine how within-person variations in different contexts (i.e., time,&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial, and affective) of active life engagement and interactions of these&#xD;
      contexts may associate with a set of health-related outcomes (e.g., physical functioning,&#xD;
      depression, health-related quality of life).&#xD;

      1. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 70 participants from the community with the help from staffs from&#xD;
      community service center. Investigators recruited participants who aged 60 or older and lived&#xD;
      in the community independently, and screened participants for eligibility based on the&#xD;
      following exclusionary criteria: (1) unable to complete brief survey presented in mobile&#xD;
      devices (e.g., have severe visual deficits or other self-report difficulty reading the&#xD;
      screen), (2) diagnosed with a cognition disorder, (4) diagnosed with a mental disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Self-administered questionnaire survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be asked to complete the baseline self-administrated survey on line&#xD;
      (in some cases, participants could be organized to complete the survey under the guide of the&#xD;
      research staff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Training sessions/orientation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible participants will be invited to attend the training session/orientation. The&#xD;
      research staff will assign each participant a Android phone installed with a&#xD;
      researcher-developed application and a mobile-electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device. The&#xD;
      participants will be briefed on its basic functions and how to use the application and device&#xD;
      to provide data. The whole session will take steps proactively to increase participants'&#xD;
      confidence and comfort with using the electronic band and the real-time assessment&#xD;
      application through in-person training and mutual support between participants. Detailed&#xD;
      take-home handbook (hardcopy or electronic version) that cover the use guidelines of the&#xD;
      electronic bans and the real-time assessment application, and troubleshooting help, will be&#xD;
      distributed to participants. Then, two warm-up days prior to the main study will be conducted&#xD;
      and on-call help will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Real-time assessment survey of daily experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
      The real-time assessment application will allow each user to register a personal account, and&#xD;
      to define their person-specific time-frame for the procedure, in specific, the start and the&#xD;
      end time in a typical day they accept the signaling. The time frame will basically cover the&#xD;
      user's waking hours (approximately 7 Â± 3 hours). Within the defined time frame, the mobile&#xD;
      device with the application will randomly prompt the user to complete a report for 6 times.&#xD;
      The minimum and the maximum time between two consecutive signals will be 30 and 150 minutes&#xD;
      respectively. The device will correctly record each response time once sending the signal. If&#xD;
      the device receives no response for over 20 minutes, substitute prompts will be automatically&#xD;
      sent every 5 minutes for 2 times. If still no response, a missing will be recorded. This&#xD;
      procedure will be repeated on 7 consecutive days, with different random patterns for each&#xD;
      day. For answering one signaling report, it will take approximately 3 to 5 minutes for most&#xD;
      users (a total of less than 30 min per day). The content of report will be the same each&#xD;
      time, which will comprise questions on engagement in daily activities, individual&#xD;
      distractions, mood, and social systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Physiological data provision&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological data will be collected concurrently during the 7 consecutive days for real-time&#xD;
      data collection. All participants will be required to carry the mobile-ECG device assigned to&#xD;
      them during the whole process of data collection. They will use the smartphone-based&#xD;
      application and the mobile-ECG device to provide a 30-second ECG recording for six times each&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. In-person follow-up survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete the open-ended questions focusing on the&#xD;
      feasibility/acceptability of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No drug usage and medical treatment will be involved in the study. Intensive assessment do&#xD;
      not impose any physical or medical risk to participants. The only possible problem is that&#xD;
      the intensive assessment may interfere with the participants' normal daily routines.&#xD;
      Participants can voluntarily drop out the study at any time, without giving any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-individual variability in the activity engagement will be analyzed by calculating the&#xD;
      standard-deviation for each participant's timing of each domains of engagement resulting in&#xD;
      an intra-individual standard deviation (iSD). In order to model within-person change and&#xD;
      between-person factors simultaneously, two alternative statistical methods, namely, time&#xD;
      series analysis and random coefficient multilevel modelling will be used. Multiple&#xD;
      hierarchical regression analyses will be conducted with activity indicators predicting health&#xD;
      and well-being outcomes.&#xD;
