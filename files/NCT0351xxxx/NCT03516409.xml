  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is defined as an acute inflammation of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa associated to the administration of antibiotics. Its aetiology seems to be&#xD;
      linked to the impact of antibiotics on the normal digestive microbiota. Acute otitis media&#xD;
      (AOM) is a common paediatric condition and it is one of the most commonly cited indication&#xD;
      for antimicrobial therapy in children (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modalities for AAD are limited because no established treatment exists for&#xD;
      non-Clostridium difficile associated AAD, except for discontinuing antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
      Measures to prevent AAD include the use of probiotics. The rationale for the use of&#xD;
      probiotics in AAD assumes that, considering the pathogenesis of AAD, AAD is associated with&#xD;
      disturbance in the normal intestinal microbiota; administrating specific probiotic strains it&#xD;
      is possible to normalize unbalanced indigenous microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence suggests that prebiotics could be beneficial too. Prebiotics can act in&#xD;
      synergy with probiotics, being efficacious in suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      that may occur during antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale: the principal side effects of treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate include&#xD;
      diarrhoea, vomiting and allergic reactions. Aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the administration of a synbiotic product, Bio-Kult Infantis®, in the&#xD;
      prevention of AAD during a standard therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate to treat AOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of a synbiotic product in the prevention of&#xD;
      Antibiotics-Associated Diarrhoea (AAD) during a concomitant standard therapy with amoxicillin&#xD;
      / clavulanic acid, also known as co-amoxiclav, to treat Acute Otitis Media (AOM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: this is a multicenter, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      randomized clinical study. 276 children 6 - 35 months old will be enrolled and then&#xD;
      randomized into one of the two study groups (Bio-Kult Infantis® + co-amoxiclav standard&#xD;
      treatment for AOM / placebo + co-amoxiclav standard treatment for AOM). A comparison will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a synbiotic product in the prevention of AAD&#xD;
      during the concomitant standard therapy with co-amoxiclav.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study 4 visits will have to be performed at the study centre, and extra visits&#xD;
      will be performed in case of AOM relapse after recovery. The study will last for each patient&#xD;
      38 ± 6 days.&#xD;
