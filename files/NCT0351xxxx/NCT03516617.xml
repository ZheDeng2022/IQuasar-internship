      This phase II trials studies how well acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab works in&#xD;
      treating patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving acalabrutinib with or without&#xD;
      obinutuzumab will work better in treating patients with early-stage chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (CR)&#xD;
      rate of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab in early stage asymptomatic&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients who are high and&#xD;
      very high risk by CLL-International Prognostic Index (IPI). (Arms A and B) II. To evaluate&#xD;
      time to first therapy (TFT) in early stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients with low and&#xD;
      intermediate-risk by CLL-IPI. (Arm C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the safety of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab in early stage&#xD;
      asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients who are high and very high risk by CLL-IPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next&#xD;
      therapy (TNT) and overall survival (OS) of acalabrutinib alone and acalabrutinib/obinutuzumab&#xD;
      in early stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients who are at high and very high risk by CLL-IPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in early&#xD;
      stage asymptomatic CLL/SLL patients with low and intermediate risk by CLL-IPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the quality of life using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General&#xD;
      (FACT-G) quality of life (QOL) survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the peripheral blood immune profile using 8-color flow cytometry, to assess&#xD;
      changes in T-cells, natural killer (NK)-cells, and NK-T cells at baseline and during active&#xD;
      treatment among patients receiving either acalabrutinib alone or acalabrutinib and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine changes in the peripheral blood immune profile using 8-color flow cytometry&#xD;
      to assess changes in T-cells, NK-cells, and NK-T cells at baseline and during event&#xD;
      monitoring in patients with low and intermediate risk by CLL-IPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Signal pathway studies-BTK, ERK, PLC gamma and S6 protein levels and phosphorylation&#xD;
      status will be assessed by Western blot methodology using specific antibodies to pull down&#xD;
      specific proteins from cell lysates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To confirm if in vitro cell killing is via apoptosis we will also assess PARP and caspase&#xD;
      3 cleavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Apoptotic protein studies-MCL-1, XIAP levels will be determined by Western blot&#xD;
      methodology using specific antibodies to pull down these specific proteins from cell lysates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Bone marrow aspirates will be studied for hematopoietic function in two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. Estimation of colony forming capacity by purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIb. Evaluation of the levels of HSCs and their differentiated progeny (i.e. MPP, CMP, CLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Paired bone marrow and blood samples will be evaluated for the levels of innate effector&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Perform targeted sequencing of 59 genes mainly grouped in 8 biological pathways:&#xD;
      NOTCH1, B-cell signaling, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response, chromatin modifiers,&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) metabolism, NF-kappaB pathway, cell cycle and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Screen 2 genes previously associated with resistance to BTK inhibitors (BTK and PLCG2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with high or very high risk CLL-IPI are randomized to Arm A or Arm B.&#xD;
      Patients with intermediate or low risk are assigned to Arm C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients then receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-84. Treatment repeats every 84&#xD;
      days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      may continue treatment with acalabrutinib If MRD negative CR/CR with incomplete marrow&#xD;
      recovery (CRi) is not achieved after 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive acalabrutinib PO BID on days 1-84. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 84 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may continue treatment with acalabrutinib If MRD negative CR/CRi is not&#xD;
      achieved after 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients will be observed every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (Arm A and Arm B)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 courses</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as an objective status of complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) along with MRD negativity in the bone marrow by flow cytometry.

Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated in each arm based on the normal approximation. Comparison of MRD-negative complete response rates between the two treatment groups will be performed using a one-sided z-test (based on normal approximation with pooled variance of standardized test statistics) at significance level 0.10.</description>
