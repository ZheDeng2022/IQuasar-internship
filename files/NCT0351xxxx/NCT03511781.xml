      This prospective phase I/II study to assess the clinical toxicity and investigate the&#xD;
      clinical response of breast cancers to a 10 fraction hypofractionated course of radiation&#xD;
      therapy in advanced incurable breast cancer patients. This study would also investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing in left sided breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. An intervention radiation therapy dose of 35 Gray in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, 5&#xD;
      fractions per week, 1 fraction per day will be studied within this clinical trial. Primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess the toxicity using CTCAE version 4 and LENTSOMA toxicity&#xD;
      criteria, in advanced incurable breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10 fractions . Secondary objectives are 1. response rate&#xD;
      after radiotherapy measured using the PERCIST criteria at 3 months. 2. Change in quality of&#xD;
      life measured using trial outcome index (TOI) at 2 weeks after radiotherapy. 3. Measure the&#xD;
      change in PHQ4 score at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally to assess the feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing&#xD;
      in left sided breast cancer patients and to biobank tissue and blood for future radiobiology&#xD;
      tests. A total of 30 patients will be recruited in this study. Among these 30 patients at&#xD;
      least 10 patients will be recruited with left sided breast cancer on which feasibility of&#xD;
      voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing will be tested. Patient will be followed up&#xD;
      weekly during radiotherapy, then monthly for 1st three months, then 3 monthly for two years,&#xD;
      then 6 monthly for next 3 years.&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective interventional phase I/II study Study area: Tata Medical Center,&#xD;
      Kolkata&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To assess the toxicity using CTCAE version 4 and LENTSOMA toxicity&#xD;
      criteria, in advanced incurable breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10 fractions Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. response rate after radiotherapy measured using the PERCIST criteria at 3 months. 2.&#xD;
      Change in quality of life measured using trial outcome index (TOI) at 2 weeks after&#xD;
      radiotherapy. 3. Measure the change in PHQ4 score at 2 weeks after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of hypofractionated breast radiotherapy schedule of 35 GY in 10&#xD;
      fractions over 2 weeks on quality of life in advanced incurable breast cancer patients using&#xD;
      FACT B scores PHQ4 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing in left sided&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To biobank tissue and blood for future radiobiology tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients will be recruited in this phase I/ II study. Among these 30 patients&#xD;
      at least 10 patients will be recruited with left sided breast cancer on which feasibility of&#xD;
      voluntary breath hold technique for heart sparing will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this is a phase I/II study a 30 patients sample is used as a feasibility study.&#xD;
      Primary end point of this study is acute toxicity and secondary endpoint is radiological&#xD;
      response, quality of life after radiotherapy ( from baseline) . Acute toxicities are defined&#xD;
      as toxicities happening during and at 3 months after radiotherapy. Medcalc version 12 will be&#xD;
      used for statistical analysis. Paired Student t test (2-tailed) was applied to compare the&#xD;
      results from the different time points. The level of significance will be taken as P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 patients will be recruited in the first phase of the study (20% of total number). If 1-2 of&#xD;
      the 6 patients have had more than grade 3 acute toxicity (radiation dermatitis) then the&#xD;
      study will recruit 4 further patients as phase 2. If more than 1 of these patients are found&#xD;
      to have more than Grade 3 dermatological toxicity then the study will be stopped. Similarly&#xD;
      after recruitment of 20 patients, another safety monitoring will be undertaken . At any&#xD;
      point, if more than 40% of the patients have more than grade 3 toxicity the study will be&#xD;
      closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Imaging in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A regional positron emission computed -computed Tomography scan of breast done before&#xD;
      starting radiotherapy. The standardized uptake value by the tumour, size of the tumour along&#xD;
      with that of the regional lymph nodes will be recorded. 3 months post completion of&#xD;
      radiation, the PET-CT scan will be repeated and parameters re-recorded. PERCIST criteria will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate response to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of planning CT scan-&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is positioned supine on all in one solution breast board with head rest, arms&#xD;
      above head as in treatment position such that the sternum is horizontal . The CT markers are&#xD;
      placed on the patient approximately at the lower end of sternum in free breathing.The&#xD;
      position of palpable breast tissue, drain sites and scars are marked with radio opaque wires&#xD;
      during the CT . Helical CT scan is obtained with 5 mm thickness. Couch height from the&#xD;
      lateral lasers are measured as reference height for reproducing in treatment table. CT marker&#xD;
      positions are tattooed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of Outlines- A full 3D set of outlines covering the whole breast and the organs&#xD;
      at risk must be collected with a slice separation of no more than 5 mm. The right breast&#xD;
      patients are scanned with standard institutional protocol and left breast will be scanned&#xD;
      with Voluntary breath Hold Technique . The position of palpable breast tissue, and scars are&#xD;
      marked with radio opaque wires during the CT scan. Bolus will be used as and when required&#xD;
      for dose build up to the surface during simulation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Volume Definition-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gross Tumour Volume (GTV)- GTV will be outlined as seen on the planning CT scan, with&#xD;
      information available from the PET-CT scan and clinical examination. This will include any&#xD;
      lymph nodes in the axilla or supraclavicular fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Breast Clinical Target Volume (WBCTV)- This is based on the recommendations in the&#xD;
      START trial protocol . The CTV includes the soft tissues of the whole breast from 5 mm below&#xD;
      the skin surface down to the deep fascia, excluding muscle and underlying rib cage. If the&#xD;
      tumor is seen to involve the muscle, skin or adjoining structures adequate margins must be&#xD;
      taken to include these in the target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning Target Volumes (PTV)- A field-based whole breast PTV will be used and this method is&#xD;
      illustrated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended field limits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lateral or central tumour - Superior edge - 1cm above the superior border of the&#xD;
           palpable breast tissue Inferior limit - 1cm below palpable breast tissue Lateral limit&#xD;
           -1cm lateral to palpable breast, at or anterior to mid axillary line.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medial limit -1cm medial to palpable breast tissue at or ipsilateral to midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anterior- Adequate margin on skin anteriorly to account for respiratory movements as&#xD;
           well as random and systematic errors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medial tumour As above but medial edge may be beyond midline. The internal mammary nodes&#xD;
           are not routinely included in the treated volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraclavicular fossa Superior: At level of cricoid or 3 cm above medial end clavicle&#xD;
      (whichever is superior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferior: Matchplane. In some patients with a lower match plane (for anatomy or mobility)&#xD;
      Lateral: Junction of medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of the clavicle, including coracoid&#xD;
      process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medial: Medial margin of head of clavicle Axilla:Axilla will be included in tangential field&#xD;
      if there is involved node clinically or radiologically in axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organs at Risk (OAR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is mandatory to contour ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart, brachial plexus for&#xD;
      dose volume histogram assessment. Left anterior descending coronary artery will be contoured&#xD;
      for left sided breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy planning Prescribed Dose 35 Gy in 10 fraction; 5 fractions a week; 1 fraction a&#xD;
      day for 2 weeks. Ideally, prescribed to 100% (normalization point). Dose Planning two&#xD;
      standard isocentric tangential fields, one lateral tangential and another medial tangential&#xD;
      field (6 Mega Volt, 15 MV or both could be used depending on the site and geometry of the&#xD;
      breasts) will be used to treat the breast encompassing the axillary nodes in clinically or&#xD;
      radio-logically involved. Supraclavicular fossa will be treated with one direct anterior&#xD;
      field. Radiotherapy will be delivered to the whole breast using tangential photons . 3D dose&#xD;
      calculation will be done by Analytical Anisotropic Algorithm algorithm. Segmented fields with&#xD;
      multi leaf or wedges will be used to achieve dose homogeneity in accordance with the&#xD;
      guidelines of ICRU 50/62 i.e, within 95% to 107%. Dose reporting Tangential fields prescribed&#xD;
      at the normalization point (ICRU reference point). The Supraclavicular field is prescribed at&#xD;
      a depth of Dmax for 6MV beam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Treatment Setup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be positioned in the treatment couch as in planning CT with the help of skin&#xD;
      reference markers. The patient is then moved to planned isocenter according to the plan.The&#xD;
      medial and lateral borders are marked and verified by light field and source-to-surface&#xD;
      distance. The superior border of tangential fields and inferior border of supraclavicular&#xD;
      field is matched on the skin with light field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Treatment Delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After checking the alignment , the treatment commences. Every day the patient is moved from&#xD;
      reference CT-Isocenter to planned isocenter and field edge (as defined by light field) is&#xD;
      marked with marker at every fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning Documentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic Treatment prescription. Planning approval and treatment approval is given on&#xD;
      treatment planning system. A hard copy of the planning with electronic approvals is attached&#xD;
      with each patient file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      treatment planning system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance and Treatment setup verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vivo dosimetry with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and Gafchromic film will be&#xD;
      performed during patient treatment. TLDs will be used to verify the skin dose in the junction&#xD;
      of SCF and tangential fields and along the skin surface of intact breast for each patient for&#xD;
      first 3 days. Film dosimetry will be used in the junction of the of Supra clavicular fossa&#xD;
      and Tangential field. Online clinical breast coverage verification is carried out by Visually&#xD;
      checking the light field on the patient on the first day of treatment. Partial conebeam CT&#xD;
      scan will be taken to ascertain the treatment position verification for whole breast set-up&#xD;
      and 2D MV image for supraclavicular field setup, for all fractions. Treatment Review Patients&#xD;
      are reviewed weekly, unless specified otherwise by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Constraints for Organs at Risk (OAR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal dose constraints criterias are as follows-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 10.5 Gy should be less than 15%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The volume of heart receiving 1.75 Gy and 8.75 Gy should be less than 30% and 5%&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial plexus: EQD2 = 60 Gy (conservative estimate based on α/β= 2 for brachial&#xD;
           plexus). Minimum , maximum and median dose to the left anterior descending artery will&#xD;
           be recorded for left sided breast cancer patients undergoing voluntary breadth hold&#xD;
           technique. In case where optimal dose constraints criteria for heart and lung could not&#xD;
           be met in order to cover the gross tumour volume in breast or axilla; essential criteria&#xD;
           should be met ( V10.5 Gy for lung &lt;31%, V8.75 Gy for heart &lt;11%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute toxicity will be assessed weekly during radiotherapy then monthy for 1st three month&#xD;
      after completion of radiotherapy. Acute toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4&#xD;
      toxicity criteria. If CTCAE Gr 3 desquamation is seen the patient will be reviewed weekly&#xD;
      until the desquamation is resolved to CTCAE gr 1 or less. If the patient somehow fails to&#xD;
      attend for the toxicity assessment, a telephone questionnaire will be asked to assess grade&#xD;
      of skin toxicity. Modified LENT-SOMA scale will be used for scoring various grades of late&#xD;
      effects occurring in brachial plexus after radiation therapy at 3 months,6 months and 1year .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour size measurement will be done pretreatment and 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Patients will be assessed for symptoms like breast pain, ulcer, arm oedema ,&#xD;
      shoulder stiffness and others at baseline . If the patients have any of these symptoms then :&#xD;
      for Pain in breast visual analogue scale will be used to score the pain (score 0-10), ulcer&#xD;
      and arm oedema will be graded according to CTCAE version 4, shoulder stiffness will be&#xD;
      recored as yes/no response. Symptom assessment will be repeated at 2 wks, 1 month, 2 months,&#xD;
      3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a baseline regional PET-CT scan of breast (including axilla and&#xD;
      supraclavicular fossa) done before start of radiotherapy and three month after completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy another regional PET-CT scan of breast will be done. Response will be assessed&#xD;
      using PERCIST 1.0 criteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of quality of life: Quality of life will be assessed by using FACT B scale and&#xD;
      anxiety/mood symptoms will be assessed by a 4 question screen (PHQ4) before start of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, after completion of radiotherapy and 3 month, 6 months and 1 year after&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy. For patients who are unable to travel, the quality of life rating&#xD;
      will be done over telephone for the 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:Weekly during radiotherapy, then monthly for 1st three months, then 3 monthly for&#xD;
      two years, then 6 monthly for next 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring An independent data safety monitoring committee (IDMC) will be&#xD;
      instigated to monitor the progress of the trial. Two radiation oncologists, a surgeon and a&#xD;
      lay person will be in the committee to ensure safety of patients. The IDMC will meet in&#xD;
      confidence after a first phase of recruitment of 6 patients (20% of the sample size). The&#xD;
      second meeting will be done after 10 patients are recruited and the third meeting after 20&#xD;
      patients recruited. A report of the findings and recommendations will be produced following&#xD;
      each meeting and a summary of the minutes will be submitted to the PI, and if required, the&#xD;
      Institutional review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liability/Indemnity/Insurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indemnity arrangements will be made as required.&#xD;
