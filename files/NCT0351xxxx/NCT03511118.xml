  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of women in the US who are breastfeeding their infants take prescription drugs. You&#xD;
      are being asked to participate in this study because you are breastfeeding your infant and&#xD;
      are currently taking, as part of your medical care, at least one of the drugs we are&#xD;
      studying. We are interested in studying drugs commonly prescribed to women who are&#xD;
      breastfeeding so we can learn more about the amount of drug that is transferred to breastmilk&#xD;
      and estimate how much of drug that is consumed by breastfed infants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if the study drugs of interest are found in&#xD;
      breastmilk and how much; to estimate the amount of drug that is consumed by breastfed infants&#xD;
      and what effect this may have on infants; and to share what we learn with other researchers.&#xD;
      The study drugs of interest have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, but there is&#xD;
      little or no information about the amount of drug found in the breastmilk of mothers who take&#xD;
      them; the amount of drug that may be transferred to their infant's through breastmilk; or the&#xD;
      effects this transfer may have on their infants. During this study we will ask to collect&#xD;
      breastmilk and blood from mothers, and blood from infants, to measure the amount of study&#xD;
      drug of interest in these body fluids. Results from this study will help researchers better&#xD;
      understand how much of the study drug of interest is in your blood and breastmilk, and how&#xD;
      much of the study drug of interest may be in your infant's blood because of breastfeeding.&#xD;
