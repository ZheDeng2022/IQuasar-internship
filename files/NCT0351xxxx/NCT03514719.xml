      In this feasibility study, a zirconium-89 (89Zr)-avelumab positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scan will be performed in 37 patients prior to treatment with avelumab to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the tumor and systemic tissue uptake 89Zr-avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the potential to predict avelumab treatment response&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The programmed death 1 (PD1)/ programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway plays an important&#xD;
      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti&#xD;
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody avelumab is effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) resulting in durable disease control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined&#xD;
      by immune histochemistry (IHC) is the best available biomarker for treatment response, but&#xD;
      standardized scoring criteria are lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular&#xD;
      imaging using 89Zr-labeled antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the&#xD;
      visualization of PD-L1 expression in primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing&#xD;
      information on the in vivo accessibility of the PD-L1 target following intravenous&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enables PD-L1 PET-imaging with 89Zr-avelumab in patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early stage NSCLC (stage Ia (≥T1b) -IIIa) followed by 2 cycles of neo-adjuvant avelumab&#xD;
           treatment and surgical resection of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced stage NSCLC (Stage IIIb-IV) followed by avelumab treatment until disease&#xD;
           progression or intolerable toxicity.&#xD;
