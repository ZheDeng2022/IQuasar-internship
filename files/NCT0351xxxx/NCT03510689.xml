    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to use patient-centered in vitro and in vivo models to&#xD;
      answer the fundamental question of whether or not pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 result in&#xD;
      an increased risk of CV disease&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing</intervention_name>
    <description>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET, also called V02 test) will be completed at each study time point utilizing a standard clinical protocol, on either a stationary bike or treadmill. The purpose of this test is to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (V02 max) as in index of cardiopulmonary fitness. Resting ECG, heart rate, and BP will be obtained prior to beginning the test, during each stage of the test and for 5 minutes after the test is stopped.</description>

    <intervention_name>Blood Collection</intervention_name>
    <description>We will obtain blood samples (approximately 16mL) at baseline and (approximately 12mL) at each follow-up visit. Typically these will be drawn via peripheral venipuncture, however if patients have a port-a-cath in place, blood may be drawn from the port instead.</description>
