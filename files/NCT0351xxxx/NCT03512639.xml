      Background Seroma is a common surgical complication created by the inflammatory process that&#xD;
      follows mastectomy and reconstruction. It is, thus, common practice to insert surgical&#xD;
      drains, which often often remain in place for long periods and delay recovery. In light of&#xD;
      the many advantages of holistic treatment, there has been a global trend of integrating them&#xD;
      with conventional medicine. In this study, the investigators examined the effect of Arnica&#xD;
      montana and Bellis perennis on seroma prevention after mastectomy and breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The investigators conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      study to asses the effect of homeopathic remedies on seroma in 55 patients (78 breasts), who&#xD;
      had undergone mastectomy for cancer or risk reduction, followed by immediate implant and&#xD;
      Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM)-based breast reconstruction in the Department of Plastic &amp;&#xD;
      Reconstructive Surgery at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, between January&#xD;
      2016 and August 2017 (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board and it was registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects All subjects were female, aged over 18 years, who underwent mastectomy, either for&#xD;
      breast cancer or for risk reduction, followed by immediate breast reconstruction. In some&#xD;
      patients, this was performed in a single procedure - direct to implant (DTI) (n=42); in&#xD;
      others, it was in two stages tissue expander (TE) (n=36), depending on presurgical&#xD;
      evaluation, risk factors and clinical assessment of perfusion of the mastectomy skin flaps.&#xD;
      All subjects signed informed consent forms after receiving a detailed explanation of the&#xD;
      study from one of its investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators excluded patients with: (a) conditions which could affect wound-healing;&#xD;
      (b) coagulation problems (autoimmune and hematological diseases, etc.); (c) taking medication&#xD;
      which affects the immunological or hematological system (steroids, anticoagulants,&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, etc.); and (d) with unbalanced background diseases. Active smokers&#xD;
      were instructed to stop smoking at least three weeks prior to surgery and a month&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication and randomization and surgical techniques Experimental medications and&#xD;
      placebos were prepared and delivered in accordance with the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the&#xD;
      United States (HPUS). Stem tinctures of Arnica montana, Bellis perennis and 40% alcohol as&#xD;
      placebo were diluted 1:100 with 40% alcohol, and vigorously shaken. This process was repeated&#xD;
      30 times for a theoretical final concentration of 10-60 of the stem solutions. Spherical&#xD;
      saccharose globules, approximately 1 mm in diameter, were wetted with the diluted tinctures&#xD;
      and dried, resulting in three groups of the experimental medication: Arnica montana C30&#xD;
      (10-60), Bellis perennis C30 (10-60) and alcohol dilutions as placebo. The medications were&#xD;
      packed in bottles, each containing 5 grams of the preparation, and consecutively numbered.&#xD;
      The prefix 'A' indicated Arnica montana, and 'B' Bellis perennis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly allocated into groups given either homeopathic medication (Arnica&#xD;
      montana C30 and Bellis perennis C30) or placebo (alcohol 40% and alcohol 40%) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Age, body mass index, laterality of mastectomy, mastectomy type and number requiring sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection were similar between groups. The randomization&#xD;
      sequence was created by an independent physician, uninvolved in the study, using&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers. The randomization code was held in confidence and the code&#xD;
      was not broken until the data analysis. The same randomization list was used to blind the&#xD;
      Arnica montana and the Bellis perennis, creating similar pairs. The placebos and the active&#xD;
      medication were indistinguishable in appearance, taste and smell. Three globules of each&#xD;
      medication were regarded as a single dose, to be sucked rather than swallowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were hospitalized the night prior to surgery. On admission, a member of the study&#xD;
      team again explained the study protocol, and gave the assigned medications to the patients.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to take the medication according to the following protocol (Figure 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One dose of A (3 pills) on the morning of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One dose of A and one of B, 4 to 6 times a day for the first 24 hours after surgery (as&#xD;
           soon as patients were stable, conscious and nausea- and vomit-free).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One dose of A and one of B, 3 times a day until 4 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Finally, one dose of B 3 times a day until removal of the surgical drain. All&#xD;
           mastectomies were performed by experienced breast surgeons at our institution. Amputated&#xD;
           breast-weight was documented. Sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph-node&#xD;
           dissection (ALND) was carried out according to the oncological status of each patient,&#xD;
           either through a separate axillary incision or through the mastectomy incision. All&#xD;
           reconstructions were subpectoral ADM-assisted, performed by plastic surgeons from our&#xD;
           department. 42 breasts underwent the DTI procedure, and in 36 breasts a two-stage TE&#xD;
           approach was taken, according to the patient's estimated breast volume, risk factors and&#xD;
           intraoperative clinical evaluation of flap perfusion. ADM used was an 8*16 cm ADM. A&#xD;
           10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted through a subcutaneous tunnel in the lateral&#xD;
           breast gutter at the level of the inframammary fold (IMF) (in the subcutaneous space).&#xD;
           When axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed through a separate incision, a&#xD;
           second drain was placed in the axillary space. Drains were removed when drainage fell&#xD;
           below 30 mL/24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data for all patients were retrieved from their medical records:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline characteristics and demographic variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and risk factors - comorbidities, obesity, smoking, breast cancer (BRCA)&#xD;
           mutation status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables relating to the procedure - reason for surgery (breast cancer vs. risk&#xD;
           reduction), breasts operated (unilateral or bilateral), size and type of implant (DTI&#xD;
           vs. TE and implant volume) and lymph node status (no biopsy taken/sentinel lymph node&#xD;
           biopsy (SLNB)/ALND)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative course- time to drain removal, hemoglobin and cortisol levels on&#xD;
           postoperative days (POD) 3 and 7, postoperative level of pain according to the visual&#xD;
           analog (VAS) scale and Quality of Recovery. The VAS scale is a scale from 0 to 10, with&#xD;
           0 being &quot;no pain at all&quot; and 10 being &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; The staff nurse caring&#xD;
           for each patient administered the form and elicited the patient response for pain level&#xD;
           according to the study protocol, and the quantity of narcotics taken. On POD 3 and 7,&#xD;
           patients were given the Quality Of Recovery (QoR) 40 questionnaire, a validated&#xD;
           questionnaire to measure postsurgical quality of recovery. Its scores range from 40 for&#xD;
           very poor recovery to 200 for outstanding quality of recovery [49-51].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative complications: hematoma, skin-flap necrosis, infection, seroma,&#xD;
           explantation and need for repeat surgery. Complications were divided into major and&#xD;
           minor. Major complications included any of those mentioned above which required revision&#xD;
           surgery in the operating room. Minor complications resolved spontaneously or were&#xD;
           treated at the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All data were collected daily by a study coordinator. The investigators&#xD;
      calculated the mean standard deviation (SD) and range for all quantitative variables, as well&#xD;
      as their absolute frequencies and percentages. Statistical analyses were conducted using&#xD;
      statistical software. The criterion for significance was: alpha (α) = .05 (one-sided).&#xD;
