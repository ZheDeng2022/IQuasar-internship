  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukemia cells grow and divide fast and out of control. In normal cells, certain proteins&#xD;
      called CDK4 and CDK6 control cell growth. The study drug called palbociclib works by blocking&#xD;
      the CDK4 and CDK6 proteins. Palbociclib has been shown to kill leukemia cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory and in animal studies. Palbociclib will be added to other chemotherapy drugs, such&#xD;
      as dexamethasone, that are known to be effective in treating childhood ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in two parts: Part 1: Dose Escalation and Part 2: Dose Expansion. The&#xD;
      goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the highest tolerable combination of palbociclib and&#xD;
      chemotherapy that the investigators can give to patients with leukemia. Once those doses are&#xD;
      determined, the investigators will enroll patients on Part 2: Dose Expansion. This phase will&#xD;
      enroll additional patients that receive the highest tolerated dose of palbociclib as&#xD;
      determined in part 1, in order to better understand the side effects and how effective this&#xD;
      treatment approach is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this research study, the investigators hope to meet the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find the highest tolerable dose of palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy that&#xD;
           can be given without causing severe side effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn what kind of side effects palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy may&#xD;
           have; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the biology effects of palbociclib on the cells in the participant's&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 children, adolescents and young adults will participate in both parts of this study&#xD;
      at St. Jude only.&#xD;

      RELPALL is a single center, St Jude initiated, non-randomized single-arm phase I study to&#xD;
      characterize the toxicity profile and to determine the maximum tolerated combination (MTC)&#xD;
      and recommended phase II combination of palbociclib when given with chemotherapy in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Palbociclib is a&#xD;
      reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and the closely related&#xD;
      cyclin-depending kinase 6 (CDK6) that has shown high anti-leukemic activity in several&#xD;
      pre-clinical models. The mechanism of palbociclib, which reversibly arrests cells in G1,&#xD;
      argues that combination treatment, as opposed to single agent treatment, will be more likely&#xD;
      to provide clinical benefit. Timing of combination treatment with standard cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs that kill actively dividing cells is important to maximize the chance of&#xD;
      activity. This study will build on prior multiple myeloma experience with palbociclib in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib while tailoring the treatment to pediatric&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory ALL. To maximize G1 arrest, dexamethasone will be given concurrently with&#xD;
      palbociclib for five days. Patients will receive a 48 hour &quot;washout&quot; before receiving&#xD;
      bortezomib and doxorubicin, both cytotoxic anti-leukemic drugs that preferentially kills&#xD;
      cells when synchronized in S phase. Patients with Philadelphia Chromosome positive ALL (Ph+)&#xD;
      and Philadelphia-like (Ph-like) ALL will also receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)&#xD;
      beginning on Day 7 until count recovery. The primary objective is to determine a tolerable&#xD;
      combination of palbociclib plus chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory ALL. The secondary objective is to estimate the overall response rate to the&#xD;
      combination of palbociclib and chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      ALL. Exploratory objectives include measuring cell cycle kinetics of ALL cells following&#xD;
      administration of palbociclib and an evaluation of modes of resistance in non-responders.&#xD;

Bortezomib will be given on Days 7, 10, 17 and 20. Doxorubicin will be given on Days 7 and 17. If the dose escalation with this schema is tolerated, a final dose level administering additional doses of palbociclib on days 21-30 will be evaluated.&#xD;
Patients with Ph-like or Ph+ ALL will receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) beginning on Day 7.&#xD;
Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (MHA) will be given on Day 1 of the course. The frequency and total number of IT MHA is based on the patient's level of CNS disease.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This study will be done in two parts: Part 1: Dose escalation and Part 2: Dose expansion.&#xD;
In Part 1 - Dose escalation: Patients that lack Ph+ or Ph-like ALL, palbociclib, initially at 50mg/m2/day, 40% of the adult MTD, will be administered on Days 1-5 and 11-15, and escalated based on tolerability. If our highest dosing of 100mg/m2/day is tolerated, we will have a final dose level that receives an additional 10 days of palbociclib (Days 1-5, 11-15, and 21-30).&#xD;
For patients that are Ph+ or have Ph-like ALL that are also receiving dasatinib or ruxolitinib: palbociclib, initially at 75mg/m2/day, 60% of the adult MTD, will be administered on Days 1-5 and 11-15 and escalated based on tolerability.&#xD;
In Part 2 - Dose expansion: After determination of dose in Part 1, an additional 10 patients will be enrolled to confirm tolerability.</description>
