    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, pilot study administering hyperthermic intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy with Mitomycin-C in 10 men and women with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection who have risk&#xD;
      factors for tumor recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment toxicity will be analyzed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version 4.0. Descriptive statistics will be used to determine proportion of grade III/V treatment toxicity. Expected grade III/V toxicity in surgical patients without HIPEC would be 3 out of 10 patients. With the addition of HIPEC, there would be a significant difference (p=0.05) if 6 out of 10 patients experienced a grade III/V toxicity. Therefore, if less than 6 patients experience a grade III/V we would consider this a &quot;negative&quot; finding.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Primary urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient's aged 45-85, both genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status &lt; 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hematology: ANC &gt; 1.5x109/L; Platelets &gt; 100x109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women with child bearing potential who are negative for pregnancy test (urine or&#xD;
             blood) and who agree to use effective contraceptive method. Reliable contraception&#xD;
             should be used from trial screening and must be continued throughout the study. A&#xD;
             woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is biologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed and dated written informed consent to participate in this clinical trial must&#xD;
             be obtained prior to any study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Either any of the following preoperative factors for increased risk of recurrence:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Lymphovascular invasion&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Variant histology in the background of primary urothelial (notably plasmacytoid)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinical T3 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Clinical N+&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or lack of response to NAC&#xD;
&#xD;
             Or any of the following perioperative factors for increased risk of recurrence:&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Palpable concern for extravesical disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Tumor spillage/bladder entry&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Suspicious nodes or positive intraoperative frozen sections&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have previously undergone intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with tumor histology other than urothelial cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients on concurrent anti-cancer therapy other than that allowed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other prior malignancies, except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer or curatively&#xD;
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated malignancies for which&#xD;
             there has been no evidence of activity for more than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with renal insufficiency defined as creatinine &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal or a calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 cc/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a condition which may interfere with the subjects' ability to understand&#xD;
             the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or severe infection requiring antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric illness or&#xD;
             other condition which in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any condition that would preclude the ability to deliver appropriate IP therapy.&#xD;
