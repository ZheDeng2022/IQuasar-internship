  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping medications, called hypnotics, are often prescribed for insomnia. About one-quarter&#xD;
      of Veterans use hypnotics (or bedtime alcohol). Older patients who use hypnotics fall more&#xD;
      often and have worse memory than those who do not use them. Stopping hypnotics often reverses&#xD;
      these problems. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to reduce hypnotic use&#xD;
      among older adults. Currently, there are two main treatments to help patients stop using&#xD;
      hypnotics. The first treatment involves a slow decrease in the daily dose until the hypnotic&#xD;
      is ultimately discontinued. For safety, the process of decreasing the daily dose is usually&#xD;
      supervised by a physician. The second is a treatment for insomnia called cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare a novel hypnotic tapering method to the usual tapering method offered&#xD;
      to older Veterans. The purpose of the study is to determine if the novel tapering method is&#xD;
      more effective than the usual tapering method, both in terms of hypnotic discontinuation and&#xD;
      improvement in insomnia severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from among Veterans 55 years and older who receive care from&#xD;
      one VA Healthcare System. Following a baseline assessment, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two 8-week treatment groups (66 participants per group). Each&#xD;
      treatment group will receive CBTI, however, one group will receive the novel tapering program&#xD;
      and the other group the usual tapering program. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      post-treatment and at 6-months after completion of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the novel tapering program is effective, it will represent a treatment option that can be&#xD;
      offered to older Veterans who want to discontinue hypnotics. This tapering program could help&#xD;
      VA healthcare providers adhere to clinical guidelines that recommend benzodiazepine&#xD;
      discontinuation among older adults. A reduction in chronic hypnotic use may in turn reduce&#xD;
      the risk of falls and hip fractures, which ultimately may improve the health and quality of&#xD;
      life of older Veterans who receive healthcare at the VA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are often prescribed&#xD;
      for insomnia. Among Veterans attending outpatient clinics, approximately one-quarter use&#xD;
      hypnotics (or bedtime alcohol). Hypnotics use is associated with an increased risk of falls&#xD;
      and worse cognition in older adults. Discontinuing hypnotics often attenuates or reverses&#xD;
      these negative effects, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has initiatives to reduce&#xD;
      hypnotic use among older adults. Current discontinuation strategies focus on tapering off the&#xD;
      hypnotic and/or treating insomnia symptoms. Common strategies include supervised gradual&#xD;
      taper (SGT), cognitive behavioral therapy targeting hypnotic withdrawal (CBT-HW), cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), and combination therapy (SGT+CBTI). Yet up to 40% of&#xD;
      patients eventually resume use of hypnotics with these strategies, suggesting that other&#xD;
      mechanisms need to be targeted to achieve and sustain high rates of non-use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1) To assess the efficacy of a novel taper plus cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy-augmented program on hypnotic discontinuation among older Veterans, 2) to determine&#xD;
      the impact of the the novel taper intervention on insomnia severity, 3) to assess the impact&#xD;
      of the novel taper intervention on participants' beliefs and expectancies for using hypnotics&#xD;
      to improve sleep quality and daytime function, and 4) to assess the efficacy of the novel&#xD;
      taper intervention on balance and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, we propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in older&#xD;
      Veterans recruited from a single VA site. Veterans will undergo a 3-step screening process&#xD;
      (letter with opt-out card, telephone screen, and in-person screen). Eligible participants (N&#xD;
      = 132) will be randomized to 8 weeks of the novel taper intervention (CBTI+taper method A) or&#xD;
      CBTI+taper method B. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at post-treatment and 6-months.&#xD;
      Key 6-month outcomes will include hypnotic discontinuation and use (measured objectively&#xD;
      through lab testing and medical record review/state prescription monitoring database query,&#xD;
      and subjectively through sleep diary), insomnia severity, beliefs and expectations about&#xD;
      hypnotics, balance, and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypnotic discontinuation program could be an important tool to help older Veterans who&#xD;
      want to discontinue hypnotics to achieve this goal.&#xD;
