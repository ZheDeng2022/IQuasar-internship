      This study aims to evaluate the if the administration of dexamethasone both around the nerve&#xD;
      and in the vein (perineural and intravenous (IV)) will prolong the duration of pain relief&#xD;
      from ropivacaine when compared with ropivacaine local block alone or when administered along&#xD;
      with IV dexamethasone in patients undergoing hand surgery.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the if the administration of dexamethasone both around the nerve&#xD;
      and in the vein (perineural and intravenous (IV)) will prolong the duration of pain relief&#xD;
      from ropivacaine when compared with ropivacaine local block alone or when administered along&#xD;
      with IV dexamethasone in patients undergoing hand surgery. Individuals who have hand surgery&#xD;
      scheduled will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Eligible and consenting patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (1:1:1) as follows: • Group A (IV&#xD;
      dexamethasone): Perineural (30ml of 0.75% ropivacaine + 0.5 ml normal saline) and IV (9.0 ml&#xD;
      normal saline + 1 ml of 10 mg/ml Dexamethasone) • Group B (IV + perineural dexamethasone):&#xD;
      Perineural (30ml of 0.75% ropivacaine + 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml Dexamethasone) and IV (9.5 ml&#xD;
      normal saline + 0.5 ml of 10 mg/ml Dexamethasone) • Group C (control with no adjuvant&#xD;
      dexamethasone): Perineural (30ml of 0.75 ropivacaine + 0.5 ml normal saline) and IV (10 ml&#xD;
      normal saline) This study is single-blind, so the subjects will not know to which group they&#xD;
      have been assigned. All subjects will receive at least a nerve block with a local anesthetic,&#xD;
      or numbing agent. After written, informed consent is obtained and on the day of surgery, the&#xD;
      research staff will collect information about the subject's medical history including&#xD;
      allergies (seasonal and drug related), demographics (gender, age, height, weight), history of&#xD;
      drug use, pain and nausea scores, and vital signs. All medication taken 1 month prior to&#xD;
      treatment day will be recorded. Information will be collected from the physical examination&#xD;
      performed by the surgeon, which is a standard procedure for the pre-operative visit,&#xD;
      regardless of participation in the study. After being put under light sedation according to&#xD;
      standardized sedation, as written in the protocol, one group will receive a local nerve block&#xD;
      and numbing agent. The other two groups will receive either the nerve block and local&#xD;
      anesthetic with intravenous dexamethasone or the nerve block and local anesthetic with both&#xD;
      intravenous and perineural (local) dexamethasone, as described above. Details regarding the&#xD;
      subject's surgery and anesthesia will be collected, and after your surgery, a member of the&#xD;
      research team will provide the subject with a diary to document level of pain, movement, any&#xD;
      episodes of nausea/vomiting, and the number of pain medicine tablets taken for up to 48 hours&#xD;
      after surgery. The subjects will receive a follow up phone call 48 hours after the nerve&#xD;
      block from the research team to collect the information already documented in the diary. Thus&#xD;
      far, no evidence of dexamethasone toxicity around the nerve has been shown and no neurologic&#xD;
      complications or infections have been reported. Only one study reported blood glucose&#xD;
      elevations [1]. There is a potential benefit of enhancing the duration of the nerve block and&#xD;
      therefore pain management. The results of this study will help clarify if use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone as an adjuvant in nerve block will prolong the effect of the nerve block and&#xD;
      reduce the heightened sensitivity to pain and burning sensation as the block wears off.&#xD;
