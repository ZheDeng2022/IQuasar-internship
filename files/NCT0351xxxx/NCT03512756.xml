  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label phase 2/3 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer subjects who have&#xD;
      failed two lines of prior systemic therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS (methoxsalen, phenytoin and sirolimus) in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      and will measure multiple endpoints, including overall survival, progression free survival,&#xD;
      relevant biomarkers, quality of life, safety, and overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Part 1 enrollment complete) In the initial stage of the trial (36 subjects), two dose levels&#xD;
      of SM-88's metyrosine-derivative was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Part 2 actively enrolling) The second part will consist of a subsequent expansion of the&#xD;
      trial to further assess safety and efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS containing the selected&#xD;
      SM-88 RP2D from Part 1. A total of 250 subjects in the second part will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      either to the SM-88 arm (125 subjects) or Physician's Choice of therapy for the Control Arm&#xD;
      (125 subjects). Subjects should have previously received two lines of prior systemic therapy.&#xD;

        Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented radiographic disease&#xD;
        progression on or after one or more systemic therapies. Chemotherapy given as part of prior&#xD;
        chemoradiation in the setting of non-metastatic pancreatic cancer does not count as a line&#xD;
        of therapy. Chemotherapy given for at least 4 months as adjuvant after complete response is&#xD;
        considered as a first line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 2 actively enrolling&#xD;
&#xD;
        Biopsy-proven metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on or after two prior lines of systemic&#xD;
        therapy. Chemotherapy given as part of prior chemo- radiation in the setting of&#xD;

&#xD;
         28. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with delavirdine (due to potential for&#xD;

         32. Subjects treated, or anticipated to be treated, with a calcineurin inhibitor (because&#xD;
             concomitant use of sirolimus and a calcineurin inhibitor increases the risk of&#xD;
             calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic&#xD;
             purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy [HUS/TTP/TMA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
