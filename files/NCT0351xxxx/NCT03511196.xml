      Adaptive Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) plus Standard of Care. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to develop adaptive therapy for high risk metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCSPC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Investigators proposed this pilot feasibility study to use prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      response and testosterone level to guide the treatment with androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      (ADT) [Leuprolide, Goserelin, and Triptorelin are the most commonly used GnRH agonists for&#xD;
      ADT] and/or abiraterone plus prednisone. Adaptive therapy is a program of chemotherapy where&#xD;
      the type and dosage of drug changes in an attempt to kill more of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate with prednisone is a standard of care treatment for mCRPC (metastatic&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer). It works by interrupting the male hormone (androgen)&#xD;
      making process in the testes, adrenal glands, and tumors. This helps to prevent the growth of&#xD;
      tumors that need these hormones to grow.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo 12-16 weeks of GnRH analog, along with 8-12 weeks of combinational therapy with GnRH analog and abiraterone plus prednisone. 14 participants who achieve &gt;75% PSA decline after the run-in period will be enrolled. GnRH analog and abiraterone will be stopped after study enrollment. PSA and testosterone level will be measured every 4 weeks during the run-in period, then every 6 weeks after study enrollment. Imaging studies with CT and bone scan will be performed at the time of study enrollment and these will be considered baseline scans. Study treatment will be restarted if participant's PSA reaches 2 fold or higher of his baseline PSA. Selection of treatment will be based on participant's testosterone level.</description>
