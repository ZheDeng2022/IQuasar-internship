  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the two alternate primary endpoints of&#xD;
      radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC who receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 in addition to best&#xD;
      supportive/best standard of care versus patients treated with best supportive/best standard&#xD;
      of care alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PSMA positive scans will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive/best standard of care or to receive best supportive/best&#xD;
      standard of care only. Best supportive/best standard of care will be determined by the&#xD;
      treating physician/investigator but will exclude investigational agents, cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi-body radiotherapy. Novel androgen axis&#xD;
      drugs [NAADs] (such as abiraterone or enzalutamide) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is open-label and patients will be monitored throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment&#xD;
      period for survival, disease progression, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long-term follow-up period will include the collection of rPFS survival and information&#xD;
      about new treatments, responses to new treatments, adverse events assessment, as well as&#xD;
      blood for hematology and chemistry testing. During follow-up, patients will be contacted&#xD;
      every 3 months (+/- 1 month) via phone, email, or letter for 24 months or until 508 deaths&#xD;
      have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End of Treatment visit should occur once a patient discontinues the treatment part of the&#xD;
      study for any reason (patient or investigator decision, going on to long term follow up,&#xD;
      etc.). This visit should occur approximately 30 days from the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or&#xD;
      the date of the best supportive/best standard of care end of treatment decision (whichever&#xD;
      occurs later), but before the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, outside of what&#xD;
      is allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned enrollment for this study is 814 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dosimetry, PK and ECG sub-study will be conducted in a non-randomized cohort&#xD;
      (177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive/best standard of care) of approximately 30 patients at&#xD;
      sites in Germany to provide a more complete assessment of the safety aspects of&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617. In order to not bias the results obtained from randomized patients in the&#xD;
      main study, the data of the sub-study patients will be analyzed descriptively and not&#xD;
      considered in the primary and secondary analysis of the main study.&#xD;

EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156.

Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]). Pain severity progression is defined as an increase in score of 30% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use.</description>
