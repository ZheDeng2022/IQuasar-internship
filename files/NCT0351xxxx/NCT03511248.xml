    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of inorganic dietary nitrate to the optimal treatment of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Some vegetables contain&#xD;
      large amounts of inorganic nitrate, and research suggests that this nitrate has beneficial&#xD;
      effects on the heart and blood vessels. We have shown in lab experiments that nitrate has&#xD;
      positive effects on the heart. We wish to test whether dietary nitrate might be useful in&#xD;
      halting deterioration and/or improving heart function in patients with heart failure, with a&#xD;
      specific focus on a marker of poor outcome in heart failure: high uric acid levels. Half of&#xD;
      the patients will receive nitrate-rich beetroot juice, and the other half a nitrate-deplete&#xD;
      placebo beetroot juice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Heart failure (HF) affects 1-2% of those under 70 years, and 10-20% of those over&#xD;
      70 years in developed countries; approximately 900,000 people in the UK suffer with HF.&#xD;
      Despite several promising pre-clinical targets, clinical translation has been disappointing,&#xD;
      with very few successful phase 3 studies of new HF therapeutics. Dysfunction of the classical&#xD;
      pathways that underlie endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, with deficient cardiac&#xD;
      constitutive NO supply, are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HF. It has&#xD;
      been mooted that novel strategies that replace/restore this diminished NO have therapeutic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organic nitrates, as a method of NO delivery, provide an efficacious treatment in the&#xD;
      acute HF setting. However, the development of tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction with long-term use severely limits their utility in chronic heart disease.&#xD;
      Alternative methods for sustained NO delivery without tolerance are therefore of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical research demonstrates that inorganic nitrate offers this possibility through&#xD;
      sequential chemical reduction, first via the enterosalivary circuit to nitrite, and&#xD;
      subsequently from nitrite to NO. In particular, pre-clinical research suggests that delivery&#xD;
      of NO via this pathway imparts benefit in HF models. Dietary inorganic nitrate is known to&#xD;
      provide a safe and non-invasive method to elevate NO in humans, and a once daily dose&#xD;
      (5-6mmol), in the form of a beetroot juice, can improve vascular function and reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure in hypertensives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inorganic nitrate as a HF treatment is particularly exciting since a key pathway involved in&#xD;
      the generation of NO from nitrate is xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR); an enzyme upregulated in&#xD;
      HF. Conventionally, XOR is considered detrimental as it generates superoxide and uric acid;&#xD;
      both exert negative effects on cardiac function, and are associated with worse outcomes in&#xD;
      HF. However, XOR also plays an important role in the second step of nitrate bioactivation:&#xD;
      conversion of nitrite to NO in the heart. Importantly, we have hypothesised that in an&#xD;
      environment of elevated XOR activity, such as HF, delivery of inorganic nitrate to the body&#xD;
      would result in reductions in superoxide/uric acid with concomitant elevations in NO. This&#xD;
      might prove more efficacious than simply inhibiting the enzyme using classical inhibitors.&#xD;
      Importantly, a recent study (EXACT-HF) has shown a trend for reduced HF re-hospitalisations&#xD;
      in those with XOR inhibition via allopurinol; it has been suggested that greater benefits&#xD;
      might be seen if these effects are coupled with NO delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis and Aims: We aim to investigate whether dietary inorganic nitrate&#xD;
      provides benefit in patients with HF. We will determine whether inorganic nitrate delivery by&#xD;
      elevating nitrite, delivers substrate to XOR resulting in a two-fold benefit: increasing NO&#xD;
      production, whilst concomitantly reducing superoxide and uric acid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Investigation: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel two-limb study&#xD;
      in New York Heart Association (NHYA) class II-III HF patients. Patients with left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% and elevated NT-proBNP/ BNP levels will be enrolled and&#xD;
      stratified by degree of hyperuricaemia. 92-patients will receive a once daily dose of&#xD;
      nitrate-rich beetroot juice (versus nitrate-deplete beetroot juice) for 12-weeks. The study&#xD;
      is powered for significant reductions in hyperuricaemia. Powered secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      circulating nitrite/nitrate levels, nitrite reductase activity, and a difference in LVEF from&#xD;
      baseline by contrast echocardiography. A number of mechanistic exploratory outcomes will also&#xD;
      be reported, including assessments of oxidative stress, erythrocytic XOR activity, 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test, quality of life questionnaire and levels of NT-proBNP/BNP as surrogate measures of&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: This trial if positive will identify a new, safe and easy-to-deliver therapeutic&#xD;
      option for HF patients. The NHS would benefit by providing a new inexpensive pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      for a disease with significant unmet need and increasing burden to the health service.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals will receive a once daily dose of dietary nitrate in the form of a beetroot juice concentrate (70mL) containing ~5-6mmol inorganic nitrate (James White Drinks, UK) for 12 +/- 2 weeks. This dose has been chosen due to several reports demonstrating efficacy in patients with cardiovascular disease.</description>

    <description>The placebo control is an identical juice from which the nitrate anion has been removed using a standard anion exchange resin. Visually there is no detectable difference between the juices and previous spectral, ion concentration, sugar levels, ascorbate analysis and taste testing has confirmed no differences in colour and constituents. The process to extract nitrate from the juice is the same technique used to remove inorganic nitrate from general drinking water supplies, and has been approved for use by Ethics Committees. The nitrate-free juice is not considered a drug or medicine, and is classified as a foodstuff.</description>

             intake of greater than 2 units) for females. 1 unit is equivalent to a half-pint&#xD;
             (284mL) of beer/lager; 25mL measure of spirits or 125mL of wine&#xD;
