      The purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of the study drug nintedanib when&#xD;
      combined with azacitidine and the associated side effects of the combination in older adults&#xD;
      with AML characterized by HOX gene overexpression who are not interested in or not considered&#xD;
      fit for standard intensive chemotherapy. The use of the study drug nintedanib in this study&#xD;
      is investigational. Investigational means that this medication has not yet been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA to treat this type of cancer. Azacitidine received FDA Approval in 2004 for&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (a blood cancer related to AML) and has a National Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommendation for treatment of older adults who are not&#xD;
      candidates for or decline intensive remission induction therapy. We expect participation to&#xD;
      continue in this study based on each participant's response to the drug, and ability to&#xD;
      tolerate treatment. Participants may continue to receive study treatments for 6 cycles (one&#xD;
      cycle is 28 days long). If the 6 cycles of treatment is completed, participants may be moved&#xD;
      on to a maintenance phase of treatment. Treatment will continue until the participant's&#xD;
      leukemia gets worse, or they experience serious side effects, have a break in treatment for&#xD;
      more than 56 days or the study doctor feels it is best for study treatments to stop.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nintedanib for combination treatment of&#xD;
      nintedanib and azacytidine (5-azacitidine) in the treatment of newly diagnosed and&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with HOX overexpression and who are ineligible for&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Adverse events (AEs) including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed according&#xD;
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine median overall survival. III. To determine complete remission (CR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine composite CR rate (CR + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery&#xD;
      [CRp] + complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery [Cri]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine duration of confirmed response. III. To determine event free survival. IV.&#xD;
      To determine leukemia free survival. V. To establish correlation between response and&#xD;
      pre-treatment Fgf2 levels and change in Fgf-2 levels during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and azacitidine&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion&#xD;
      of 6 courses, participants may discontinue treatment, receive nintedanib every 4-8 weeks, or&#xD;
      receive nintedanib and azacitidine every 4-8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at every 3 months for 12&#xD;
      months and then every 6 months for up to 24 months.&#xD;
