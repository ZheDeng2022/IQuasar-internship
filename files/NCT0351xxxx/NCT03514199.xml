  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of the elderly present with sleep apnea and mortality is significantly higher in&#xD;
      this group. Sleep apnea runs the risk of developing diseases, especially hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, while the Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet on the apnea and hypopnea index in&#xD;
      the elderly. Therefore, the present work intends to evaluate the effect of the intervention&#xD;
      with the Mediterranean diet on the apnea-hypopnea index in the elderly with moderate sleep&#xD;
      apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis study is that the elderly with moderately severe sleep apnea under a&#xD;
      Mediterranean-type diet will modify AHI in the short term, regardless of weight change, due&#xD;
      to changes in body volume and ingestion, especially those related to body water.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of the Mediterranean diet intervention on the apnea-hypopnea index in&#xD;
      the elderly with moderate-severe sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of intervention with Mediterranean diet on the effect of low-fat&#xD;
           diet (control) on anthropometric variables (BMI, neck and waist circumferences) and&#xD;
           bioimpedance (body water, lean mass, fat mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of the intervention with a diet of the Mediterranean type to the&#xD;
           effect of the intervention with a low-fat diet (control) on glycolipid profile,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein, Sodium, and Potassium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of the Mediterranean diet intervention on the effect of the&#xD;
           low-fat diet (control) on blood pressure: systolic, diastolic and heart rate measured in&#xD;
           24-hour ABPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be measured equally in the two groups: Mediterranean diet and control&#xD;
      diet. The provision of extra virgin olive oil and oilseeds will be provided free to&#xD;
      participants randomized to the Mediterranean diet at visits 1 and 2 and participants&#xD;
      randomized to the control diet will receive nutritional guidelines. There will be no caloric&#xD;
      restriction for both groups, nor will there be any increase in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be interviewed by a nutritionist and a nutritionist at the baseline and&#xD;
      at all subsequent visits, and the dietary guidelines will be given by the same nutritionist.&#xD;
      Evaluations with participants from both groups will be organized separately for each of the&#xD;
      groups. All participants will be instructed not to use multivitamins or antioxidant&#xD;
      supplements during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF ADHERENCE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire with 14 items (Annex 3) assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet will be&#xD;
      used. A value of 0 (not compatible) or 1 (compatible) will be assigned to each item answered&#xD;
      on the diet. Higher scores will reflect better adherence to the diet. High adherence will be&#xD;
      set when matching at least 11 of the 14 items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization to the diet group of the Mediterranean type or Diet Control will be&#xD;
      performed by withdrawing the envelope in groups of 4 following random numbers generated by&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE The sample size calculation is based on the study &quot;Effect of Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      versus prudent diet combined with physical activity on OSAS: a randomized trial&quot; 45. For a 5%&#xD;
      alpha error and 80% power, the calculated sample size was 24 patients in each group to detect&#xD;
      an effect size of 0.25 standard deviation. However, considering withdrawals, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, absenteeism, and case losses during the study period, up to 25 patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the Mediterranean diet group and 25 in the control diet group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The demographic characteristics and other variables of interest of the&#xD;
      participants of the Mediterranean diet and Diet control groups will be compared using the&#xD;
      Student's t-test or the chi-square test. Paired t-test or non-parametric test will be&#xD;
      performed to compare measures at baseline and after two months of intervention within each&#xD;
      group. Differences of measures of interest will be determined between the groups using&#xD;
      covariance analysis (ANCOVA) controlled by the corresponding baseline levels, sex, and age or&#xD;
      by non-parametric test. The transformation to log for data that is not normally distributed&#xD;
      will be used. The significance of P &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. The analyzes will&#xD;
      be performed with the IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 program.&#xD;
