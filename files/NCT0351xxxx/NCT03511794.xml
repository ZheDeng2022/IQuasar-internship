      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplants (SCTs) are important in treating many diseases. There are two main&#xD;
      types of transplants. Autologous stem cells come from the person getting the cells.&#xD;
      Allogeneic stem cells come from another person. The risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is high&#xD;
      after allogeneic SCT. Even if a person receives the HBV vaccine after transplant, he or she&#xD;
      may not really be immune to HBV. The person may become immune only after repeated series of&#xD;
      the vaccine. Researchers need to learn more about the HBV vaccine in people after transplant&#xD;
      so it can be most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the rate of achieved HBV immunity for people who had an SCT who did not become&#xD;
      immune with the first vaccine series and require 2 or more series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have had at least 1 dose of the HBV vaccine and were enrolled in these protocols:&#xD;
      99-H-0050, 10-H-0154, and 08-H-0046&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in the other protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants data and medical charts will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from up to 350 participants who had transplants before March 2016 will be reviewed.&#xD;

      Participants data will be collected:&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on current medical literature, the risk of hepatitis B reactivation is high after&#xD;
      allogenic stem cell transplant and can be a major problem in the post-transplant population,&#xD;
      leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Additionally, many people in the general&#xD;
      population and transplant population do not achieve immunity against hepatitis B with the&#xD;
      first vaccination series and may require repeat series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is unclear as to what percentage of post-transplant patients have a failed or&#xD;
      delayed immunity against hepatitis B and how many vaccine series it may take to eventually&#xD;
      achieve immunity. Previous data has eluded toward a seroconversion rate of 64% in children&#xD;
      and adults after vaccination with 20% of patients losing immunity by 5-years&#xD;
      post-vaccination. Additionally, the study found that 25% of patients did not achieve&#xD;
      protective titers following one vaccination series and of those that went on to be&#xD;
      revaccinated, 55% achieved seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, retrospective analysis examining the effectiveness of the hepatitis&#xD;
      B vaccine posthematopoietic stem cell transplant and the impact of factors that may affect&#xD;
      seroconversion. Through this study, we hope to collect data on hepatitis B vaccination and&#xD;
      recommend potential protocol revisions if trends are found. We hypothesize that hepatitis B&#xD;
      immunity post-first vaccine series will occur in the majority of patients evaluated and that&#xD;
      patients failing to respond to the first vaccine series, will respond to subsequent&#xD;
      vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to assess the rate of achieved immunity for those patients that&#xD;
      do not achieve immunity with the first vaccine series and require two or more vaccine series.&#xD;
      Secondary and exploratory objectives will include the evaluation of the percentages of&#xD;
      patients responding to vaccination on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd attempt at the hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccination series, the rate of reactivation of hepatitis B, and the analysis of factors&#xD;
      potentially impacting the response to vaccination.&#xD;
