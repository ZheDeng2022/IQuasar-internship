  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      .A surgical intervention involves the participant and his / her family in a very stressful&#xD;
      situation with a biopsychosocial alteration of the participant, often presenting a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge of the surgical process from admission to hospital discharge. Researchers (nursing)&#xD;
      began to make prior visits to the surgical procedure to reduce anxiety and provide&#xD;
      information about the surgical process. The importance of the presurgical nursing visit (PNV)&#xD;
      is sought, how to achieve a better health education throughout the surgical process, improve&#xD;
      communication between professionals through standardized records, contributing to an optimal&#xD;
      approach to the participant, increasing well-being, health and the satisfaction of the&#xD;
      participant&#xD;

      In our Center, PNVs are carried out in the Ambulatory Area (External Consultations) in a&#xD;
      specific and personalized nursing consultation, within an established and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      program. One week before surgery, the patient and a family / primary caregiver are cited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PNV conducts a semi-structured interview; the content may vary according to the type of&#xD;
      surgery, but in general it can be understood as all those nursing interventions; how to&#xD;
      provide information, support, advice and training to the patient and his family (primary&#xD;
      caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an innovative experience since it has been carried out for a short time. The PNV have&#xD;
      been gradually restructured and continue to grow, since their establishment has been&#xD;
      positively valued in the different services thanks to the experience gained and the numerous&#xD;
      bibliographic references that demonstrate the beneficial results for the patient and the&#xD;
      health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 356 participants have been calculated (surveys answered in more than 3 months),&#xD;
      taking into account an approximate population of 1,172 programmed interventions carried out&#xD;
      in 1 year, with a confidence interval of 95%, accuracy of 3% a proportion of 5% and with an&#xD;
      expected loss of 15%.&#xD;
