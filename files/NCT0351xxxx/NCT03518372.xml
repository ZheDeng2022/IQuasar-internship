  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) is common in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery. Many of the events are undetected and associated with a high 30-day mortality risk.&#xD;
      Knowledge of which perioperative factors that predicts MINS is lacking. Decrease in tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation (StO2) is common in patients undergoing major spine surgery and is associated&#xD;
      with postoperative complications in these patients. However, an association between decrease&#xD;
      in tissue oxygenation and MINS has not been examined. This group of patients may have other&#xD;
      potential predictors of postoperative complications that the study group would like to&#xD;
      investigate. In this observational cohort study, we will include 70 patients undergoing major&#xD;
      spine surgery at University of California San Francisco. The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      decrease in intraoperative tissue oxygenation is associated with postoperative myocardial&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year 10 million people worldwide suffer from myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      (MINS). The majority of these events are undetected because they are asymptomatic and there&#xD;
      is sparse knowledge about triggering causes. Major surgery is associated with a high risk of&#xD;
      postoperative complications. These include covert stroke, myocardial injury and -infarction,&#xD;
      and are all major contributors to mortality. The 30-day post-operative mortality in patients&#xD;
      suffering from covert stroke is increased up to eight-fold compared with matched controls and&#xD;
      is 10% in patients with MINS, which makes it a substantial public health problem.&#xD;
      Approximately 33% of patients undergoing major spine surgery suffer from major postoperative&#xD;
      complications, including stroke and myocardial infarction. However, knowledge is lacking&#xD;
      regarding which perioperative factors predict myocardial injury and -infarction, covert and&#xD;
      overt stroke, and mortality in high-risk patients such as those undergoing major spine&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure of tissue oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is non-invasive and&#xD;
      uncomplicated. Tissue desaturation is common in spine surgery patients. Previous studies&#xD;
      found that a decrease in tissue oxygenation (StO2) was associated with postoperative&#xD;
      complications such as creatinine elevation, hypotension and prolonged hospitalization.&#xD;
      However, current knowledge of how tissue oxygenation affects other clinical outcomes is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, to address these knowledge gaps the investigators propose a cohort study to examine the&#xD;
      association between tissue oxygenation and MINS in patients undergoing major spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a prospective observational cohort study. Participants are patients&#xD;
      undergoing major spine surgery. Measurements include blood samples, non-invasive tissue&#xD;
      oximetry and collection of general perioperative factors from the anesthesia machine. First&#xD;
      measurements are made on the day of surgery and further measurements are conducted on the&#xD;
      first two postoperative days. Secondary outcomes from medical records (e.g. 30-day mortality)&#xD;
      are collected retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened from Operation Room Surgery Schedule at University of California,&#xD;
      San Francisco (UCSF) prior to surgery. The informed consent will be obtained at the&#xD;
      preoperative area about 30-60 min prior to surgery. Eligible patients will sign a written&#xD;
      consent form and HIPAA Authorization for study participation. If the subject is determined to&#xD;
      have diminished or lack a capacity to consent, a surrogate/legally authorized representative&#xD;
      will need to be present to authorize their participation in the study and complete the&#xD;
      applicable forms as required by UCSF and Californian law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from medical records are entered by certified study personnel into REDCap (a HIPAA&#xD;
      compliant online data collection tool) to assure all data is complete and stored correctly.&#xD;
      Included in REDCap is a data dictionary with descriptions of every individual variable.&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for patient recruitment and enrollment, data collection&#xD;
      and data extraction have been created and are available. Tissue Oximetry data is collected&#xD;
      separately with the laboratory's oximeters. After each case/study the data is uploaded to an&#xD;
      online secure box. As all data are collected case-by-case in the course of the study, all&#xD;
      missing data are registered immediately as missing in REDCap and will be treated as missing&#xD;
      data in the final data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size assessment is based on previous studies investigation tissue oximetry and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect size: 0.36 (SD=0.50) based on Meng et al. (Br J Anaesth. 2017 Apr 1;118(4):551-562.&#xD;
      doi: 10.1093/bja/aex008.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle tissue oxygenation (SmO2) time weighted area under the curve (AUC) (%*min*hr-1 (SD)):&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;3 complications: 1.4 (0.8) &gt;3 complications: 1.9 (1.2) p-value: 0.07 Proportion of patients&#xD;
      with &gt;3 composite complications = 33% Alpha: 0.05 Beta: 0.2 (power=0.8) Sample size: 68. We&#xD;
      expect to include 70 patients in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By convention the 5% level of alpha and 20% level of beta have been used. As this study is&#xD;
      explorative and hypothesis-testing, the investigators consider the above calculation to&#xD;
      contain sufficient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be multiple regression with adjustment for age, sex and pre-existing&#xD;
      conditions including cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and obstructive respiratory diseases. The following pre-specified potential&#xD;
      confounders will be tested separately: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, history of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, insulin therapy, hypertension, preoperative creatinine&#xD;
      elevation above normal, and length of surgery. Since this relationship may or may not be&#xD;
      linear, the data will first visually be assessed by plotting the estimated probability (on&#xD;
      the logit scale) of having the outcome as a function of StO2, using a univariable logistic&#xD;
      regression incorporating a smooth (thin-plate regression spline) term for StO2 (smoothing&#xD;
      parameter obtained via cross-validation). The fit of each model will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. STATA software will be used for the statistical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
