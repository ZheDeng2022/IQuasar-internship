  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a liver disorder of pregnancy that typically&#xD;
      presents in late pregnancy with generalised itching. ICP is associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of pregnancy complications, including premature labour, fetal distress, and stillbirth.&#xD;
      Models of the fetal heart (using cells from rodents) have shown that high bile acids levels&#xD;
      cause an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which may be the cause of stillbirth. High&#xD;
      levels of bile acids also cause preterm labour in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to assess whether severe ICP, defined as maternal serum bile acid&#xD;
      levels ≥40μmol/L, is associated with abnormal fetal heart rhythms and abnormal myometrial&#xD;
      contractility, which may lead to preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal heart rhythms and myometrial contractility will be recorded using a portable&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) device, the Monica AN24. This monitors the fetal heart and myometrial&#xD;
      activity via stickers applied to the mother's abdomen. It also records the maternal ECG. It&#xD;
      will also study women with uncomplicated pregnancy, in order to make comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of maternal position during sleep has also more recently been established,&#xD;
      with some studies demonstrating an association between the risk of stillbirth and the&#xD;
      position the mother was sleeping in. Work by Stone et al published this year has shown that&#xD;
      the maternal sleep position has a significant impact on the fetal sleep state and fetal heart&#xD;
      rate, (in particular something called the fetal RMSSD value). The researchers therefore wish&#xD;
      to identify any potential correlation between fetal heart arrhythmia and maternal sleep&#xD;
      position. To do this they will use a Zephyr BioPatchTM which provides a clear indication of&#xD;
      whether the patient was in left lateral, right lateral or supine position.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) also known as obstetric cholestasis (OC) is a&#xD;
      liver disorder unique to pregnancy that affects 0.5-1% of women in the UK. It typically&#xD;
      presents in the third trimester of pregnancy with pruritus that can affect any part of the&#xD;
      body, but is most commonly experienced on the palms and soles. Biochemically, it is&#xD;
      characterised by liver dysfunction with raised serum bile acids, and clinically, by a&#xD;
      significantly increased incidence of fetal complications, including spontaneous preterm&#xD;
      labour, fetal distress, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid and sudden fetal death&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology of ICP is complex and incompletely understood although the maternal disease is&#xD;
      likely to be caused by interaction between sex hormone metabolites and bile acids in&#xD;
      genetically susceptible women . To date, genetic variation in several biliary transporters&#xD;
      have been identified that predispose women to the disease. The aetiology of the adverse&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes is also not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including spontaneous&#xD;
      preterm delivery, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, admission to the neonatal unit and&#xD;
      sudden intrauterine death. As with the maternal disease, the aetiology for the perinatal&#xD;
      complications is not fully understood, but evidence from animal and in vitro studies suggests&#xD;
      a role for bile acids. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the risk of adverse&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes is directly associated with the level of maternal serum bile acids, and&#xD;
      specifically with maternal serum bile acids exceeding 40 μmol /L, i.e. severe ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the adverse perinatal outcomes associated with ICP, the most severe is sudden intrauterine&#xD;
      death, which is reported to affect between 2 and 4% of ICP pregnancies. The mechanism for&#xD;
      fetal demise is unclear, but is appears to be a sudden event as there are several case&#xD;
      reports of normal fetal movements and CTG recordings in the hours preceding fetal demise.&#xD;
      Furthermore, at post-mortem there is typically no evidence of preceding uteroplacental&#xD;
      insufficiency, and the babies are appropriately grown. One possible explanation for the&#xD;
      sudden intrauterine death is an acute cardiac arrhythmia leading to fetal cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      This hypothesis is supported by evidence from in vitro studies of cultured neonatal rat&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes which demonstrate the development of arrhythmias following the addition of&#xD;
      bile acids to the culture (Williamson et al., 2001). Further studies have shown that this&#xD;
      effect is dose dependent and reversed by the addition of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the&#xD;
      drug commonly used to treat ICP. However, there are very few case reports in the literature&#xD;
      of fetal heart abnormalities in women with ICP, but studies have reported bradycardias,&#xD;
      tachycardias and atrial flutter. Prolongation of the PR interval in the fetal echocardiogram&#xD;
      has also been reported; this clinical feature has been known to predispose the heart to&#xD;
      arrhythmias. A recent study using the same technique has also reported fetal diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with severe ICP. Given the paucity of human clinical data regarding&#xD;
      the fetal heart rhythm in ICP, the researchers propose to undertake this study to investigate&#xD;
      whether ICP is associated with fetal arrhythmias and the influence of bile acid levels on&#xD;
      fetal heart rhythm. In parallel they will evaluate whether there is fetal ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that maternal lie has an association with stillbirth; an increased&#xD;
      risk of stillbirth was observed when women slept in a supine or right lateral position. Stone&#xD;
      et al published data from a study where the Monica AN24, a transabdominal fetal&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (fECG) monitor, was used on mothers lying in supine, left and right lateral&#xD;
      positions. They found that the fetal short-term heart rate variability (RMSSD) changed&#xD;
      depending on the position the mother was lying in. Unpublished data also using the Monica&#xD;
      AN24 has demonstrated an association between maternal lie and maternal RMSSD (Fifer et al,&#xD;
      personal communication). As the RMSSD is one of the principal measures the research team will&#xD;
      be using to detect arrhythmogenic activity, analysis will include the detection of maternal&#xD;
      lie in order to accurately determine short-term heart rate variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited evidence that the maternal heart is affected by ICP to cause maternal rhythm&#xD;
      disturbance, although there is one report of prolonged maternal QT interval. The fetal heart&#xD;
      develops in an environment of relative hypoxia and this is associated with the transformation&#xD;
      of human fetal cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which subsequently disappear&#xD;
      post-natally. Myofibroblasts may re-appear in the diseased adult heart during the process of&#xD;
      remodelling following infarction, and have been shown to act as an arrhythmogenic focus in&#xD;
      these circumstances. Interestingly, in vitro data have demonstrated that the myofibroblasts&#xD;
      also act as the arrhythmogenic focus in bile acid induced arrhythmia in the neonatal heart.&#xD;
      UDCA has also been demonstrated to protect against bile acid-induced arrhythmias in&#xD;
      myofibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP is also associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm labour. Again, the&#xD;
      reasons for this are unclear, but evidence from animal studies suggests that bile acids may&#xD;
      be involved. Bile acid infusions cause spontaneous preterm labour in sheep and in vitro&#xD;
      studies have shown that they increase the sensitivity of the myometrium to the hormone&#xD;
      oxytocin which is central to the process of labour. Human data regarding myometrial&#xD;
      contractility are lacking. As a secondary aim of this study, the research team also propose&#xD;
      to investigate whether ICP is associated with abnormal myometrial contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding fetal cardiac rhythms and myometrial contractility collected from women with&#xD;
      ICP will be compared to data collected from women with uncomplicated pregnancy. The inclusion&#xD;
      of women with uncomplicated pregnancies will ensure that any variation identified in the&#xD;
      fetal cardiac rhythms or myometrial contractility in women with ICP is attributable to the&#xD;
      condition, rather than a variant of normal. The parallel recording of the maternal ECG in&#xD;
      both women with ICP and women with uncomplicated pregnancy will enable the research team to&#xD;
      ensure that any abnormal fetal cardiac rhythms are not due to an inherited arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal and maternal ECG, and myometrial contractility data will be collected using the Monica&#xD;
      AN24 device. This is a small wearable monitor that continuously records maternal and fetal&#xD;
      ECG's, and myometrial activity data via electrodes placed on the maternal abdomen. Maternal&#xD;
      lie will be detected using the Zephyr BioPatchTM. This wearable monitor is much smaller than&#xD;
      the Monica AN24 and also functions via adhesive electrodes. It is placed at the base of the&#xD;
      breastbone of the participant.&#xD;
