      Lumbopelvic fixation is the treatment opation for spinopelvic dissociation. In our study we&#xD;
      will compare unilateral versus bilateral lumbopelvic fixation as regarding functional&#xD;
      outcomes by Majeed score along a period of 12vmonths as a primary measure and metal&#xD;
      failure,skin condition and nonunion as secondaries.&#xD;

      Traumatic loss of connection between the spine and pelvis can adopt many forms including&#xD;
      lumbosacral fracture dislocation and bilateral sacroiliac dislocation. However, the term&#xD;
      spinopelvic dissociation refers to a pathological condition in which this dissociation occurs&#xD;
      due to the association of a transverse fracture with sagittal fractures in both sacral wings,&#xD;
      result-ing in a proximal segment with the vertebral spine and the proximal sacral fragment,&#xD;
      which is mechanically separated from a distal segment formed by the pelvic girdle and the&#xD;
      rest of the sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinopelvic dissociation is an important entity to recognize because these fractures are&#xD;
      almost uniformly unstable with a very narrow set of criteria for conservative management .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of injury includes a very high energy trauma with axial compression on the&#xD;
      sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various options for internal fixation have been proposed, including percutaneous iliosacral&#xD;
      screws, transiliac bars, sacral rods, posterior small plates, or vertical stabilization alone&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors have introduced the technique of triangular posterior osteosynthesis (TPO) in&#xD;
      the treatment of vertically unstable pelvic fracture..This is a biplanar fixation able to&#xD;
      counterbalance the forces on the posterior pelvic ring during unipodal stance, so as to allow&#xD;
      early weight-bearing. The stability of fixation could be confirmed by biomechanical testing&#xD;
      of human specimens with transforaminal sacral fractures submitted to cyclic loading. The load&#xD;
      to failure of the commonly used internal fixation techniques (sacroiliac screw fixation,&#xD;
      plating limited to the sacrum) amounted to 60% of the load to failure of triangular&#xD;
      stabilizations. In order to perform the triangular osteosynthesis, we used the Click'X system&#xD;
      (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Pedicle screws were first inserted in the pedicle of L4.&#xD;
      Subsequently caudal screws were implanted into the iliac bone, through the&#xD;
      posterior-superior-iliac-spine and parallel to the sacroiliac joint. Once the four screws&#xD;
      were inserted, reduction was carried out. Connecting rods were inserted and tightened&#xD;
      initially only over the proximal pedicle screws of L4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pedicle screws were used as ''joysticks'' in order to achieve reduction in the vertical&#xD;
      and horizontal direction at this point, the connecting rod was tightened over the distal&#xD;
      screws, therefore stabilizing the fracture. In order to obtain stabilization in the&#xD;
      horizontal plane a 6-mm rod was inserted as atransversal cross-link between the two&#xD;
      longitudinal connecting rods.e used the Click'X system (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland).&#xD;
