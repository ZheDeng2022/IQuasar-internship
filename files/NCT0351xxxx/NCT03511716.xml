  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational, multi-center trial in which patients with mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      sufficient to merit mitral valve repair will receive a surgical transvalvular, intra-annular&#xD;
      Mitral Bridge™ to reduce or eliminate mitral regurgitation.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Mitral&#xD;
      Bridge device in the correction of mitral valve regurgitation in patients who qualify for&#xD;
      mitral valve repair as defined by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE). The device&#xD;
      is a single use, mitral valve implant designed to reduce mitral regurgitation by reducing the&#xD;
      septo-lateral mitral annular diameter, promoting early coaptation of the valve leaflets and&#xD;
      restraining the leaflets below the intra-annular plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was designed as a First In Man (FIM) with a 6-month follow up but was amended to&#xD;
      follow the enrolled patients for a total of 5 years.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Patients over the age of 21 with moderate to severe, functional (ischemic or dilated&#xD;
        cardiomyopathies) mitral regurgitation or mitral regurgitation caused by dilation of the&#xD;
        mitral annulus who qualify for mitral valve repair&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients moderate to severe, symptomatic functional (ischemic or dilated&#xD;
             cardiomyopathies) mitral regurgitation or mitral regurgitation caused by dilation of&#xD;
             the mitral annulus who qualify for mitral valve repair with cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mitral regurgitation must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The primary regurgitant jet is central, originating from mal coaptation of anterior&#xD;
             and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a secondary jet is present, the jet must be considered clinically insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe mitral annular and leaflet calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is hemodynamically unstable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has systolic anterior motion of the&#xD;
             leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient requires emergency surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or rheumatic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) is contraindicated or cannot be performed&#xD;
             intraoperatively for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known chronic, dialysis-dependent renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or reversible ischemic neurological&#xD;
             disease within the last three (3) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding within the last three (3) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergy to aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or hypersensitivity to clopidogrel (Plavix) or its congeners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or treated malignancies in the last twelve (12) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is participating in another clinical study for which follow-up is currently&#xD;
             ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing age who have not had a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with non-cardiac co-morbidities and life expectancy &lt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes&#xD;
             participation, including willingness to comply with all follow-up procedures.&#xD;
