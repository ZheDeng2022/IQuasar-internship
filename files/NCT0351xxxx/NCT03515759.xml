    <textblock>
      60 pregnant women with singleton living fetus between 34 -38 wks gestation known to have&#xD;
      severe hypertension in the current pregnancy were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants underwent Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate the Feto-Placental Circulation&#xD;
      within 24 hours from Pregnancy Termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow Velocity Waveforms were obtained from: Umbilical Artery (UA), Middle Cerebral Artery&#xD;
      (MCA), Ductus Venosus (DV), Umbilical Vein (UV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the flow velocity waveforms the following indices were measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      UA &amp; MCA: Pulsatility Index (PI) &amp; Resistance Index (RI), DV: Peak Velocity Index For veins&#xD;
      (PVIV), Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) &amp; a- wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UV Flow: Presence or Absence of Pulsatile Flow.&#xD;

      60 pregnant women (aged from 18- 35 years) with singleton healthy living fetus between 34 -38&#xD;
      wks gestation known to have severe hypertension in the current pregnancy were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure value of 140/90 mm Hg or higher&#xD;
      diagnosed before 20 weeks' gestation or preconception. Gestational Hypertension was defined&#xD;
      as blood pressure value of 140/90 mm Hg or higher on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart that&#xD;
      occurred after 20 weeks' gestation in a patient with previously normal blood pressure.&#xD;
      Preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure value of 140/90 mm Hg or higher on 2 occasions at&#xD;
      least 4 hours apart and proteinuria (Proteinuria is defined as the excretion of 300mg or more&#xD;
      of protein in a 24 hour urine collection or 1+ by The dipstick method) that occurred after 20&#xD;
      weeks' gestation in a patient with previously normal blood pressure. Chronic hypertension &amp;&#xD;
      gestational hypertension was considered to be severe if systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg, or both &amp; persists for 15 minutes or more. Preeclampsia&#xD;
      was considered to be severe in the following conditions: Blood pressure of 160/110 or more,&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 1000,000 / microliter), impaired liver function&#xD;
      (elevated blood levels of liver transaminases to twice the normal concentration) , severe&#xD;
      persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication and not&#xD;
      accounted for by alternative diagnosis, or both, the new development of renal insufficiency&#xD;
      (elevated serum creatinine &gt; 1.1mg/dL or a doubling of serum creatinine in the absence of&#xD;
      other renal disease) &amp; new-onset cerebral or visual disturbances. Patients with other&#xD;
      maternal medical disorders rather than hypertension or experienced rupture of membrane or&#xD;
      antepartum hemorrhage (placenta previa or accidental hemorrhage) were excluded. Also,&#xD;
      patients who received respiratory depressants medications within 2 hours from the delivery of&#xD;
      the fetus (e. g., opioid analgesic) were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consents were obtained from all participants after explanation of the study and its&#xD;
      aims. All participants underwent the following: Full history taking including a detailed&#xD;
      history of the hypertension state during the current pregnancy (onset, course, current&#xD;
      medication, and whether the blood pressure is controlled or not). complete physical&#xD;
      examination: general (including BMI &amp; blood pressure measurement) and obstetric examinations.&#xD;
      Routine obstetric ultrasound: to confirm gestational age &amp; fetal viability &amp; number, assess&#xD;
      fetal weight (EFW) and growth percentile &amp; amniotic fluid index (AFI) &amp; to exclude fetal&#xD;
      anomalies. Laboratory investigations (Complete blood count (CBC) - Urine analysis for&#xD;
      albuminuria - Liver enzymes &amp; kidney function). In addition to Doppler ultrasonography&#xD;
      assessment using GE Voluson Pro-V and GE Voluson E10 with 3.5-5 MHz abdominal transducer).&#xD;
      The color flow imaging (to identify the vessels) &amp; pulsed wave velocimetry was used to obtain&#xD;
      flow velocity waveforms within 24 hours of pregnancy termination from: Umbilical artery (UA):&#xD;
      from a free-floating loop in the mid portion of the cord, Middle cerebral artery (MCA):&#xD;
      obtained from a transverse image of the fetal head at the level of sphenoid bones (color flow&#xD;
      im¬aging was used to display the circle of Willis), Ductus venosus (DV) was sampled soon&#xD;
      after its origin from the umbilical vein &amp; finally Umbilical vein flow (UV) assessment. In&#xD;
      all Doppler studies, while the woman is lying in a semi-recumbent position, the angle of&#xD;
      insonation of the vessels is &lt; 45 degrees &amp; the high-pass filter is set at 100 Hz. Care is&#xD;
      taken not to exert undue pressure on the fetal head because this alters the flow velocity&#xD;
      waveforms from the MCA. Furthermore, examination of the fetal vessels was performed in the&#xD;
      absence of fetal body and respiratory movements, with a fetal heart rate ranging from 120-160&#xD;
      bpm. Measurements was obtained from ≥ 4 consecutive flow velocity waveforms of good quality&#xD;
      and averaged. From the flow velocity waveforms of the UA &amp; MCA, the pulsatility index (PI) &amp;&#xD;
      the resistance index (RI) was measured. From the flow velocity waveforms of the DV, peak&#xD;
      velocity index (PVIV), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and A wave was measured. From the&#xD;
      umbilical vein flow, the presence or absence of pulsatile flow was recorded. All labours was&#xD;
      attended by an expert neonatologist who was blinded to the results of Doppler indices&#xD;
      measurements &amp; the following was recorded: APGAR score at (1 &amp; 5 min) - Neonatal birth weight&#xD;
      (Fetal growth restriction will defined as birth weight of less than 10th percentile of&#xD;
      newborn weight in normal pregnancies at corresponding gestational age) - the occurrence of&#xD;
      respiratory complications [Transient Tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) or Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (RDS)] - The further need for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission &amp;&#xD;
      Perinatal death.&#xD;
