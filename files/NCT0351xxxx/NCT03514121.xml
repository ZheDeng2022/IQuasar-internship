  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of FPA150, an anti-B7H4 antibody alone or in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab an anti-PD1 antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      The Phase 1a, open-label, cohort will identify a recommended dose of FPA150 to use for Phase&#xD;
      1a Combination (FPA150 and Pembrolizumab) Safety Lead-in and for Phase 1b monotherapy&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/1b open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the dosing, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of FPA150 as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a Phase 1a FPA150 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Phase 1a Monotherapy Dose&#xD;
      Exploration, Phase 1a combination Safety Lead-in (FPA150 + pembrolizumab), a Phase 1b FPA150&#xD;
      Monotherapy Dose Expansion, and a Phase 1b combination Dose Expansion (FPA150 +&#xD;
      pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1a Monotherapy Dose Escalation will include an initial accelerated titration design&#xD;
      followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation design until the MTD and/or RD for Phase 1b is&#xD;
      determined. The Phase 1a combination Safety Lead-In will start enrolling once the FPA150&#xD;
      monotherapy RD is identified in Phase 1a monotherapy dose escalation and will continue until&#xD;
      the FPA150 MTD/RD in combination is identified. Phase 1a FPA150 monotherapy Dose Exploration&#xD;
      may include cohorts that may enroll beyond 3 patients whose tumors express high levels of&#xD;
      B7-H4 protein and/or have varying levels of B7H4 expression including low (&lt;10% IHC 2+ or 3+&#xD;
      scores) or no expression on their tumor cells (up to 20 additional patients across all dose&#xD;
      levels) to further evaluate safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity at that dose&#xD;
      (to be conditional upon the dose level clearing DLT criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b will be the Dose Expansion (monotherapy and combination) portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Phase 1b Dose Expansion will begin after identification of the MTD and/or RD&#xD;
      in Phase 1a (monotherapy and Safety Lead-in). Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in Phase&#xD;
      1b in planned expansion cohorts that include patients with specific tumor types that are&#xD;
      B7-H4+ advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
