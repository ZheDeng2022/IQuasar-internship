  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well testosterone (enanthate or cypionate) and olaparib work&#xD;
      in treating patients with prostate cancer that has progressed despite hormonal therapy.&#xD;
      Hormonal therapy, such as leuprolide, may lessen the amount of male sex hormones made by the&#xD;
      body. In patients that have developed progressive cancer in spite of standard hormonal&#xD;
      treatment (i.e. castration-resistant prostate cancer), administering testosterone may result&#xD;
      in regression of tumors by causing DNA damage in cancer cells that have adapted to low&#xD;
      testosterone conditions. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes involved in repairing DNA damage. Therefore, giving testosterone and olaparib&#xD;
      together may work better in treating castration-resistant prostate cancer by generating DNA&#xD;
      damage that the cancer cell is unable to repair.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)50 response rate (i.e., percent of patients&#xD;
      with a PSA decline of at least 50% below baseline) following 12-weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) plus olaparib in men with asymptomatic metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or&#xD;
      enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the percent of mCRPC patients achieving a radiographic response per Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria following treatment with BAT plus&#xD;
      olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the radiographic progression free survival (PFS) in mCRPC patients treated with&#xD;
      BAT plus olaparib using RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue metastases and Prostate Cancer&#xD;
      Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the PSA PFS rate according to PCWG3 criteria in mCRPC patients treated with&#xD;
      BAT plus olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the PFS (i.e. whichever occurs first: clinical, radiographic or PSA&#xD;
      progression) in mCRPC patients treated with BAT plus olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the overall survival in mCRPC patients treated with BAT plus olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Track changes in quality of life (QoL) as determined using the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT-P) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)&#xD;
      surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Assess the incidence and severity of adverse events according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate for differences in response and PFS in patients with/without mutations in genes&#xD;
      involved in homologous recombination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine intratumoral androgen levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC/MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess for evidence of double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) breaks using&#xD;
      gamma-H2AX immunostaining on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess androgen receptor (AR) and AR splice variant (AR-V) transcript expression levels&#xD;
      using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess androgen receptor (AR) and AR splice variant (AR-V) protein expression levels using&#xD;
      immunostaining on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Sequence tumor DNA (cell-free circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA] and/or metastatic tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Conduct transcript profiling studies on CTCs (multiplexed qRT-PCR) and metastatic tissue&#xD;
      (ribonucleic acid sequencing [RNA-seq]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and testosterone&#xD;
      enanthate or cypionate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
