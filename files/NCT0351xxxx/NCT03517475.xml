  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will pilot test (N=100 caregivers of children ages 3-4 years) the effects&#xD;
      of a caregiver supervision intervention on caregivers' supervision and children's injury&#xD;
      frequency using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design. The control group will receive&#xD;
      Services as Usual (SAU), and the treatment group will receive SAU+ SHS. The results will be&#xD;
      used to support an R01 application to conduct a larger-scale RCT test of the program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the RCT, the investigators will recruit Head Start participants with help from the home&#xD;
      visitors (using procedures that are similar to phase 1 recruitment procedures). The home&#xD;
      visitors will read a short script about the study to eligible clients; it will be emphasized&#xD;
      that the Head Start services they receive will not be impacted by their decision about&#xD;
      whether or not to participate. Interested caregivers will sign a release form for the home&#xD;
      visitors to provide the caregiver's contact information to study personnel. A Graduate&#xD;
      Research Assistant (GRA) will then call the caregivers and will read a recruitment script. If&#xD;
      the caregiver is interested in participating, the GRA will set up a meeting in the&#xD;
      caregiver's home to complete consent and baseline measures. Caregivers will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate if they are the primary caregiver (male or female) for at least one child in the&#xD;
      target age range (3-4 years-of-age), the caregiver can speak and read English, and the&#xD;
      caregiver did not participate in the focus group study. The investigators will exclude&#xD;
      families in which the target child has been diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder&#xD;
      or is blind or deaf because such conditions often result in specialized supervision&#xD;
      requirements, and the investigators have not tailored the intervention to be appropriate for&#xD;
      such families. Later research may examine whether the intervention or a modified version of&#xD;
      it, is appropriate for such families. If there is more than one child in the home who is&#xD;
      attending Head Start and is between the ages of 3-4 years, the investigators will use a&#xD;
      random procedure to choose the target child. Participants who consent will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the treatment or control condition by the primary investigator after the&#xD;
      consent appointment. A blinded design will be used so the GRA who will collect data will not&#xD;
      know who is in the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A GRA and URA will administer baseline, post-test, and follow-up assessments at participants'&#xD;
      homes. Baseline assessments will include three self-report measures of caregiver supervision&#xD;
      beliefs and practices, a measure of caregivers' injury beliefs, and a measure of children's&#xD;
      injury history. The investigators will also conduct an observation of in-home supervision and&#xD;
      collect data on current injuries. The baseline, post, and follow-up sessions will take&#xD;
      approximately one hour. If needed, the GRA will assist caregivers with low literacy to&#xD;
      complete the measures by reading the measures aloud or by answering questions about the&#xD;
      measures. The investigators have used this approach successfully in previous studies&#xD;
      (Damashek &amp; Corlis, 2017; Damashek, Hughes, Chahin, &amp; Corlis, 2017). After the baseline&#xD;
      session, primary caregivers randomized to the treatment condition will participate in&#xD;
      one-hour intervention sessions in their home for 5 weeks. Those randomized to the treatment&#xD;
      group will receive the tailored SHS intervention in addition to their Head Start home&#xD;
      visiting services (SHS+SAU); those randomized to the control group will only receive the Head&#xD;
      Start home visiting services (SAU). A GRA will deliver the intervention to the treatment&#xD;
      group and will be assisted by an Undergraduate Research Assistant (URA). The GRA will be&#xD;
      trained by the co-investigator to deliver SHS and will use a manual to guide delivery (based&#xD;
      on previous work, Morrongiello et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A week after the last intervention session (or an equivalent time period for the control&#xD;
      group), the GRA and URA will return to the participant's home and will re-administer the same&#xD;
      measures taken at baseline, in addition to questionnaires assessing their satisfaction with&#xD;
      the intervention and perception of the intervention's cultural acceptability. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a 1-month follow-up to assess for sustainability of effects during&#xD;
      which the investigators will administer the same supervision and injury measures as at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to self-report measures, the investigators will conduct pre-, post-, and&#xD;
      follow-up observational assessments of maternal supervision, based on an innovative testing&#xD;
      protocol developed by Morrongiello and her colleagues (Morrongiello, McArthur, Goodman, &amp;&#xD;
      Bell, 2015). During the data collection appointments, the investigators will set up a&#xD;
      situation in which the investigators will observe caregivers' supervision of their child&#xD;
      while they are distracted and while their child is exposed to an interesting and potentially&#xD;
      hazardous object (a &quot;gadget&quot;, see Measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect data on children's minor everyday injury frequencies&#xD;
      using a structured injury interview that will be administered weekly via telephone; this&#xD;
      measure has been used in previous research by the PI (Damashek &amp; Corlis, 2017). The first&#xD;
      interview will be administered in person during the baseline data collection session. A&#xD;
      second baseline injury interview will occur 1 week before caregivers participate in their&#xD;
      first intervention session. Additional administrations will occur weekly via telephone&#xD;
      through the follow-up data collection appointment.&#xD;
