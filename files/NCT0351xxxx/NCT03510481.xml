  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease malaria affects many people in Mali and other parts of Africa and the world. It&#xD;
      is caused by germs spread by mosquito bites. Malaria may be mild. But it can also be serious&#xD;
      or lead to death if it is not treated promptly. Researchers want to find a safe vaccine that&#xD;
      prevents malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how safe and tolerable the malaria vaccine called PfSPZ Vaccine is for healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ages 18-35 in Ouelessebougou, Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not infected with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for females, not pregnant or breastfeeding and must use reliable birth control during&#xD;
           the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about malaria and will undergo blood, urine, and&#xD;
      heart tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. They will get injections of either&#xD;
      the PfSPZ Vaccine or a salt-water placebo. They will not know which one they get.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinations will occur leading into the malaria transmission each year with 3 injections&#xD;
      leading into Year 1 (malaria transmission season in 2018) and 1 injection prior to Year 2&#xD;
      (malaria transmission season 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One vaccine group and one placebo group will get an injection 3 times over 4 weeks with an&#xD;
      additional vaccination ~10 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other two groups (vaccine group and placebo) will get an injection 3 times over 16 weeks&#xD;
      with an additional vaccination ~10 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated with an antimalarial medication prior to the third injection&#xD;
      and prior to fourth injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be followed for approximately 6 months after third and fourth injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At vaccine visits, female participants will have a pregnancy test before injection. All&#xD;
      participants will have an arm cleaned and the vaccine injected in a vein. They will be&#xD;
      watched for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At non-vaccine visits, participants will have a physical exam and be asked how they are&#xD;
      feeling. They will usually have blood tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated immunization with&#xD;
      radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Sanaria, Inc. has developed a process for manufacturing, in&#xD;
      compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) aseptic, purified, radiation-&#xD;
      attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites from a well-characterized isolate of Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum (Pf). This product, which is called PfSPZ Vaccine, can be administered by needle&#xD;
      and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC, Mali), the Laboratory&#xD;
      of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. has shown that sterile protection against naturally&#xD;
      occurring malaria infection can be achieved. In this study, five doses of 2.7 x 10^5 PfSPZ&#xD;
      during the dry season resulted in protective efficacies of about 48% by time to first&#xD;
      positive blood smears (BS) and about 29% by proportion of participants with at least one&#xD;
      positive BS during a full malaria transmission season (20 weeks), higher than those reported&#xD;
      for other malaria vaccine candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up study in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02627456) that reduced the&#xD;
      number of vaccinations (from 5 to 3) while increasing the dose of sporozoites at each&#xD;
      vaccination (2.7 x10^5 to 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine) was conducted. Preliminary results show&#xD;
      that 42 of 55 (77.8%) participants from the placebo group and 32 of 54 participants (58.1%)&#xD;
      from the vaccine group developed Pf infection. Per protocol, the vaccine efficacy (VE) was&#xD;
      51% (p=0.004, 95% CI 20-70) by time-to-infection analysis (intention to treat (ITT) 39%,&#xD;
      p=0.033) and 24% (p=0.031, 95% CI 2-41) by proportional analysis (ITT 22%, p= 0.041), similar&#xD;
      to the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are ongoing to establish a vaccination regimen, optimum dose and schedule, that will&#xD;
      lead to improved sterile protection in endemic regions. Preliminary results from more recent&#xD;
      studies in malaria-naïve and malaria-experienced participants have shown that 9.0x10^5 PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine dose per vaccination (lower than 1.8 x10^6 used in studies above) in a three-dose&#xD;
      regimen may be an optimal dose for immunization. In addition, there is emerging evidence that&#xD;
      a condensed, more practical regimen may also lead to development of sterile immunity. This&#xD;
      proposed study is therefore designed to assess safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy&#xD;
      of two separate three-dose vaccination regimens during natural transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the main phase were randomized into arms receiving either PfSPZ Vaccine or&#xD;
      normal saline injections. Each group received three doses of the respective injection during&#xD;
      Year 1. After completion of the follow up in the main phase, all participants that are still&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will be offered continued participation to receive a booster dose of&#xD;
      the vaccine (dose # 4) with 9.0x10^5 PfSPZ or normal saline (depending on the group they were&#xD;
      originally randomized to) at approximately 10 months post #3 vaccination. The booster dose is&#xD;
      timed prior to ensuing malaria transmission season. Participants will be followed, similarly&#xD;
      to the follow up during the main phase, for safety and vaccine efficacy for approximately 6&#xD;
      months during this second transmission season.&#xD;
