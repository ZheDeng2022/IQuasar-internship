    <textblock>
      This study will test whether seven days adjunctive administration of a serotonin receptor&#xD;
      subtype 4 (5HT4) agonist called PF-04995274 has positive effects on emotional processing and&#xD;
      neural activity in medicated, treatment-resistant depressed patients compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised between-groups design to test&#xD;
      if adjunctive administration of a serotonin receptor subtype 4 (5HT4) agonist called&#xD;
      PF-04995274 has positive effects on emotional processing and neural activity in medicated&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depressed patients. Participants are patients who fulfill criteria for&#xD;
      current episode of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and have shown lack of response to&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment, and they will be randomised to receive 7 days treatment with either&#xD;
      PF-04995274 (15 mg daily) or a matched placebo. Participants will come for a Screening Visit,&#xD;
      a First Dose Visit, and a Research Visit (including measures of emotional processing and&#xD;
      non-emotion cognition).&#xD;

             Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) - with the exception of fluoxetine, paroxetine or&#xD;
             fluvoxamine - or a Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) ; Participants&#xD;
             currently taking excluded medications can be switched to sertraline or citalopram;&#xD;

          -  Participants currently taking strong cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes inhibitors, such&#xD;

             (apart from their prescribed antidepressant and the contraceptive pill). Participants&#xD;
             who have taken prescription medication may still be entered into the study, if, in the&#xD;
