  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is treated with antiretroviral drugs. Many people with HIV&#xD;
      also have the lung infection tuberculosis (TB). Most TB treatments are complicated. A simpler&#xD;
      treatment of two TB drugs can be taken once a week. Researchers want to study how the HIV and&#xD;
      TB drugs affect each other so people who take both can be treated safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study if rifapentine and isoniazid affect blood levels of the common antiretroviral TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-65 without HIV, TB, or hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fast before the screening visit. They will have a medical history, physical&#xD;
      exam, and blood tests. Women may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use effective birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not take most medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not drink alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, participants will repeat screening tests and get TAF tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take TAF once a day for 31 days. They will keep track of doses and side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 32 days, participants will have 4 long visits and 4 short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fast the night before&#xD;
&#xD;
      Get food&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take that day s TAF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review their TAF supply&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have pregnancy and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 visits, participants will also take the 2 TB drugs and vitamin B6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 long visits, participants will also have blood collected 8 times over 8 hours by plastic&#xD;
      tube in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around Day 46, participants will fast and have blood and pregnancy tests. Two weeks later,&#xD;
      they will get a call to see how they are feeling....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rifapentine (RPT) is a long-acting rifamycin that can be used weekly with isoniazid (INH) as&#xD;
      a first-line regimen in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Although this&#xD;
      regimen offers several potential benefits, the use of weekly RPT plus INH is limited in&#xD;
      adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) due&#xD;
      to lack of drug interaction data with antiretrovirals (ARVs). Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is&#xD;
      a preferred backbone agent by the current Department of Health and Human Services ARV&#xD;
      guidelines and is a part of multiple recommended first-line regimens for the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV. However, the use of TAF with rifamycins, including RPT, is not recommended due to&#xD;
      potential drug interactions. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      concomitant RPT and INH administration on the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of plasma&#xD;
      TAF, plasma tenofovir (TFV), and intracellular TFV diphosphate (dp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, fixed sequence, intrasubject drug-drug interaction study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the steady state PK of TAF, TFV, and TFV-dp with coadministration of once-weekly RPT&#xD;
      + INH administered at doses used to treat LTBI. The study will consist of two phases: (1) TAF&#xD;
      once daily alone (days 1-14) and (2) TAF once daily + weight-based RPT + INH once weekly&#xD;
      (days 15-31). Participants will undergo periodic serial ARV PK blood draws over 24 hours on&#xD;
      days 14-15, 22-23, and 31-32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAF, TFV, and TFV-dp PK will be determined using non-compartmental methods. The following PK&#xD;
      parameters will be compared between phases: area under the curve over the dosing interval,&#xD;
      maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal half-life,&#xD;
      apparent oral clearance, and minimum plasma concentration. Adverse events will be graded and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
