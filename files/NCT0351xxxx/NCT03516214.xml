      The aim of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D), to define pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      continuous treatment with EGF816 and trametinib in locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB&#xD;
      or IV) lung cancer patients with activating mutations in the epithelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The population of interest for this trial is defined by patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) harbouring the sensitizing EGFR mutations del19 or p.L858R. Patients may be&#xD;
      enrolled in first- or later lines of therapy and independently of the prior (approved) EGFR&#xD;
      inhibitor administered and independently of the EGFR p.T790M-status. Those individuals whose&#xD;
      tumors harbour high-level amplifications of MET or other EGFR mutations except for del19,&#xD;
      p.L858R or p.T790M will be excluded from the trial. The molecular status must have been&#xD;
      determined in a biopsy collected at progression to the last systemic and prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of the trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) for a continuous treatment with the 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor EGF816 and the&#xD;
      MEK inhibitor trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations for dose level escalations will be based on an &quot;up-and-down&quot; design&#xD;
      proposed by Storer, 1989. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period comprises the first 28 days&#xD;
      of treatment with EGF816 and trametinib at the designated dose level (Cycle 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK parameters of the combination treatment will be assessed for every dose level in every&#xD;
      patient during the dose-escalation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary efficacy of EGF816 and trametinib in the trial population will be assessed by&#xD;
      RECIST (v1.1) analysis of scheduled CT scans (every 8 weeks or as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study blood samples will be collected to monitor cell free plasma DNA (cfDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop resistance upon treatment with the study drugs will undergo a rebiopsy&#xD;
      to identify potential mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;
