      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using anterior approach through&#xD;
      the posterior oropharynx for treating alar and transverse ligament injuries with bone marrow&#xD;
      concentrate for patients with craniocervical junction (CCJ) instability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled study&#xD;
      of patients with CCJ instability that are randomized to either 2 bone marrow concentrate&#xD;
      (BMC) treatments or 2 sham procedure to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using an&#xD;
      anterior approach through the posterior oropharynx for treating alar and transverse ligament&#xD;
      injuries in addition to upper cervical injection treatment. Patients will undergo a bone&#xD;
      marrow aspiration of approximately 30-60 cc from the posterior superior iliac crest for each&#xD;
      procedure. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) and platelet lysate (PL) will be derived from the bone&#xD;
      marrow aspirate and later mixed with the bone marrow nucleated cell layer for those in the&#xD;
      treatment group. While under unconscious TIVA anesthesia, the injectate is then injected&#xD;
      under fluoroscopy into the area in need of treatment using an anterior approach through the&#xD;
      posterior oropharynx with direct visualization of the injection site via endoscopy. Patients&#xD;
      will be repositioned in the prone position to then receive upper cervical injections to C0-C3&#xD;
      ligaments and facets. Patients assigned to the sham control condition will also undergo a&#xD;
      bone marrow aspiration of 30-60 cc to maintain blinding. Control subjects will receive a sham&#xD;
      procedure of a small skin puncture to the posterior oropharynx guided under fluoroscopy while&#xD;
      under anesthesia, as well as those pokes to mimic the upper cervical injections to the C0-C3&#xD;
      ligaments and facets. In this group, the BMC will be donated for research purposes and not&#xD;
      used clinically. Study patients will be evaluated at 3 months after the 2nd procedure months&#xD;
      using patient reported clinical outcome questionnaires and digital motion x-ray. Control&#xD;
      patients can crossover to the treatment group after being unblinded at 3-months after the 2nd&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to invasive surgery, ligament injections of proliferant agents&#xD;
      (prolotherapy) have been proposed to treat cervical instability. Our group has used a blinded&#xD;
      flexion-extension radiography to demonstrate that injections of cervical proliferant agents&#xD;
      (hypertonic dextrose) into the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments can objectively reduce&#xD;
      excessive cervical translation in flexion (Centeno et al. 2005). More recently we have&#xD;
      published on the use of bone marrow concentrate to demonstrate MRI evidence of robust ACL&#xD;
      ligament signal changes consistent with healing and repair (Centeno et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges of treating the upper cervical ligaments through injection is that they&#xD;
      can't be accessed from the posterior due to obstruction from the cervical spinal cord.Our&#xD;
      group has developed an injection technique using an anterior approach through the posterior&#xD;
      oropharynx, which allows direct access to the ligaments for injection. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in carefully selected CCJ instability&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
