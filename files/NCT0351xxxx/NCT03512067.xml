      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Entrainment-based ventilation is a new mode of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation based on the classical physics theory of mutual entrainment between coupled&#xD;
      oscillators. Typically, the entrained inspiratory activity may precede or lag behind machine&#xD;
      inflation depending on whether spontaneous respiratory frequency is higher or lower than the&#xD;
      ventilator frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators anticipate that the results of the study will help to improve&#xD;
      the interaction of patients with the mechanical ventilator thereby minimizing the risks of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in future. The investigators believe the potential benefits&#xD;
      significantly outweigh the potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This is a prospective study and single site. Twenty&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients, stable on their current vent settings and are capable of&#xD;
      triggering the ventilator in the SICU, MICU, CCU and Cardiac and Neuro Surgery ICUs at BWH&#xD;
      will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent a respiratory real-time data monitor will be placed between&#xD;
      the artificial airway and the Y piece of the ventilator circuit. Baseline mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation data with conventional pressure-limited assist/control ventilation mode will then&#xD;
      be collected for a 4-hour period. The patients will then be transitioned to pressure-limited&#xD;
      entrainment-based ventilation for a 4-hour period. Baseline ventilation monitoring will be&#xD;
      carried out either immediately preceding or immediately following EMV in the same patient.&#xD;
      The sequence of the control/baseline phase and the experimental phase of the study will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Demographic data, weight, height, and past and current medical history will&#xD;
      be recorded. Also hospital admission information, reasons of mechanical ventilation, mode of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and settings, arterial blood gas, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      (hematology/chemistry) values, and hemodynamic values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographic and procedural variables will be analyzed&#xD;
      statistically by plotting the 95% confidence intervals of each variable. For feasibility&#xD;
      evaluation, the total number of each type of asynchronous breaths/hour during&#xD;
      entrainment-based ventilation will be averaged over the 4-hour experimental period and&#xD;
      compared with those in the 4-hour baseline ventilation period.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All currently available mechanical ventilation modes assume that patient-ventilator&#xD;
      interaction is necessarily a &quot;master-slave&quot; or controller-follower relationship. In&#xD;
      controlled mechanical ventilation, the ventilator takes control of the ventilatory rhythm&#xD;
      irrespective of whether the patient is breathing or not. In the patient-triggered mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation modes such as assist/control, pressure support ventilation, proportional assist&#xD;
      ventilation, neutrally adjusted ventilator support), instead of the ventilator dictating the&#xD;
      ventilatory rhythm (ventilator-based ventilation), patient triggering allows the patient to&#xD;
      initiate the breath with the ventilator responding to the patients demand (patient-based&#xD;
      ventilation) with the imposition of various support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entrainment-based mechanical ventilation (EMV) is a new mode of mechanical ventilation based&#xD;
      on the classical physics theory of mutual entrainment between coupled oscillators. It takes&#xD;
      advantage of the patient's powerful innate capacity to entrain 1:1 to the ventilator rhythm&#xD;
      via the Herring-Breuer reflex, provided that the ventilator rhythm is close enough to the&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing rhythm. This ability of the respiratory system to adapt to changes in&#xD;
      the entrainment mechanism via habituation and desensitization of the Herring-Breuer reflex&#xD;
      allows an even greater dynamic range of entrainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for the investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that the results of the study will help to improve the&#xD;
      interaction of patients with the mechanical ventilator thereby minimizing the risks of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in future. We believe the potential benefits significantly outweigh&#xD;
      the potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the ability of entrainment-based mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation to provide synchronous mechanical ventilation to patients in the SICU, MICU, CCU&#xD;
      and Cardiac and Neuro Surgery ICUs at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent a respiratory real-time data monitor will be placed between&#xD;
      the artificial airway and the Y piece of the ventilator circuit. Baseline mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation data with conventional pressure-limited assist/control ventilation mode will then&#xD;
      be collected for a 4-hour period. The patients will then be transitioned to pressure-limited&#xD;
      entrainment-based ventilation for a 4-hour period. Baseline ventilation monitoring will be&#xD;
      carried out either immediately preceding or immediately following EMV in the same patient.&#xD;
      The sequence of the control/baseline phase and the experimental phase of the study will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the observation study period, the basic ventilator settings will remain as prescribed&#xD;
      during conventional mechanical ventilation. Any adjustment in basic ventilator settings will&#xD;
      be up to the medical staff caring for the patient. Throughout the observational period a&#xD;
      respiratory therapist familiar with the operation of entrainment-based ventilation will be at&#xD;
      the patients' bedside constantly observing the patients interaction with the ventilator. In&#xD;
      addition, the ventilator alarms and limits will be set appropriately preventing the airway&#xD;
      pressure from increasing more than 5 cmH2O above the set level or the respiratory rate or&#xD;
      tidal volume from exceeding or decreasing below the patient average tidal volume or&#xD;
      respiratory rate by more than 25%. Apnea backup ventilation will be set to activate after a&#xD;
      20 second apnea period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, weight, height, and past and current medical history will be recorded. Also&#xD;
      hospital admission information, reasons of mechanical ventilation, mode of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and settings, arterial blood gas, clinical laboratory (hematology/chemistry)&#xD;
      values, and hemodynamic values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A respiratory real-time data monitor will continuously collect mechanical ventilation data,&#xD;
      which will be downloaded to a laptop computer for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood gas analysis will be performed at the 2nd hr and at end of the baseline ventilation&#xD;
      period, 2nd hr and at the end of the entrainment-based ventilation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen saturation and blood pressure will be recorded every 15 minutes (every 5 minutes in&#xD;
      the first hour) until completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG will be monitored continuously and recorded every 15 minutes (every 5 minutes in the&#xD;
      first hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate, paradoxical breathing, accessory muscle use, nasal flaring, will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria will be used to identify failure of entrainment-based ventilation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RR &gt; 35/min for &gt; 5 min SpO2 &lt; 88% for 5 minutes and not corrected by suctioning or if SpO2 &lt;&#xD;
      80% at any time Pulse sustained &lt; 50/min or &gt; 120/min PH + 0.05 units from baseline pH PCO2 +&#xD;
      10 mmHg from baseline PCO2 Mean arterial pressure sustained + 20 mmHg from baseline pressure&#xD;
      Ischemic changes on ECG New onset of paradoxical breathing, accessory muscle use, nasal&#xD;
      flaring, etc. Agitation (RASS &gt; +1), diaphoresis, persistent anxiety despite reassurance and&#xD;
      requiring sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once any of these safety criteria are met, the patient will be placed back to the baseline&#xD;
      ventilation mode and closely observed for return to the pre-intervention baseline. Any&#xD;
      patient who does not return to a pre-intervention baseline within 5 minutes after return to&#xD;
      baseline ventilator settings will be evaluated by the study doctor for possible adverse&#xD;
      effects or serious adverse effects and the patient will not be given further EMV therapy.&#xD;
      Such AEs or SAEs will be deemed unknown related UADE or USADE. The DSMB will review the data&#xD;
      and any safety concerns along with the Investigator and Sponsor each time any adverse event&#xD;
      or serious adverse event occurs regardless of whether such an event is device related or not.&#xD;
      If three or more non-serious adverse events occur or if two serious adverse events occur or&#xD;
      if any death occurs, the corresponding events will be deemed possibly device related and the&#xD;
      study will be placed on hold and the DSMB will review all available data at the time of the&#xD;
      hold. The FDA and IRBs would review and approve any and all modifications to the protocol in&#xD;
      response to such a study hold. Unanticipated problems and adverse events that occur during&#xD;
      the conduct of the study, after study completion, or after subject withdrawal or completion&#xD;
      will be reported to the IRB within 5 working days/7 calendar days of the date the&#xD;
      investigator first becomes aware of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first indications of any adverse events: such as bronchospasm, atelectasis, hypoxemia,&#xD;
      barotraumas, pulmonary edema, prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased ventilatory&#xD;
      requirements, pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute lung injury, ARDS, organ failure, MI, or death&#xD;
      are abnormal cardiorespiratory responses meeting the above safety criteria will be reported&#xD;
      to the IRB and FDA according to the guidelines. Serious adverse events will be defined as any&#xD;
      of the previous adverse events that lead to death, or are life-threatening, or lead to&#xD;
      persistent or significant disability/incapacity, prolongation of hospitalization or surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Investigators will monitor all subjects for any adverse events or serious adverse&#xD;
      events for 48 hours after return to baseline mechanical ventilation and will specifically&#xD;
      include each of the above-listed events or any other adverse events or serious adverse events&#xD;
      in the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed at the subject's bedside when the subject is stable. A standard&#xD;
      ventilator modified to provide entrainment-based ventilation will be used for the study. All&#xD;
      ventilator alarms will be active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period a respiratory therapist and study staff will constantly monitor the&#xD;
      patient for adverse or serious adverse events. If any of the events listed in the safety&#xD;
      criteria above occurs, the entrainment-based ventilation will be permanently discontinued and&#xD;
      subject will be changed back to baseline or conventional ventilation. Also the study will be&#xD;
      stopped if any SAEs occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol calls for blood gas analysis at the 2nd hr and at the end of the EMV period.&#xD;
      Therefore, changes in arterial pH and PCO2 values from baseline will be assessed at those&#xD;
      time intervals for any violation of the safety criteria. Once any changes in these blood gas&#xD;
      variables are found to violate the stated safety criteria, the patient will be immediately&#xD;
      returned to the pre-intervention ventilator settings and closely observed for return to the&#xD;
      pre-intervention baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG will be monitored continuously and recorded every 15 minutes (every 5 minutes in the&#xD;
      first hour). Mean arterial pressure will be recorded every 15 minutes (every 5 minutes in the&#xD;
      first hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once any ischemic changes on ECG or excessive changes in mean arterial pressure (+ 20 mm Hg&#xD;
      from baseline) are detected, the patient will be immediately returned to the pre-intervention&#xD;
      ventilator settings and closely observed for return to the pre-intervention baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all other safety criteria mentioned above (regarding pulse, paradoxical breathing,&#xD;
      accessory muscle use, nasal flaring, etc.), the timeframes are similar to those for RR.&#xD;
      Specifically, the patient will be monitored continuously and will be placed back to the&#xD;
      baseline mode of ventilation if any of these safety criteria are violated for &gt; 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation management will be performed per BWH ICU sedation guidelines, with sedation targeted&#xD;
      to Ricker Agitation Sedation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is targeted to enroll at least 20 sequential mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
      Baseline demographic and procedural variables will be analyzed statistically by plotting the&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals of each variable. With 20 patients we will have an 88% chance of&#xD;
      seeing any complication (such as those defined by the safety criteria or any associated&#xD;
      adverse event or serious adverse event) that occurs with a frequency of 10% or more. For&#xD;
      feasibility evaluation, the total number of each type of asynchronous breaths/hour during&#xD;
      entrainment-based ventilation will be averaged over the 4-hour experimental period and&#xD;
      compared with those in the 4-hour baseline ventilation period. The 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      of the differences of each type of asynchrony between entrainment-based ventilation and&#xD;
      baseline ventilation will be provided without formal inference of statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of synchrony:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following types of patient-ventilator asynchrony will be analyzed every hour over the&#xD;
      4-hour baseline period and 4-hour experimental period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trigger asynchrony - Number of breaths/hour initiated by the patients that fail to trigger&#xD;
      the ventilator to inspiration (identified by pressure, flow and or CO2 ventilator graphics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath initiation asynchrony - Number of breaths/hour in which the initial airway pressure&#xD;
      drops below baseline pressure for &gt; 100 milliseconds prior to pressurization of the airway or&#xD;
      a concave rise in airway pressure after triggering or an initial pressure increase that&#xD;
      exceeds the set pressure level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath termination asynchrony - Number of breaths/hour in which airway pressure at the end of&#xD;
      the pressure targeted breath increases above set level just prior to exhalation or a second&#xD;
      breath is rapidly triggered (double triggering) during initial expiration or premature&#xD;
      termination of breath with small tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhythm asynchrony - Number of breaths/hour in which ventilation is continuously&#xD;
      patient-triggered (assist mode) or continuously ventilator-initiated (control mode) for more&#xD;
      than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk minimization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMV method is an extension of the well-established assist/control (A/C) ventilation mode&#xD;
      and has minimal risk.&#xD;

          <description>Baseline mechanical ventilation data with conventional pressure-limited assist/control ventilation mode will then be collected for a 4-hour period. The patients will then be transitioned to pressure-limited entrainment-based ventilation (EMV) for a 4-hour period. Baseline ventilation monitoring will be carried out either immediately preceding or immediately following EMV in the same patient. The sequence of the control/baseline phase and the experimental phase of the study will be randomized.</description>
