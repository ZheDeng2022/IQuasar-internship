      The Collar Therapy Indicator (CoTI) (A device that is placed in collar around the neck&#xD;
      resembling a turtle neck sweater collar with a wire and recording box) has been shown in a&#xD;
      single small previously published experience to provide data regarding radioiodine exposure&#xD;
      that correlates with conventional methods of measuring I-123 and I-131 uptakes after&#xD;
      diagnostic dose administration and/or therapy for thyroid disorders. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      device's continuous measurement capability will permit more accurate estimates of radiation&#xD;
      exposure to thyroid tissue than conventionally employed methods assessing fractional uptake&#xD;
      at one or a few time points. It may also provide information about the extent of variability&#xD;
      in the absorbed radiation dose among patients with thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. By&#xD;
      providing more complete information about individual patient's exposures, it will facilitate&#xD;
      more accurate estimation of the administered I-131 dose requirements for control of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism and thyroid remnant ablation while reducing the need for repeated visits to&#xD;
      the clinic for dosimetry measurements. The aims of our project include the following: (1)To&#xD;
      compare quantitative imaging-derived thyroid time activity curve to that obtained using the&#xD;
      CoTI and to determine the extent to which there is variability in radiation dose predicted&#xD;
      using conventional methods to that predicted from measurement of the full Time-Activity Curve&#xD;
      (TAC).(2) Evaluate the uptake and clearance kinetics across the 5 patients in each category&#xD;
      as proof of principle for a potential larger trial to investigate use of this device in&#xD;
      optimizing the administered doses of radioactive iodine to achieve therapeutic goals while&#xD;
      minimizing risks of comorbidities, such a post-radioiodine hypothyroidism in patients with&#xD;
      Graves' disease.(3)Evaluate patient experience, convenience, and discomfort in using the CoTI&#xD;
      device with a survey instrument.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radioiodine treatment for thyroid disorders represented an early example of individualized&#xD;
      medicine. Since its introduction 80 years ago, the therapeutic I-131 dosage has usually been&#xD;
      tailored to individual patient requirements based on the uptake of a tracer radioiodine dose.&#xD;
      Various techniques have been employed to estimate the administered dose of I-131 for optimal&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit. Estimated exposure has typically been extrapolated from the results of&#xD;
      activity measurements at one or two time points, e.g., at 4 and 24 hours. We now know that&#xD;
      treatment of hyperthyroid Graves' disease with these methods lead to a 13-25% rate of failure&#xD;
      to cure hyperthyroidism and a 46-80% rate of long-term hypothyroidism in cured patients.&#xD;
      Similarly, such relatively crude dosimetry doubtless result in significant overtreatment in&#xD;
      the case of remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer requiring remnant ablation, the administered&#xD;
      activity has, in most cases, been derived empirically, ranging between 30-100 mci. The high&#xD;
      success rates in ablating remnant thyroid tissue implies that many patients are still treated&#xD;
      with higher 131-I doses than required, with potential side effects, such as radiation&#xD;
      sialadenitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Study Rationale; Our overall objective is to provide the optimal dose to each patient.&#xD;
      This study will apply a novel &quot;wearable&quot; radiation detection technology to determine&#xD;
      continuous cervical measurements over days following tracer radioiodine administration will&#xD;
      provide information that permits the tailoring of subsequent therapeutic radioiodine doses&#xD;
      more precisely to improve clinical outcomes, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual therapeutic dose decisions in this pilot trial, however, will not be based on the&#xD;
      collar device measurements. Patients with Graves' disease will receive 180-200 ÂµCi I-131 per&#xD;
      gram of estimated gland mass based on the conventional method of dose calculation, based on a&#xD;
      24-hour % uptake and gland volume. Most patients with thyroid cancer would receive the 30 mCi&#xD;
      dose for remnant ablation prior to the placement of the COTI device, as per the American&#xD;
      Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This will be an unmasked prospective pilot study involving patients&#xD;
      with Graves' disease (Group I) and differentiated thyroid cancer (Group II). Five patients in&#xD;
      each group will have radiation activity measurements using the COTI devise. All persons in&#xD;
      the study will receive 131-I treatment based on the current standards of care for dose&#xD;
      estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Device; The CoTI has 3 components;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A collar unit: a gamma detector wrapped around a body part-neck in this case and&#xD;
           contains a scintillating crystal and a silicon photomultiplier. The photon pulse signal&#xD;
           is then converted to digital signals (measuring the counts per second). Usually two&#xD;
           detectors are placed in specified positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cable that connects the collar unit to the Control Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control unit that collects the signals and transmits it wirelessly to a hand-held&#xD;
           computer tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of collar devices will be used: the lower activity and the medium activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lower activity collar for patients with Graves' disease as well as diagnostic I-123 scan&#xD;
           in thyroid cancer patients. These patients typically receive 0.2-1.2 m Ci of&#xD;
           I-123/I-131.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medium activity collar for Patients with thyroid cancer after 131-I ablation, for which&#xD;
           patients typically receive 30-100 mci of I-131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: Patients with diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) diagnosed clinically with&#xD;
           no prior history of radioiodine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: Patients with differentiated epithelial thyroid cancer who are s/p total&#xD;
           thyroidectomy and candidates for remnant ablation based on ATA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRB approval and HIPPA regulations; Since it is a project involving a medical device which&#xD;
      will be applied to the patients' neck, it will require the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) regular approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Registry into ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Appropriate forms and consent process for the patients. The recruitment of subjects for&#xD;
           the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent including the benefits and the risks of the Collar device (CoTI)&#xD;
                will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confidentiality agreement would be signed regarding the CoTI and its application.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic, clinical and tumor characteristics of the participants will be&#xD;
                obtained, as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The instructions on the application CoTI will be provided in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Instructions regarding communication in the event of any difficulties will be&#xD;
                provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patients will be prepared by general standards of care prior to CoTI placement. For&#xD;
           patients with Graves' disease, any thionamide anti-thyroid meds will be stopped 3-5 days&#xD;
           prior to I-123 diagnostic dose administration. After obtaining written consent, a venous&#xD;
           blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite laboratory evaluation for baseline&#xD;
           labs, as outlined below, and in women, for a pregnancy test. A (low activity) CoTI&#xD;
           device will be placed under supervision and then adjusted for comfort and optimal&#xD;
           activity measurement as a trial and then removed. Background activity of the patient, a&#xD;
           phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After administration of I-123, an&#xD;
           initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will then be placed and the&#xD;
           patient will be asked to return to the clinic at scheduled imaging times for Group I.&#xD;
           Anatomical localization of the CoTI in all patients will be standardized by pen&#xD;
           markings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with Graves' disease, who will be administered 200 ÂµCi of I-131 and fitted with&#xD;
           a low-activity CoTI device after administration of the dose. Background activity of the&#xD;
           patient, a phantom and the device itself will be measured prior to placement of the&#xD;
           device. After administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The&#xD;
           CoTI device will then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled&#xD;
           imaging times for Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will&#xD;
           be standardized by markings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will be placed on a low iodine diet for one&#xD;
           week. Recombinant TSH will be administered on days 1 and 2 (typically Monday and&#xD;
           Tuesday), and the diagnostic I-123 dosage will be administered on day 2. As per the&#xD;
           protocol standard of care, the diagnostic whole-body scan is done on day 3 and the I-131&#xD;
           dose for I-131 ablation (30-100 mci) is administered on day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written consent, venous blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation for baseline labs as outlined below, including in women, a pregnancy&#xD;
      test prior to the I-131 remnant ablation dose. The (medium activity) CoTI device will be&#xD;
      placed under supervision and then adjusted for convenience as outlined above. Background&#xD;
      activity of the patient, a phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After&#xD;
      administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will&#xD;
      then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled imaging times for&#xD;
      Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will be standardized by&#xD;
      markings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled Imaging times; Group I - Persons with Graves' Disease&#xD;
