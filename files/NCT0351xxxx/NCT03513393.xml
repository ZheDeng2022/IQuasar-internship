  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EpclusaÂ® is a pan-genotypic, once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) infection containing the NS5B- polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF, nucleotide&#xD;
      analogue) 400 mg and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (VEL) 100 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velpatasvir has pH dependent absorption. At higher pH the solubility of velpatasvir&#xD;
      decreases. It has been shown that in subjects treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such&#xD;
      as omeprazole, the absorption of velpatasvir is reduced by 26-56%, depending on the dose of&#xD;
      omeprazole, concomitant food intake, and timing/sequence of velpatasvir vs. omeprazole&#xD;
      intake. As a result, concomitant intake of PPIs with velpatasvir is not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a number of reasons, the prohibition of PPI use with velpatasvir is a clinically relevant&#xD;
      problem. First, PPI use is highly frequent in the HCV-infected subject population with&#xD;
      prevalences reported up to 40%. Second, PPIs are available as over-the-counter medications&#xD;
      and thus can be used by subjects without informing their physician. Third, although HCV&#xD;
      therapy is generally well tolerated, gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and&#xD;
      nausea are frequently reported, which my lead to PPI use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution of this problem could be the use of other acid-reducing agents such as&#xD;
      H2-receptor antagonists or antacids. In general, they have a less pronounced effect on&#xD;
      intragastric pH, and are considered less effective than PPIs by many patients and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second solution would be the choice of another HCV agent or combination that is not&#xD;
      dependent on low gastric pH for its absorption such as daclatasvir. Daclatasvir, however, is&#xD;
      not a pan-genotypic HCV agent and may be less effective against GT 2 and 3 infections than&#xD;
      velpatasvir. Second, not all subjects have access to daclatasvir, depending on health&#xD;
      insurance company or region where they live.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third solution, and the focus of this COPA study, is to add a glass of the acidic beverage&#xD;
      cola at the time of velpatasvir administration in subjects concurrently treated with PPIs.&#xD;
      This intervention has been shown to be effective for a number of drugs from other therapeutic&#xD;
      classes who all have in common a reduced solubility (and thus reduced absorption) at higher&#xD;
      intragastric pH, namely erlotinib, itraconazole, ketoconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of this approach are: (1) only a temporary decrease in gastric pH at the time&#xD;
      of cola intake; the rest of the day the PPI will have its therapeutic effect (2) cola is&#xD;
      available worldwide (3) the administration of cola can be done irrespective to the timing of&#xD;
      PPI use.&#xD;
