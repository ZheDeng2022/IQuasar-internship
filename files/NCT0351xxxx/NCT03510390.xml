      The study evaluates the effects of the drug Metformin on the oxygen content in cancer tissue.&#xD;
      Low oxygen concentration in cancer tissue accelerates cancer growth. Moreover, the response&#xD;
      to radiation therapy is worse when tissue oxygen is low, because radiation therapy depends on&#xD;
      oxygen to unfold therapeutic effects. Metformin has been used to treat type II diabetes for&#xD;
      over 50 years and features additional properties that could slow down cancer growth. One of&#xD;
      these properties is the improved oxygen concentration in cancer tissue. This effect has been&#xD;
      proven for various cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned to verify this effect in head and neck cancer. Patients who suffer&#xD;
      from cancer of the mouth and are planned for surgical removal of the cancer will be given&#xD;
      Metformin for 9 to 14 days. The tissue removed in the subsequent surgery will be compared to&#xD;
      a tissue sample that had been taken from the same patient prior to Metformin intake. To&#xD;
      evaluate the oxygen content in the tissue samples, the expression of genes that react to&#xD;
      oxygen levels will be measured and compared between the samples taken before and after&#xD;
      treatment with Metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to evaluate whether changes in the oxygen content within the tumor can be&#xD;
      visualized by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, participants undergo an&#xD;
      MRI scan, before and after Treatment with Metformin. The changes in the MRI will be&#xD;
      correlated to the changes measured in gene expression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to prove the hypothesis that Metformin reduces tissue&#xD;
      hypoxia in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma after a course of treatment of 9-14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in hypoxia-regulated gene expression upon&#xD;
      Treatment with Metformin. Secondary endpoint are changes in MRI imaging correlating with the&#xD;
      changes in gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a single-arm, open-label interventional window of opportunity study for&#xD;
      proof of principle. Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is primarily treated by surgical&#xD;
      tumor resection. This offers the possibility to study the effect of metformin on the tumor&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline tissue from potential participants before the intervention will be acquired by&#xD;
      biopsy during diagnostic panendoscopy. Provided surgery is recommended by tumor board&#xD;
      decision, participants will be orally administered 850 mg of metformin twice daily between&#xD;
      the therapeutic decision of the tumor board and the surgical resection of the tumor. The&#xD;
      duration of the treatment is 9-14 days, depending on the date of the planned surgery. The&#xD;
      resected tumor tissue as well as the biopsy taken prior to metformin treatment will be&#xD;
      subjected to massive parallel sequencing and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether changes in hypoxia regulated gene expression can be correlated to changes&#xD;
      in MRI scans, each participants will undergo a MRI scan before metformin treatment and a&#xD;
      second MRI scan within 48 hours prior to the surgical resection of the tumor.&#xD;
