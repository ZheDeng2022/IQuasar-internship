  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After completion of 5 years of medical school training, the next step of becoming a House&#xD;
      Officer is said to be associated with high levels of stress. It has been associated with&#xD;
      mental health problems amongst HOs and sometimes quitting the medical line altogether. In&#xD;
      Malaysia, the number of HOs not completing housemanship training within the allocated time is&#xD;
      slowly declining from 86.4% (2009) to 58.8% (2012). The dropout rate is said to be increasing&#xD;
      yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This causes a lot of constraints on the HO, their family, sponsors, patients and also the&#xD;
      country. Amongst the reason for stress is the feeling of incompetency or &quot;fear of making&#xD;
      mistakes&quot;. Other work-related issues include workload, time management, financial, colleague&#xD;
      and superior related issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicorp is a company that specializes in training for junior doctors and has come up with a&#xD;
      module to help medical graduates cope with these issues. The module is a 3-day-course named&#xD;
      the HO Preparatory Course. It was initially the brainchild of the Islamic Medical Association&#xD;
      of Malaysia (IMAM) but was later privatized to accommodate the demand and the running of the&#xD;
      module and courses. The module has been re-evaluated through feedback of participants and&#xD;
      trainers to cater to the needs and wants of the newly graduate; be it local or overseas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators would like to assess whether this intervention module is&#xD;
      effective in addressing HO stress, therefore consequently reduce the risk of drop out and&#xD;
      extension in HO training.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in International Youth Centre, Cheras. It has been the main&#xD;
      focal point of where most of the courses have been conducted. It is within easy reach and&#xD;
      centrally located near National University of Malaysia Hospital. Many participants will come&#xD;
      from all around Malaysia to attend. The centre is equipped with a lecture hall and boarding&#xD;
      for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pre-post quasi-experimental study that will be conducted over 12 months duration.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo a House Officer (HO) preparatory course. The level of&#xD;
      confidence, readiness and psychological wellbeing will be evaluated. There will be three&#xD;
      assessment time points: at baseline (before the course), immediately after the course (only&#xD;
      for level of confidence and readiness) and 1 month after working as HO. This study is unable&#xD;
      to have a control because of constraints in resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will start from April 2018 - March 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who attend the Medicorp HO Preparatory Course from April 2018 -March 2019 will&#xD;
      be recruited into this study as the sampling frame. The eligibility criteria are based on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling methods employed in this study will be taking all participants who fulfill the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and agree to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this study will be the Medicorp HO preparatory course which comprises of&#xD;
      a 3-day training touching on aspects of HO training that is needed practically for an HO to&#xD;
      function. The training will touch on the nature of the HO job, explaining about technical&#xD;
      details such as the shift and on-call system. The tagging period, and assessments that HOs&#xD;
      need to undergo during their training. They will be guided on how to clerk, review and&#xD;
      present common as well as emergency cases. Other aspects involved in clerking such as common&#xD;
      forms used in the wards and also how to refer cases is also discussed. Apart from that, soft&#xD;
      skills such as communication among staff, financed, balancing social life and future career&#xD;
      planning is incorporated in the training. There are hands-on training for participants for&#xD;
      common procedures such as continuous bladder drainage insertion and venepuncture. The&#xD;
      trainers are specialists, specialists in training, medical officers, and also house officers&#xD;
      who come to share their experience. Medicorp encourages their alumni to be part of their&#xD;
      training program. This module will be held on a 1-2 monthly basis. The Module Content is&#xD;
      moderated by Medicorp based on discussions with the board of directors, advisors and feedback&#xD;
      from participants. The training program is done as a lecture, tutorial and hands-on session.&#xD;
      Before commencing the course, participants will be included in a WhatsApp group, for easier&#xD;
      content sharing and updates of the course. They will continue this networking even after&#xD;
      completion of this course. They will be also be guided in the online applications of their&#xD;
      job through this application and also through Facebook. During the commencement of their job,&#xD;
      Medicorp will use their database to guide them into different WhatsApp groups according to&#xD;
      their place of work for additional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1 sample size calculator software.&#xD;
      Based on reports by confidence score from a study analysing pre and post-emergency department&#xD;
      posting in junior doctors was used. The mean overall confidence score was 56.475(24.67) at&#xD;
      the end of month 1 and 62.775(28.69) at the end of month 4(Williams et al., 1997). The&#xD;
      estimated sample size was 208 participants after accounting for the power of 80%,&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05% and 30% attrition.&#xD;

      at any time. All data obtained will be kept confidentially and for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of the study includes assessing issues in relations to HO wellbeing and to&#xD;
      assess what is needed in training a functional HO. The potential risk, discomforts and&#xD;
      inconvenience is almost none. However, should the DASS score be suggestive of depression or&#xD;
      anxiety, team members of the research team will refer the participant appropriately. Should&#xD;
      participants choose to withdraw from study, they will be allowed to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed using IBM Social Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24. A&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of the demographic characteristics of the participants, clinical&#xD;
      experience and baseline level of confidence, readiness and psychological wellbeing will be&#xD;
      reported using means and standard deviations (SD) or median and inter-quartile range (IQR)&#xD;
      for continuous variables (depending on the data distribution) and as frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages for categorical data. An analysis to compare between participants who completed&#xD;
      and withdrew from the study will be made using Chi-square or Exact test (for unbalanced data)&#xD;
      for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeated measures ANOVA will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention within the groups across the study periods (baseline, immediately after&#xD;
      intervention and at 1 month after working). Controlling for baseline measures will be done to&#xD;
      determine the change over time on the measured outcomes (level of confidence, readiness and&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing). All analyses conducted are two-tailed with significant level set at&#xD;
      p value &lt;0.05.&#xD;

        <description>This will be adapted from the IMU Student Competency Survey (Appendix 2) as there are no published studies on the confidence level of medical graduates before beginning HO-ship. The questionnaire comprises of 5 sections. The first 4 sections asses on generic skills, practical tasks, soft skills and their confidence as a whole, using a Likert scale assessment. Scoring is a mean score of 1-5 and the higher the score, the higher the confidence. The last section asks on the one daunting aspect of being a HO out of a list of 7 things, this section is descriptive.</description>

Post-intervention: Drop outs mainly due to failure in submitting the complete post-intervention questionnaires before they headed home.&#xD;
Post 1 month after work: Major drop outs purely as a result of unavailability to answer and time constraint due to the hectic schedule of a houseman.</description>
