  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to collect blood and tumour samples from consenting patients for the&#xD;
      development of manufacturing processes for potential immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do NOT consent to participate in a leukapheresis procedure will follow schedule&#xD;
      1 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Suitable patients will provide consent at the first patient visit, followed by&#xD;
      baseline assessments as per standard of care and per protocol. Details will also be collected&#xD;
      about current medical conditions and procedures and current medications. Patients will be&#xD;
      tested for infectious diseases e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Human T-cell&#xD;
      lymphotropic virus (HTLV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Procured tumour samples will be obtained during the patients standard of care&#xD;
      surgery, or the patient may provide a superficial skin or subcutaneous lymph node disease&#xD;
      sample strictly for the purposes of the trial. All patients will also donate a whole blood&#xD;
      sample conducted as a non-standard of care procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All donated samples will be couriered to a specialist Sponsor laboratory with appropriate&#xD;
      oversight maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Following the surgical procedure patients will receive their standard follow up&#xD;
      care. Under this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made to ensure patients have&#xD;
      recovered fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who DO consent to participate in a leukapheresis procedure will follow either&#xD;
      schedule 2 OR schedule 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: As described in schedule 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: As described in schedule 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 serves as a re-confirmation of eligibility (screening) to undergo leukapheresis&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: The leukapheresis procedure is conducted, providing the patient consents and is&#xD;
      deemed fit by their treating physician to undergo the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Safety follow up visit. Under this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made&#xD;
      to ensure patients have recovered fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule 3 (UK only):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: As described in schedule 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: The leukapheresis procedure is conducted, providing the patient consents and is&#xD;
      deemed fit by their treating physician to undergo the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: serves as a leukapheresis safety follow up and surgical screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Procured tumour samples will be obtained during the patients standard of care&#xD;
      surgery, or the patient may provide a superficial skin or subcutaneous lymph node disease&#xD;
      sample strictly for the purposes of the trial. All patients will also donate a whole blood&#xD;
      sample conducted as a non-standard of care procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All donated samples will be couriered to a specialist Sponsor laboratory with appropriate&#xD;
      oversight maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Safety follow up visit. Under this protocol a follow up telephone call will be made&#xD;
      to ensure patients have recovered fully.&#xD;
