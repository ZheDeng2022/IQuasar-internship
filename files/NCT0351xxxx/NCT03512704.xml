      Objectives: Objective of this project are to create several clinical prediction rules (CPR)&#xD;
      to stratify patients into different prognostic levels: on arrival at the emergency room, at&#xD;
      hospital discharge, in the evolution at 90 days, and up to 1 year; for clinical parameters&#xD;
      (mortality, complications, readmissions) and the evolution of the patient health related&#xD;
      quality of life. Additional objectives include the analysis of equity in access, continuity&#xD;
      of care after discharge, costs, psychosocial support received, and variability in clinical&#xD;
      decisions and in the results obtained from inclusion in the study after the visit to the&#xD;
      emergency room until 1 year of follow-up. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study&#xD;
      with a one year follow-up. Multicenter and coordinated study with 9 hospital in Spain. This&#xD;
      project will include around 1000 patients diagnosed of heart failure who come to emergency&#xD;
      services of these hospitals, whether discharge home or admitted to the hospital. Multiple&#xD;
      parameters (about the process of care, clinical outcomes, and quality of life), will be&#xD;
      retrieved in the emergency room visits, admission, discharge and up to one year follow up&#xD;
      after discharge. This project bases its work in the large number of variables to be collected&#xD;
      and would not be viable with few centers, so centers from other communities will collaborate&#xD;
      providing more cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis using multivariate logistic regression models or Cox or general linear&#xD;
      models or multilevel analysis will derive the CPR in a subsample of the original sample which&#xD;
      will be validated in another different subsample.&#xD;

      DESIGN: multicenter prospective observational cohort study with one year follow-up after&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCOPE: Nine hospitals participating in this project: Hospital Universitario Basurto, Santa&#xD;
      Marina, Donostia, and Galdakao-Usansolo, Hospital de Antequera, Costa del Sol, Universitario&#xD;
      de Canarias, Universitario Parc Taulí y Bellvitge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS: patients with known chronic heart failure (or de novo diagnosed in the emergency&#xD;
      department visit) attended in the emergency services of the participating hospitals&#xD;
      prospectively diagnosed with acute or decompensated heart failure and recruited during the&#xD;
      first year of the study, including patients admitted or given discharge in the hospital&#xD;
      emergency room. The first admission of each patient during the recruitment period will be&#xD;
      taken as a reference, and after this episode the follow-up will be carried out during a whole&#xD;
      year, collecting all the events that happen related to their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing patients: In all patients who meet the selection criteria the investigators will&#xD;
      collect data on essential sociodemographic and clinical variables in order to be able to&#xD;
      compare the patients lost in the follow-up with the patients who finally participate in the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Predictive model development studies establish that it is necessary&#xD;
      to have at least 10 events of the dependent variable of interest (in our case: mortality,&#xD;
      major complications, recurrence or re-admissions, separately) for each independent variable&#xD;
      included in the multivariate logistic regression model . Given that our intention is to&#xD;
      include in the multivariate model a limited but exhaustive number of variables (predictably,&#xD;
      no less than 10), the investigators estimate that it will be necessary to have at least 100&#xD;
      events of the dependent variable in the derivation sample (of 1000 patients ) to make sure&#xD;
      that the regression model converges properly. Data from our centers indicate that the number&#xD;
      of events of the dependent mortality variable would be&gt; 15% of the patients admitted, with&#xD;
      the percentages expected from the other parameters with higher results. With all the&#xD;
      participating centers and 1 year of recruitment, the investigators hope to recruit around&#xD;
      2000 valid patients (50% for the derivation and 50% in the validation sample) sufficient to&#xD;
      meet the stated objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on data from the year 2012 of our centers for this pathology and according&#xD;
      to the expected exclusions (80% will meet the selection criteria with their acceptance to&#xD;
      participate in the study ) and losses (20% of losses in the follow-up of those that meet the&#xD;
      selection criteria), the recruitment of this number of patients is guaranteed for the&#xD;
      majority of the participating centers and, therefore, the response to this and other&#xD;
      hypotheses of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: non-probabilistic sampling of convenience of consecutively recruited patients in&#xD;
      each of the participating centers for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES. Sources for the collection of information: it will be done through the medical&#xD;
      record (of emergencies, hospital admission or primary care), information systems of the&#xD;
      participating centers (medical/electronic records), hospital and primary care, and directly&#xD;
      from patients through a survey. Summary of the variables to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Socio-demographic data: age, sex, level of studies, place of residence, distance to the&#xD;
           hospital, family situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antecedents: symptoms; time of evolution; risk factors and health habits; previous&#xD;
           pharmacological / non-pharmacological treatments, previous vaccines; comorbidities and&#xD;
           their respective treatments; previous income by HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A.-Presentation in the emergency room: a.1.-symptoms; a.2.-signs. a.3.- Complementary&#xD;
           tests and their result: ECG, chest x-ray, BNP test, laboratory parameters; urine&#xD;
           analysis. a.4.- Pharmacological treatment of HF; Other treatments; Specific treatments&#xD;
           and associated comorbidities. a.5.- Destination at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;

           and signs, laboratory data and complementary examinations, diagnosis, destination at&#xD;
           discharge, prescribed controls) C.-Patients hospital admitted. Evolution of: c.1.-&#xD;
           symptoms; c.2.-signs. c.3.- Complementary tests performed: ECG, echocardiography, .&#xD;
           c.4.- Use of other complementary tests. c.5.- Diagnosis of the HF and type.&#xD;
           c.6.-Pharmacological treatment of HF; Other treatments; c.7.- Interventional procedures.&#xD;
           c.8.- Need for more intensive treatment. c.9.-Specific treatments and associated&#xD;
           comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D.-Outcomes: death; complications during admission; Intensive treatments; Other&#xD;
           reperfusion treatments; Other complications; days of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E.-Data at hospital discharge of patients admitted: symptoms, signs, laboratory data at&#xD;
           discharge, diagnosis at discharge, prescribed treatment, care and established controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Alternatives to classic hospital admission: home hospitalization, palliative care,&#xD;
           medium-stay units-centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.-Other health care / interventions. 6-Utilization of health services after the emergency&#xD;
      visit / discharge from hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-Availability and use of psycho-social support services. 8.- Other results in the follow-up&#xD;
      until the year: Evolution of symptoms, signs and basic analytics, the latter included in the&#xD;
      readmissions and the primary care databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9-Quality of life questionnaires: Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ;&#xD;
      EuroQol-5D and Barthel Index) Questionnaires to pass in the first contact and in the 1st&#xD;
      year, moments in which transitional questions on evolution will be included of symptoms and&#xD;
      general condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.-Clinical results to be measured during follow-up: death, re-admissions, complications,&#xD;
      visits to the emergency department and surgical interventions, both cardiological and other,&#xD;
      evolution of dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: the above parameters will be collected from the arrival of the patient to&#xD;
      the emergency room until discharge (from the emergency room or after hospital admission) with&#xD;
      the patient being followed until one year after the index visit, collecting information on&#xD;
      the care received in other services (hospitalization), at home, primary care, for social&#xD;
      services, at the hospital level, (including possible new readmissions) through the clinical&#xD;
      history (of emergencies, hospital admission or primary care) and information systems of the&#xD;
      participating centers (medical/electronic records) and evolution of the quality of life&#xD;
      (PROm) and symptoms, for which the same questionnaires will be passed on again at the&#xD;
      baseline time per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND CONFIDENTIALITY ASPECTS. The project has been evaluated by the research&#xD;
      commissions of the participating centers and the Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      accredited (CEIC autonomic of the Basque Country in this case) receiving their approval. The&#xD;
      laws on personal data management will be followed, ensuring that the processing of personal&#xD;
      data will be carried out in such a way that the information obtained can not be associated&#xD;
      with identified or identifiable persons (Organic Law 15/1999, 13-12, Protection of Data of&#xD;
      Character Personal).&#xD;
