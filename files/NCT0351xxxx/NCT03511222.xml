  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that vorolanib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab for gastric/gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancers and nivolumab for&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) may improve immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming treatment&#xD;
      resistance of checkpoint inhibitors in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.&#xD;
