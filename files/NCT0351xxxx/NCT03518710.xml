      The present project will therefore focus upon those processes related to visual attention and&#xD;
      perceptual abilities and on their potential to explain reading behavior and reading problems&#xD;
      in NF1. The main objective of this study is to clarify the specificity and heterogeneity of&#xD;
      reading profiles and the causes of its disturbance in NF1. In particular, this project allow&#xD;
      the investigators to study more precisely the relations between perceptual, oculomotor and&#xD;
      visuo-attentional skills in NF1 children and reading abilities. In addition, a new&#xD;
      oculomotor/perceptual reading aid for NF1 children will be evaluated. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that the early intervention for perceptual, visuo-attentional or oculomotor problems&#xD;
      may promote academic skill development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although some NF1 children manage in the end to exhibit &quot;expert&quot; reading behavior, a&#xD;
      non-negligible number of them have real problems learning this skill. Today's estimates&#xD;
      indicate that 30-60% of NF1 children suffer from written-language learning disorder. Studies&#xD;
      of the effects of the neurocognitive deficit on academic performance are relatively rare,&#xD;
      owing to the small size of the populations concerned. However, research is needed to develop&#xD;
      effective rehabilitation programs. At the current time, most tools available to professionals&#xD;
      are designed for the evaluation and remediation of child language problems, particularly&#xD;
      difficulties related to the acquisition of meta-phonological skills. The findings from&#xD;
      dyslexics and typically developing readers however suggest a strong relationship between&#xD;
      reading ability and visual processing. The main goal of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      occurrence of perceptual, visuo-attentional and oculomotor deficits in NF1 children and their&#xD;
      potential to explain reading behavior and reading problems in this population. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to contribute to the process of clarifying the specificity and&#xD;
      heterogeneity of reading profiles and the causes of its disturbance in NF1. The second&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate an oculomotor/perceptual reading aid for NF1 children;&#xD;
      in particular, the idea of the training is to help the readers to land their saccades at the&#xD;
      optimal viewing position1 (OVP) of each word (highlighting the letter at the OVP or putting&#xD;
      it in color, so that the saccades they make would land near the centre of the word, at the&#xD;
      OVP). Eye movement control during reading is a highly automated process; people are not aware&#xD;
      of most of the saccades and fixations they make. This tool is a way to train children to&#xD;
      control these subconscious saccades and fixations. Note that, our team has already&#xD;
      demonstrated the usefulness of this reading aid for beginning readers. This project have&#xD;
      important implications from a clinical perspective, by providing the opportunity to gain&#xD;
      insight into the reading difficulties of NF1 children, in view of establishing thorough and&#xD;
      accurate assessment procedures and proposing child-specific guidelines and remediation&#xD;
      methods that take into account the particular processes affected. Providing a clearer picture&#xD;
      of visuo-attentional and perceptual skills in children with NF1 would be of considerable&#xD;
      clinical benefit, not least for supporting targeted clinical practices. Moreover, NF1&#xD;
      children could benefit from a new remediation tool that allow them to have feedback on their&#xD;
      reading ability, and to read more easily, more rapidly, and with better comprehension. If&#xD;
      appropriate interventions are implemented at an early age, academic skill development could&#xD;
      be altered, preventing subtle learning difficulties from becoming more pronounced over time.&#xD;
