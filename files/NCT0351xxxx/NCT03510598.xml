        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 22 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at&#xD;
             screening and agree to practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CR-SMFRS grade of 4 (extreme) as determined by the evaluating investigator at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dissatisfaction with the submental area expressed by the subject as a rating of 0, 1&#xD;
             or 2 using the Subject Self Rating Scale (SSRS) as determined at Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stable body weight confirmed by the subject, for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             the first treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5%) by not making any major&#xD;
             changes in their diet or exercise routine during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to forgo any treatment or behavior (e.g., unshaven facial hair) during&#xD;
             the subject's participation in the study that may affect the assessments of the&#xD;
             submental area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is medically able to undergo the administration of KYBELLA® determined after&#xD;
             review of the subject's medical history for which the evaluating investigator&#xD;
             identifies no clinically significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has read and signed the study written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index ≥40 as determined at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has excessive skin laxity, as determined by the evaluating investigator, in&#xD;
             the neck or chin area or other anatomical feature (e.g., predominant subplatysmal fat,&#xD;
             loose skin in the neck or chin area, prominent platysmal bands) for which reduction in&#xD;
             the submental fat may result in an aesthetically unacceptable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is evidence of any cause of enlargement in the submental area (e.g., thyroid&#xD;
             enlargement, cervical adenopathy) other than localized submental fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of trauma associated with the chin or neck areas, which in the&#xD;
             judgement of the investigator may affect evaluation of safety or efficacy of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of treatment with CoolSculpting or KYBELLA® in the intended&#xD;
             treatment area or has a history of any intervention to treat submental fat (e.g.,&#xD;
             liposuction, surgery, or lipolytic agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of treatment with radiofrequency, micro-focused ultrasound,&#xD;
             laser procedures, chemical peels, or dermal fillers in the neck or chin area within 12&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a&#xD;
             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of facial nerve paresis or paralysis (such as Bell's palsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history or current symptoms of dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of prior neck surgery, or prior surgery in the area of intended&#xD;
