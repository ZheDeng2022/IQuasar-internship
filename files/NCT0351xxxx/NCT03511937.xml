  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) like sodas, sports drinks, and fruit drinks&#xD;
      remains a pressing public health concern in the United States. Consumption of SSBs remains&#xD;
      well above recommended levels, and has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. In response, policymakers across the U.S. have proposed requiring warning messages&#xD;
      on SSB containers to inform the public and reduce consumption to healthier levels. While&#xD;
      online studies find that such warnings reduce intentions to purchase SSBs, no studies have&#xD;
      yet examined the impact of warnings on actual consumer behavior. The purpose of this&#xD;
      randomized trial is to determine whether health warnings on sugar-sweetened beverages are&#xD;
      more effective than control labels at reducing purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages. The&#xD;
      trial will take place in a mock convenience store. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      a health warnings arm in which all sugar-sweetened beverages in the store are labeled with a&#xD;
      health warning, or to a control arm in which all sugar-sweetened beverages in the store are&#xD;
      labeled with a neutral label. Participants will select items to purchase with cash, and&#xD;
      purchases will be compared across trial arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in the United States. Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as sodas,&#xD;
      fruit drinks and sports drinks increases risk of these preventable conditions. SSBs are&#xD;
      particularly problematic because they are high in calories but offer little nutritional&#xD;
      value, and because the liquid calories in SSBs cause faster spikes in blood sugar and lower&#xD;
      feelings of fullness than solid foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these risks, the average American adult consumes more than 130 calories per day from&#xD;
      SSBs, well above recommended levels. A promising strategy for reducing SSB consumption is&#xD;
      requiring health warnings on SSB containers. Online studies show that health warnings attract&#xD;
      consumers' attention and reduce intentions to purchase SSBs. However, no research has tested&#xD;
      the impact of SSB health warnings on actual behaviors. This randomized trial evaluates&#xD;
      whether health warnings reduce purchases of SSBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial will take place a mock convenience store setting created for researchers&#xD;
      to examine how store and product characteristics influence consumer purchases in a controlled&#xD;
      but realistic environment. The store reflects a convenience store's characteristics, selling&#xD;
      foods, beverages, and household items at real-world prices. Participants can buy these&#xD;
      products using cash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited via university community subject pools, printed&#xD;
      flyers posted, and online listings. Interested potential participants will complete an online&#xD;
      pre-enrollment screening questionnaire to determine their eligibility. If eligible, they will&#xD;
      be invited to schedule a time to visit the mock store for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: At the beginning of the study visit, research staff will review the consent&#xD;
      documents with the participants. After reviewing the form, the research staff member will ask&#xD;
      the participant if he or she has any questions. Then both parties will sign the consent form&#xD;
      and the participant will receive a copy of the consent form to keep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to trial arms. An independent&#xD;
      biostatistician will conduct the randomization a priori. Participants will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of being randomized to either arm of the trial. Randomization will be carried out by&#xD;
      generating a random number for each participant identification code (ID). Participant IDs&#xD;
      will be ordered on this random number from smallest to largest. The bottom half of the IDs&#xD;
      will be assigned to the control arm and the top half to the treatment arm (trial arms are&#xD;
      described below). When participants arrive for their study visit, they will be assigned the&#xD;
      next consecutive participant ID and will be allocated to the trial arm previously assigned to&#xD;
      that ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures: When participants arrive at the mock store, they will be provided&#xD;
      with a shopping basket and their participation incentive in cash. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to pretend they are on a usual shopping trip and reminded that there are no right&#xD;
      or wrong products to select. They will not be told the trial's purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a shopping task. They will be given a list of product&#xD;
      categories and asked to select their preferred products in each of these categories. They&#xD;
      will indicate their selections by placing products in their shopping basket. Before they&#xD;
      begin the shopping task, participants will be instructed that they will be required to&#xD;
      purchase one of the items they select, and that this item will be chosen for them at random&#xD;
      by the experimenter. This procedure incentivizes participants to only select products they&#xD;
      are actually interested in purchasing. After participants have completed the shopping task,&#xD;
      the experimenter will randomly choose one of the products in the participant's basket for&#xD;
      participant to purchase with his or her incentive cash. The participant will pay for the&#xD;
      product and will receive change as necessary. After paying for their item, participants will&#xD;
      complete a computer-based survey in another room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: The products participants select will be recorded by the experimenter at the end&#xD;
      of the shopping task. Participants will also complete 1 computer-based survey immediately&#xD;
      after completing the shopping task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the trial arms: Participants will be assigned to either a health&#xD;
      warnings arm or a control arm. In the health warnings arm, all SSB products will be labeled&#xD;
      with a health warning label. Investigators developed the text and design of these labels&#xD;
      based on previous research and on label designs described in US and international&#xD;
      legislation. In the control arm, all SSB products will be labeled with a neutral label, also&#xD;
      developed by the investigators. In both arms, labels will be adhered directly on the&#xD;
      front-of-package of SSB containers.&#xD;

        <description>Intentions to limit consumption of beverages with added sugar will be measured at post-test using 3 items adapted from Klein, Zajax &amp; Monin (2009). The items ask participants to rate the extent to which they want to, plan to, and are likely to, drink less than 1 beverage with added sugar in the next week. Responses to these three items will be averaged to create a mean intentions score. Response options are on a 1 to 7 scale, thus, mean scores can range from 1-7, with higher scores indicating higher intentions to limit consumption of beverages with added sugar.</description>

        <description>Perceptions of added sugar content in specific categories of sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e., soda, fruit drinks, sport drinks/flavored waters, sweetened coffee/tea, and energy drinks) will be measured at post-test using items adapted from Roberto et al. (2016). Items ask participants to rate the amount of added sugar they think is in 1 serving of the beverage. Responses will be averaged to create a mean perceptions of added sugar score. Response options are on a 1 to 4 scale. Thus, mean scores can range from 1-4, with higher scores indicating perceiving higher added sugar content.</description>

          <title>Mean Injunctive Norms Score Regarding Consumption of Beverages With Added Sugar</title>
          <description>Injunctive norms will be measured at post-test with items adapted from Zoellner et al. (2012). Items ask participants to rate the extent to which people who are important to them think they should drink less than 1 beverage with added sugar per week, would approve of them drinking less than 1 beverage with added sugar per week, and want them to drink less than 1 beverage with added sugar per week. Responses will be averaged to create a mean injunctive norms score. Responses are on a 1 to 5 scale. Thus, mean scores can range from 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher injunctive norms.</description>
