      This clinical study is designed to investigate the safety and potential ability of relocated&#xD;
      autologous SVF (stromal vascular fraction) to restore erectile function in men with ED&#xD;
      (erectile dysfunction).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, two-arm, blinded, randomized treatment. Covariate adaptive&#xD;
      randomization will be used. Covariates included in the adaptive randomization process will be&#xD;
      investigational center, history of diabetes, and radical prostatectomy. The two randomized&#xD;
      study arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with SVF followed six months later with sham treatment (ARM 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sham treatment followed six months later by treatment with SVF (ARM 2) Study population&#xD;
           is 60 adult male subjects with organic erectile dysfunction (IIEF-EF score 11-22) of&#xD;
           greater than 6 months' duration due to radical prostatectomy, diabetes mellitus, and/or&#xD;
           vascular disease. Subjects will be followed for 12 months after initial treatment.&#xD;
