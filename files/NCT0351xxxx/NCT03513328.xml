      In this study, the investigators test 2 dose levels of thiotepa (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) added&#xD;
      to the backbone of targeted reduced dose IV busulfan, fludarabine and rabbit anti-thymocyte&#xD;
      globulin (rATG) to determine the minimum effective dose required for reliable engraftment for&#xD;
      subjects undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for non-malignant disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative choice for a number of inherited&#xD;
      bone marrow failure syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, metabolic disorders and primary immune&#xD;
      deficiencies. While survival of these patients is typically better than survival of patients&#xD;
      with malignancies, toxicities of conditioning regimens and failure of engraftment remain&#xD;
      challenges. Most children with non-malignant disorders present with normocellular or even&#xD;
      hypercellular bone marrow, posing a barrier to engraftment and requiring intensive&#xD;
      conditioning. Commonly used backbone of busulfan and fludarabine, although well tolerated,&#xD;
      results in variable engraftment, in particular with mismatched unrelated donors and cord&#xD;
      blood recipients. In this study, the investigators test 2 dose levels of thiotepa (5 mg/kg&#xD;
      and 10 mg/kg) added to the backbone of targeted reduced dose IV busulfan, fludarabine and&#xD;
      rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) in order to determine the minimum effective dose&#xD;
      required for reliable engraftment. Subjects are stratified in groups A and B based the risk&#xD;
      of graft failure.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study builds in rules for escalation of thiotepa dose based on graft failure by day 42. Patients are stratified in two groups A (lower risk of graft failure) and B (higher risk of graft failure). Patients undergoing 10/10 HLA matched bone marrow and peripheral blood transplants are assigned to Group A, and patients receiving &lt;10/10 matched bone marrow or peripheral blood, or receiving cord blood, even if fully matched, are assigned to Group B.&#xD;
If criteria for thiotepa dose escalation are met first in Group A, which has a lower risk of graft failure, thiotepa dose will be escalated for all subjects (Groups A and B). If criteria for thiotepa dose escalation are met first in Group B, dose will be escalated only in Group B and Group A will continue enrolling patients at a lower dose level.</intervention_model_description>
