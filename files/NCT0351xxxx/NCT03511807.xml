    <textblock>
      Tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, affects 10% to 30% of the population. Of those, 20% have&#xD;
      tinnitus bothersome enough to seek medical attention. In many people, tinnitus can&#xD;
      significantly affect the quality of life. At this point in time, there is no effective&#xD;
      treatment or cure available for tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found that electrical stimulation of the inner ear can reduce and in some cases&#xD;
      eliminate tinnitus. The purpose of this research is to investigate both acoustic and&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the inner ear as a possible treatment of tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both acoustic and electrical testing conditions, the subjects will be instructed to be&#xD;
      familiar with a 0-10 ranking scale of loudness. In acoustic testing, the stimulus will be&#xD;
      presented through headphones in a noiseless environment, and the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      report on the loudness of the presented sound and the level of the tinnitus at 20-second&#xD;
      intervals. If the subject cannot perceive the presence of the tinnitus, a value of zero will&#xD;
      be assigned. A typical sound will be presented for 3 to 6 minutes. Loudness will be reported&#xD;
      for 1 to 4 minutes after stimulus offset to measure the presence and duration of residual&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation will be delivered to the inner ear in three ways, 1. using a cochlear&#xD;
      implant (implant placed in the inner ear to replace hearing function), 2. Using an electrode&#xD;
      placed in the ear canal, and 3. using a small needle inserted through the ear drum. Various&#xD;
      electrical signals will be used to evaluate the reduction in the tinnitus perception by the&#xD;
      subject. The subjects will rate the loudness of the tinnitus before, during, and after the&#xD;
      electrical signal. Surveys will be used to evaluate the tinnitus loudness and the quality of&#xD;
      life of the subjects. Hearing tests will be used before and after the procedures. The long&#xD;
      term goal of this research is to develop a device to treat tinnitus in people who can hear&#xD;
      and to develop programs for cochlear implants that help treat tinnitus in deaf people.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, is a medical condition that significantly affects the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and that can be disabling to many. It has become known that&#xD;
      acoustic and electrical stimulation of the inner ear can cause suppression and sometimes&#xD;
      elimination of tinnitus. The long term goal of this study is to devise new methods for&#xD;
      reduction/elimination of tinnitus. Multiple attempts at tinnitus suppression using acoustic&#xD;
      and electrical stimulation of the inner ear has been performed with variable success. More&#xD;
      commonly, acoustic stimulation is used to mask the tinnitus as opposed to suppressing or&#xD;
      inhibiting the tinnitus. More recently, however, cochlear implants have been used for hearing&#xD;
      as well as tinnitus suppression. The first hypothesis is that in using acoustic stimulation&#xD;
      at specific frequencies and levels of loudness, tinnitus can be suppressed / eliminated. The&#xD;
      second hypothesis is that using the same electrical stimulation technology as used in the&#xD;
      cochlear implant, tinnitus can be suppressed/eliminated. These predictions will be tested in&#xD;
      3 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, an acoustic sound will be delivered through headphones to&#xD;
      the subjects' ears at various frequencies and loudness levels to evaluate suppression /&#xD;
      elimination of tinnitus. In Specific Aim 2, an electrical current will be delivered to the&#xD;
      inner ear. Pulse trains of various frequencies will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      suppression/elimination of the ringing in the ears. Specific Aim 3. The effect of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation on the subjects' quality of life will be measured using validated surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, attempts to suppress tinnitus using acoustic stimulation have succeeded in only&#xD;
      masking the tinnitus to a limited degree. Tinnitus masking devices only camouflage the&#xD;
      tinnitus. Patients frequently report an interference with hearing or complain that the&#xD;
      devices only substitute one unpleasant sound for another. Additionally, the masking devices&#xD;
      can only be used for a limited time and the patient's tinnitus often subjectively becomes&#xD;
      worse after the removal of the device. Patients also become habituated or accustomed to the&#xD;
      device thereby decreasing its effectiveness over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to suppress tinnitus using electrical stimulation have a long history. Starting in&#xD;
      1801 and continuing throughout the 19th century, the effects of electrical stimulation on the&#xD;
      ear were described by several authors. Some of these early attempts showed that direct&#xD;
      current applied to the mastoid or zygoma could suppress and possibly eliminate tinnitus in&#xD;
      some patients. Aran et al have found that electrical stimulation of the inner ear via an&#xD;
      electrode inserted through the ear drum can cause suppression and sometimes elimination of&#xD;
      tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of the cochlear implant revolutionized the restoration of hearing to the deaf by&#xD;
      electrically stimulating the hearing nerve. As a side-benefit, the cochlear implant was found&#xD;
      to suppress tinnitus in 28% to 79% of patients. Electrical stimulation of the inner ear may&#xD;
      have a direct electrical influence on the tinnitus generated in the inner ear, or it may have&#xD;
      an indirect influence by creating activity centrally where tinnitus reduction occurs. The&#xD;
      success with cochlear implants has led to a number of studies to evaluate electrical&#xD;
      stimulation for suppression of tinnitus. These studies have used electrodes externally and&#xD;
      internally (behind the ear drum) and various stimulus waveforms. They all suggest that in&#xD;
      some patients, tinnitus can be suppressed and occasionally eliminated using these techniques.&#xD;
      It is important to note that none of these studies was placebo-controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently in a preliminary study in 2003, Rubinstein et al, used a needle electrode&#xD;
      passed through the ear drum to suppress tinnitus. The authors used a high pulse rate of 4,800&#xD;
      pulse-per- second (pps) for their electrical stimulation. They found that 5 of 11 (45%)&#xD;
      subjects with electrical stimulation of the inner ear through the ear drum using a needle&#xD;
      electrode showed substantial or complete tinnitus suppression with either no perception or&#xD;
      only a transient perception of the stimulus. Three (27%) showed tinnitus suppression with the&#xD;
      perception of the stimulus and three showed no suppression of the tinnitus. In subjects with&#xD;
      cochlear implants, the authors used the cochlear implant for tinnitus suppression using the&#xD;
      electrical signal sent through the implant to the inner ear. The results of tinnitus&#xD;
      suppression using the cochlear implant were similar to the subjects without implants. Based&#xD;
      on recent work performed on cochlear implant subjects, it has been found that low pulse rate&#xD;
      stimulation may be more beneficial in suppressing tinnitus in cochlear implant patients.&#xD;
      Electric stimulation will be delivered through an optically-isolated constant-current source.&#xD;
      The maximum output will be set at 1000 microamps and be periodically calibrated to ensure&#xD;
      accuracy. This device has been used in several previous studies on hearing perception and a&#xD;
      similar device has been used to treat tinnitus . The device is routinely used for cochlear&#xD;
      implant patients, but is not routinely used to stimulate people without cochlear implants&#xD;
      (given their normal hearing status). It has been used experimentally, however, used for&#xD;
      people with hearing lossor tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to expand on these studies and to evaluate the impact of various&#xD;
      modes of electrical stimulation for the suppression of tinnitus and to evaluate the quality&#xD;
      of life impact of tinnitus suppression on the patients. The predictor variables include&#xD;
      frequency, pulse width, and waveform of the electrical stimulation. This study will determine&#xD;
      which combination of amplitude, frequency, or waveform will provide the best response. If&#xD;
      successful, this method of treating tinnitus could form the basis for development of&#xD;
      hopefully the first effective treatment for tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables include tinnitus level (on a scale of 0-100, with 100 being the loudest&#xD;
      level of tinnitus they have experienced), tinnitus handicap inventory score, and Short-form&#xD;
      36 results.&#xD;

    <description>For the acoustic stimulation:&#xD;
A typical sound will be presented for 6 minutes. Loudness is reported for 4 minutes after the stimulus offset to measure the presence and duration of the residual inhibition. If a successful acoustic stimulus is found, the subject will be given a series of sound files to listen to on a digital music player (CD or MP3 player) and will be asked to listen to each sound file (5 minute duration) and record their tinnitus loudness/annoyance during and after each sound stimulation. For some subjects, the investigators will use music on a digital music player (MP3 player) to see if music listening and music exercises will help reduce the intensity or annoyance level of the tinnitus (using the same surveys). These music-based exercises will involve training in recognition of musical intervals (e.g., octaves, fifths, and thirds).</description>
