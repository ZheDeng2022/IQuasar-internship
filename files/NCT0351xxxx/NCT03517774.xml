    <textblock>
      Adults with lower limb amputation undergo rehabilitation in order to learn how to effectively&#xD;
      use a lower limb prosthesis. Unfortunately, the process of being fitted a prosthesis can be&#xD;
      delayed due to resource constraints and manufacturing times, which delays the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process and puts patients at higher risk for functional decline. Preliminary work by our team&#xD;
      have shown that our 3D printing system, 3DPrintAbility Devices by NIA (http://niatech.org/),&#xD;
      perform at the same level of efficacy as traditionally manufactured prosthetics, which&#xD;
      suggests that a digital manufacturing tool-chain is a viable alternative and may be desirable&#xD;
      given the time savings involved. In order to lead to improved processes related to prosthesis&#xD;
      fitting for adult transtibial amputees, we want to assess the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of using 3DPrintAbility sockets in this population. Specifically, we want to determine if: 1)&#xD;
      the 3D printing of transtibial prosthetic sockets can provide better quality prosthetic care&#xD;
      in regards to cost, timeliness, and accessibility; 2) 3D printed sockets are equivalent in&#xD;
      quality to standard thermoplastic preparatory sockets in regards to safety, fit, durability&#xD;
      and comfort; and 3) whether a 3D scanning, design and printing process can be integrated into&#xD;
      the workflow of current rehab centres. If successful, the findings from this work can provide&#xD;
      an innovative approach for facilitating the fitting of a socket for adults with amputation&#xD;
      might provide significant savings to the healthcare system by making the process more&#xD;
      efficient while optimizing clinical outcomes by allowing patients to begin their&#xD;
      rehabilitation sooner&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation (LLA) resulting from trauma or non-traumatic causes is a life altering&#xD;
      and often debilitating event that negatively affects many aspects of a person's life, such as&#xD;
      their ability to move around the home and community, their physical and mental health.&#xD;
      Persons with lower-limb amputation face challenges with activities of daily living and have&#xD;
      noted psychosocial issues stemming from poor body image as well as issues of chronic pain&#xD;
      from phantom limb syndrome. Further, mortality rates are known to be extremely high,&#xD;
      estimated at ~25% at 30 days post amputation and nearly 50% by one year. As the number of LLA&#xD;
      continues to rise, this will ultimately lead to an increased demand for services and&#xD;
      subsequent greater financial impact to the healthcare system. There are several factors that&#xD;
      influence outcomes post-amputation but walking with a prosthesis has been noted to be a&#xD;
      central factor influencing quality of life. For instance, greater participation in social&#xD;
      experiences is positively associated with mobility outcomes, such as walking distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing number of adults requiring care post-amputation is reflected by the large&#xD;
      volume of amputee patients receiving care at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre's St. John's&#xD;
      Rehab (SJR) campus and Sunnybrook's Centre for Independent Living (SCIL). SJR is a tertiary&#xD;
      rehabilitation centre with a dedicated in-patient and out-patient amputee care program, and&#xD;
      SCIL provides amputee care and prosthetic service at Sunnybrook's Bayview campus. The&#xD;
      increased number of LLA creates a high demand for prosthetists as they need to meet with each&#xD;
      patient several times to fit them. Due to staffing constraints, there are often delays in&#xD;
      prosthetic fitting. With current technologies, it takes one to two weeks from the time&#xD;
      Sunnybrook patients are cast and measured until they are fit with their prosthesis. This&#xD;
      delay leads to increased rehab length of stay, cost and decreased rehab efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a number of companies and individuals are beginning to explore the use of 3Dprinting&#xD;
      for mobility prosthetics, few of them have clinical experience beyond a few cases. There are,&#xD;
      however, three groups working actively in this space. Vorum Inc., TechMed3D, and Standard&#xD;
      Cyborg. All of these are software companies, which are building scanning and design solutions&#xD;
      for use in prosthetics. None offers a full single site solution that also includes the&#xD;
      printing of definitive devices. Nia Technologies (http://niatech.org/), the technology&#xD;
      partner on this project, has developed a full software/hardware tool-chain for prosthetics&#xD;
      and has carried out clinical trials at four hospital sites in three developing world&#xD;
      countries with pediatric transtibial amputees. For instance, in 2016-2017, Nia worked with&#xD;
      clinical partners in Cambodia, Tanzania, and Uganda to study the efficacy and value of 3D&#xD;
      PrintAbility to orthopaedic workshops, clinicians, and patients in low-resource countries.&#xD;
      The innovation is that the use of Nia technologies enables a 3D model of the residual limb,&#xD;
      thereby eliminating the need to use plaster casting and other time consuming processes to&#xD;
      manufacture and fit the device. As a result, this technology has the potential to cut time&#xD;
      from the assessment to fitting from about 5 days to less than 1.5 days for a prosthetic leg.&#xD;
      Preliminary results indicate that the resulting devices were as effective and well-tolerated&#xD;
      by patients as traditionally manufactured prostheses. In addition, the use of 3D printing can&#xD;
      build on the skills and expertise of physicians and prosthetists since it allows them to&#xD;
      minimize time on manual production and maximize time on decisions about device design, fit,&#xD;
      and patient care. The innovation being developed in this project leverages Nia's existing&#xD;
      work, but focuses it on a specific in-need patient base, namely transtibial amputee rehab&#xD;
      adult patients in developed world rehabilitation clinics. This clinical context and patient&#xD;
      base is different from the developing world sites where this tool-chain was previously&#xD;
      tested. Successful implementation requires adaptation of Nia's tool-chain to support the&#xD;
      workflow of clinical staff in adult rehab contexts including physiatrists, physical&#xD;
      therapists, and prosthetists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a unilateral transtibial amputation (N=20) that are currently in-or&#xD;
      out-patients at Sunnybrook - St. John's Rehab (SJR) will be recruited to participate in the&#xD;
      evaluation aspect of this quality improvement project. Participants who agree to participate&#xD;
      in the quality improvement initiative will be asked by the clinical member within their&#xD;
      circle of care to ask if they would be willing to participate in the evaluation aspect&#xD;
      collecting data on patient outcomes. Once the participant agrees to be contacted by the&#xD;
      research coordinator, they will be given an overview of the study and undergo the informed&#xD;
      consent process (Appendix A). The participants will be given one day to provide their consent&#xD;
      since the fitting process for a prosthetic starts early in the rehabilitation process. Once&#xD;
      consent is received, the participants will receive a 3D printed prosthetic to wear. They will&#xD;
      then rate their satisfaction and comfort. Data regarding time and associated cost differences&#xD;
      will also be collected.&#xD;

    <description>Twenty participants will be fitted with a 3D Printed socket created using 3DPrintAbility hardware and software. To do this, a 3D model of the participants residual limb will be generated which will be used to create the 3D printed sockets. These 20 participants will also receive standard care for prosthetic fitting at SJR. The fittings will be done by one prosthetist. Our team will compare the feasibility, function, quality and stability of the prosthetics through quantitative, economic and qualitative analyses. All fittings will be done under the supervision of a qualified Sunnybrook prosthetist who has previous experience with using 3D printed technologies for creation of prosthetics.</description>
