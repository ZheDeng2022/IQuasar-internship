  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will deploy a novel, personalized, smartphone-based intervention (PrEPSteps) that&#xD;
      responds to real-time PrEP adherence and nonadherence detected through the use of a digital&#xD;
      pill. The PrEPSteps intervention will be developed and refined through a series of focus&#xD;
      groups. Participants will be screened at the Screening Visit, and, if eligible, will then&#xD;
      begin using the digital pill system at Study Visit 1 for 2 weeks. At Study Visit 2,&#xD;
      participants will undergo randomization to using either PrEPSteps + the digital pill, or the&#xD;
      digital pill alone to measure PrEP adherence, for 90 days. Participants will then complete 3&#xD;
      monthly study visits (Study Visits 3-5) where the investigators will assess digital pill&#xD;
      adherence, conduct manual pill counts, obtain dried blood spots to confirm adherence, provide&#xD;
      substance use disorder counseling, and obtain urine drug screens. At Study Visit 5, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a semi-structured qualitative interview with participants in the&#xD;
      PrEPsteps arm, which will be grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model, in order to&#xD;
      understand the user response to PrEPSteps and the digital pill. All participants will&#xD;
      complete the final follow-up assessment 3 months after Study Visit 5 (Study Visit 6).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PrEPSteps is a novel, smartphone-based behavioral intervention that delivers PrEP adherence&#xD;
      messages in response to detected PrEP ingestion via an innovative digital pill. PrEPSteps&#xD;
      comprises 1) an adaptation of LifeSteps, an evidence-based medication adherence behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, with smartphone-delivered booster sessions, 2) messages of contingent&#xD;
      reinforcement and corrective feedback, and 3) stimulant use screening, brief assessment, and&#xD;
      referral to treatment. In this K23, the investigators will first refine and inform the&#xD;
      specification of PrEPSteps with a series of focus groups. The investigators will next test&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability and potential for an effect of PrEPSteps to boost PrEP&#xD;
      adherence in a pilot randomized controlled trial of men who have sex with men (MSM) with&#xD;
      stimulant use. Finally, the investigators will conduct qualitative interviews among&#xD;
      participants who used PrEPSteps to understand the participant response to living with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The digital pill comprises a standard gelatin capsule with an integrated radiofrequency emitter that overencapsulates the desired medication (Truvada). When participants ingest the digital pill, the chloride ion gradient in the stomach activates the radiofrequency emitter which transmits direct evidence of medication ingestion to a wearable reader which relays this data to the participant's smartphone and cloud server.</description>
