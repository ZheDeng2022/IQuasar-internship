  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, for participants with cT1-2N0 small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the International&#xD;
      guidelines recommend surgical radical resection (lobectomy + systematic lymph node sampling&#xD;
      or cleaning); If the postoperatively pathological examination is confirmed to be in pT1-2N0&#xD;
      stage, a single postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (combining etoposide with cisplatin) is&#xD;
      recommended. If participants are difficult to tolerate the side effects of cisplatin, the&#xD;
      investigators can replace cisplatin by carboplatin in the adjuvant chemotherapy scheme.&#xD;
      Participants with pT1-2N0 SCLC are not recommended to receive postoperative chest-assisted&#xD;
      radiotherapy. For participants with pT1-N0 SCLC after specific surgical resection,&#xD;
      prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is currently recommended. But this recommendation is&#xD;
      currently lacking the support of research evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to study the prognostic effects of PCI on participants with&#xD;
      pT1-2N0 stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have received radical surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of this study is to observe the total survival rate (5-year OS%) in 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures include 5 years of disease-free survival (5-year DFS%),&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), surgical complications, resection rates,&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL), and exploration of biomarkers (tumor tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-arm, open, multicentral clinical study designed to compare the 5-year OS% of&#xD;
      participants receiving or not receiving PCI for pT1-2N0 stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC)&#xD;
      with radical surgery plus postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous literature reports&#xD;
      that the 5-year OS% of participants with pT1-2N0 period SCLC who have received surgical&#xD;
      resection is about 50%. Assuming that PCI can increase 5 years OS% by 10%, then enrolling 320&#xD;
      participants in the group can guarantee 70% degree of certainty with observing a unilateral&#xD;
      significant difference α&lt; 0.1. Taking about 10% of the follow-up loss rate into account, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to enroll 360 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dividing the 360 participants divided into two groups randomly, each group is composed of 180&#xD;
      people. All participants received lobectomy plus mediastinal lymph node dissection or&#xD;
      systematic lymph node sampling. Participants in the control group are enrolled in the&#xD;
      follow-up, and the participants in research group will receive PCI by 25gy/10fx.&#xD;
