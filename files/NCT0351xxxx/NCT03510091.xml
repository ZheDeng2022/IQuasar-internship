  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted counseling has been shown to improve consistency of counseling regarding a&#xD;
      wide variety of health-care related issues. West Cancer Center has shown a significant&#xD;
      increase in breast cancer susceptibility gene testing in ovarian cancer patients following&#xD;
      video-assisted counseling compared to traditional provider-led counseling. This trial is&#xD;
      designed to determine if video-assisted counseling can improve HPV vaccination rates by&#xD;
      providing consistent counseling in a timely fashion.&#xD;

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           To increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series initiation and completion in&#xD;
           an outpatient pediatric clinic as well as to assess attitudinal and logistic barriers to&#xD;
           HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and is implicated in the&#xD;
           development of oropharyngeal and anogenital cancers. Currently three vaccinations&#xD;
           against HPV are available: a bivalent vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18), quadrivalent&#xD;
           vaccine (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18), and 9-valent vaccine (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31,&#xD;
           33, 45, 52, 58). The 9-valent vaccine vaccinates against HPV types that cause&#xD;
           approximately 90% of cervical cancers, anal cancers, anogenital warts and a significant&#xD;
           proportion of oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal and penile cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although HPV vaccination has been proven to significantly decrease the incidence of&#xD;
           anogenital dysplasia, widespread acceptance among patients and providers has been&#xD;
           difficult to achieve. The 2015 National Immunization Survey-Teen data found for females&#xD;
           and males ages 13-17, 63 and 50 percent received â‰¥1 dose and 42 and 28 percent received&#xD;
           all three doses respectively. Multiple studies have identified barriers to HPV&#xD;
           vaccination including attitudes toward HPV, lack of provider recommendation or&#xD;
           appropriate counseling, lack of provider knowledge, paucity of preventative care visits&#xD;
           and inadequate time for appropriate counseling. HPV vaccination is especially difficult&#xD;
           in an urban practice setting given racial and socioeconomic discrepancies in patient&#xD;
           understanding of HPV vaccination and unique barriers to vaccination series completion.&#xD;
           Regardless of race or socioeconomic background, however, &gt;95% of parents trust their&#xD;
           doctor's advice on HPV vaccination, highlighting the need for consistent and clear&#xD;
           counseling among all providers caring for patients ages 9-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The West Cancer Center in Memphis, TN recently published data on video-assisted genetic&#xD;
           counseling in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer. In&#xD;
           eligible patients, a 7 minute counseling video increased the rate of breast cancer&#xD;
           susceptibility gene testing by 25% compared to traditional, provider-led counseling.&#xD;
           Given these results we sought to apply the concept of video-assisted counseling to HPV&#xD;
           vaccination in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study/Project Population&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parents of children ages 9-18 as well as children ages 9-18 years who have not&#xD;
           previously completed the HPV vaccination series will be eligible for enrollment during&#xD;
           outpatient care visits at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Children&#xD;
           who are pregnant, have a hypersensitivity to yeast, or have experienced hypersensitivity&#xD;
           to a prior HPV vaccination will be considered ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Single arm prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study/Project Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           After informed consent is obtained from a parent or legal guardian, eligible patients&#xD;
           and their parents or legal guardians will be shown a condensed, standardized counseling&#xD;
           video on a tablet during their initial appointment after enrollment. The video will be&#xD;
           approximately 3 minutes long and review HPV transmission, relation to cancer, role of&#xD;
           immunization, myths, side effects, series timing and need for completion. All parents or&#xD;
           legal guardians of patients will be given the option to proceed with HPV vaccination,&#xD;
           decline, or discuss further with their provider. Providers will confirm the option&#xD;
           chosen by the parents or legal guardians at the initial visit, as parental consent is&#xD;
           required at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital for HPV vaccination. A modified Carolina HPV&#xD;
           Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale will be administered to both the parent or&#xD;
           legal guardian prior to and following video-assisted counseling. All parents will be&#xD;
           given a handout reviewing recommendations for HPV vaccination after the video is&#xD;
           complete. Electronic medical record (EMR) review will be performed for pertinent medical&#xD;
           and demographic data. Data collected will be compared to HPV vaccination outcomes from&#xD;
           1/1/2015 to 12/31/2015, when standardized, provider-led counseling using a pre-written&#xD;
           template was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled to determine a stable rate of HPV vaccination&#xD;
           initiation and completion in this patient population with a target of 70 patients to&#xD;
           assess for a 10% difference in HPV vaccination initiation from a historical baseline of&#xD;
           62% during outpatient care visits at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital when standardized,&#xD;
           provider-led counseling using a prewritten template was performed. Faculty in the&#xD;
           Department of Epidemiology at the University of Memphis will perform statistical&#xD;
           analysis. Faculty in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of&#xD;
           Tennessee Health Science Center will perform geographic information system analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the feasibility and efficacy of a video-based educational intervention to&#xD;
      increase: 1) the percentage of adolescent patients initiating the HPV vaccination series and&#xD;
      2) the percentage of adolescent patients completing the HPV vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the relationships between demographic factors, attitudinal barriers to HPV&#xD;
      vaccination among parents, visit time, individual provider characteristics, time spent with a&#xD;
      provider, and HPV vaccination initiation and completion.&#xD;
