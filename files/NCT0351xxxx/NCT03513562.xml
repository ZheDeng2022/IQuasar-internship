  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax and ibrutinib work in treating participants&#xD;
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have developed genetic mutations after previously being&#xD;
      treated with ibrutinib. Venetoclax and ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib therapy can eliminate ibrutinib&#xD;
      resistance mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the rate of minimal residual disease negative complete remission to combination&#xD;
      ibrutinib and venetoclax therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine progression-free survival after the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine overall survival after the addition of venetoclax to ibrutinib. IV. Describe&#xD;
      the toxicity profile of venetoclax in combination with ibrutinib in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Describe changes in variant allele frequency (VAF) of known&#xD;
      ibrutinib resistance mutations after the addition of venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform BH3 profiling and correlate with response to combination venetoclax and ibrutinib&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine if increased expression of MCL-1 and BCL-XL is a potential mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance to venetoclax when given in combination with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine potential mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib and venetoclax combination&#xD;
      treatment by whole exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and ibrutinib PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 or 24 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD) negativity after 12 or 24 courses discontinue treatment, while participants with MRD&#xD;
      positivity continue treatment with venetoclax in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 2 years&#xD;
      and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
