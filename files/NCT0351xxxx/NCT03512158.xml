    <textblock>
      Lungs of babies born early are not fully developed and they often need a machine to help them&#xD;
      breathe. The traditional approach to provide this support is with a breathing tube passed&#xD;
      into the windpipe. However, we know that breathing tubes can cause injury to the fragile&#xD;
      lungs of premature babies. Providing breathing support through nose-masks instead of&#xD;
      breathing tubes (called nasal breathing support) is becoming popular, as it is gentler on&#xD;
      developing lungs. Doctors, in trying to limit the use of support with a breathing tube, are&#xD;
      using many different forms of nasal breathing support. The most common form is nasal&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant pressure and the baby&#xD;
      breathes on his on her own. However, when this strategy is no longer able to support a&#xD;
      premature baby's breathing, the best way to provide breathing support is not known. Some&#xD;
      doctors use a strategy called &quot;nasal intermittent positive airway pressure&quot; (NIPPV) which&#xD;
      gives the baby artificial breaths through the nose-mask. Others simply increase the pressure&#xD;
      on nasal CPAP to higher than traditional levels. In the first study of its kind, we will&#xD;
      compare these two strategies of nasal breathing support given to premature babies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity of prematurity, and affects up&#xD;
      to 40% of all preterm infants. It is independently associated with long term pulmonary and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impairment, and confers a significant cost to society. Although&#xD;
      development of BPD is multifactorial in nature, endotracheal mechanical ventilation (EMV) is&#xD;
      known to be a significant contributor and strategies aimed at avoiding endotracheal&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation may indeed reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) has increased over the last decades in an&#xD;
      effort to minimize dependence on endotracheal ventilation and reduce BPD in preterm neonates.&#xD;
      Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) remains the prototypical form of NRS and is&#xD;
      most commonly utilized. Another commonly used modality is non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (NIPPV) though it is often relegated as a &quot;rescue&quot; NRS mode following failure of&#xD;
      NCPAP. NIPPV mimics tidal breathing by delivering &quot;breaths&quot; through a nasal interface at&#xD;
      regular intervals, and results in higher mean airway pressures compared to NCPAP. Despite the&#xD;
      increase in use of NRS and evidence from clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing BPD,results at a population level have been rather disappointing, with a recent&#xD;
      report from the United States actually showing an increasing trend in BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, in an effort to further minimize dependence on endotracheal ventilation and&#xD;
      BPD, some new strategies in NRS use are emerging. One of these approaches is the early use of&#xD;
      NIPPV in place of NCPAP, rather than as a rescue mode after failure of NCPAP. Two recent&#xD;
      Cochrane reviews have evaluated NIPPV as an alternative to NCPAP., and suggested superiority&#xD;
      over NCPAP Based on these results, a number of NICUs have started utilizing NIPPV in place of&#xD;
      NCPAP as the default NRS mode. However, there are a number of methodological limitations of&#xD;
      studies that were included in these reviews. First, most studies did not allow for rescue use&#xD;
      of NIPPV in the NCPAP arms, which is not representative of current clinical practice at most&#xD;
      NICUs. Secondly, the mean airway pressures in NIPPV vs. NCPAP were vastly different, and the&#xD;
      question remains whether it is truly the mechanism of NIPPV or simply higher mean airway&#xD;
      pressure that leads to the superior outcomes reported. These limitations warrant&#xD;
      consideration because most NIPPV use is not synchronized to patients' respiratory efforts,&#xD;
      the optimal and safe peak pressures remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach that has emerged in recent years is the use of high end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressures (defined as pressures &gt; 8 cm H2O) on NCPAP. As of 2015, use of high NCPAP pressures&#xD;
      had only been adopted at 5 out of 28 Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and&#xD;
      McMaster Children's Hospital NICU is currently one of only few Canadian centres employing&#xD;
      pressures &gt; 12 cm H2O on NCPAP. The reasons for the lack of widespread use of high&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP are unknown, but may relate to the theoretical concerns of&#xD;
      altered systemic hemodynamics including impaired cardiac venous return, decreased venous&#xD;
      drainage of the cerebral circulation as well as the potential for air leak syndromes such as&#xD;
      pneumothoraces. On the other hand, such high end-expiratory pressures are very commonly and&#xD;
      safely used during endotracheal mechanical ventilation, as well as during NIPPV. As such, the&#xD;
      selective use of high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP non-invasively may be quite&#xD;
      appropriate. However, the use of high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP is currently based on&#xD;
      very limited evidence, and whether adopting this strategy leads to a meaningful decline in&#xD;
      the dependence on endotracheal ventilation and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains unknown.&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to comparatively evaluate use of NIPPV vs. high end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressures (&gt; 8 cmH2O) on NCPAP after failure of NCPAP use at traditional pressures (≤ 8&#xD;
      cmH2O) among preterm infants. This will be the first prospective clinical study to evaluate&#xD;
      high end-expiratory pressures on NCPAP, and also the first to compare NIPPV and NCPAP at&#xD;
      equivalent mean airway pressures. If high NCPAP is shown to be as effective and safe as&#xD;
      NIPPV, it will lead to a significant advancement in the understanding of NRS and the&#xD;
      respiratory management of extremely preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of the conduct of a larger and definitive trial comparing two&#xD;
      NRS strategies (NIPPV vs. high NCPAP pressures) in preterm infants. Therefore to prepare for&#xD;
      this a pilot trial is proposed. We hypothesize that the conduct of a definitive trial&#xD;
      comparing these two NRS modes to assess clinical outcomes will be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of all patients with gestational age &lt; 29 weeks who do not meet any of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be approached for consent by the research assistant at the earliest&#xD;
      opportunity. Consent will be sought within the first 72 hours. Subjects whose parents provide&#xD;
      consent AFTER 72 days will still be eligible, as long as there is no administration of high&#xD;
      NCPAP or NIPPV outside of randomization for greater than 4 continuous hours AFTER day 10 [240&#xD;
      hours] of post-natal age . A subject for whom consent is obtained from the parents will be&#xD;
      considered an &quot;enrolled subject&quot;. The research assistant will be responsible for indicating&#xD;
      this by placing a laminated card at the bedside, and informing both the medical and&#xD;
      respiratory therapy teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects who meet NRS failure criteria despite NCPAP 8 cmH2O, or are being extubated&#xD;
      from invasive mechanical ventilation with a mean airway pressure &gt;/= 10 cmH2O will be&#xD;
      eligible for randomization to either high CPAP &gt; 8 cmH2O (experimental arm) or NIPPV (control&#xD;
      arm). Once NRS failure criteria (indicated on bedside laminated card) and randomization&#xD;
      eligibility is confirmed, the subject will be randomized using an electronic web-based secure&#xD;
      platform (REDCap). An enrolled subject who gets randomized to one of the two arms will be&#xD;
      considered a &quot;randomized subject&quot;. A study initiation form will be completed by the research&#xD;
      team within 24 hours of randomization, and a new laminated card indicating arm of&#xD;
      randomization and extubation criteria will replace the enrollment card. This form will&#xD;
      include demographic data about the subject, the NRS failure criteria that was met which led&#xD;
      to randomization, and the suspected underlying pathophysiological mechanism for NRS failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for initiation and recommended increments of both high CPAP and NIPPV will be&#xD;
      provided, with a view towards maintaining similar mean airway pressures between the two modes&#xD;
      (which will also be placed at patient bedside in randomized subjects). Given the existing&#xD;
      variability of practice in NRS application and lack of evidence-based guidelines, the&#xD;
      strategies will NOT provide guidance with regards to day-to-day changes in settings or&#xD;
      modalities, but rather provide only ceiling limits and maximum allowed pressures for each NRS&#xD;
      mode. However, interfaces must be limited to either nasal masks or short bi-nasal prongs (RAM&#xD;
      cannulas will not be allowed). However, ceiling limits and maximum allowed pressures for each&#xD;
      NRS mode will be provided, as delineated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High CPAP - Maximum PEEP: 15 cmH2O&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIPPV - Maximum (set) PIP: 25 cmH2O; AND/OR Maximum (set) PEEP: 12 cmH2O; AND/OR Maximum&#xD;
           (calculated) MAP: 15 cmH2O&#xD;
&#xD;
      If NRS failure criteria are met despite escalating settings (with a strongly suggested - but&#xD;
      not mandated - minimum MAP of 12 cmH2O) whether either randomized arm of high NCPAP or NIPPV,&#xD;
      the clinician will have one of following three options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intubation and endotracheal mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Escalation of settings within the randomized arm beyond the aforementioned ceiling limit&#xD;
           - will still be considered failure of assigned mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of an alternate mode of NRS (NIV-NAVA or NIHFV) - but no crossover&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, the maximum recommended settings for each NRS mode need not be reached before&#xD;
      decision to intubate a subject, at the medical team's discretion. Furthermore, the NRS&#xD;
      strategy corresponding to the randomization arm reflects use of NRS at any and all times&#xD;
      after randomization until a randomized subject is discharged or transferred. The decision to&#xD;
      wean down to traditional NCPAP levels from either arm will be at discretion of the medical&#xD;
      team. Finally, subjects randomized to a particular strategy will NOT be allowed to cross-over&#xD;
      to the other arm until the first intubation. Patients may be pulled out from the study&#xD;
      protocol only at the discretion of the attending medical physician following the first&#xD;
      intubation, and the reason must be discussed in advance with the PI (A.M.). A customized&#xD;
      protocol violation form will then be completed by the attending physician, facilitated by the&#xD;
      research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major forms of protocol violations will be tracked prospectively (by research&#xD;
      coordinator):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of NIPPV or high CPAP in an enrolled patient outside of randomization. Such patients&#xD;
           will not be included in any further analysis of clinical outcomes, but will count&#xD;
           towards feasibility outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A patient with protocol violation related to cross-over; such a patient will be treated&#xD;
           as intention-to-treat for clinical outcomes, but a set of sensitivity analyses excluding&#xD;
           such patients (i.e. those that underwent protocol violation) will be conducted (see&#xD;
           section below on Sensitivity Analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of cerebral and renal regional perfusion will be performed using near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) for all subjects (at the primary study site only) at time of&#xD;
      randomization. At the time an enrolled subject meets NRS failure criteria, the NIRS leads&#xD;
      will be placed and recording will be initiated. Perfusion will be assessed immediately prior&#xD;
      to and continuously for up to 7 days post-randomization (or intubation if sooner that 7&#xD;
      days). This will be conducted by the research assistant during office hours and the&#xD;
      respiratory therapist at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study period, relevant demographic data and outcome variables for all&#xD;
      randomized subjects will be extracted from the local Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN) database&#xD;
      (or other equivalent local database) and from patient charts/electronic records by the&#xD;
      research coordinator using a customized data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS, STATISTICS AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized patients will be analyzed using intention-to-treat principle. Mean (SD) or&#xD;
      Median (IQR) will be reported for continuous variables depending on normality of data, and&#xD;
      percentages will be reported for categorical variables. T-test (or Wilcoxon rank sum test for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed variables) and Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test as&#xD;
      appropriate) will be used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. All&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses (for relevant secondary outcomes) will be performed based on the following&#xD;
      variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Indication for randomization [categorized broadly into: (a) Escalation from NCPAP due to&#xD;
           Apneas; (b) Escalation from NCPAP due to all other causes; and (c) Post-extubation]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-randomization respiratory management reflecting the initial alteration from&#xD;
           assigned NRS mode [categorized broadly into: (a) Wean down to traditional NCPAP; (b)&#xD;
           Escalation to alternate NRS mode (including escalation within assigned NRS mode beyond&#xD;
           maximum allowed settings); or (c) Intubation]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses (for secondary outcomes) based on the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Protocol violations due to crossover to alternate rescue NRS arm under study - analysis&#xD;
           of all secondary outcomes will be conducted after excluding such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Protocol violations due to crossover will be categorized into (i) within 7 days of&#xD;
           randomization and (ii) after 7 days of randomization - exclusion of patients for this&#xD;
           sensitivity analysis will be based on (i) and (ii) or (ii) only depending on which&#xD;
           outcome is being analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Excluding patients for whom a minimum MAP of 12 cmH2O on rescue NRS was NOT utilized&#xD;
           prior to NRS failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Excluding patients for whom the post-randomization NRS failure criteria were due to need&#xD;
           for intubation related to non-respiratory pathology (including but not limited to&#xD;
           clinical deterioration due to sepsis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression analyses: No regression analyses are planned a-priori for this pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional perfusion data using NIRS (from participant data at primary study site only) will be&#xD;
      compared within each randomization arm (immediately prior to and 2 hours post-randomization)&#xD;
      as well as between the two randomization arms 2 hours-post randomization using paired t-test&#xD;
      and unpaired t-tests, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of 100 subjects (40 at the lead institution and 20 per site at the other&#xD;
      3 centres) will be chosen for the purposes of this pilot trial. Analysis of secondary&#xD;
      outcomes from this pilot study will help inform the design and sample size for a definitive&#xD;
      trial comparing high CPAP and NIPPV. The feasibility outcome goals were used to determine the&#xD;
      sample size, based on methods described by Thabane et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARD (DSMB): A DSMB will perform two reviews - one following the&#xD;
      transition of the first phase of the study (30 randomized patients) and prior to commencement&#xD;
      of the second phase, with a second review occurring after 40 patients have been randomized&#xD;
      (70 total) in the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendix: NRS • FiO2 &gt;50% or rise in FiO2 &gt;20% in ≤12 hours&#xD;
