      EVERYONES HCV is a retrospective review of all previous Hepatitis C (HCV) testing and&#xD;
      diagnosis in NHS Tayside. The aim of this study is to analyse and compare the different&#xD;
      Hepatitis C diagnostic pathways with a view to determining the most cost effective&#xD;
      combination of methods of diagnosing HCV infection in a typical developed world population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus (HCV) that can seriously damage the liver and is spread&#xD;
      mainly through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. The &quot;serious and significant&#xD;
      public health risk&quot; posed by HCV was recognised during a member's debate in the Scottish&#xD;
      Parliament in 2004. By December 2006, Health Protection Scotland estimated that 50,000&#xD;
      persons in Scotland had been infected with the Hepatitis C virus and that 38,000 were chronic&#xD;
      carriers. Currently, the greatest risk of acquiring the virus in the UK is through injecting&#xD;
      drug use. In Scotland, it is estimated that over 85% of individuals who have Hepatitis C were&#xD;
      infected in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scotland has taken the lead within the UK in tackling HCV with its Hepatitis C Action Plan.&#xD;
      One of the plan's key goals was to identify undiagnosed infections. The plan has identified&#xD;
      that access to testing was a significant obstacle in diagnosis. Nearly 75% of undiagnosed&#xD;
      cases of HCV within Scotland (16,300) are people who inject drugs (PWIDs) who no longer&#xD;
      inject. Given that we have now entered the new era of the curative direct antiviral agents&#xD;
      against HCV, it is important that we develop new stratagems to identify and treat those cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators had considered population screening, however this is not justified under&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria due to the relatively low prevalence in Scotland.&#xD;
      The way forward will be to prioritise strategies and target different population groups in a&#xD;
      logical manner. The question is what is the most cost-effective means to achieve this and&#xD;
      with what combination of testing strategies. Tayside has been at the forefront of piloting&#xD;
      novel testing methods. The following list includes the current diagnostic pathways which are&#xD;
      standard care in NHS Tayside and previously published pilot studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard diagnosis pathway: clinical suspicion at presentation in primary (pathway 1a)&#xD;
           or secondary care (pathway 1b) that HCV could be the cause of the presentation or&#xD;
           co-incident issue requiring testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients on opiate substitution therapy (OST): testing is being done across the Tayside&#xD;
           Substance Misuse Services on initial assessment and annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients on opiate substitution therapy (OST). Opportunistic testing done for clients&#xD;
           receiving OST in participating dispensing pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Testing in needle exchanges&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients previously on OST or in drug treatment: review of methadone prescription&#xD;
           records, dating back to the 1980s, to identify patients at increased risk of HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prisons: opt-out testing upon entry is standard practice for all prisoners in the region&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Community outreach to ethnic minorities, including testing in the mosques&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. General Practice: Electronic record trawl and health promotion&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Record trawl with specially designed search tools to identify patients at increased&#xD;
                risk of HCV infection and GP follow up offer of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Health promotion message and easy access HCV testing for selected general practices&#xD;
                in Tayside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Targeted General Practice screening in Glasgow:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Targeting to GPs in areas with high social deprivation, as these are associated&#xD;
                with higher HCV prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Targeting to GPs with in areas with high social deprivation, with patients who have&#xD;
                a history of IVDU and fall within the ages of 30-64&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. GP record unification. 24 general practices in Tayside unified their HCV testing records&#xD;
           with the secondary care HCV records to identify patients never referred or lost to&#xD;
           follow up. Whilst this is not a novel diagnosis pathway, the outcomes will provide&#xD;
           important information regarding linkage to care for other pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to retrospectively compare and evaluate the existing and pilot&#xD;
      studies that have been conducted in NHS Tayside along with two general practice based studies&#xD;
      from Glasgow to determine the optimum and most cost effective bundle of diagnostic activities&#xD;
      to bring the different HCV communities to diagnosis and accessing of treatment.&#xD;
