  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open label, two way crossover study in healthy male subjects. Two treatments were&#xD;
      administered to each subject, one treatment per study period, in a randomized manner.&#xD;
      Subjects remained resident in the Clinical Unit from the evening of Day 1 until the morning&#xD;
      of Day 2 of each period and there was a washout period of at least 2 days between treatments.&#xD;
      A post study medical examination was performed prior to discharge in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a single dose of intranasal&#xD;
      oxymetazoline hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
