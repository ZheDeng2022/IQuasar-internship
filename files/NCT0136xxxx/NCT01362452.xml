  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an infusion of white blood cells&#xD;
      (called T cells) that have been genetically changed is safe to give patients who have&#xD;
      received an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Researchers want to learn if these&#xD;
      genetically changed T-cells are effective in attacking cancer cells in patients with advanced&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma or leukemia after they have received an UCBT, how long the changed T-cells&#xD;
      stay in the body, and if adding them to standard transplant could improve how patients&#xD;
      respond to treatment.&#xD;

      T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene transfer used in this study involves umbilical cord blood cells taken either from&#xD;
      your UCB unit(s) or from cells left over after your UCB unit has been processed. Researchers&#xD;
      perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA (the genetic material of cells), and then&#xD;
      inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant. This&#xD;
      process is called a modified donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and UCBT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the umbilical cord blood unit has been identified for your transplant and after it has&#xD;
      arrived at the hospital, you will be admitted to the hospital to receive chemotherapy and the&#xD;
      UCBT. These procedures are not considered part of this research study. You will discuss these&#xD;
      procedures with a study doctor and sign an informed consent document with specific details of&#xD;
      the UCBT procedure and possible risks, at another time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the&#xD;
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-cell Infusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the UCBT, the study doctor will decide when you will be eligible for the T-cell&#xD;
      infusions. You must be at least 42 days past your UCBT without any serious evidence of active&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when the donor cells attack the cells of the&#xD;
      person receiving the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-cell infusion is given by vein, usually over 15-30 minutes over 2 days. A smaller dose&#xD;
      of T cells will be infused on the first day and if this is tolerated the remaining dose of T&#xD;
      cells will be infused within 72 hours after the first infusion. During both infusions, your&#xD;
      vital signs will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days before the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check how well the donated blood cells and&#xD;
           tissue are mixing with your blood. Researchers use this test to find out how successful&#xD;
           the transplant is. This is a standard test for patients who have received a transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests to measure the number of&#xD;
           B-cells and other (non-transplanted) T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to your UCBT, including GVHD and graft&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your immune&#xD;
           system, and to check for HAMA immune system reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 hours, and then about 3 days, 1 week (+/- 2 days), 2 weeks (+/- 2 days), 4 weeks&#xD;
      (+/- 7 days), 8 weeks (+/- 7 days), 3 months (+/- 7 days), 6 months (+/- 7 days), and 12&#xD;
      months (+/- 7 days) after the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be checked for possible reactions to your treatment, including GVHD and graft&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 month (+/- 7 days), 2 months (+/- 7 days), 3 months (+/- 7 days), 6 months (+/- 7&#xD;
      days), and 12 months (+/- 7 days) after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will&#xD;
      be drawn to check certain protein levels. This may be checked more often, and the protein may&#xD;
      be replaced, if your doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once during Weeks 2 and 4, and then once a month for 6 months after the T-cell infusion,&#xD;
      blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your immune system. This blood draw may be&#xD;
      done at the same time as the blood draws for routine tests when possible, to avoid extra&#xD;
      &quot;needle sticks&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 2nd T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests to check the level of the&#xD;
           infused T-cells and to measure the number of B-cells and other (non-transplanted)&#xD;
           T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, and you will be checked for possible reactions to your&#xD;
           treatment, including GVHD and graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests to check the level of the&#xD;
           infused T-cells and to measure the number of B-cells and other (non-transplanted)&#xD;
           T-cells. Â°During the Month 3 visit, part of this blood sample will be used to check for&#xD;
           HAMA immune system reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have lymphoma, you may have a you will have a positron emission tomography -&#xD;
           computed tomography (PET-CT) scan and/or a CT scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and&#xD;
           pelvis to check the status of the disease, if your doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and/or procedures may be repeated more often, if your study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking part in this study for up to 12 months. You will be taken off study&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse, you have any infections, intolerable side effects occur, you are&#xD;
      not able to follow study directions, the T-cells do not engraft (grow in your body), or you&#xD;
      are not able to receive a T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken&#xD;
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits,&#xD;
      or if your transplant doctor decides it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over once you have completed the planned study&#xD;
      visits at 12 months after the last T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who&#xD;
      receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term&#xD;
      follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will be asked to sign&#xD;
      a separate consent form for a long-term follow-up study named Protocol 2006-0676.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The gene transfer (or T-cell infusion with genetically&#xD;
      changed T cells) is not commercially available or FDA approved for use in this type of&#xD;
      disease. Gene transfer in this study is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
