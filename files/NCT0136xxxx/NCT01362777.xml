    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disease (2-4% of the general&#xD;
      population) that generates intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. OSAS is associated&#xD;
      with various metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes. OSAS is a risk&#xD;
      factor for cardio-vascular diseases by increasing morbidity/mortality. OSAS patients suffer&#xD;
      from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a symptom also responsible for at least 30% of&#xD;
      traffic accidents but also other cognitive disorders with significant impact on quality of&#xD;
      life. OSAS generates oxidative stress, inflammation and resistance to insulin and other&#xD;
      systemic metabolic dysregulation of many whose levels are correlated with the severity of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has clearly demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness to eliminate apneas and improve EDS but it is sometimes difficult to accept&#xD;
      and/or poorly tolerated, limiting its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss and regular physical activity are clearly recommended but rarely done in clinical&#xD;
      practice. A few studies have applied to study the effects of rehabilitation training (REE) on&#xD;
      the sleep apnea patients and have shown an improvement in sleep quality, reduction of&#xD;
      awakenings and arousals from sleep and the Index of Apnea/Hypopnea (AHI), but their&#xD;
      methodology was questionable, and the number of patients included was too low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that an in-patient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program&#xD;
      comprising educational activities, dietary management and individualized exercise training&#xD;
      (IET) will decrease OSAS severity, improve sleep quality and symptoms (EDS, fatigue, QoL).&#xD;
      This IET program (24 sessions during 4 weeks) could also help to improve many metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulation, inflammation and oxidative stress (also markers of cardiovascular risk).&#xD;
      Leptin, a hormone involved in regulating appetite, energy expenditure and ventilatory control&#xD;
      is increased in OSA (mechanism of leptin resistance). The improved sensitivity to leptin may&#xD;
      play a role in enabling a better control of ventilation in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAS), with an estimated prevalence of between&#xD;
      2 and 4% (1) is characterized by repetitive obstructions of the upper airway that generate&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. The typical clinical profile of the apneic&#xD;
      patient is an middle aged (50-55 years) obese male, snoring and drowsy. Moreover, OSAS is a&#xD;
      risk factor for hypertension independent of obesity (2, 3) and it is now clear evidence that&#xD;
      untreated apnea patients have high cardiovascular morbidity / mortality (CVM) higher than&#xD;
      subjects treated with CPAP (4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is the main symptom (7) but the attentional&#xD;
      and cognitive disorders (8.9), depression or simply a state of fatigue are other possible&#xD;
      manifestations of OSAS. The impact on quality of life (QoL) (10-12) are significant and&#xD;
      underestimated. The origins of this drowsiness are multiple: one finds the fragmentation of&#xD;
      sleep (13,14), intermittent hypoxia, respiratory effort, obesity (15) and certain cytokines&#xD;
      such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 involved in sleep regulation (16-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the pathophysiology, the investigators find in the obstructive apneic oxidative stress&#xD;
      (20-24) and systemic inflammation (25-27). CRP and levels of some cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8 and TNF-alpha) are increased and their levels are correlated with the severity of&#xD;
      disease as the increase of CVD (28-30 ). Intermittent hypoxia appears to play an essential&#xD;
      role in the genesis of these abnormalities (31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the metabolic dysregulation of many coexist. Found abnormal fasting blood glucose, a state&#xD;
      of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia. Insulin resistance increases with&#xD;
      body weight independent of the index of apnea / hypopnea (AHI) (18, 32-34). Intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxia appears to be the cause. Leptin secreted by adipocytes, regulates weight by&#xD;
      controlling appetite and energy expenditure. The hyperleptinemia found in OSA is&#xD;
      controversial. Obesity appears to be primarily responsible for some (36) while others suggest&#xD;
      the role of nocturnal hypoxemia (37). In fact, it is more the state of leptin resistance that&#xD;
      hyperleptinemia alone that seems to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has clearly demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness to suppress apneas and sleep fragmentation associated. A meta-analysis (38) has&#xD;
      confirmed the improvement of IDS by the PPC. However, in less severe forms, improving the SDE&#xD;
      is less clear (39) and the PPC is sometimes not easily accepted, not tolerated and limiting&#xD;
      its effectiveness is its poor compliance (40,41). From a pathophysiological point of view,&#xD;
      CSF improves systemic inflammation (26,27) and diminishes the CVD (5.6). For cons, the&#xD;
      metabolic dysregulation (insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia) are improving&#xD;
      somewhat CPAP except in patients without obesity (42-44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary guidelines are essential for the management of this disease is the result for a&#xD;
      large part of a healthy lifestyle deleterious. Weight loss, regular physical activity is also&#xD;
      clearly recommended but unfortunately rarely performed and / or supported by our healthcare&#xD;
      system. Few studies have focused on studying the effects of such treatment on sleep apneic&#xD;
      patients. In normal subjects, the effects of exercise on sleep are described in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis (45). The practice of regular physical activity endurance improves quality of&#xD;
      sleep (45-47). Sleep latency is shorter, there is less change in stages and fewer awakenings&#xD;
      and arousals from sleep. Unlike other studies show that in situations where physical activity&#xD;
      is reduced (physical inactivity, obesity, or prolonged bed rest, for example) sleep&#xD;
      deteriorates, breaks and daytime alertness decreases. The effect of exercise in OSAS (48,49)&#xD;
      and especially the training in physical exercise (48) shows an improvement in sleep quality&#xD;
      and reduction of awakenings and arousals from sleep and fewer respiratory events (IAH).&#xD;
      Pathophysiological point of view, there is a decrease in concentrations of leptin (50-53) and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines (54-55) in different populations of subjects (healthy, older, obese,&#xD;
      or with heart failure). And the investigators know the effects of exercise on carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism in particular (decreased insulin resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      And physical activity improves sleep quality in normal subjects while in parallel it would&#xD;
      have an anti-inflammatory. For patients with severe OSAS, our hypothesis is to improve the&#xD;
      quality of sleep (SLP rate) and a decrease in AHI and EDS through rehabilitation training&#xD;
      (REE) associated with a comprehensive care (patient education, dietary, psychological, ...).&#xD;
      On the pathophysiology, this improvement would be through a reduction of biological&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with OSA are also markers of cardiovascular risk. Mainly metabolic&#xD;
      disorders, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
