    <textblock>
      Since 2007, the cost of sequencing a diploid human genome has fallen dramatically, from&#xD;
      approximately $70 million to $20,000. As affordable sequencing platforms become more widely&#xD;
      available, the advancement of biomedical science will draw increasingly on whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing research requiring large cohorts of diverse populations. Key policy, ethical and&#xD;
      legal implications of these developments will need to be understood in order to promote the&#xD;
      efficacy and effectiveness of genomic research going forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overall aim of this project is to obtain feedback on the informed consent process from&#xD;
      some of the earliest particpants in studies using whole genome sequencing. A more specific&#xD;
      goal is to characterize the salient personal and public references accessed by participants&#xD;
      around the time of the informed consent process. By highlighting trends in participants views&#xD;
      about study participation around the time of the initial informed consent process, we aim to&#xD;
      advance the development of an ethically and socially relevant vocabulary with which to&#xD;
      negotiate future terms of use for personal sequence data in genomic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a one-time, semi-structured telephone interview&#xD;
      lasting approximately 45 minutes in the period 2-8 weeks following their initial informed&#xD;
      consent session at the NIH. They will be recruited from two NIH protocols employing whole&#xD;
      genome sequencing for distinct purposes. They The ClinSeqTM Study is a large-scale medical&#xD;
      sequencing project investigating the causal role of genetics in cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      enrolling both symptomatic and healthy individuals. The Whole Genome Medical Sequencing for&#xD;
      Gene Discovery Study (WGMS) enrolls children and adults for full sequencing with the aim of&#xD;
      discovering the genetic etiology of rare conditions.&#xD;

      Since 2007, the cost of sequencing a diploid human genome has fallen dramatically, from&#xD;
      approximately $70 million to $20,000 (Illumina, 2010). As affordable sequencing platforms&#xD;
      become more widely available, the advancement of biomedical science will draw increasingly on&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing research requiring large cohorts of diverse populations (Lunshof et&#xD;
      al., 2009; Need &amp; Goldstein, 2009). Key policy, ethical and legal implications of these&#xD;
      developments will need to be understood in order to promote the efficacy and effectiveness of&#xD;
      genomic research going forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to information about well-understood regions of the genome both sought-after and&#xD;
      incidental whole genome sequencing yields results of probabilistic, uncertain, and changing&#xD;
      significance over indefinite periods of time. Sequence data is most useful when shared widely&#xD;
      among investigators in conjunction with detailed clinical information (Angrist, 2010). It may&#xD;
      have implications for individuals and families and be of unclear clinical significance. As&#xD;
      such, the boundary between clinical and research testing is dissolving, and standards for&#xD;
      returning test results to research participants are non-existent (McGuire &amp; Lupski, 2010).&#xD;
      The difficulty of acquiring informed consent for studies involving whole genome sequencing is&#xD;
      therefore a topic of active debate within the biomedical research community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study approaches both informed consent and genomic medicine as iterative&#xD;
      constructs shaped by civic values and social norms. Understanding the civic and social&#xD;
      contexts where informed consent takes place is crucial in order to adapt it to new realities&#xD;
      in genomic research. An overall aim of this inquiry is to solicit feedback on the informed&#xD;
      consent process from some of the earliest adopters of whole genome sequencing in research. A&#xD;
      more specific goal is to characterize the salient personal and public references accessed by&#xD;
      participants around the time of the informed consent process. By highlighting trends in and&#xD;
      relationships between these civic values and social norms, we aim to advance the development&#xD;
      of an ethically and socially relevant vocabulary with which to broker terms of use for&#xD;
      personal sequence data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from two NIH protocols employing whole genome sequencing for&#xD;
      distinct purposes. The ClinSeqTM Study is a large-scale medical sequencing project&#xD;
      investigating the causal role of genetics in cardiovascular disease enrolling both&#xD;
      symptomatic and healthy individuals. The Whole Genome Medical Sequencing for Gene Discovery&#xD;
