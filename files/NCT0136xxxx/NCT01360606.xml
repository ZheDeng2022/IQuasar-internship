      This is a phase I dose escalation study. Dose escalation will be via the traditional &quot;up and&#xD;
      down&quot; scheme. SBRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one of the following radiation regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 Gy in 5 fractions (10 Gy/fx) delivered over a 2-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 Gy in 5 fractions (12 Gy/fx) delivered over a 2-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75 Gy in 5 fractions (15 Gy/fx) delivered over a 2-week period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to enrollment all patients will be evaluated with a physical exam, review of pathology&#xD;
      and laboratory values to confirm diagnosis, and baseline imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will treat with a stereotactic radiosurgery system using 6MV photons to deliver&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a total dose ranging from 50-75 Gy in 5 fractions (10-15 Gy/fx). Dose&#xD;
      escalation will be via the traditional &quot;up and down&quot; scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In determining the radiation dose and fractionation scheme for this protocol, we used the&#xD;
      linear-quadratic formalism for radiation cell killing to &quot;equate&quot; schemes that vary the&#xD;
      dose/fraction and number of fractions. This concept of biologically equivalent dose (BED)&#xD;
      states that the total effect is given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      nd x (1 + d/(alpha-beta ratio))&#xD;
&#xD;
      where n is the # of fractions and d is the dose/fraction. The &quot;alpha-beta ratio&quot;&#xD;
      characterizes the radiation response of a particular tissue; a higher value is indicative of&#xD;
      a tissue that responds acutely to the effects of radiation. Due to their highly proliferative&#xD;
      nature, most tumors fall into this category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This final dose scheme (total dose 75 Gy) is biologically equivalent to the previously&#xD;
      studied doses in the literature (60 Gy in 3 fractions), meaning the first two sets of&#xD;
      patients will be treated to a radiobiologically smaller (and likely safer) dose. We would&#xD;
      favor treating in five fractions, as opposed to three, to allow more repair of normal tissue,&#xD;
      reoxygenation of tumor cells, and redistribution of tumor cells to more radiosensitive parts&#xD;
      of the cell cycle. Using a smaller fraction size, 10-15 Gy compared to 20 Gy, will also help&#xD;
      reduce late effects of radiation therapy. SBRT treatment will be given on an every other day&#xD;
      schedule, excluding weekends. The prescription dose will be prescribed to the isodose line&#xD;
      best encompassing the planning target volume (PTV) depending on the volume of tumor (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization, immobilization, and simulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 5 - 10 days after fiducial placement, pPatients will undergo 4D FDG-PET/CT simulation&#xD;
      with the goal of evaluating tumor motion to allow for gated treatment when indicated. This&#xD;
      goal will be accomplished by using the Real-time Position Management (RPM) system (Varian&#xD;
      Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) to create a retrospective 4D CT scan. Following the&#xD;
      institutional protocol, a helical CT scan and a 4D positron emission tomography (PET) scan&#xD;
      with a patient with body immobilization device will be acquired. A patient will not eat or&#xD;
      drink anything for four hours before the PET scan. Before the PET scan, blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken from either a finger stick or a vein in the arm to check the sugar level. An injection&#xD;
      of a small amount of a radioactive drug called FDG ( [F18] fluorodeoxyglucose) which is a&#xD;
      chemical similar to sugar will be administered into a vein in the arm or hand. Approximately&#xD;
      45 to 60 minutes after the injection of FDG, the patient will be asked to urinate (to empty&#xD;
      the bladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be set up in the PET/CT scanner using a vacuum cushion for immobilization in&#xD;
      the supine position with feet tied and hands across the chest or above the head. There will&#xD;
      also be a respiration-monitoring device called a marker block placed 5cm below the patient's&#xD;
      xyphoid process. An infrared camera at the foot of the CT table will capture the images of&#xD;
      the marker block and relay them to the RPM computer, which in turn will translate the images&#xD;
      into a respiratory pattern. The audio coach (which instructs the patient in regulating&#xD;
      breathing) will be calibrated to both patient comfort and time of expiration, inspiration,&#xD;
      and full breathing cycle. The placing of the patient in a body immobilization device will&#xD;
      take about 10-15 minutes. The patient will need to lie still for about 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      completion of the 4D PET scan. The PET/CT scanner will then be programmed to acquire a&#xD;
      retrospective 4D CT scan with a set of images for each phase of the breathing cycle. This&#xD;
      scan will take place immediately after the PET scan. It will take around 5-10 minutes. The&#xD;
      physician or physicist will then select the number of breathing phases to use while the&#xD;
      software program selects the best image for each selected breathing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire FDG-PET/CT scan procedure is expected to take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Planning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning will be carried out using the planning station for the radiosurgery&#xD;
      equipment being used for treatment. The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be contoured on the&#xD;
      fused image set. Two GTV volumes will be contoured; the gross tumor as seen on CT alone and&#xD;
      the gross tumor corresponding to FDG avidity. No margins will be added for clinical target&#xD;
      volume (CTV), but custom margins will be added for the planning target volume (PTV) based on&#xD;
      the findings of the 4D FDG-PET/CT motion study assessment. The treatment will be prescribed&#xD;
      to the isodose line that best covers the planning target volume, which will typically be the&#xD;
      80% isodose line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT will take place within 14 days of the treatment planning scan. The planning data&#xD;
      containing the coordinates of tumor isocenter, the external infrared markers, and the&#xD;
      implanted markers are transferred to the appropriate platform depending on the treating&#xD;
      machine. If the patient meets the criteria of gating technique then treatment delivery will&#xD;
      be accomplished using the appropriate gating technology. Depending on the technology used&#xD;
      external infrared markers attached to the patient's skin or a marker block placed on the&#xD;
      patient's chest is used to determine the breathing pattern. The size of beam-on window will&#xD;
      be determined based on the target motion as detected by the 4D FDG-PET/CT scan. The threshold&#xD;
      for gated treatment delivery is determined based upon the target motion due to respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily initial positioning during treatment delivery will be performed using lasers and&#xD;
      skin marks and infrared optical markers as appropriate. The target isocenter will be verified&#xD;
      using daily imaging. Depending on the platform used, the moving target will be positioned&#xD;
      within the beam under infrared and/or image guidance&#xD;
