  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is a major health problem and the most prevalent cancer among women.In a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of familial cases, germ-line mutations in either BRCA1/2 can be&#xD;
      detected. The only proven modality for active risk reduction (rather than passive early&#xD;
      detection), is prophylactic surgery - prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. While the&#xD;
      majority of Jewish mutation carriers elect to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy at about age&#xD;
      40 years, in Israel only a minority perform prophylactic mastectomy. Another ramification of&#xD;
      being a mutation carrier is the emotional stress associated with that discovery.Genetic&#xD;
      information has profound implications for mutation carriers. The IBSR (Inquiry-based stress&#xD;
      reduction) intervention, developed by Byron Katie, trains participants to reduce their&#xD;
      perceived level of stress by self-inquiry of their thoughts and beliefs connected to&#xD;
      stressful circumstances or symptoms. This meditative process, named &quot;The Work&quot;, enables the&#xD;
      participants to identify and question the stressful thoughts that cause their suffering. The&#xD;
      core of IBSR is simply four questions and a turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the&#xD;
      opposite of what the participant believes. This process is simple, powerful and provides&#xD;
      skills for self-inquiry and management of stressful thoughts that can be easily implemented&#xD;
      in daily life [ ]. Therefore, on the basis of previous data and beneficial observations we&#xD;
      postulate that the clinical utility of IBSR mediation program may improve psychological and&#xD;
      physical symptoms and quality of life among asymptomatic (oncologically healthy) BRCA1/ BRCA2&#xD;
      mutation carriers. Thus, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      scientifically investigate the effect of this intervention effects on BRCA1/2 mutation&#xD;
      carriers.&#xD;

      Main Goals: To investigate whether IBSR intervention is efficacious in improving quality of&#xD;
      life, psychological and physical status in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary-goal: To Assess feasibility of IBSR intervention by examining attendance, drop-out&#xD;
      rates, and program satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Participants' ability to deal with emotional difficulties will be improved&#xD;
      following participation in the IBSR intervention. This will be reflected in improving the&#xD;
      values of psychological measures, such as quality of sleep, cancer related worry, family&#xD;
      support, depression and anxiety, after the intervention (among participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group, but not in the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Eligible individuals are women who are carriers of one of the predominant&#xD;
      Jewish mutations in BRCA1/2 genes at the Meirav Center, Sheba Medical center over the past 10&#xD;
      years. All eligible women will be contacted by the staff of the Meirav Center and will be&#xD;
      offered participation during routine follow up visits at the high risk clinic, by phone or a&#xD;
      letter. Interested individuals will be scheduled to attend a meeting at a time of their&#xD;
      convenience with the PI or the Co PIs to explain the study aims and goals. After the&#xD;
      participant has agreed and signed the informed consent she is considered eligible.&#xD;
