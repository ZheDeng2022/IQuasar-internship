  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      C-reactive protein (CRP) is directly implicated in atherogenesis and associated&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Effective Continuous&#xD;
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment has been shown to gradually decrease CRP levels and&#xD;
      thus consequently improve disease-related cardiovascular morbidity. However, the influence of&#xD;
      gender on the CRP evolution pattern has never been assessed before. The aim of our study was&#xD;
      to investigate possible gender differences in CRP evolution in OSA patients 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after the start of effective CPAP treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSA is an independent risk factor for a number of cardiovascular diseases. One important&#xD;
      possible mechanism underlying cardiovascular disease in patients with OSA is systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. CRP, an acute phase reactant secreted by the liver, is one of the most actively&#xD;
      studied biomarkers of low-grade inflammation, and numerous studies have shown that higher CRP&#xD;
      levels are associated with high mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease in men&#xD;
      and women. In patients with OSA, the question as to whether or not CRP levels are elevated is&#xD;
      still under debate. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in the&#xD;
      management of OSA, conflicting data also exist regarding the effects of CPAP on CRP levels.&#xD;
      However, none of the existing studies assessed the influence of gender on the CRP evolution&#xD;
      pattern. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate possible gender differences in&#xD;
      CRP evolution in patients with moderate to severe OSA, free of medical comorbidities, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the start of effective CPAP treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) management. Subjects with OSA will be trained in the use of CPAP and will be instructed to use CPAP every night for 6 months. These subjects will then return for a post-treatment blood draw 3 and 6 months after the start of effective CPAP treatment</description>
