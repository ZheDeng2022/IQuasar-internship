    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Plexiform neurofibromas are tumors that grow in and around nerves. The only way to treat&#xD;
      them is with surgery. Some of these tumors cannot be completely removed. The tumors may be&#xD;
      too large, too numerous, or in a bad location for surgery. An experimental drug called&#xD;
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate may be able to prevent the tumors from growing, slow down their&#xD;
      growth, or shrink them. This drug has been tested in adults with cancer and in children with&#xD;
      some types of brain cancer. This study will test how well this drug works with these types of&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate in children and young&#xD;
      adults with plexiform neurofibromas that cannot be completely removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and young adults between 12 and 18 years of age who have plexiform neurofibromas&#xD;
      that cannot be completely removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, and&#xD;
           imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will take the study drug twice a day with 8 ounces of water, every day for 28-day&#xD;
           cycles of treatment. During study visits, participants will have blood and urine tests&#xD;
           and physical exams. They will also have imaging studies to examine the tumor sizes and&#xD;
           locations. They will answer questions about their health. They may have other tests as&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to receive the study drug as long as they have no severe side&#xD;
           effects and the disease is not getting worse.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing tumors of&#xD;
           the central and peripheral nervous system, including plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which&#xD;
           are benign nerve sheath tumors that are among the most debilitating complications of&#xD;
           NF1. PN may be congenital and appear to have the fastest growth rate in young children.&#xD;
           Surgery is the only standard treatment option available for PN. However, this is often&#xD;
           difficult due to the encasement of vital structures, and extensive and invasive PN&#xD;
           growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PN are composed of neoplastic Schwann cells that lack NF1 gene expression. This results&#xD;
           in upregulation of Ras, which initiates several signaling cascades regulating cell&#xD;
           proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib (AZD6244 hyd sulfate), a novel orally bioavailable mitogen activated protein&#xD;
           kinase inhibitor, is a specific inhibitor of MEK 1, which may mediate anti-tumor effects&#xD;
           in PN by inhibition of downstream signaling of Ras. Selumetinib is currently undergoing&#xD;
           evaluation in adult cancers and children with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this phase I study of selumetinib directed at NF1 PN, we have observed a degree of&#xD;
&#xD;
      activity which has not been observed previously; therefore a phase II evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral selumetinib administered daily to&#xD;
           pediatric patients with NF1 and inoperable PN. Based on the results of the dose&#xD;
           escalation in this study, the current MTD has been determined as 20 mg/m2/dose. To be&#xD;
           consistent in pediatric dosing, an additional dose level of 25 mg/m2/dose was added,&#xD;
           which is the MTD recently determined in a study conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor&#xD;
           Consortium (PBTC). Amendment H (November 2014): The MTD has been determined to be 25&#xD;
           mg/m(2)/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the acute and chronic toxicities and pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib.&#xD;
           Completed with amendment H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objectives: To evaluate the confirmed partial and complete response rate of&#xD;
      selumetinib using volumetric MRI analysis in children and young adults with NF1 and&#xD;
      inoperable PN with PN related morbidity at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Patients (greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 18 years) who are&#xD;
      able to swallow intact capsules, with NF1 and inoperable measurable PN that have the&#xD;
      potential to cause significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selumetinib will be administered orally BID on a continuous dosing schedule (28 days = 1&#xD;
           treatment cycle). In the phase I portion, limited dose escalations will be performed to&#xD;
           define the MTD based on tolerability of selumetinib during the first three treatment&#xD;
           cycles. In the phase II portion, the recommended phase II dose level (RP2D) will be&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients will be enrolled on one of two strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stratum 1: PN related morbidity present at enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
                ---PN related pain, disfigurement, or difficulty in physical functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stratum 2: No significant PN related morbidity present at enrollment, but potential&#xD;
                for development of PN morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported and functional outcomes will be evaluated at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status will be evaluated using volumetric MRI analysis at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day 1 and steady state plasma PK and PD of selumetinib will be evaluated.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age Phase I: greater than 3 years and less than or equal to 18 years at the time of&#xD;
             study enrollment, if able to swallow whole capsules. The age limits including young&#xD;
             children were chosen because early childhood and puberty are considered to be the&#xD;
             greatest risk for disease progression, and selumetinib may provide the most benefit to&#xD;
             this young group of patients. In addition, an important objective of this study is to&#xD;
             characterize the pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in the pediatric population since it&#xD;
             has been well studied in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age Phase II: geater than 2 years of age and less than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
             BSA greater than or equal to 0.55 m(2), and able to swallow whole capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis: Patients with NF1 and inoperable PN, defined as PN that cannot be&#xD;
             surgically completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to encasement&#xD;
             of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the&#xD;
             PN. The PN has to cause (stratum 1) or have the potential to cause (stratum 2)&#xD;
             significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck lesions that could&#xD;
             compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal lesions that can cause myelopathy&#xD;
             brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of&#xD;
             function, lesions that could result in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are&#xD;
             significantly disfiguring, lesions of the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or&#xD;
             loss of function, and painful lesions. Patients will be enrolled into stratum 1 or 2&#xD;
             based on PN related morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Histiologic confirmation of tumor is not necessary in the presence of consistent&#xD;
             clinical and radiographic findings, but should be considered if malignant degeneration&#xD;
             of a PN is clinically suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A PN is defined as a neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may&#xD;
             involve multiple fascicles and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with&#xD;
             connection between the levels or extending laterally along the nerve. In addition to&#xD;
             PN, all study subjects must have either positive genetic testing for NF1 or have at&#xD;
             least one other diagnostic criterion for NF1 listed below: (NIH Consensus conference):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more caf(SqrRoot)(Copyright)-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to&#xD;
                  0.5cm in prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in post pubertal&#xD;
                  subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Optic glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first-degree relative with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease: Patients must have at least one measurable PN, defined as a lesion&#xD;
             of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Patients who underwent surgery for&#xD;
             resection of a PN are eligible provided the PN was incompletely resected and is&#xD;
             measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Phase II: Measurability and suitability for volumetric MRI analysis of the target PN&#xD;
             must be confirmed with the NCI POB prior to enrolling a patient. The target PN will be&#xD;
             defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which has to be amenable to volumetric MRI&#xD;
             analysis. PN will be classified as typical PN versus nodular PN versus solitary&#xD;
             nodular PN prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior Therapy: Patients with NF1 will only be eligible if complete tumor resection is&#xD;
             not considered to be feasible without substantial risk or morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with NF1 and PN,&#xD;
                  patients may be treated on this trial without having received prior medical&#xD;
                  therapy directed at their PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial myelosuppression, there&#xD;
                  will be no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for PN or other&#xD;
                  tumor manifestations associated with NF1 such as optic glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received previous investigational agents or biologic therapy,&#xD;
                  such as tipifarnib, pirfenidone, Peg-Intron, sorafenib, imatinib or other&#xD;
                  targeted therapies are eligible for enrollment. At least 4 weeks must have&#xD;
                  elapsed since receiving medical therapy directed at the PN. Patients who received&#xD;
                  prior medical therapy for their PN must have recovered from the acute toxic&#xD;
                  effects of all prior therapy to less than or equal to grade 1 before entering&#xD;
                  this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function must not&#xD;
                  have been administered within 7 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed prior to enrollment since the patient received&#xD;
                  any prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since any surgeries, with evidence of good&#xD;
                  wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Performance status: Patients greater than or equal to 16 years of age must have a&#xD;
             Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to70%, and children &lt; 16 years&#xD;
             old must have a Lansky performance of greater than or equal to 70%. Patients who are&#xD;
             wheelchair bound because of paralysis secondary to a plexiform neurofibroma should be&#xD;
             considered ambulatory when they are up in their wheelchair. Similarly, patients with&#xD;
             limited mobility secondary to need for mechanical support (such as an airway PN&#xD;
             requiring tracheostomy or CPAP) will also be considered ambulatory for the purpose of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hematologic Function: Patients must have an absolute neutrophil count greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 1500/(micro)l, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9g/dl, and platelet&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 100,000/(micro)l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hepatic Function: Patients must have bilirubin within 1.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal for age, with the exception of Gilbert syndrome, and AST/ ALT within less than&#xD;
             or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Renal Function: Patients must have a creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 60ml/min/1.73 m(2) or a normal serum creatinine based on age&#xD;
             described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age (years)/Maximum Serum Creatinine(mg/dL):&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age less than or equal to 5/Maximum Serum Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age greater than 5 to less than or equal to 10/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age greater than 10 to less than or equal to 15/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             Age greater than 15/ Maximum Serum Creatinine 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Cardiac Function: Normal ejection fraction (ECHO or cardiac MRI) greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 53% (or the institutional normal; if a range is given then the upper value of the&#xD;
             range will be used); QTcF less than or equal to 450 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate Blood Pressure defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to the 95th percentile for age, height, and&#xD;
             gender measured as described in (Appendix IB). Adequate blood pressure can be achieved&#xD;
             using medication for treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Informed Consent: Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine&#xD;
             eligibility for this trial must only be done after obtaining written informed consent&#xD;
             from all patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is &lt;18 years old). When&#xD;
             appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions. This can be&#xD;
             accomplished through one of the following mechanisms: a) the NCI POB screening&#xD;
             protocol, b) an IRB-approved institutional screening protocol, or c) the&#xD;
             study-specific protocol. Documentation of the informed consent for screening will be&#xD;
             maintained in the patient s research chart. Studies or procedures that were performed&#xD;
             for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for&#xD;
             baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willingness to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if&#xD;
             sun exposure is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willingness to avoid the ingestion of grapefruit and Seville oranges (as well as other&#xD;
             products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) during the&#xD;
             study, as these may affect selumetinib metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of fetal and&#xD;
             teratogenic adverse events of an investigational agent. Pregnancy tests must be&#xD;
             obtained prior to enrollment for all females of childbearing potential as per&#xD;
             institutional standards (at NIH subjects 9 years and older or those showing pubertal&#xD;
             development). Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless&#xD;
             they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. Abstinence is an acceptable&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Phase I: Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first&#xD;
             three cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation&#xD;
             may affect analysis of adherence and/or make the subject inevaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of an investigational agent within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy directed at the tumor,&#xD;

             C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be excluded. Patients with HIV who have&#xD;
             adequate CD4 count, not requiring antiretroviral medication, may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to undergo MRI and/or contraindication for MRI examinations following the&#xD;
             MRI protocol. Prosthesis or orthopedic or dental braces that would interfere with&#xD;
             volumetric analysis of target PN on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic grastointestinal disease (e.g., inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior treatment with selumetinib or another specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (unless the&#xD;
             subject meets criteria for re-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of an optic glioma, malignant glioma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath&#xD;
             tumor, or other cancer requiring treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Supplementation with vitamin E greater than 100% of the daily recommended dose. Any&#xD;
             multivitamin containing vitamin E must be stopped prior to initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients not achieving adequate blood pressure in spite of antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
             for control of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Cardiac Function: a) known inherited coronary disease, b) Symptomatic heart failure&#xD;
             (NYHA Class II-IV prior or current cardiomyopathy, or severe valvular heart disease),&#xD;
             c) Prior or current cardiomyopathy, d) Sever valvular heart disease, 3) History of&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Ophthalmologic conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Current or past history of central serous retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current or past history of retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Known intraocular pression (IOP) greater than 21 mmHg (or ULN adjusted by age) or&#xD;
                  uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP); Patients with known glaucoma and&#xD;
                  increased IOP who do not have meaningful vision (light perception only or no&#xD;
                  light perception) and are not experiencing pain related to the glaucoma, may be&#xD;
                  eligible after discussion with the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects with any other significant abnormality on ophthalmic examination should&#xD;
                  be discussed with the Study Chair for potential eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Ophthalmological f ndings secondary to long-standing optic pathway glioma (such&#xD;
                  as visual loss, optic nerve pallor or strabismus) or long-standing&#xD;
                  orbito-temporal PN (such as visual loss, strabismus) will NOT be considered a&#xD;
                  significant abnormality for the purposes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known severe hypersensitivity to selumetinib or any excipient of selumetinib or&#xD;
             history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to selumetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Recent major surgery within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment,&#xD;
             with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any unresolved chronic toxicity with CTC AE grade greater than or equal to 2 from&#xD;
             anti-NF1 therapy, except for alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Clinical judgement by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. While not an exclusion criterion, unless considered clinically indicated, patients&#xD;
             should avoid taking other additional non-study medications that may interfere with the&#xD;
             study medications. In particular, patients should avoid medications that are known to&#xD;
             either induce or inhibit the activity of hepatic mircrosomal isoenzymes CYP1A2,&#xD;
             CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, as this may interfere with the metabolism of selumetinib.&#xD;
