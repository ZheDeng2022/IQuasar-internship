      Proof of concept study to compare the best corrected visual acuity obtained via First-Sight&#xD;
      lenses with the autorefraction in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncorrected refractive error is a frequent cause of visual impairment in children most&#xD;
      prevalent in rural or underserved areas in the global population. In 2006, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization released global estimates on visual impairment. According to their findings,&#xD;
      there are approximately 314 million people in the world whose vision is impaired. Of this&#xD;
      population 90% of those individuals live in developing countries and 153 million cases are&#xD;
      believed to be due to uncorrected refractive error. Children, ages five to 15 years, suffer&#xD;
      from refractive errors (mostly myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism) that can be improved to&#xD;
      normal vision. It is estimated that by 2020, approximately one third of the world's&#xD;
      population (2.5 billion) will be affected by myopia alone14. The prevalence of refractive&#xD;
      error in school-aged children is significant especially the impact on a child's life in terms&#xD;
      of education and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in Western populations have collectively shown that myopia occurs &lt;5% in children 8&#xD;
      years and younger. Sampling studies in other countries worldwide have shown that there is&#xD;
      higher prevalence of myopia among Southeast Asia children and less among Australian&#xD;
      children.1-11 Refractive error study in Eastern Nepal found 2.9% of children had vision of&#xD;
      20/40 or worse of which 56% of the 200 eyes tested was caused by refractive error due to&#xD;
      myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge is to determine the most effective and accessible method of detecting&#xD;
      refractive error and dispensing spectacles for better vision. Children who have access to&#xD;
      clinical setting typically receive prescriptive spectacles to correct refractive errors.&#xD;
      However, in underserved areas where standard eye care may be absent, children are unable to&#xD;
      receive the benefits of normal or near normal vision. The challenge is to determine the most&#xD;
      effective and accessible method of detecting refractive error and dispensing spectacles for&#xD;
      better vision&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, refractive error is corrected by prescribing spectacles or contact&#xD;
      lenses on a daily basis. Typically the patient will first undergo autorefraction, in which a&#xD;
      computer-controlled machine objectively calculates the refractive error present as a starting&#xD;
      point for the subjective refraction test. This machine, however, is cumbersome and not easily&#xD;
      transportable abroad. Typically the machine is held up to the patient's forehead and they are&#xD;
      asked to look into the machine at a distant object. While they are looking at this object the&#xD;
      machine calculates the refractive error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-Sight is a simplified way to correct refractive error. It is easily portable, making it&#xD;
      accessible to remote areas of the world. Unlike the study cited above, First-Sight can be&#xD;
      taken to remote areas where clinics are not available and patients are not able to afford to&#xD;
      pay for the clinic visit. As it is a simplified technique, local health care workers may&#xD;
      easily be able to learn how to use First-Sight and dispense spectacles to those in need.&#xD;
      Lastly, sponsors of First-Sight will provide the refracting kit and dispense custom-made&#xD;
      spectacles at no cost to health care workers and children respectively.&#xD;
