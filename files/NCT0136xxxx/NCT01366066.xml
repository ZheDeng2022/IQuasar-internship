  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in&#xD;
      pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder&#xD;
      capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMNS) in women could induce pressure increment of the external urethral&#xD;
      sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33&#xD;
      women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on&#xD;
      the overactive bladder syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence and includes 2 groups of patients with&#xD;
      30 patients in each group: Women suffering from urinary stress incontinence and women&#xD;
      suffering from urge incontinence. A medical vibrator is used and in each group the subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to vibration treatment or no vibration treatment. All patients will&#xD;
      receive pelvic floor training and all women suffering from urge incontinence will receive&#xD;
      anticholinergic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation will be performed at the perineum every day for 6 weeks with an amplitude of&#xD;
      2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. Results will be evaluated on the basis of questionnaires,&#xD;
      micturition diaries and diaper tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence&#xD;
      symptoms in the subjects the investigators asses that vibration can be a way of&#xD;
      reestablishing a normal function of the pelvic floor muscles and bladder function in&#xD;
      incontinent patients.&#xD;

    <description>A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) will be used. The stimulation works through a vibrating disc of hard plastic with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The stimulation point will be the perineum. The stimulation will be performed with a vibration amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz.&#xD;
A daily stimulation sequence consisting of 10 seconds of stimulation followed by a 10 second pause repeated 10 times will be used through 6 weeks.</description>
