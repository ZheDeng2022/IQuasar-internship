  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if Australian patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      treated with paliperidone palmitate under conditions of continuous monitoring of outcomes&#xD;
      over a 12-month period achieve relapse rates comparable to published literature.&#xD;

      This study involves the establishment of PEARL, an Australian Quality Use of Medicine&#xD;
      clinical registry designed to collect clinical and social data on up to 300 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia for a 12-month period after initiating treatment with intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injections of paliperidone palmitate as part of their routine clinical care. Continuous&#xD;
      feedback of clinical outcomes will be via regular reports to all registry sites. Enrollment&#xD;
      in PEARL should be considered only after the clinical decision to prescribe IM paliperidone&#xD;
      palmitate has already been made because the treating physician has determined that this&#xD;
      treatment is the best option for the patient. Observational Study - No investigational drug&#xD;
      administered&#xD;
