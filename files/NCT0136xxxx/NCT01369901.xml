      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited disorder that affects men. People&#xD;
      with SBMA often have weakness throughout the body, including the muscles they use for&#xD;
      swallowing, breathing, and speaking. We do not know if exercise helps or harms people with&#xD;
      SBMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To see if a 12-week program of either functional exercise or stretching exercises will&#xD;
      improve strength, function, or quality of life in people with SBMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be men 18 years of age or older who have genetic confirmation of SBMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must be able to walk at least 50 feet with or without an assistive device such as a&#xD;
           cane or a walker and stand for 10 minutes without using an assistive device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must have access to a computer with an Internet connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit to NIH (2 days), participants will have a medical history taken and&#xD;
           undergo a physical exam. They will also have blood tests and an EKG, and complete&#xD;
           questionnaires about mood, health, and exercise. Tests of muscle strength, balance, and&#xD;
           endurance will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who qualify for the study will receive instruction about either&#xD;
           strengthening or stretching exercises. They will do these exercises at home one to three&#xD;
           times a week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will wear a small activity monitor while they exercise and record their exercise in&#xD;
           a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of 12 weeks, participants will return to the NIH for 2 days. They will&#xD;
           undergo the same tests as they had on the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive follow-up phone calls and e-mails during the study and for 4&#xD;
           weeks after the last visit....&#xD;

      Objective: Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy s disease, is a slowly&#xD;
      progressive, X-linked motor neuron disease for which there is currently no treatment. It is&#xD;
      caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor that results in a polyglutamine repeat&#xD;
      expansion. The role of exercise in motor neuron disease research is debated. Although SBMA is&#xD;
      believed to be primarily a neuronopathy, the potential effect of aberrant androgen receptor&#xD;
      activity on muscle leads exercise to be of uncertain utility in this population. Our&#xD;
      objective is to examine the safety and efficacy of exercise regimens in Kennedy s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We aim to enroll 80 men with genetically confirmed Kennedy s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This will be a randomized, evaluator blinded, trial with 25 subjects in each exercise&#xD;
      arm. Following informed consent, the subjects will undergo an initial medical and physical&#xD;
      evaluations followed by a series of neurological tests and blood work over a two-day&#xD;
      outpatient visit at the NIH. The subjects will provide blood work for analysis of hormonal&#xD;
      levels and assessment of any potential muscle damage. On the second day of their visit, the&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized and taught a series of either functional or stretching exercises&#xD;
      that they will engage in as part of the study and control arms, respectively. Following the&#xD;
      baseline visit to NIH, the subjects will be monitored throughout the study with telephone&#xD;
      contacts and other measures including video recording to monitor their progress and&#xD;
      compliance. The subjects will return to the NIH at the end of a 12 week period at which time&#xD;
      the physical and laboratory testing will be repeated. After the 12 week exercise period there&#xD;
      will be a four week period where we will follow-up with the participants by telephone and&#xD;
      e-mail. At the end of the trial all of the subjects will be informed of the study results and&#xD;
      given the opportunity to learn the exercises if they are found to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure used will be the Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool&#xD;
      (AMAT). Secondary outcome measures will involve quantitative muscle analysis (QMA), the Timed&#xD;
      Up and Go (TUG) test, a quality of life measure (SF-36v2TM), adverse event questionnaires, a&#xD;
      Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) assessment of balance, accelerometer measurements of&#xD;
      exercise effort, and progressive height sit-to-stand testing. Several exploratory biomarkers&#xD;
      that may be affected by exercise will be evaluated, including insulin-like growth factor-1&#xD;
      (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, testosterone, growth hormone, and&#xD;
      creatine kinase. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) testing will also be used to determine if&#xD;
      the subjects mood is affected by exercise. Qualitative sub-study questions, international&#xD;
      index of erectile function, Block brief food questionnaire, Aggression Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Fatigue Symptom Inventory, and physical&#xD;
      activity survey measures will also be employed.&#xD;
