  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be the main risk factor for progression of&#xD;
      glaucoma and therefore the main target of therapy. Pharmacologic treatment of glaucoma has&#xD;
      changed considerably during the last decades due to the introduction of prostaglandin&#xD;
      analogues. Three of these are commonly used in North America: latanoprost (Latanoprost T,&#xD;
      Pfizer), Travoprost (Travatan TM, Alcon) and bimatoprost (Lumigan TM, Allergan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several studies to evaluate their effectiveness. The three seem to be&#xD;
      equivalent, according to the only study that has compared the molecules. Latanoprost is&#xD;
      employed initially, due to its paucity of side effects when compared to the other two&#xD;
      analogues. However, if it is not effective, several studies ahve shown that a result is&#xD;
      possible using either travoprost or bimatoprost. No study has been conducted to date&#xD;
      systematically comparing the three molecules in cases of resistance to latanoprost. In&#xD;
      actuality, the investigators patients will receive treatment identical to current practice&#xD;
      with the exception of the group continuing with latanoprost. Several studies confirm the&#xD;
      benefit of changing prostaglandin analogues if the first has not signficantly decreased the&#xD;
      IOP (Palmberg et al. 2004). Each prostaglandin has unique properties which may cause the&#xD;
      mechanism of action to vary slightly among patients. (cf. Pharmacological Aspects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is thus to evaluate the efficaciousness of latanoprost, bimatoprost and&#xD;
      travoprost in their IOP-lowering capacity in patients who do not initially respond to&#xD;
      latanoprost.&#xD;

      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effectiveness of latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost in patients whose&#xD;
      intraocular pressure does not decrease by at least 20% while undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      latanoprost ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- What is the percentage of glaucoma patients who are resistant to latanoprost ? 2- Which&#xD;
      prostaglandin is the most effective in decreasing intraocular pressure in cases of resistance&#xD;
      to latanoprost ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Project Goals :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the effectiveness of latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost in patients in&#xD;
      whom latanoprost does not decrease the intraocular pressure by at least 20%. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of the three prostaglandins will be determined by the IOP : the treatment&#xD;
      should at least effect a 20% decrease from baseline (IOP measured at time of recruitment),&#xD;
      with the ultimate aim of attaining the target IOP, which varies depending on the patient.&#xD;
      Target IOP is based on the severity of optic nerve damage as well as baseline IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the percentage of patients resistant to prostaglandins. Patients who have not&#xD;
      responded (as measured by IOP decrease) to more than 2 prostaglandins will be considered&#xD;
      resistant to this category of hypotensive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, open label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population consists of open angle glaucoma patients, or patients with ocular&#xD;
      hypertension with an IOP greater than 21 mmHg and who have never undergone treatment for&#xD;
      glaucoma. Patients must be 18 years or older, capable of giving informed consent in written&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Candidates will be selected from the patient population of the ophthalmology clinic of&#xD;
           the CHUS hotel-Dieu or from the private practice of Dr. Blondeau&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will all be treated with latanoprost for approximately 6 weeks, after which&#xD;
           only those who have not experienced at least a 20% decrease in their initial IOP and who&#xD;
           are eligible will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size - The sample size estimate is based on the need to obtain a significant decrease&#xD;
      from baseline IOP at 6 weeks, 2 months and 6 months. Estimating a maximum IOP variation of 2&#xD;
      mmHg with a standard deviation of +/- 2 mmHg, the necessary sample size to power the study&#xD;
      (90% with a p &lt; 0.05 using a paired-samples Student T test) is about 47 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of randomization and sample make-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized and comparative trial taking place over a period of 12 months.&#xD;
      Patients will be distributed by random lots of 6 (ACBCAB, etc) into 3 different groups after&#xD;
      a documented non-response (IOP decrease of less than 20%) to latanoprost. Group 1 will remain&#xD;
      on Latanoprost 0.005%, Group 2 will switch to travoprost 0.004% and Group 3 will switch to&#xD;
      bimatoprost 0.03%. The dose of each medication will be 1 drop daily HS, which is the usual&#xD;
      dose in ophthalmological practice and in the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure will be measured in the same manner for all patients by applanation&#xD;
      tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, for each study participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of IOP measurement IOP value (mmHg) At time of recruitment 6 weeks after 2 months after&#xD;
      6 months after&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Therefore, 3 groups of patients will have the same measurements taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Diagnosis of glaucoma de novo in the outpatient clinic or Dr. Blondeau's office.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Patients will be informed about the possibility of resistance to a treatment of 6&#xD;
           weeks with latanoprost, as well as to its possible benefit. The patient will receive a&#xD;
           consent form, consisting of an explanation of the study including potential side effects&#xD;
           of the medications. Patients will be able to take the time to thoroughly read the&#xD;
           document and to decide whether they wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Informed consent will be obtained by ophthalmologist Dr. Pierre Blondeau or the&#xD;
           resident in ophthalmology, Zineb Ghali, PGY IV, who will offer clarification and&#xD;
           explanation to the potential participants if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients with a diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension&#xD;
      (OH) but who have never received treatment will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Recruited patients will be treated for 6 weeks with latanoprost. This corresponds to the&#xD;
      time necessary for the molecule to block the all prostaglandin receptors, thus allowing for&#xD;
      maximum IOP-lowering potential. This period of time was determined by the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      company that created the molecule and is used by all studies involving the molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Patients who have not experienced a decrease of at least 20% of their baseline IOP and who&#xD;
      consent to participate will be distributed into 3 different groups (recruitment step). Group&#xD;
      1 patients will continue to receive latanoprost 0.005%, 1 drop daily HS. The two other groups&#xD;
      will receive either bimatoprost 0.03% or travoprost 0.004%, 1 drop daily HS. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to be treated for 4 weeks. Patients will receive instructions regarding medication&#xD;
      administration and compliance. The medication will be administered every 24 hours between&#xD;
      20:00 and 22:00. No other IOP-lowering medication will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Patients with less than 20% response to initial treatment with latanoprost will be&#xD;
      randomised into 3 groups corresponding to one of the prostaglandin analogues. IOP will be&#xD;
      remeasured after 6 weeks in order to evaluate response to the medication. We consider that a&#xD;
      documented response to treatment consists of a significant decrease in IOP as measured by the&#xD;
      t-test. If the IOP has not decreased by at least 20% after 1 month of treatment with the&#xD;
      various prostaglandins, the patient will be excluded from the study, treated with another&#xD;
      class of hypotensive agent, and receive standard follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will monitor for possible side effects and other potential problems. To this&#xD;
      effect, an auxiliary researcher (not yet recruited) as well as a resident in ophthalmology&#xD;
      (Zineb Ghali) will be available 24 hours a day to address medication side effects or&#xD;
      unexpected symptoms. If immediate follow-up is required and the patient makes contact during&#xD;
      business hours, the research team will immediately see the patient. If the patient contacts&#xD;
      the auxiliary researcher or the resident outside of business hours, he or she will be&#xD;
      immediately referred to one of the ophthalmology residents on call at the hotel Dieu hospital&#xD;
      Emergency Department. If necessary, one of the two physician researchers will be available to&#xD;
      meet with the patient in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ensures that any adverse reaction will be rapidly treated by the research team. If a&#xD;
      physician observes undesirable side effects that are attributable to the medication, he or&#xD;
      she has the duty to discontinue treatment as well as the subject's participation in the&#xD;
      study. In this case, the physician will ensure continuity of care via another form of&#xD;
      treatment in order to ensure the patient's recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal dependent variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure shall be measured with a Goldmann tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drop of fluorescein sodium and benoxinate hydrochloride, USP (0.25%/0.4%) will be instilled&#xD;
      in the patient's eyes, after which baseline IOP will be measured by Goldmann tonometry. The&#xD;
      inter-measurement variability is +/- 2mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient age: quantitative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient sex: qualitative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient race: qualitative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
           4- Results analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homogeneity of groups in terms of social demographics will be verified via one-way analysis&#xD;
      of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's correction for continuous variables and a chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Values discovered to be significant will be&#xD;
      expressed in the following format: obtained value as well as confidence interval, in order to&#xD;
      highlight the impact of the particular treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-way crossed ANOVA will be used to compare data collected during follow-up with different&#xD;
      ophthalmological exams, notably the IOP. We will calculate the impact for each period of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of individual side effects will be summarized and compared with a chi-square&#xD;
      test. Emphasis will be placed on the degree of severity of symptoms caused by the medications&#xD;
      used. The examined side effects will be those that occur most frequently and are of ocular&#xD;
      nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no interim analysis included in this research project. All statistical tests will&#xD;
      consider a p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant, i.e. all results will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant at the 5% level.&#xD;
