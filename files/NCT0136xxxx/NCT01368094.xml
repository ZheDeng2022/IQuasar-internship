      Around two thousand pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) are performed each year in France. This&#xD;
      intervention is associated with a high rate of postoperative complications including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pancreatic fistulas (PF);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgical site infections (intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of SSI (superficial and deep) is about 35% and seems influenced by the&#xD;
      prolonged intra-abdominal drainage. For several years, there has been a global trend to&#xD;
      reduce the use of abdominal drainage after abdominal surgery. Several randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown that prophylactic drainage does not decrease the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications during elective hepatectomy, colectomy, and cholecystectomy and could increase&#xD;
      the number of SSI. However, the role of prophylactic drainage after PD is so far unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective randomized multicenter study is to evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      early (4 days) versus standard (10 to 15 days, depending on the staff clinical practice)&#xD;
      drainage removal of the abdominal cavity after PD, on the rate of SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The technique of PD is left at the discretion of the operator as well&#xD;
      as the prescription of analogues of somatostatin. Drainage of the abdominal cavity is made of&#xD;
      one or two round silicone close suction drains or open multichannel silicone drains placed in&#xD;
      the vicinity of the pancreatic and biliary anastomosis. Shall be excluded patients operated&#xD;
      on for chronic pancreatitis and patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy. The 3rd&#xD;
      postoperative day, a fistula is sought clinically, biologically and on CT-scanner images. In&#xD;
      case of pancreatic fistula, the patient is excluded from randomization and drainage of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity is left in place depending on the different teams' practice. Patients&#xD;
      without fistula are randomized to either drainage removal 4 days after surgery (D4) or&#xD;
      standard drainage.&#xD;

      Introduction. Two thousand pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) are performed per year in France&#xD;
      (observatory pancreatectomy GCB 2005). This intervention is associated with a high rate of&#xD;
      postoperative complications including pancreatic fistula (PF), the site infections (SSI:&#xD;
      intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection), gastroparesis, and hemorrhage. The incidence of&#xD;
      SSI (superficial and deep) is about 35% and seems influenced by the prolonged drainage of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal. For several years, there is a global trend to reduce the use of abdominal&#xD;
      drainage after abdominal surgery. Several randomized clinical trials have shown that&#xD;
      prophylactic drainage does not decrease the incidence of postoperative complications during&#xD;
      elective hepatectomy, colectomy, and cholecystectomy and could increase the number of SSI.&#xD;
      However, the role of prophylactic drainage after PD is so far unclear. In the literature,&#xD;
      three studies have examined the influence of drainage of the abdominal cavity after PD, and&#xD;
      were published at the time this protocol was submitted :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of Conlon et al. (Ann Surg 2001), prospective randomized study comparing no&#xD;
           drainage standard abdominal drainage. The SSI rates in the drained group was 36% versus&#xD;
           16% in the undrained group (NS, but in his critical study methodology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of Kawai et al. (Ann Surg 2006), non-randomized prospective study comparing&#xD;
           short drainage (D4) drainage standard (D8). The SSI rates in the drained group was 38%&#xD;
           versus 7.7% in the undrained group (significant but non-randomized study involving&#xD;
           patients on two consecutive periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Berberat et al. (Büchler) (J Gastrointest Surg 2007), retrospective analysis of a&#xD;
           population of patients with a PD (80%) the results by intention to treat the early&#xD;
           removal of drainage of the abdominal cavity. The SSI rates published in this study is&#xD;
           9.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acceptance of this protocol by local ethics committee, a forth study was published by&#xD;
      Bassi et al (Bassi C Ann Surg 2010) : it is a randomized controlled study. Patients who&#xD;
      underwent pancreatic resection (including left pancreatic resection) and at low risk of&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula were randomized on post operative day (POD) 3 to receive&#xD;
      either early (POD 3) or standard drain removal (POD 5 or beyond). The primary end point of&#xD;
      the study was the incidence of pancreatic fistula. This study shows that, in patients with a&#xD;
      low risk of pancreatic fistula after pancreatic resection, intra-abdominal drains can be&#xD;
      safely removed on POD 3 after standard pancreatic resections. A prolonged period of drain&#xD;
      insertion is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications with increased&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present prospective randomized multicenter study is to evaluate the influence&#xD;
      of short drainage (4 days) of the abdominal cavity versus standard drainage (10 to 15 days,&#xD;
      depending on the staff clinical practice) after PD on the rate of SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The technique of PD is left at the discretion of the operator as well&#xD;
      as the prescription of analogues of somatostatin. Drainage of the abdominal cavity is made of&#xD;
      one or two round silicone close suction drains or open multichannel silicone drains placed in&#xD;
      the vicinity of the pancreatic and biliary anastomosis. Shall be excluded patients operated&#xD;
      on for chronic pancreatitis and patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy. The 3rd&#xD;
      postoperative day, a pancreatic fistula is sought clinically, biologically and on CT-scanner&#xD;
      images. In case of pancreatic fistula, the patient is excluded from randomization and&#xD;
      drainage of the abdominal cavity is left in place depending on the different teams' practice.&#xD;
      Patients without fistula are randomized to either drainage removal 4 days after surgery (D4)&#xD;
      or standard drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and outcomes: The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of surgical site infection&#xD;
      (SSI) at D30, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surface SSI (wound abscess): infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue or muscle, above&#xD;
           the fascia, located at a surgical incision. The diagnosis is based on at least one of&#xD;
           the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The fluid from the wound or drain located above the fascia is purulent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A spontaneous dehiscence of the wound&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A positive culture from a closed wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  deep SSI (intra-abdominal abscess) infection in operated tissues or in site of&#xD;
           intervention (under the fascia). The diagnosis is based on at least one of the following&#xD;
           criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The fluid from a drain positioned beneath the fascia is purulent;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A culture from a closed wound is positive;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other signs of infection on direct examination found during a re-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, with&#xD;
      emphasis on classification IIIa (radiological drainage) and IIIb (re-intervention) of Clavien&#xD;
      (Dindo et al. Ann Surg 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who underwent PD during the study period, especially patients excluded before&#xD;
      randomization will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating the number of patients needed to reduce SSI rate from 30% (in the group standard&#xD;
      drainage of the abdominal cavity) to 10% (in the short drainage group), with a risk alpha of&#xD;
      0.05 and a risk beta of 0.20 yields 124 patients. Taking into account 10% of patients not&#xD;
      analyzable, the number of patients included in this study is 138 (69 patients in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five university hospitals are participating in the study (Amiens, Lille, Caen, and Rouen) and&#xD;
      one general hospital (CH Beauvais). The expected duration of the study is 24 months (12-14&#xD;
      patients per center per year).&#xD;
