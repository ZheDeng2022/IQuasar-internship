    <textblock>
      The trial objectives are to compare efficacy relative to pain, along the route of the vein&#xD;
      following echoguided endovenous injection of sclerotherapeutic foam into the Great Saphenous&#xD;
      vein, of class III microfibre compression (centred at 25 mm Hg) versus class I (10-15 mm Hg)&#xD;
      versus class III cotton compression (20 to 36 mm Hg) over 21 days. The main contrast will be&#xD;
      the comparison between the first two groups mentioned. All other contrasts will be secondary.&#xD;
      The &quot;Class I compression&quot; versus &quot;The two class III compressions&quot; contrast will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured by totalling the VAS scores for maximum pain experienced since the&#xD;
      morning and evaluated by the patient at the end of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of analgesics or the number of days of analgesic treatment necessary for the 3&#xD;
      compression types used will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the trial objectives is also to show that regular use of a class III compression&#xD;
      product leads to a reduction in complications following sclerosis (by reducing the number of&#xD;
      non-serious/serious complications specific to sclerosis: matting, pigmentation, inflammation,&#xD;
      development of sclerosis requiring drainage, DVT, pulmonary embolism, etc.). The trial also&#xD;
      aims to compare the rate of successful sclerosis between the three devices, success being&#xD;
      defined by complete or partial occlusion of the great saphenous vein, leading to the&#xD;
      disappearance of reflux at the crural level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other secondary objectives will be patient evaluation of comfort, ease of putting on and&#xD;
      taking off the compression hose and a global appreciation of the procedure for echoguided&#xD;
      endovenous injection of sclerotherapeutic foam into the great saphenous vein, followed by&#xD;
      wearing compression hose.&#xD;
