    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. Lung adenocarcinomas is the&#xD;
      most common type, accounting for 70% of lung cancer and the molecular target of epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation at exons 18 - 21 is present in about 50% of lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas. The v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) mutations&#xD;
      are commonly present in the other 50% that are EGFR wildtype. EGFR and K-ras mutations are&#xD;
      found to be mutually exclusive in the same tumor. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) can be&#xD;
      used as treatment for EGFR mutated tumors while no specific targeted therapy can be&#xD;
      recommended for EGFR wildtype tumors and these patients often receive chemoirradiation, which&#xD;
      is toxic and clinical response is suboptimal. There is a need to find alternative molecular&#xD;
      pathways/targets in EGFR wildtype lung adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even with EGFR mutations, good clinical response to EGFR-TKI is achieved in about 70% of&#xD;
      these patients. This would mean suboptimal targeting of the EGFR gene or the presence of&#xD;
      alternative pathways mediating tumor progression and susceptibility to therapy. Exploration&#xD;
      of molecular pathways in lung cancer may allow for discovery of new molecular targets for&#xD;
      therapeutic development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophil infiltration is frequently observed in lung cancer. Recognized similarities&#xD;
      between neutrophils and cancer cells include (i) ability to circulate as single cells; (ii)&#xD;
      target attachment via vascular system; (iii) target invasion. The major difference is that&#xD;
      migrated neutrophils will undergo apoptosis while cancer cells can escape apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to the postulation that neutrophils and cancer cells may share similar inflammatory&#xD;
      cascades by secreting a similar panel of proteases, and one of these could be neutrophil&#xD;
      elastase (NE). Animal studies demonstrated that NE from neutrophils moves into lung tumor&#xD;
      cells and mediates lung tumor growth via degradation of Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1),&#xD;
      leading to activation of intracellular phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3k) and the v-akt murine&#xD;
      thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) signaling pathways and the intracellular tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to demonstrate NE activities and the subsequent signaling cascades&#xD;
      activated in lung cancer cells, and to verify NE and its related pathway activation in&#xD;
      clinical lung cancer specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will conclude the roles of NE and the therapeutic potential of NE/IRS-1/PI3K/PDGFR&#xD;
      pathways in EGFR wildtype lung adenocarinomas.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the presence of NE in vitro and the entrance into lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the intracellular mechanisms through which NE mediates its tumor&#xD;
           proliferating effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To verify the activation of NE and its related pathway component in clinical lung&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background of research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Cancer in Hong Kong Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Hong Kong [1].&#xD;
      Surgical resection for early stage lung cancer is the only curative option and advanced stage&#xD;
      lung cancer is treated with chemoirradiation or molecular targeted agents, one of which is&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor - Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Recent advances in&#xD;
      molecular biology of lung cancer allowed for development of these targeted therapy. However,&#xD;
      treatment response depends on the presence of activating EGFR gene mutation, and the median&#xD;
      response period is usually maintained for nine to twelve months, after which the tumor&#xD;
      usually become non-responsive or resistant to EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR mutation vs EGFR wildtype lung adenocarcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Asian populations including Hong Kong, EGFR mutations at exons 18 - 21 are present in up&#xD;
      to 50% of lung adenocarcinomas, while the other 50% are EGFR wild type lung adenocarcinomas&#xD;
      and are usually bearing K-ras gene mutations [2]. Even with the presence of activating EGFR&#xD;
      gene mutations at exons 18 - 21, clinical response was observed in only 70% of patients with&#xD;
      tumors bearing EGFR mutations [3]. It is apparent that in a cohort of lung adenocarcinomas,&#xD;
      there can be the following groupings according to their EGFR gene mutation status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinomas (~50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. with response to TKI treatment (~35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. but unresponsive to TKI treatment (~15%) (ii) EGFR wildtype lung adenocarcinomas (~50%)&#xD;
           The presence of group (i)(b) tumors with EGFR but failed response to treatment would&#xD;
           mean suboptimal targeting of EGFR and the presence of group (ii) EGFR wildtype tumors&#xD;
           would imply alternative pathways mediating tumor progression and susceptibility to tumor&#xD;
           therapy in lung cancer. Exploration of molecular pathways in lung adenocarcinomas may&#xD;
           allow for discovery of new molecular targets for therapeutic development in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils vs cancer cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophil infiltration, and hence inflammatory infiltrate, is a frequently observed in lung&#xD;
      cancer [4]. Recognized similarities between neutrophils and cancer cells include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ability to circulate as single cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. target attachment via vascular system&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. target invasion Neutrophils achieve migration through pulmonary epithelial layers by&#xD;
           secreting NE, which is readily balanced by the local action of secretory leukocyte&#xD;
           peptidase inhibitor (SLPI). SLPI has also been detected in cancer tissues but the&#xD;
           relevant function role in lung cancer has not been defined yet [5]. The major difference&#xD;
           between neutrophils and cancer cells lies in the fact that migrated neutrophils will&#xD;
           undergo apoptosis while cancer cells can escape apoptosis and are able to proliferate in&#xD;
           target organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible roles of NE in lung cancer This has led to the speculation that neutrophils and&#xD;
      cancer cells may share similar inflammatory cascades by secreting a similar panel of&#xD;
      proteases, and one of these had been demonstrated to be neutrophil elastase (NE). The action&#xD;
      of NE may happen at different cellular levels: (1) action on extracellular matrix to&#xD;
      facilitate migration and tissue invasion; (2) action on cell surface signaling receptors; or&#xD;
      (3) intracellular action on signaling pathways following uptake into signaling endosomes.&#xD;
      There are recent evidence in animal studies that NE secreted by neutrophils actually moved&#xD;
      into lung tumor cells and mediates lung tumor growth via degradation of Insulin receptor&#xD;
      substrate-1 (IRS-1) and subsequent effects on the intracellular PI3K signaling pathways&#xD;
      acting on the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (PDGFR)[6]. It is possible that neutrophils infiltrating lung tumor stromal tissues&#xD;
      may be acting in collaboration with cancer cells via the direct and indirect actions of NE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work done by others Immunoreactive NE, both in free and in complex forms, can be demonstrated&#xD;
      in breast cancer cell lines [7] and lung cancer cell lines [8]. NE activities has been&#xD;
      further demonstrated in human breast cancer tissues [9] but not in human lung cancer tissues&#xD;
      or normal lung tissues. These showed that NE is present at the tissue level but their&#xD;
      intracellular action, whether enzymatically active or signaling active, has not been&#xD;
      delineated clearly yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer tissues, the higher the amount of extracted tissue NE, the worse was the&#xD;
      prognosis [9] and similar prognostic significance was suggested for NE in non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When lung cancer cells were inoculated into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice,&#xD;
      concomitant administration of NE inhibitor, ONO-5046, will completely suppressed tumor growth&#xD;
      and appearance of metastatic foci [11]. The exact mechanism of action of ONO-5046 remains to&#xD;
      be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE has also been shown to cleave cell surface epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming&#xD;
      growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) [12, 13]. This may send aberrant signals to tumor cells EGF&#xD;
      receptors and promote cancer cell proliferation in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGF-α also induced NE expression in human cancer cell lines (breast and pancreas)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were recent works by Houghton et al [6] demonstrating NE could influence lung cancer&#xD;
      growth and development by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. permeating into lung tumor cells (A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line with Kras mutation)&#xD;
           and, via degradation of IRS-1, mediating tumor cell progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. being blocked by specific inhibitors (ONO-5046), leading to aberrant intracellular&#xD;
           signaling and then tumor cell growth arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work done by our groups NE in airway inflammation Our group had done work related to the&#xD;
      roles of NE in airway inflammation and diseases and we have raised cancer and normal&#xD;
      bronchial bronchial epithelial cell lines from local patients that would be appropriate&#xD;
      models for testing the hypothesis in local patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syndecan-1 was found to be able to bind NE in sputum sol of bronchiectasis, supporting the&#xD;
      role of NE complexed with syndecan-1 in balance with antielastase [14]. We have also&#xD;
      demonstrated shed syndecan-1 from human lymphoid cell line was able to bind to NE, disturbing&#xD;
      the NE and anti-elastase balance in the airway environment, and thus could be playing a role&#xD;
      in airway inflammation [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have tried to unopposed NE in the airway fluids in a cigarette smoke-induced model of COPD&#xD;
      in rats. Sulfated maltoheptaose to chelate NE was administered to rats and bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected 3 days after administration that showed&#xD;
      significant declines in NE activity and myeloperoxidase activity as compared to BALF of&#xD;
      smoking rats not treated. Significant reduction in neutrophil accumulation was also observed&#xD;
      in BALF and lung tissue sections. Airspace enlargement was significantly reduced following&#xD;
      the treatment. All these results suggested that sulfated maltohepatose is a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic against neutrophilic inflammation in the airways of patients with COPD.&#xD;
      (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have also tested the NE activity of a lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and found that&#xD;
      radio-labelled cells migrate into lung cancer cells and is enzymatically inactive&#xD;
      (unpublished data) Lung cancer cell lines and normal bronchial epithelial cells and clinical&#xD;
      lung cancer tissue bank&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently established primary lung cancer and normal bronchial epithelial cell lines&#xD;
      from local Chinese patients and they were characterized with in vitro growth kinetics,&#xD;
      morphological and immunohistochemical studies and gene expression profiling [16]. At the&#xD;
      moment, we have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Four primary lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (HKULC 1 - 4) published [16] and six more&#xD;
           newly established in various phase of characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two new normal bronchial epithelial cell lines immortalized with standard protocols with&#xD;
           cdk4 and hTert infections [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new cell lines were all derived from clinical specimen from the local Hong Kong Chinese&#xD;
      patients and more are becoming established with continued accrual of clinical collection. The&#xD;
      clinical data of the patients, including gender and smoking history, from which these primary&#xD;
      lung adenocarcinoma cell lines originated were known. Together with 10 other ATCC lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma cell lines and established normal bronchial epithelial lines (HBEC-KT 1 - 5)&#xD;
      from John Minna MD, Tx, USA, these cell lines will provide invaluable materials to test for&#xD;
      in vivo effects of NE on cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the collaboration of Queen Mary Hospital Cardiothoracic Surgical Department, we have&#xD;
      also collected 40 pairs of resected lung adenocarcinomas and normal lung tissues that will&#xD;
      allow for verification of in vitro findings in clinical specimens. Further collection accrual&#xD;
      of clinical specimens is in progress&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions to be addressed (Figure 1) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the roles of NE in lung adenocarcinoma proliferation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How are such roles of NE mediated at the intracellular signaling level? Is&#xD;
           IRS-1/PI3K/PDGFR the most common axis involved in cancer cells? Or there will be&#xD;
           'cross-talk' with pathways such as EGFR or TNF-α in lung adenocarcinoma proliferation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can we verify such roles of NE in cancer proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           tissues?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the mode of entrance and site of action of labeled NE in lung&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the activation of IRS-1/PI3K/PDGFR in lung adenocarcinoma cells after&#xD;
           penetrance by NE and if there will be concurrent activation of other signaling pathways&#xD;
           including the EGFR and TNF-α pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the effects of blocking NE with specific NE inhibitors on lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           cell proliferation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To verify the above mechanisms of actions of NE in clinical lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EGFR mutation profiling of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and resected lung&#xD;
           adenocarcinomas Genomic DNA will be extracted from available lung adenocarcinoma cell&#xD;
           lines (20 specimens) as well as microdissected surgical lung adenocarcinoma specimens.&#xD;
           Exons 18 - 21 will be PCR-amplified and directly sequenced to read for EGFR mutation in&#xD;
           exons 18 - 21. This will characterize available lung adenocarcinomas cell lines and&#xD;
           clinical tumor specimens with respect to EGFR gene mutation or EGFR wildtype for&#xD;
           subsequent work, where experimental results will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For aim (1) - (3), the mode of entrance and site of action of NE in lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           cells will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Live cell imaging Live cell imaging technique with Alex-Flour-488-labelled NE will be&#xD;
           employed to localize and follow the path of NE entrance into lung adenocarcinoma cells.&#xD;
           Eglin C, a proteolytic inhibitor, will be applied at the same time. Normal bronchial&#xD;
           epithelial cell lines will be used for comparison. The intracellular location of&#xD;
           entrance and possible activated structural changes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NE-specific reverse transcription PCR cDNA amplified from total RNA will be amplified&#xD;
           using RT-PCR with specific primers 5'-GAG GCA ATT CCG TGG ATT AG-3' and 5' ACG ACA TCG&#xD;
           TGA TTC TCC AG-3' Western blotting NE-stimulated cells from (1) above will have proteins&#xD;
           extracted by standard methods followed by immunoblotting with specific monoclonal&#xD;
           antibodies to study related signaling pathways including pAkt, Akt, p85, IRS-1, IRS-2,&#xD;
           PDGF, PDGF-α, pPDGF-α, p44/42 MAPK, phosphor-p44/42 MAPK as well as pEGFR and TNF-α.&#xD;
           Anti-β-actin will be used as endogenous control. Reaction to individual markers will be&#xD;
           done in triplicates Cell growth assay The effect of ONO-5046, a specific NE inhibitor,&#xD;
           on cell growth and proliferation will be studied on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines&#xD;
           compared to control (no drug administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For aims (4), we would like to study the activation of relevant signaling pathways upon&#xD;
           NE stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical staining will be performed on clinical&#xD;
                lung adenocarcinoma specimens with specific monoclonal antibodies against NE, PDGF,&#xD;
                PDGFR, IRS-1 and EGFR. Concordance of staining pattern will be examined between&#xD;
                IRS-1 and EGFR or PDGF respectively. The proportion of discordant cases will be&#xD;
                compared with the proportion of concordant cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. NE assay in clinical lung cancer specimens from human subjects Clinical lung cancer&#xD;
                specimens will be collected from patients with lung adenocarcinomas and NE&#xD;
                activities assayed.&#xD;
