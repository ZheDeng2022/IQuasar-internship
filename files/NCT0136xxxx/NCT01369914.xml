      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is used to treat some kinds of cancer, blood cell&#xD;
           disorders, and immune disorders. Stem cells from a donor s blood are used to replace the&#xD;
           recipient s stem cells in the bone marrow. The recipient s bone marrow can then produce&#xD;
           new blood cells. Some of these new cells involved in the immune system are like the&#xD;
           donor s cells. Sometimes immune cells from the SCT attack the recipient s normal&#xD;
           tissues, including the eyes. This type of immune attack is called graft-versus-host&#xD;
           disease, or GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The symptoms of ocular GVHD include eye pain, irritation, dryness, and inflammation.&#xD;
           When it is severe and if it does not respond well to treatment, ocular GVHD may also&#xD;
           cause vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the eyes in people who have had&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must be taking part in a study at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or the&#xD;
           National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They must have a SCT scheduled within the next 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study lasts for 1 year and includes six visits to the National Eye Institute. (There&#xD;
           is an optional visit about 1 month before your SCT.) When possible, visits for this&#xD;
           study will be scheduled so that they can be done on the same day as your visits for the&#xD;
           NCI or NHLBI protocol that you are taking part in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will have a medical exam and an eye history will be taken.&#xD;
           They will have an eye exam and a test to measure the ability to make tears. Those in the&#xD;
           study will also have tear fluid collected for analysis in a lab. Tear fluid collection&#xD;
           is a painless process. Blood will be drawn during certain visits if it has not already&#xD;
           been collected by the transplant team.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are to study the development of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)&#xD;
      in participants treated with stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the NIH, including exam&#xD;
      findings prior to SCT, changes in ocular signs and symptoms following SCT and response to&#xD;
      standard therapy in participants identified with dry eye and ocular GVHD; to develop clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures for early onset and more advanced ocular GVHD and provide estimates of&#xD;
      progression rates for these outcomes; to analyze tear fluid, impression cytology (IC) and&#xD;
      serum samples from participants undergoing SCT, to identify biomarkers or other findings&#xD;
      which may predict the onset of ocular GVHD or correlate with disease progression or response&#xD;
      to therapy and to establish a cohort of participants with ocular GVHD in anticipation of&#xD;
      future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 adult participants undergoing SCT at the NIH, and up to 50 healthy adult&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, natural history study will follow participants through 12 months post-SC,&#xD;
      with the option to extend follow-up for up to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective outcome variable is ocular surface staining using fluorescein and&#xD;
      lissamine green dyes, as measured by the Oxford criteria, with the scale ranging from 0 to 15&#xD;
      in each eye. The primary subjective outcome measure is the Ocular Surface Disease Index&#xD;
      (OSDI), ranging from 0 to 100. Secondary outcome variables include best-corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCVA), tear film osmolarity, Schirmer s tear testing with anesthesia, meibomian gland&#xD;
      function and tear break-up time. In addition, tear fluid biomarkers and/or IC will be studied&#xD;
      as secondary outcome variables to determine whether changes in biomarker levels (tear fluid)&#xD;
      or cell densities and morphologies (IC) correlate with the development or progression of&#xD;
      ocular GVHD.&#xD;
