  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was initially designed for pediatric subjects who had completed a previous BRV&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With protocol amendment 4, enrollment for &quot;directly enrolled&quot; subjects was modified from 'up&#xD;
      to' an additional 100 subjects to &quot;at least&quot; 100 subjects, keeping the planned total&#xD;
      enrollment of approximately 600 subjects to allow flexibility in the number of patients&#xD;
      reaching 1 year of exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With protocol amendment 5, entry criteria for subjects coming for other pediatric core&#xD;
      studies in development were included. Additional clarity was provided for subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in N01266 that temporary roll over to one of those studies and resume participation in&#xD;
      N01266.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With protocol amendment 6, central EEG reading and entry visit EEG were removed. Some&#xD;
      clarifications on study assessments (questionnaires, EEGs) was provided and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were aligned from an earlier local amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With protocol amendment 7, the pregnancy section was updated to clarify that Pregnancy Report&#xD;
      and Outcome Form has to be completed in all pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With protocol amendment 8, re-categorization of study variables in compliance with reporting&#xD;
      registries was performed. Modifications due to COVID19 pandemic were implemented and&#xD;
      clarification provided that participants may transition to another BRV study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of BRV during long-term exposure.&#xD;

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>The max BRV dose will be 5.0 mg/kg/day, not to exceed a dose of 200 mg/day for subjects with body weight &gt;40kg. Subjects may receive oral solution or oral tablets. The LTFU subjects will start dosing in N01266 on the individualized BRV dose they were receiving at the completion of the core study. Subjects must be able to tolerate the min BRV dose specified in the core study to be eligible for entry into the Evaluation Period of N01266. Dose can be adjusted as considered necessary by the Investigator and required by the subject's medical condition. All subjects who prematurely discontinue the study should complete an EDV and have their BRV dose down titrated by a maximum of half the dose every week for a maximum of 4 weeks until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (50 mg/day for subjects with body weights &gt;50kg) is reached.</description>

&#xD;
        Long Term Follow-up Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Male or female subjects having participated in a core study with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
        epilepsy and for whom a reasonable benefit from long-term administration of BRV is expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        Directly Enrolled Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a male or female ≥4 years to &lt;17 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of partial-onset seizures (POS) according to the&#xD;
             International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an EEG compatible with the clinical diagnosis of POS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been observed to have uncontrolled POS after an adequate course of&#xD;
             treatment (in the opinion of the Investigator) with at least 1 antiepileptic drug&#xD;
             (AED; concurrently or sequentially)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had at least 1 seizure (POS) during the 3 weeks before the Screening Visit&#xD;
             (ScrV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is taking at least 1 AED. All AEDs need to be at a stable dose for at least 7&#xD;
             days before the ScrV. Vagal nerve stimulator stable for at least 2 weeks before the&#xD;
             ScrV is allowed and will be counted as a concomitant AED. Benzodiazepines taken more&#xD;
             than once a week (for any indication) will be considered as a concomitant AED&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a pregnant or nursing female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has severe medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorders or laboratory&#xD;
             values, which may have an impact on the safety of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has planned participation in any clinical study of another investigational&#xD;
             drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),&#xD;
             or &gt;1.0xULN total bilirubin (≥1.5xULN total bilirubin if known Gilbert's syndrome). If&#xD;
             subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are &gt;ULN and &lt;1.5xULN, fractionate&#xD;
             bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%). N01349 subjects with a total bilirubin &gt; ULN may be considered for the study if&#xD;
             benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is suspected in the context of prolonged&#xD;
             neonatal jaundice, after discussion with the medical monitor. For randomized subjects&#xD;
             with a baseline result &gt;ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin, a baseline&#xD;
             diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful elevation must be understood&#xD;
             and recorded in the eCRF. If subject has &gt;ULN ALT, AST, or ALP that does not meet the&#xD;
             exclusion limit at the baseline referenced in Table 5-1 for LTFU subjects and at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit for directly enrolled subjects, repeat the tests, if possible, prior&#xD;
             to dosing to ensure there is no further ongoing clinically relevant increase. In case&#xD;
             of a clinically relevant increase, inclusion of the subject must be discussed with the&#xD;
             Medical Monitor. Tests that result in ALT, AST, or ALP up to 25% above the exclusion&#xD;
             limit may be repeated once for confirmation. This includes re-screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Long Term Follow-up Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;

             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at the EV. If a subject has active&#xD;
             suicidal ideation without a specific plan as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;)&#xD;
             to Question 4 of Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C SSRS) at the EV, the&#xD;
             subject should be referred immediately to a Mental Healthcare Professional and may be&#xD;
             excluded from the study based upon the Investigator's judgment of benefit/risk of&#xD;
             continuing the subject in the study/on study medication.&#xD;
