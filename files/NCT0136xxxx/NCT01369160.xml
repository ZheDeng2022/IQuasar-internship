      The research proposed is a pilot study of pediatric and adolescent/young adult patients who&#xD;
      have received the curative intervention (MSD-SCT), disease-modifying interventions (HU or CT)&#xD;
      or SCC (control), with respect to three clinically important outcomes: quality-of-life (QOL),&#xD;
      neurocognitive function, and reproductive potential. Comparable cohorts will be identified&#xD;
      for each of the groups, drawing from patients treated by the SCD program of Children's&#xD;
      Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA). QOL measures and neuropsychiatric testing and will be&#xD;
      administered. Reproductive endocrine function markers (laboratory studies and pubertal&#xD;
      staging), will be collected and analyzed. A tracking system of such patients will also be&#xD;
      developed, gathering available retrospective data and setting up a mechanism for collection&#xD;
      of new data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      sickle cell disease (SCD), but a significant proportion experience clinically severe disease&#xD;
      requiring more aggressive intervention. Widely applicable curative therapy with a favorable&#xD;
      toxicity profile remains elusive for such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three distinct intervention strategies are currently available for children with severe&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD): oral hydroxyurea (HU), chronic blood transfusions (CT), and&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) from an HLA-matched sibling donor&#xD;
      (MSD). Each intervention has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Many patients do not&#xD;
      receive specific intervention, and continue standard comprehensive care (SCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though indications for these therapies overlap, to date there are no comparative outcomes&#xD;
      data, leaving families and physicians without adequate information upon which to base&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions. The gold standard for obtaining such data would be a randomized,&#xD;
      prospective study comparing each intervention, though this may or may not be feasible to&#xD;
      conduct. Before such a trial is considered, a large cross-sectional trial should be conducted&#xD;
      to establish comparisons among the four therapeutic groups (HU, SCT, CT, SCC) with respect to&#xD;
      the outcomes that clinicians and families deem most important.&#xD;
