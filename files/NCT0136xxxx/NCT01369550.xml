  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether the omega-3 fatty acid stearidonic&#xD;
      acid (SDA), when used as a food ingredient, increases the level of the long-chain omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in red blood cell (RBC) membranes in men and women.&#xD;

             requirements as judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history and routine&#xD;
             laboratory test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is willing to avoid alcohol consumption for 24 h prior to every clinic visit.&#xD;

             pattern except for use of the study products, as directed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health&#xD;
             information to the study Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has coronary heart disease or a coronary heart disease risk equivalent&#xD;
             including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Diabetes mellitus (or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL at visit 1, week -2);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical signs of atherosclerosis including peripheral arterial disease,&#xD;
                  abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery disease [symptomatic (e.g., transient&#xD;
                  ischemic attack or stroke of carotid origin) or &gt;50% stenosis on angiography or&#xD;
                  ultrasound] or other forms of clinical atherosclerotic disease (e.g., renal&#xD;
                  artery disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Presence of multiple risk factors that give a person a greater than 20% chance&#xD;
                  for developing coronary artery disease within 10 years. This will be determined&#xD;
                  by the Framingham risk index calculated at visit 1, week -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Abnormal laboratory test results of clinical significance, including, but not limited&#xD;
             to creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL and ALT or AST ≥1.5X the upper limit of normal at visit 1,&#xD;
             week -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. TG ≥400 mg/dL at visit 1, week -2.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history or presence of clinically important renal, hepatic, pulmonary,&#xD;
             biliary, gastrointestinal, neurologic or endocrine disorders that in the judgment of&#xD;
             the Investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to provide informed&#xD;
             consent, comply with the study protocol (which might confound the interpretation of&#xD;
             the study results), or put the subject at undue risk. Stable, treated hypothyroidism&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure ≥100 mm Hg as defined by the average blood pressure measured at visit 1, week&#xD;
             -2). One re-test will be allowed on a separate day prior to visit 2, week 0 for&#xD;
             subjects whose blood pressure exceeds either of these cut points at visit 1, week -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unstable use (initiation or change in dose) within four weeks of visit 1 (week -2;&#xD;
             Appendix 1) of antihypertensive medications or thyroid hormone replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any lipid-altering drugs, including statins, bile acid sequestrants,&#xD;
             cholesterol absorption inhibitors, fibrates, or prescription formulations of niacin&#xD;
             within four weeks of visit 1 (week -2) and throughout the study. If a subject needs to&#xD;
             wash off of a drug, he/she will be consented and then asked to return after the four&#xD;
             week washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of EPA/DHA from a drug or supplement within four months of visit 1, week -2 and&#xD;
             throughout the study period. If subject has used &gt;1.0 g/d of EPA, DHA, or combination&#xD;
             of EPA and DHA from a drug or supplement, use must have been discontinued at least six&#xD;
             months prior to the visit 1, week -2 blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Frequent use (more than twice per month) of any non-study-related EPA/DHA containing&#xD;
             enriched foods (such as DHA-enriched eggs) within four months of visit 1, week -2 and&#xD;
             avoidance of these enriched foods throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of ALA-containing seeds and oils (i.e., flaxseed, perilla seed, hemp, spirulina,&#xD;
             walnut, mustard seed or black currant oil) for more than one week duration within four&#xD;
             weeks of visit 1, week -2 and throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Consumption of fatty fish (salmon, herring, mackerel, albacore tuna, or sardines) more&#xD;
             than twice per month within four months of visit 1, week -2. Unwillingness to avoid&#xD;
             all fish, except shellfish and crustaceans, throughout the study period (Appendix 6.&#xD;
             Note: it is recognized that many fish are not significant sources of omega-3 fatty&#xD;
             acids; however, these foods are restricted to simplify the dietary advice in this&#xD;
             low-dose SDA study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of any dietary supplement known to alter lipid metabolism, including but not&#xD;
             limited to: dietary fiber supplements, red rice yeast supplements, garlic supplements,&#xD;
             soy isoflavone supplements, sterol/stanol products, policosanols, niacin or its&#xD;
             analogues at doses &gt;50 mg/d, or others at the discretion of the Investigator within&#xD;
             the four weeks prior to visit 1, week -2 or during the study. If a subject needs to&#xD;
             discontinue a lipid-altering supplement(s), he/she will washout for four weeks prior&#xD;
             to the screening visit procedures (visit 1, week -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of any weight-loss medication (prescription or over-the counter) including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, lipase inhibitors [orlistat (alli™)], within four weeks prior to visit&#xD;
             1, week -2 and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use of any weight loss supplement or program within four weeks of visit 1, week -2 and&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known allergy or sensitivity to study products or any ingredients of the study&#xD;
             products (study products may contain milk, soy or wheat).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has a history or presence of cancer in the prior two years, except for&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Females who are pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study period, lactating,&#xD;
             or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to commit to the use of a&#xD;
             medically approved form of contraception throughout the study period. The method of&#xD;
             contraception must be recorded in the source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Current or recent history of (within 12 months of visit 1, week -2) or strong&#xD;
             potential for alcohol or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse will be defined as &gt;14 drinks&#xD;
             per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1 ½ oz distilled spirits).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Exposure to any non-registered drug product within 30 days prior to the screening&#xD;
             visit (visit 1, week -2).&#xD;
