  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) can be understood as a form&#xD;
      of dysregulated learning and are influenced by classical conditioning. This is based on&#xD;
      numerous studies indicating that conditioned contextual cues influence craving for alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. As a result, there has been considerable interest in extinction-based treatments&#xD;
      for AUDs (i.e., treatments that focus on extinguishing the associations between alcohol cues&#xD;
      and motivation to drink), referred to as cue exposure treatment To date, extinction-based&#xD;
      treatment for AUDs has resulted in disappointing outcomes in clinical trials and there is&#xD;
      considerable interest in improving this form of treatment. One novel strategy is the use of&#xD;
      pharmacological adjuncts to enhance extinction. Medications that maximize extinction may&#xD;
      minimize subsequent reactions to alcohol cues and, in turn, subsequent clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      This study is examining whether the medication d-cycloserine (DCS) can enhance extinction to&#xD;
      alcohol cues. Recent basic research has revealed that DCS enhances extinction to fear cues&#xD;
      and several lines of evidence suggest that DCS may also enhance extinction to alcohol cues.&#xD;
      Therefore, DCS may serve as a useful pharmacological adjunct to extinction-based treatment&#xD;
      for AUDs. Our primary aim is to examine whether, compared to placebo, DCS (50 mg) will&#xD;
      enhance extinction to alcohol cues under controlled laboratory conditions in&#xD;
      treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol use disorders. We hypothesize that DCS will&#xD;
      generate greater extinction compared to placebo during the subsequent extinction session as&#xD;
      measured by attenuated craving in response to alcohol cues. Furthermore, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      DCS will generate greater extinction compared to placebo at follow-up assessments. This study&#xD;
      is a proof-of-concept test of whether DCS can reduce reactions to alcohol cues under&#xD;
      controlled laboratory conditions. It is a preliminary study using a subclinical number of&#xD;
      extinction sessions and medication administrations to establish whether or not DCS improves&#xD;
      extinction in the laboratory. If proof-of-concept is supported, it will suggest that a&#xD;
      clinical trial is warranted. A clinical sample and clinical context are used to maximize the&#xD;
      potential generalizability from this exploratory study.&#xD;
