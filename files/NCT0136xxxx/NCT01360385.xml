  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown a remarkably positive effect of 6 monthly injections of Ranibizumab&#xD;
      on eyes with CRVO. The disease may cause severe sight threatening complications, partly due&#xD;
      to restrictions in blood flow and oxygenation . Although Ranibizumab has been shown affective&#xD;
      to reduce oedema of the retina, it is not known whether the drug ameliorates or aggravates&#xD;
      restrictions in oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oxymap oximeter allows a non-invasive measurement of the oxygen saturation in retinal&#xD;
      vessels and thus the state of retinal oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of injections of Ranibizumab on&#xD;
      the retinal oxygen saturation in eyes with newly diagnosed central retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
      (CRVO),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of injections of Ranibizumab on visual&#xD;
      acuity and retinal oedema in eyes with different degree of ischemia.&#xD;

      Background and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRUISE study has shown a remarkable positive effect of 6 monthly injections intravitreal&#xD;
      Ranibizumab on visual function in eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO. Eyes with CRVO&#xD;
      are at risk of severe complications to retinal ischemia, particularly proliferative&#xD;
      retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma. It is not known whether intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy&#xD;
      ameliorates or aggravates retinal ischemia and thus the risk of ischemic complications is&#xD;
      unknown. Since complications to retinal ischemia take time to develop, and are relatively&#xD;
      infrequent, the CRUISE study was not designed, or powered, to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oxymap oximeter allows objective non-invasive measurement of the oxygen saturation in&#xD;
      retinal vessels and thus the degree of retinal ischemia. The rationale behind the present&#xD;
      study is to use this instrument in order to obtain preliminary information on the effects of&#xD;
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on retinal ischemia in CRVO eyes without having to wait for&#xD;
      ischemic complications to arise in a large study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with intravitreal&#xD;
      Ranibizumab on the retinal oxygen saturation in eyes with newly diagnosed central retinal&#xD;
      vein occlusion (CRVO),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of intravitreal Ranibizumab on visual&#xD;
      acuity and central retinal thickness in eyes with different degree of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project is a case-series study of CRVO-patients with three monthly injections of&#xD;
      Ranibizumab and a 3 month follow-up period, during which Ranibizumab injections are provided&#xD;
      as needed.&#xD;
