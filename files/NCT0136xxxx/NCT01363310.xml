  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with major depressive disorder manifest clinically significant agitation.&#xD;
      Concurrent agitation in a depressed individual is associated with an intensification of mood&#xD;
      symptoms, decreased probability of recovery, increased recurrence risk, suicidality, and&#xD;
      increased medical-service utilization. The occurrence of anxiety/agitation phenomenology in&#xD;
      the depressed patient often invites the need for augmentation strategies (e.g. atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, etc.) and complicated polypharmacy regimens. Moreover,&#xD;
      individuals with major depressive disorder often report worsening of symptom severity,&#xD;
      irritability, hostility, dysphoria, and significant subjective distress (This response&#xD;
      pattern is similar to individuals with bipolar disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from large research studies provide evidence indicating that quetiapine is capable of&#xD;
      offering clinically significant multidimensional symptom relief in bipolar depression.&#xD;
      Moreover, results from several trials in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder have established the efficacy of quetiapine therapy for unipolar depression and&#xD;
      anxiety syndromes. So far, no atypical antipsychotic agent has been evaluated specifically&#xD;
      for the treatment of agitated depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is hypothesized that persons with major depressive disorder and prominent&#xD;
      agitation (i.e. agitated depression) will exhibit a more favourable response and tolerability&#xD;
      profile to quetiapine XR when compared to escitalopram.&#xD;
