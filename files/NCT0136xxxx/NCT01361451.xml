    <textblock>
      There are 24,000 admissions each year to Intensive Care Units (ICU) in the United Kingdom due&#xD;
      to pneumonia, asthma and a common condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), with rates of death of 10%, 40% and 50%, respectively. These conditions account for&#xD;
      10% of all ICU admissions. It is therefore important to find out if it would be possible to&#xD;
      detect deteriorations in patients with breathing problems early, in order to increase&#xD;
      appropriately their level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical early warning scores (EWS) are used in many hospitals to detect patients whose&#xD;
      medical condition is getting worse, and who are likely to need admission to intensive care or&#xD;
      high dependency care units. EWS are usually calculated from several measurements taken from&#xD;
      the patient, such as blood pressure, temperature and heart rate. However, they are often&#xD;
      inaccurate as they need to be calculated manually by nursing staff from a number of&#xD;
      measurements taken from a variety of different devices. Furthermore, even when accurately&#xD;
      calculated, it is not clear how helpful EWS are in predicting whether or not patients will&#xD;
      deteriorate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural respiratory drive (NRD) is an objective indicator of breathlessness, and can be&#xD;
      derived from the amount of electrical activity occurring in certain muscles used in&#xD;
      breathing. The Myotrace system measures this electrical activity, as well as measurements&#xD;
      such as rate of breathing and heart rate. It then analyses these measurements together to&#xD;
      help identify patients at risk of deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use Myotrace to monitor patients with severe breathing difficulties due to an&#xD;
      acute worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for early identification of failure&#xD;
      to respond to medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at St. Thomas' Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is funded by the Guy's and St. Thomas' Charity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Admissions to hospital due to breathing difficulties are common. When these patients' medical&#xD;
      condition worsens, the deterioration is often not noticed until the patient needs to be moved&#xD;
      to an area of the hospital that provides higher levels of care, e.g. intensive care unit or&#xD;
      high-dependency unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early warning scores (EWS) have been designed to help medical and nursing staff identify&#xD;
      patients at risk of deteriorating. These scores are usually calculated from patient&#xD;
      measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate. It is not clear how effective these&#xD;
      scores are in preventing patient deterioration, or the need for intensive or high-dependency&#xD;
      care. The investigators therefore need another means of identifying patients at risk of&#xD;
      deterioration, particularly in those with breathing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural respiratory drive is a term used to describe the nervous system's response to the need&#xD;
      for increased breathing, and may be helpful in predicting whether patients admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with breathing difficulties will deteriorate. This response may be measured as the&#xD;
      amount of electrical activity that occurs in the muscles associated with breathing, which are&#xD;
      supplied with nerves that deliver electrical messages to the fibres that make up muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main breathing muscle in the body is the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle lying beneath the&#xD;
      lungs, which, when it contracts, moves downwards and draws air into the lungs. Although the&#xD;
      electrical activity in the diaphragm may be measured, this can only be achieved using a&#xD;
      technique that involves passing an electrical probe into a patient's oesophagus, or gullet.&#xD;
      This is not easy to do in a patient that has been admitted unwell to hospital with breathing&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a technique has been developed to measure the electrical activity that occurs in&#xD;
      the parasternal muscles. These muscles lie either side of the sternum, or breast bone, and&#xD;
      are particularly important breathing muscles in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), a lung disease commonly associated with smoking. Parasternal muscle&#xD;
      electrical activity can be measured from probes attached to the skin of the chest wall, and&#xD;
      can therefore be achieved more easily than measuring diaphragm electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that parasternal electrical activity is comparable to diaphragm&#xD;
      electrical activity in patients with COPD, and is a useful measure of neural respiratory&#xD;
      drive in patients with COPD. Neural respiratory drive has been shown to be increased in&#xD;
      patients with stable COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study involving 25 patients with COPD showed that daily measurements of parasternal&#xD;
      electrical activity are possible in patients admitted to hospital with acute worsening of&#xD;
      COPD. This study also demonstrated that the amount of parasternal electrical activity&#xD;
      reflected the degree of breathlessness experienced by patients with acute worsening of COPD.&#xD;
      Importantly, this study showed that measures related to parasternal electrical activity, and&#xD;
      hence neural respiratory drive, were significantly different in patients whose medical&#xD;
      condition deteriorated, compared with those that improved with treatment. Clinical early&#xD;
      warning scores were not significantly different between these two groups. Furthermore,&#xD;
      measures related to parasternal electrical activity were able to predict whether a patient&#xD;
      with an acute worsening of COPD would be readmitted to hospital within 7 and 14 days of&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, measurement of parasternal activity may be helpful in predicting deterioration due&#xD;
      to treatment failure in patients admitted to hospital with acute worsening of COPD. However,&#xD;
      as the pilot study was performed on a small number of patients, a larger clinical trial of&#xD;
      the Myotrace system, which acquires, processes and analyses this information, is needed to&#xD;
      demonstrate this conclusively. This is the purpose of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute worsening of COPD, as diagnosed by a doctor, will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Emergency Department or the acute admissions wards at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. On&#xD;
      admission, it is normal practice for the Patient At Risk (PAR) score to be recorded. This is&#xD;
      the Early Warning Score used at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will usually have had a blood test to check blood gas content as part of their&#xD;
      normal medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will identify potential candidates for the study in two ways: firstly,&#xD;
      directly from the Emergency Department; secondly, following admission, when new patients with&#xD;
      COPD will have been seen by the medical team directly responsible for the patient's medical&#xD;
      care or COPD outreach team. The research team will liaise with the medical and COPD outreach&#xD;
      teams to identify potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates then be given oral and written information about the study. Patients'&#xD;
      capacity to consent will be assessed at this time. Patients will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      consider participating in the study for 3 hours, after which written consent will be sought.&#xD;
      The relatively short period of time for consideration is due to the potential for patients'&#xD;
      medical condition to change rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment, patients will be asked about the history of their breathing&#xD;
      difficulties. Height and weight will be recorded where possible. Patients will be asked how&#xD;
      breathless they normally feel when stable (MRC dyspnoea score) and how breathless they&#xD;
      currently feel (visual-analogue scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further blood sample may be taken to assess for markers of inflammation on enrollment;&#xD;
      inflammation in COPD remains poorly understood, and it is intended that these blood tests&#xD;
      will inform further studies into this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasternal electromyogram (EMG) electrodes will then be attached to the patient's chest,&#xD;
      either side of the sternum (breast bone), to measure muscle electrical activity, breathing&#xD;
      rate and heart rate, using the Myotrace system. Electrode position will be marked with&#xD;
      indelible ink, to make sure that electrodes are re-attached to the chest wall in the same&#xD;
      place after washing or other activities. Electrodes will also be applied to the neck and the&#xD;
      abdomen, as muscles in these areas also contribute significantly to breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will first be asked to sniff as hard as possible through the nose, to measure the&#xD;
      maximum electrical activity that the parasternal muscles can generate. All other measures of&#xD;
      muscle electrical activity will then be expressed as a percentage of this maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasternal muscle electrical activity, breathing rate and heart rate will be measured using&#xD;
      the Myotrace system, as well as normal bedside measurements of temperature, blood pressure&#xD;
      and oxygen levels. An Early Warning Score will also be calculated (the PAR score).&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken for 20 minutes three times a day (at around 9am, 12 noon and 6pm),&#xD;
      until the patient is discharged from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also wear an activity monitor, either on the wrist or around the neck. This&#xD;
      will monitor the patient's physical activity, which is known to be related to decline in&#xD;
      breathing function in patients with COPD. The patient will be asked to keep the monitor on&#xD;
      throughout their hospital stay and for up to three months after discharge. The activity&#xD;
      monitors are very light to wear and very well-tolerated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a diary card recording their symptoms three times a day&#xD;
      during Myotrace measurements. Tests of breathing function (spirometry) will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will not inform the medical team looking after the patient of the results&#xD;
      of the tests, whilst the patient remains in hospital. When the patient is ready to be&#xD;
      discharged home, he/she will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires about their&#xD;
      breathing difficulties and their quality of life. A further blood sample will be taken at&#xD;
      this stage for markers of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will note whether the patient has been discharged with support from the&#xD;
      COPD outreach, to see whether there is any relationship between being offered supported&#xD;
      discharge and muscle electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be offered follow-up appointments with the research team at St. Thomas'&#xD;
      Hospital one month and three months after discharge from hospital. During this appointment,&#xD;
      further blood tests may be taken to check for blood gas content and any persisting infection&#xD;
      or inflammation. The patient will be asked to complete further questionnaires relating to&#xD;
      breathlessness and quality of life. Measurements of breathing muscle electrical activity will&#xD;
      be repeated, and patients' physical activity data analysed.&#xD;
