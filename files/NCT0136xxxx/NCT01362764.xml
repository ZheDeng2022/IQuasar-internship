  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the single-dose pharmacokinetics (how the drug is&#xD;
      absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body) of&#xD;
      the solution formulation to the tablet formulation; therefore the lowest dose available in&#xD;
      the tablet formulation (250 mg) was selected.&#xD;

      This is an open-label (volunteer and study staff will know the identity of the assigned&#xD;
      treatment) study of two abiraterone acetate suspension formulations, compared to the&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate tablet formulation in healthy volunteers. Approximately 30 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will participate in this study. Each volunteer will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6&#xD;
      possible treatment sequences. The study consists of a screening phase (within 21 days before&#xD;
      the first study drug administration of the first period); an open-label treatment phase&#xD;
      consisting of 3 single dose treatment periods; and end-of-study or withdrawal assessments&#xD;
      done upon completion of the 72-hour (Day 4 of Period 3, or upon withdrawal) sampling to&#xD;
      evaluate how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is&#xD;
      removed from the body over time. A 7- to 14-day washout period will separate the study drug&#xD;
      administrations. The duration of participation in the study for an individual healthy&#xD;
      volunteer will be from 41 days to a maximum of 55 days (including screening). Safety will be&#xD;
      monitored. Volunteers will receive a 250 mg dose of abiraterone acetate as a tablet,&#xD;
      suspension Formulation 1, and suspension Formulation 2 according to their treatment sequence.&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed, divided, dissolved or&#xD;
      crushed and will be taken with 240 mL of noncarbonated water. For the suspensions, the&#xD;
      volunteer will drink the contents of the vial. The vial will be rinsed with 10 mL of water,&#xD;
      and the volunteer will be asked to drink the rinse water.&#xD;
