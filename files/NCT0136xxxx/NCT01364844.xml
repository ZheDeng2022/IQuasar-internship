  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-7423 to assess its safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      identify a RP2D, (recommended Phase 2 Dose) and assess its Pharmacokinetics (PK) (what your&#xD;
      body does to process the drugs and how your body gets them out of your system.) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PDy) (Pharmacodynamics is a study of what a drug does to your body)&#xD;
      properties in subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors. This study will include 2 parts:&#xD;
      part 1-Dose Escalation and part 2-Dose Expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: DS-7423 will be safe and tolerable, and will exhibit acceptable PK and PDy&#xD;
      properties in subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors for whom standard therapy has&#xD;
      failed or for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;

      Part 1 : Dose-escalation of DS-7423 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors Part 2 : Dose Expansion: The purpose of Part 2 of this clinical&#xD;
      research study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of DS-7423 identified in&#xD;
      Part 1, and measure the effects of DS-7423 on your cancer. Part 2 will be conducted in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced colorectal or endometrial cancer.&#xD;
