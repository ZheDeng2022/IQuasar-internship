    <textblock>
      Kryptonite is a non-toxic biologic polymer, that has previously been used in orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery. The objective of our study is to demonstrate the benefits of Kryptonite in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients at high risk for sternal wound complications. The investigators have&#xD;
      designed a randomized clinical trial of 48 high risk patients, with a 1:2 randomization of&#xD;
      kryptonite to conventional closure. The primary outcome will be quality of life. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include sternal complications, pain, hospital length of stay, and respiratory&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      Purpose: To compare clinical outcomes following sternal closure with Kryptonite and&#xD;
      conventional sternal closure, in cardiac surgery patients at high risk for sternal wound&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients receiving sternal closure with Kryptonite will have a shorter&#xD;
      post-operative length of stay, fewer sternal wound complications, improved respiratory&#xD;
      function, better quality of life, and less pain than patients receiving a conventional&#xD;
      sternal closure. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving sternal closure with&#xD;
      Kryptonite will be discharged from hospital, on average, 1 day earlier than patients&#xD;
      receiving conventional sternal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Kryptonite is a biologic polymer from the castor bean and is non-toxic. It is&#xD;
      osteoconductive i.e. bone regrows through it. It is adhesive, and only requires 24 hours to&#xD;
      completely cure, although sternal stability is achieved even sooner. In human cadaver&#xD;
      studies, sternal edges adhered together with Kryptonite could not be broken after 2 hours.&#xD;
      The proposed benefits of Kryptonite in cardiac surgery patients are the prevention of&#xD;
      pathologic sternal displacement, the elimination of regional non-union, the enhancement of&#xD;
      functional recovery, and the reduction of sternal wound complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Kryptonite to close sternal wounds in cardiac surgery was first described in&#xD;
      Calgary, Alberta. This group conducted a small, single-blind randomized clinical trial in 34&#xD;
      patients at low risk for sternal complications (personal communication, Fedak, P). Patients&#xD;
      in the Kryptonite group experienced significantly less pain, required less analgesia, and&#xD;
      demonstrated a faster return to baseline pulmonary function. The limitations of this study&#xD;
      were the small sample size and blinding of patients only. Furthermore, hospital length of&#xD;
      stay was not evaluated. A multi-center randomized clinical trial is planned, pending funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary outcome of our trial is quality of life. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      pain, sternal complications, and respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: All patients undergoing non-emergent cardiac surgery through a primary&#xD;
      sternotomy at Vancouver General Hospital will be screened for enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will be approached by a research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 intra-operatively to receive either&#xD;
      conventional sternal closure or closure with Kryptonite. Sealed envelopes with treatment&#xD;
      allocation will be utilized for the randomization process, and will be randomly selected in&#xD;
      the operating room. Conventional sternal closure will be with single interrupted or&#xD;
      figure-of-eight surgical steel wires. Conventional techniques such as vancomycin paste and&#xD;
      bone wax can be utilized in the usual fashion to obtain hemostasis in these patients.&#xD;
      Patients in the Kryptonite group will have surgical steel wires placed in the usual fashion,&#xD;
      prior to the application of Kryptonite. However, bone wax and vancomycin paste will not be&#xD;
      used in the Kryptonite group, as it impairs the adherent properties of Kryptonite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, patients will not be made aware of which type of sternal closure they&#xD;
      received. Furthermore, the post-operative care team in the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (CSICU), as well as the surgical ward will also be blinded. The cardiac surgery ward is&#xD;
      run by a single cardiologist who will be blinded to the patients' group allocations. Battery&#xD;
      powered sternal saws will be available in the CSICU and on the cardiac surgery ward, in the&#xD;
      event of emergent resternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed prospectively. The primary outcome will be quality of life.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be hospital length of stay, pain, sternal complications, and&#xD;
      respiratory function. All patients will be required to answer a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      pre-operatively (SF12), as well as at both 2 weeks and 5 weeks post-operatively. Pain scales&#xD;
      will also be administered on post-operative day 2 and day 5, or on day of discharge if less&#xD;
      than day 5. Questionnaires will be administered by the research nurse, either in hospital or&#xD;
      by phone. Respiratory function will be measured by bedside spirometry, which will be measured&#xD;
      pre-operatively, as well as on post-operative day 2 and 5. In-hospital sternal complications&#xD;
      will be recorded, and following discharge the research nurse will ask about and sternal&#xD;
      complications during follow-up telephone calls. Sternal complications of interest are sternal&#xD;
      dehiscence requiring re-operation or sternal wound infection requiring antibiotics or&#xD;
      re-intervention. Post-operative follow-up will otherwise be routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data safety monitoring board will be assembled to perform an interim analysis when 24 of&#xD;
      the 48 patients have been enrolled in the trial. If any safety risks are identified at this&#xD;
      interim analysis, no further patients will be randomized in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be compared between groups using Student's T-tests, for&#xD;
      continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS) from the SF-12 will&#xD;
      be compared between groups at baseline using the Student's T-test, as will the change in&#xD;
      scores between baseline and 2 weeks and baseline and 5 weeks. The investigators will also&#xD;
      explore the change over time using all three time points, baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks, using a&#xD;
      general estimating equation (GEE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of stay (LOS), change in pain score, rate of sternal complications, and respiratory&#xD;
      function will also be evaluated. LOS will be reported as medians and interquartile ranges,&#xD;
      given the high likelihood that this data will be significantly skewed. Differences between&#xD;
      the groups will therefore be tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Pain scores will be&#xD;
      measured at 2 and 5 days. The mean and standard deviations for each of these time points will&#xD;
      be reported and differences at 2 days will be assessed using the Student's T-test. The change&#xD;
      in pain score between 2 and 5 days will also be compared using the Student's T-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of sternal complications will be compared as simple proportions using the Chi-square&#xD;
      test for differences. Respiratory function, specifically FEV1 and FVC, will be compared for&#xD;
      the three time points using GEE, thus allowing us to compare the change in function over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of LOS, the investigators have assumed all continuous variables will be&#xD;
      normally distributed. Outcomes will be tested for the normality assumption prior to carrying&#xD;
      out the parametric tests. If a variable is not normally distributed, then either a log&#xD;
      transformation will be applied or nonparametric tests (ie. Wilcoxon rank-sum test) will be&#xD;
      considered to test for differences between groups.&#xD;
