  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, with a 32-week follow-up, rater-blind, randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving&#xD;
      two different antipsychotics simultaneously will have any significant change in&#xD;
      psychopathology following conversion to antipsychotic monotherapy. Additionally, the effects&#xD;
      of conversion to antipsychotic monotherapy will be assessed by neurocognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Clinical Research and Evaluation Facility (CREF), a&#xD;
      specialized research unit jointly operated by the Nathan S Kline Institute for Psychiatric&#xD;
      Research (NKI) and Rockland Psychiatric Center (RPC). Patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      regular in-patient units of RPC and transferred to the CREF. Following baseline assessments,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to continued antipsychotic polypharmacy treatment or to&#xD;
      systematic conversion to monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversion to antipsychotic monotherapy will be assessed across multiple domains of&#xD;
      psychopathology using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is PANSS total score. The secondary outcome measure is time on medication (all-cause&#xD;
      dropouts). Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) will test the hypothesis that conversion to&#xD;
      antipsychotic monotherapy will show minimal change from the control group.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often, treatment resistant schizophrenia patients are treated with high doses of, or&#xD;
      polypharmacy with, antipsychotics, or both. There is a lack of systematic evidence for either&#xD;
      practice, and this is not recommended by most treatment guidelines. Often polypharmacy&#xD;
      results in dosages well above the recommended upper limit of dosage. Recent studies of&#xD;
      antipsychotic utilization, have reported that approximately 10-60% of patients are prescribed&#xD;
      at least two antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, antipsychotic treatment carries substantial risks, including the potential&#xD;
      development of tardive dyskinesia or metabolic syndrome. Higher doses may expose patients to&#xD;
      more adverse events or consequences without any additional therapeutic benefit. Clear&#xD;
      benefits of long-term treatment with antipsychotic polypharmacy have rarely been reported,&#xD;
      and there is a void of long term double blind, placebo controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipsychotic polypharmacy remains common, including patients receiving atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics. To our knowledge, no one has published a study of a systematic, randomized&#xD;
      controlled conversion to antipsychotic monotherapy for patients with chronic schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder receiving atypical antipsychotic polypharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients with DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder meeting the&#xD;
      following criteria: (1) at least two antipsychotics, (2) stable dosages for at least one&#xD;
      month prior to baseline, (3) baseline dosages of at least one of the antipsychotics are at&#xD;
      least olanzapine 15 mg, ziprasidone 120 mg, quetiapine 500 mg, risperidone 4 mg, aripiprazole&#xD;
      10 mg, paliperidone 6 mg, any dose of clozapine, or any first generation antipsychotic &gt;300&#xD;
      chlorpromazine equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a baseline assessment, patients will be randomized to conversion to antipsychotic&#xD;
      monotherapy of one of their two antipsychotics or continued on their combination&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment. Other psychotropics will be left unchanged from baseline, and the&#xD;
      prescription of a new psychotropic will not be permitted, excepting lorazepam and benztropine&#xD;
      as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is randomized to conversion to monotherapy, then the decision of which of the&#xD;
      two baseline antipsychotics to continue will occur as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If one is clozapine, then clozapine will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In all other cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If only one of the antipsychotics is at a dose greater than the above noted doses,&#xD;
                then that is one that will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If both doses are greater than the above noted doses, then there will be a flip of&#xD;
                a coin to determine which to continue, with heads equal the one with the higher&#xD;
                alphabetic letter and tails equal to the lower.&#xD;
