    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to assess the efficacy of a weight loss intervention&#xD;
      for chronic disease prevention that focuses on daily self-weighing as the primary&#xD;
      self-monitoring strategy compared to a delayed-intervention control group. While daily&#xD;
      self-weighing has been shown to be effective for weight loss in observational research, there&#xD;
      is limited experimental evidence testing this association and most is derived from intensive&#xD;
      interventions that may overshadow the effects of self-weighing. To mitigate this, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine whether daily self-weighing is effective for weight loss under&#xD;
      self-directed conditions using a randomized-controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a 6-month randomized trial in 88 overweight and obese adults&#xD;
      to compare a daily self-weighing intervention to a delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
      Changes in weight, diet and physical activity, and psychosocial measures will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study Hypothesis: Participants in the group randomized to receive the daily&#xD;
      self-weighing intervention will have greater percent weight loss at 6 months compared to&#xD;
      those in the delayed control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Participants in the group receiving the daily self-weighing&#xD;
      intervention will report greater engagement in diet and physical activity behaviors that&#xD;
      produce caloric deficits, greater self-efficacy and motivation, and no differences in body&#xD;
      satisfaction, disordered eating, or depressive symptoms compared to those in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity continues to be a challenging public health problem. Despite producing large&#xD;
      reductions in weight, weight loss interventions require a significant amount of effort&#xD;
      because of the detailed self-monitoring of dietary intake and exercise habits that is&#xD;
      involved. Consequently, this behavior is difficult to sustain and weight regain occurs.&#xD;
      Interventions focused on enhancing simple strategies for self-monitoring may be just as&#xD;
      effective and provide more lasting effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the simplest forms of self-monitoring is self-weighing. Self-weighing is an important&#xD;
      tool for regulation of body weight as it provides proximal feedback on how eating and&#xD;
      exercise behaviors are impacting weight, and allows individuals to make adjustments to these&#xD;
      behaviors to affect energy balance. Observational research indicates that daily self-weighing&#xD;
      is associated with greater weight loss as compared to less frequent self-weighing. However,&#xD;
      there is limited experimental evidence testing this association and most is derived from&#xD;
      intensive interventions that may overshadow the effects of self-weighing. To mitigate this,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine whether daily self-weighing is effective under self-directed&#xD;
      conditions with minimal contact. The results of this proposal will provide evidence about the&#xD;
      efficacy of daily self-weighing on weight loss using a randomized controlled design. Most&#xD;
      assessments of self-weighing are measured via self-report, which introduces measurement&#xD;
      error. This proposal will improve on this by using an objective measure of self-weighing with&#xD;
      a scale that can store and transmit weight data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that self-weighing does not impact weight loss directly but rather via changes in diet&#xD;
      and physical activity behaviors, a full understanding of the mechanisms explaining this&#xD;
      relationship is necessary. Furthermore, despite evidence indicating that more frequent&#xD;
      self-weighing has no adverse psychological effects in adults participating in weight control&#xD;
      interventions, there remains debate as to the negative psychological consequences of this&#xD;
      behavior. Therefore, it would be informative to test for any adverse effects between&#xD;
      treatment groups to further add to the evidence surrounding this debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the WEIGH Study (Weighing to Improve and Gain Health) is to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of a self-directed intervention focused on daily self-weighing as the main&#xD;
      self-monitoring strategy on weight loss at 6 months compared to a delayed-intervention&#xD;
      control group. This will be tested using a 2-group randomized control design. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either: [1] Daily Self-weighing Intervention Group or [2]&#xD;
      Delayed-Intervention control group. The daily self-weighing intervention group will receive&#xD;
      access to a &quot;smart scale&quot; for daily self-weighing and viewing of weight trends over time, and&#xD;
      receive weekly emails with tailored messages reinforcing self-weighing and other behaviors&#xD;
      associated with reaching weight loss goals. This group will also receive weekly lessons with&#xD;
      basic information for weight loss and strategies on how to use the scale to maximize weight&#xD;
      loss. The control group will be given the &quot;smart scale&quot; and be told to weigh as often as they&#xD;
      normally do, with the goal of observing natural weighing frequency trends in this group.&#xD;
      After the end of the 6-month study, they will receive a 3-month modified version of the daily&#xD;
      self-weighing intervention, which will include weekly emails, prescription for daily&#xD;
      self-weighing, and weight monitoring via the smart scale website. Detailed descriptions of&#xD;
      these components are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Informed Consent Participants will first undergo screening at&#xD;
      www.uncweightresearch.org via Qualtrics or call the study center to complete the screening&#xD;
      questionnaire over the phone. For those filling out the questionnaire online, they are still&#xD;
      required to call the study center to complete the screening questionnaire, as sensitive&#xD;
      medical-related questions are more appropriate to ask over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once they are considered eligible, participants will be invited to an orientation session&#xD;
      where they can hear more about the program and ask any questions before deciding whether or&#xD;
      not to participate. For those who want to participate, the study PI and/or other study&#xD;
      personnel listed on this application will explain the consent form and ask the participant to&#xD;
      read the form. Once the participant has finished reading the form, the study personnel member&#xD;
      will ask the participant if he/she has any questions. Then both parties will sign the&#xD;
      questionnaire and the participant will receive a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Consented individuals will be provided with a Qualtrics link to complete&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire measures. A computer algorithm will randomly assign them to one of the&#xD;
      two study groups. Baseline anthropometrics will be measured at the kick-off session where&#xD;
      randomization will be revealed to all participants. At both the 3 and 6-month assessments,&#xD;
      the enrolled patients will repeat all baseline measures, with the exception of demographic&#xD;
      characteristics. At 9 months, participants in both groups will be asked to stop on their&#xD;
      smart scale to provide a final weight measurement and the control group will complete 1 final&#xD;
      questionnaire. Following randomization, participants will either receive the components&#xD;
      outlined below for the intervention group or for the delayed-intervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Descriptions of the Intervention Components Kick-off Group Meeting Initially,&#xD;
      individuals will attend a group kick-off meeting where they will receive scales (see below)&#xD;
      and other materials for getting started. This meeting will also emphasize the objective of&#xD;
      the study, which is to examine the effect of a self-directed approach for weight loss&#xD;
      emphasizing daily self-weighing. The kick-off session will provide participants will a&#xD;
      start-up guide for how to use the scale as well as access to the study website&#xD;
      (www.bodytrace.com) for viewing of weight trends overtime. The session will focus on the&#xD;
      benefits of daily self-weighing for weight loss, addressing certain myths regarding daily&#xD;
      self-weighing and emphasizing the use of the scale as a barometer for progress with diet and&#xD;
      physical activity behaviors. In addition, this session will also provide a brief overview of&#xD;
      &quot;Weight Loss 101&quot; through a discussion focused on calorie balance, as it outlined in the&#xD;
      Diabetes Prevention Program materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smart Scales Participants in the intervention group will be instructed to weigh themselves&#xD;
      daily using &quot;smart&quot; scales. These scales send weight data directly to a website&#xD;
      (www.bodytrace.com) via the wireless cellular network. Participants will be able to view&#xD;
      their weight on the scale and can also utilize the website to view weight trends overtime.&#xD;
      Participants will be loaned these scales, and will be told in the consent form that they will&#xD;
      be be able to keep the smart scale upon completion of all study assessment visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be told that if they do not complete the assessment visits, they will be&#xD;
      asked to return to the UNC Weight Research Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Weekly Emails All intervention participants will receive weekly emails that&#xD;
      include basic skills training materials about weight control, and tailored feedback based on&#xD;
      rate of weight loss and daily self-weighing frequency. The skills training materials will&#xD;
      include instructional lessons about topics such as portion control, label reading, restaurant&#xD;
      eating, structured exercise, and lifestyle activity, and behavioral topics such as problem&#xD;
      solving, stimulus control and relapse prevention. The behavioral topics are based on the&#xD;
      evidence based Diabetes Prevention Program. This program has been used in various research&#xD;
      studies, including those conducted at the UNC Weight Research Program. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will reinforce self-weighing through behavioral weight control topics to&#xD;
      enhance self-regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emails will begin with a tailored feedback message about daily self-weighing frequency&#xD;
      and a message to reinforce daily self-weighing to help participants respond effectively to&#xD;
      weight changes by learning how to utilize their scale to make adjustments to diet and&#xD;
      physical activity behaviors in order to produce caloric deficits. An algorithm based on&#xD;
      self-weighing frequency compliance will determine which feedback message they receive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet and Physical Activity Level Suggestions Participants in the intervention group will also&#xD;
      receive examples of meal plans for each of the calorie levels associated with weight loss&#xD;
      (e.g., 1200-1800 calories per day) and be given suggestions for which meal plan to follow&#xD;
      based on baseline weight, Furthermore, all participants will be provided with a physical&#xD;
      activity goal of 150-250 minutes per week of exercise similar to brisk walking, as this level&#xD;
      is shown to be associated with weight loss. They will be encouraged to begin with 10 minutes&#xD;
      of walking each day and to add 5 minutes per day each week until they reach the 150-200&#xD;
      minutes. For example, Week 1 walk 10 minutes x 5 days (50 minutes), Week 2 walk 15 minutes x&#xD;
      5 days (75 minutes), Week 3 walk 20 minutes x 5 days (100 minutes), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed-Intervention Control Group The delayed-intervention control group will receive a&#xD;
      kick-off session where they will be told that the study is testing a self-directed approach&#xD;
      to weight loss focusing on careful tracking of weight, and that they will receive a modified&#xD;
      version of the intervention after the 6-month period is complete. They will also be provided&#xD;
      with the &quot;smart scales&quot; but not website access (bodytrace.com), and be told to use them as&#xD;
      they normally would, so that the investigators could get a sense of their normal weighing&#xD;
      habits. They will be told that the investigators will be able to view their weighing&#xD;
      frequency on the bodytrace.com website. They will receive a modified version of the&#xD;
      intervention for 3 months, which will include the same components as the intervention group&#xD;
      with the exception of the weekly feedback emails. After 3 months, the investigators will call&#xD;
      and/or email participants to ask them to step on the scale and provide a final weight and&#xD;
      complete 1 final questionnaire on process measures.&#xD;
