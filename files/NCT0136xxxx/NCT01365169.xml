  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this phase of the study is to determine if objectively assessed Physical&#xD;
      Activity (PA) levels in advanced-cancer patients are associated with health care provider&#xD;
      (HCP)-assessed ECOG performance status and overall survival. The purpose is to advance the&#xD;
      evidence-base for incorporating objective assessment of Physical Activity (PA) in the context&#xD;
      of performance status assessment in advanced cancer patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the feasibility and acceptability in diverse samples of cancer patients of&#xD;
      wireless collection and transmission of data for transfer into the open-source&#xD;
      cyberinfrastructure (CI) called Cyberinfrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research&#xD;
      (CYCORE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two&#xD;
      accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a heart rate monitor, a global positioning system&#xD;
      (GPS) device, and a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions&#xD;
      about exercise and health-related symptoms and feelings. The devices are used for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional&#xD;
      5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two&#xD;
      accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a weight scale, and a smart phone that prompts&#xD;
      patients to electronically answer questions about diet and health-related symptoms. The&#xD;
      devices are used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the&#xD;
      devices for an additional 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use a&#xD;
      smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about diet,&#xD;
      health-related symptoms, and swallowing exercises. Patients also take video recordings of&#xD;
      their neck while performing swallowing exercises. The device is used for 5 consecutive days.&#xD;
      After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the device for an additional 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV (CANCER SURVIVORS THAT ARE CURRENT/FORMER SMOKERS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14):&#xD;
      Patients use a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor and a smart phone that prompts patients to&#xD;
      electronically answer questions about smoking. Patients also take video recordings of&#xD;
      themselves while exhaling into the CO monitor. The devices are used for 5 consecutive days.&#xD;
      After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PANCREATIC CANCER STUDY (PCS): Patients receive post-surgical wellness program consisting of&#xD;
      physical activity, nutrition counseling, and daily monitoring (physical activity, weight, and&#xD;
      self-reported data) for up to 7 months post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technological Approach to Performance Status (TAPS) Study: Patients use two Physical Activity&#xD;
      monitor devices, the wrist-worn device (Fitbit) continuously and the Actigraph during waking&#xD;
      hours. Patients use the devices for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
