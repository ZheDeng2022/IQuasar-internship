      Current methods of choosing treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) are inefficient.&#xD;
      The Strategic Treatment to Achieve Remission of Depression (STAR*D) Trial revealed that only&#xD;
      about 1/3 of patients treated with antidepressant drugs will go into remission with the first&#xD;
      medication chosen. We hypothesize that pattern recognition software using Machine Learning&#xD;
      methods can accurately predict response to a variety of antidepressant medications (ADM) or&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) after training using pre-treatment demographic, clinical,&#xD;
      laboratory or electroencephalographic (EEG) data. These algorithms might assist the clinician&#xD;
      to chose, for any given patient, an antidepressant treatment option with greater probability&#xD;
      of favourable response than is achievable using current best practise methods.&#xD;

      Objective of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve antidepressant treatment efficacy by determining,in advance, a given subject's&#xD;
      probability of response to a range of antidepressant treatments. The study is intended to to&#xD;
      further train and test, in a larger sample of depressed subjects, a digital system that has&#xD;
      been shown to be an accurate predictor of antidepressant response in pilot studies. The&#xD;
      accuracy of the trained predictive model based on machine learning methodology is the primary&#xD;
      outcome we are interested in studying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      males and females age 18-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meet DSM IV criteria for MDD on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID) capable of&#xD;
      providing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  adequate CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adequate trials of the study antidepressant medications [adequacy definitions: ≥ 4 weeks&#xD;
           of i) venlafaxine ≥150 mg/day, ii) bupropion ≥150 mg/day iii) escitalopram ≥ 10 mg/day&#xD;
           iv) duloxetine ≥ 30 mg/day v) ≥ 8 CBT sessions over ≥ 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unstable medical illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECT within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy or sexually active female not using contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 days of psychotropic medication washout demographic, syndromatic, illness severity ,&#xD;
      biochemical/hematological and electroencephalographic data will be collected from which a&#xD;
      list of potential response predictor variables will later be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected include the following areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression Severity: evaluated using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
           (MADRS) and the Beck II Depression Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety Severity: measured using the Spielberger Stait-Trait Anxiety Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis and Syndromatic Features: documented using the Structured Clinical Interview&#xD;
           for DSM IV (SCID).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personality Attributes: determined using the Minnestota Multi-phasic Personality&#xD;
           Inventory (MMPI) and the NEO-Personality Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social Support: measured using the Perceived Social Support from Friends and Family&#xD;
           rating scale (PSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous Antidepressant Medication Treatment (range and adequacy): determined using a&#xD;
           modified and updated version of the Michigan Adequacy of Treatment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematological/Biochemical Testing: complete blood count, hepatic transaminases, thyroid&#xD;
           stimulating hormone level, serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum magnesium, fasting&#xD;
           blood glucose and serum B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressant Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antidepressant treatment will be administered in Phase I. Subjects who show less than a&#xD;
      50% response to the treatment at the end of Phase I will receive a different treatment in&#xD;
      Phase II. There will be a 10 day period between phases I and II during which the&#xD;
      antidepressant medication (if used in Phase I) is tapered and discontinued .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment choice is made naturalistically i.e. patient preference is taken into account, but&#xD;
      patients cannot receive a treatment if they have previously failed to respond to an adequate&#xD;
      trial of that treatment. Subjects judged insufficiently &quot;psychologically minded&quot; are not&#xD;
      offered CBT. If the patient has no preference regarding treatment, the choice of treatment is&#xD;
      determined randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) escitalopram for 6 weeks ii) venlafaxine for 6 weeks iii) bupropion for 6 weeks iv)&#xD;
      duloxetine for 6 weeks v) cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for 12 weeks. Antidepressant&#xD;
      medication dosing will follow established medical procedures and published dose guidelines.&#xD;
      CBT is administered in manualized format by highly trained therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, subjects will be classified as responders or non-reponders using the %&#xD;
      change in the MADRS score from pre-treatment to post treatment. Subjects will be considered&#xD;
      to be responders if the post treatment MADRS score has dropped by 50% or more from the&#xD;
      baseline score. The machine learning algorithms will be trained using features extracted from&#xD;
      the pre-treatment demographic, syndromatic, illness severity , biochemical/hematological and&#xD;
      electroencephalographic data and Phase I treatment response as the classification variable.&#xD;
      The algorithm will first be tested using nested cross-validation &quot;leave N out&quot; techniques&#xD;
      using only Phase I data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overfitting of the predictive algorithm is not entirely excluded as a possibility, even using&#xD;
      nested cross validation methods. For this reason the resulting algorithm will be further&#xD;
      tested in Phase II subjects using the predictive features extracted from pre-treatment data&#xD;
      but, in this instance, using treatment response data from Phase II treatment. The&#xD;
      pre-treatment demographic, syndromatic, illness severity , biochemical/hematological and&#xD;
      electroencephalographic data data for Phase II subjects will only have been employed to train&#xD;
      the algorithm for the treatment they received during Phase I and not for the treatment&#xD;
      received during Phase II. Under these circumstances retesting of the algorithm using Phase II&#xD;
      treatment outcome constitutes testing in an entirely independent sample.&#xD;
