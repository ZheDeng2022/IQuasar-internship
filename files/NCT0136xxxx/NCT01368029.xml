  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo in elderly subjects receiving the trivalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. Lactobacilli are part of the normal flora of the intestine. LGG is one of&#xD;
      several strains of Lactobacilli that is used as a probiotic or microorganism administered to&#xD;
      confer &quot;health benefits&quot;. Our research is focused on studying the possible therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of LGG. The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LGG or placebo administered twice daily will be safe and well tolerated in elderly&#xD;
           subjects who have just received the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The immune response to the influenza vaccine at day 21, 28, 56, and at the end of the&#xD;
           influenza season will be higher in the LGG group than the placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The occurrence rate of influenza like illness during the influenza season will be lower&#xD;
           in the LGG group than in the placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The diversity of the microbiota in nasopharyngeal and stool specimens at day 21, 28, 56&#xD;
           and at the end of the influenza season will be greater in the LGG group than the placebo&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
