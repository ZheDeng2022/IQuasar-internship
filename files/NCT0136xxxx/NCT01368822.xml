    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that renal function in patients who have donated a kidney (but are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy) remains stable and within normal limits. However, it is unclear how donor&#xD;
      nephrectomy affects patient subsets with comorbidities, an issue that becomes relevant in the&#xD;
      current environment where inclusion criteria are continuously becoming less stringent and&#xD;
      more patients are being considered as potential donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators plan to evaluate long-term renal function in obese&#xD;
      patients who have donated a kidney as part of a living donor renal transplant procedure. The&#xD;
      investigators have selected this group because it is at higher risk for developing&#xD;
      obesity-related complications such as diabetes and hypertension that may impair renal&#xD;
      function, it is rapidly becoming a major subgroup in the kidney donor population, and no&#xD;
      studies have systematically followed obese patients after kidney donation. Establishment of&#xD;
      an appropriate control group is of primary importance in studies examining long-term&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators will also evaluate a 2-kidney control group to allow us to&#xD;
      compare the individual and interactive effects of obesity and kidney donation on long-term&#xD;
      renal function. Study participants will complete a medical questionnaire, undergo blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements, and provide blood and urine samples for analysis of various metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. Some study participants will have ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed&#xD;
      which involves application of an automated blood pressure cuff for 24 hours. Some study&#xD;
      participants will also undergo direct measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with&#xD;
      iohexol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed research, the investigators hypothesize that obesity in kidney donors&#xD;
      increases the likelihood of developing renal dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) and may increase the likelihood even more than in healthy controls.&#xD;

      In order to meet the growing demand for living donor kidneys, the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      prospective donors have become less selective, allowing previously ineligible patients to&#xD;
      donate kidneys. One donor group that has become increasingly more utilized is the overweight&#xD;
      patient. There is substantial evidence that overweight individuals are more susceptible to&#xD;
      the development of renal disease either as a direct result of their weight or as a&#xD;
      consequence of their obesity-related co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. In&#xD;
      addition, it appears that even mild renal dysfunction can increase the risk of developing&#xD;
      CVD, which is already more common in this population. Despite these findings, very little is&#xD;
      known about the individual and interactive effects of obesity and donation on the overall&#xD;
      health of kidney donors. Our study addresses some of these questions by examining the effects&#xD;
      of obesity on long-term renal function and development of cardiovascular risk factors such as&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in patients who donated a kidney at the&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) more than 5 years ago (1967-2006). The control&#xD;
      group will comprise of all potential kidney donors at UCSF during this period who passed an&#xD;
      initial medical screening evaluation but did not donate because they were found to be ABO- or&#xD;
      crossmatch incompatible. The investigators believe that the results of the proposed study&#xD;
      will be important in developing more precise guidelines for the selection and long-term&#xD;
      health care maintenance of kidney donors.maintenance at all.&#xD;
