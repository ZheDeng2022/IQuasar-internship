    <textblock>
      Study DNB4987g is a Phase I, multicenter, open label, dose-escalation study of DNIB0600A&#xD;
      administered as a single agent by intravenous (IV) infusion every three weeks (q3w) to&#xD;
      participants with non-squamous NSCLC or non-mucinous, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two cohorts: Dose-escalation cohort and Expansion cohort.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of causality.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the peak concentration of a substance in blood serum.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Antibody Formation to DNIB0600A</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 84 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples will be analyzed to assess the prevalence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at baseline and the incidence of post-baseline ADAs in each treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 84 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OR is defined as a complete or partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), v1.1. Complete response is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
