    <textblock>
      GSK is planning to undertake two anti-obesity drug studies in the area of obesity. In&#xD;
      addition to assessment by questionnaires, it would be of significant value to incorporate an&#xD;
      objective non-interventional measure of cognitive or motivational processing associated with&#xD;
      evaluating and responding to food stimuli. Obesity is associated with increased attentional&#xD;
      bias to palatable foods. The aims of this protocol are two-fold, first to characterize Event&#xD;
      Related Potentials (ERPs) of two common aspects of food stimuli relevant to eating disorders&#xD;
      -presence of food and its palatability, and secondly, to assess the modulation of these ERPs&#xD;
      by appetite. Following a successful completion of this study, it is the intention to use the&#xD;
      paradigm developed in future studies in the area of obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GlaxoSmithKline is currently developing a number of drugs for the treatment of overheating&#xD;
      including 'binge eating' in obesity. Historically, the behavioural effectiveness of&#xD;
      anti-obesity drugs in clinical drug trials have utilised subjective rating scales to assess a&#xD;
      person's drive or motivation to eat. Findings from these studies have good construct&#xD;
      validity, but suffer from the shortcomings of self-reporting, e.g. the subject bias,&#xD;
      dishonesty, misinterpretation. It follows that in addition to self-reporting, it would&#xD;
      strengthen the interpretation of any future studies on anti-obesity drugs, if there were to&#xD;
      be an objective measure of brain activity in relation to cognitive/motivational processes&#xD;
      associated with evaluation and responding to food related cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring event related potentials (ERPs) during cognitive processes of food related cues,&#xD;
      using the electroencephalography technique (EEG) offers a an alternative objective approach&#xD;
      to examining the effectives of anti-obesity drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol proposes to develop and use two cognitive tasks examining response to food&#xD;
      related cues (pictorial and words) with concurrent recording of ERPs, in order to&#xD;
      characterize neurophysiological events associated with attentional bias towards food related&#xD;
      stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first task is an image processing task. This task uses food images similar to those in&#xD;
      the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) used in ERP studies of perceptual&#xD;
      processing of emotional stimuli [Olofsson, 2008; Schupp, 2006]. In this task a subject views&#xD;
      different categories of images; palatable high-calorie food images, non-palatable low-calorie&#xD;
      food images and non-edible plant images. The latter is the neutral category against which the&#xD;
      ERPs of the two food categories will be compared. Affective pictures have been used to assess&#xD;
      emotional valence by measuring differences in anterior ERP measurements between images from&#xD;
      differing groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol also proposes to measure late positive potential in order to assess higher level&#xD;
      cognitive processing possibly with early memory formation. Again, the proposal is to assess&#xD;
      AUCs, in this case in the 400-600 ms region and then look at difference curves between the&#xD;
      late potential potentials to different valency stimuli. For the late positive potentials,&#xD;
      anterior laterality will also be assessed. The second task is a cued-target task of&#xD;
      visuospatial attention to motivationally salient words. The task is a version of the Posner&#xD;
      paradigm. The appearance of a food or nonfood word inside a top or bottom frame (the cue)&#xD;
      distracts the attention of the subject towards that spatial location. Following the word&#xD;
      either one of the two frames changes appearance (the target).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these emotion and attention measures, the protocol proposes to assess the more&#xD;
      standard N1, P1 and P3 [Luck, 2005]. After completing the ERP recordings the subject will be&#xD;
      asked to rate each picture for salience and valence in order to provide a comparison between&#xD;
      objective neurophysiological and subjective attention and emotional ratings.&#xD;
