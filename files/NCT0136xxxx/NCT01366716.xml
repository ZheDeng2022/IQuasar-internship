  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) is a demonstrably efficacious intervention for substance abuse&#xD;
      and dependence. Although CM protocols have employed a variety of reinforcers, they have&#xD;
      almost exclusively relied upon non-cash privileges (e.g., take-home methadone doses), prizes,&#xD;
      or vouchers that can be exchanged for goods or services. Despite the strong empirical support&#xD;
      for CM, our research suggests that concerns relating to its cost and safety (e.g., potential&#xD;
      for harm caused by rewards undermining intrinsic motivation or being sold to purchase drugs)&#xD;
      have hindered its transfer to real-world practice. The exclusive use of non-cash CM likely&#xD;
      stems from the untested assumption that clients will use cash incentives to buy drugs or&#xD;
      engage in other high-risk behaviors. This assumption is problematic for two reasons. First,&#xD;
      the use of non-cash incentives may add substantial costs and complexity to CM protocols.&#xD;
      Second, the use of non-cash incentives may reduce the efficacy of CM interventions, as&#xD;
      research suggests that cash may be a more effective reinforcer than vouchers. This study&#xD;
      examines both practical and ethical issues relating to cash-based CM procedures. This study&#xD;
      consists of three phases; a main experiment, a &quot;Cash Bowl&quot; pilot, and a &quot;Thinning&quot; Pilot.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the main phase of the study, we used a 3-group randomized study to compare the efficacy,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, and ethics of a (1) voucher-based CM intervention, (2) cash-based CM&#xD;
      intervention, and (3) non-CM intervention. Two hundred thirty seven consenting&#xD;
      cocaine-dependent clients were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. In this main&#xD;
      we examined outcomes related to (1) efficacy, including UDS-confirmed abstinence and&#xD;
      counseling attendance; (2) cost-effectiveness; and (3) ethics, including the effects on&#xD;
      intrinsic motivation, drug use, and other high-risk behavior. This investigation addressed&#xD;
      practical issues pertaining to the transfer of CM interventions into community-based&#xD;
      treatment programs, and provided empirical evidence refuting ethical criticisms that have&#xD;
      been levied against the use of cash and CM interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase expanded on the main study with a pilot examination of a probabilistic&#xD;
      reinforcement CM schedule. Probabilistic methods are considered less expensive to implement&#xD;
      yet equally efficacious, as a reward is not provided each time target behaviors are&#xD;
      exhibited, yet similar outcomes result. In this pilot study, an additional 70 participants&#xD;
      were randomized into either a traditional voucher-based probability reinforcement CM&#xD;
      schedule, (&quot;FishBowl&quot; CM), a cash-based probability reinforcement CM schedule (&quot;CashBowl&quot;&#xD;
      CM), or a standard non-CM intervention. As in the main study, we examined these conditions in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy, associated costs and cost-effectiveness, and potential ethical risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase of this study is a pilot that seeks to examine the efficacy of a traditional&#xD;
      &quot;thinning&quot; reinforcement schedule compared to an escalating reinforcement schedule or a&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual (non-contingency management control) condition in improving the&#xD;
      during-treatment and post-treatment outcomes of cocaine dependent outpatients in&#xD;
      community-based treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment&#xD;
      conditions: Escalating CM Condition (n = 15), Traditional (&quot;thinning&quot;) CM Condition (n = 15),&#xD;
      and Non-CM Control Condition (n = 15). The intervention will last a total of 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to each of the experimental conditions will receive different&#xD;
      contingency and reward procedures during study weeks 1-12; they will receive identical&#xD;
      contingency and reward procedures during study weeks 13-16. Participants assigned to the&#xD;
      control condition will not receive any contingencies or rewards during the entire 16 week&#xD;
      study. As in the main study, we will examine these conditions in terms of efficacy,&#xD;
      associated costs and cost-effectiveness, and potential ethical risks.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be a new intake to the Parkside treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current cocaine dependence as assessed by the&#xD;
             Substance Use Disorders section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV&#xD;
             (SCID-I). (In our past studies at this same facility, 60% of the clients met DSM-IV&#xD;
             criteria for current cocaine dependence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be capable of providing valid contact information. We have found that a small&#xD;
             proportion of participants may provide false contact information, and we consider this&#xD;
             to be a passive strategy for refusing research participation. Therefore, the RA will&#xD;
             immediately attempt to verify the contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be capable of providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be willing and capable of fulfilling the requirements of the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Not currently receiving treatment at Parkside Treatment facility.&#xD;
