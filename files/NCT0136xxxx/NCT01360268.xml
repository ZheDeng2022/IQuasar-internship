      Rationale for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction of hypocholesteremia and insulin resistance after successful eradication of HCV by&#xD;
      combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin has been shown in several studies. The&#xD;
      majority of these studies examined genotype 1 and some genotype 3 patients, but it is not&#xD;
      clear if the same results can be achieved in other genotypes of HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, clinical data of the relationships between different adipocytokines, metabolic&#xD;
      profiles, and HCV and treatment is of value to further understand the mechanisms for&#xD;
      HCVrelated metabolic alterations. The present proposal is designed to address the paradox of&#xD;
      HCV-related metabolic alterations/adipocytokine alterations and to determine how BMI&#xD;
      influences the HCV-related metabolic alteration/adipocytokine aterations by collecting and&#xD;
      analyzing the samples from humans with HCV infection prior to and after combination of&#xD;
      peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin&#xD;
&#xD;
      For metabolic alternations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid profile: After treatment, responders in both genotype I and II will experience more&#xD;
      increase of cholesterol levels and LDL levels than nonresponders/ relapseres. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance: After treatment, responders with both genotype I and II will experience more&#xD;
      decrease of HOMA-IR than nonresponders/ relapseres; higher percentage of responders will&#xD;
      achieve HOMA-IR &lt; 2 than nonresponders/ relapseres B. For adipocytokine alternation, this&#xD;
      study is more of exploratory propose as there is still little well established consensus.&#xD;
