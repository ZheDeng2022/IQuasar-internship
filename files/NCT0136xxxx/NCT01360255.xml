  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the tumors with an increasing incidence worldwide.&#xD;
      Often treatment possibilities are limited and only palliative treatment such as a&#xD;
      transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is possible. Therapeutic response is evaluated three&#xD;
      months after TACE by imaging techniques (CT, MRI). In some HCC patients the tumor marker AFP&#xD;
      ( alpha-fetoprotein) is elevated, but not all patients show this elevation. In the last years&#xD;
      new tumor markers such as AFP-L3 (subfraction of AFP) and des-y-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) have&#xD;
      been examined. In this clinical trial the course of these markers are examined after TACE in&#xD;
      order to receive hints if the patient will be a therapeutic responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the investigators are interested in the quality of life after TACE. Patients&#xD;
      receive a questionnaire with regard to the quality of life before and 3 months after TACE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolisation are&#xD;
      enrolled in this clinical trial. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the usefulness of the&#xD;
      liver cancer markers AFP, AFP-L3% (subfraction of AFP) and des-y- carboxyprothrombin (DCP)&#xD;
      after TACE therapy. Some authors could have shown that AFP-L3% is rising in small tumor&#xD;
      nodules under 2 cm and so the markers which should decrease after TACE can give a hint for&#xD;
      the therapeutic response after the intervention. So the important aim of this trial is to&#xD;
      improve the early detection of tumor recurrence after TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the quality of life measured by the EORTC QLQ C30 before and after TACE is&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
