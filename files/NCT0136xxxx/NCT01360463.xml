  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to UNAIDS, Indonesia is experiencing one of the most rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS&#xD;
      epidemics in Asia. The epidemic in Indonesia has been fueled by injection drug use among&#xD;
      heroin users and the national response includes the scale-up of methadone maintenance&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug counseling is considered to be an integral part of methadone treatment, but few studies&#xD;
      have been designed to assess its benefits and costs. In settings such as Jakarta, data&#xD;
      regarding the costs and benefits of drug counseling have critical public heath relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of integrated drug and HIV counseling among injecting drug users. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted at six methadone clinics in Jakarta, Indonesia where the HIV prevalence among&#xD;
      injecting drug users ranges between 50- 86%, with collaborators from the Drug Dependence&#xD;
      Hospital in Jakarta, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. The specific aims of&#xD;
      this four year study are to evaluate the impact of Behavioral Drug and Risk Counseling&#xD;
      (BDRC)-a low intensity, cognitive behavioral approach that integrates drug counseling and&#xD;
      risk reduction intervention. Those assigned to the BDRC arm will be compared to those who&#xD;
      receive treatment as usual which includes an initial risk reduction intervention and&#xD;
      counseling as needed. The investigators hypothesize that the structured, low intensity BDRC&#xD;
      approach will be more cost effective and result in higher rates of retention in treatment,&#xD;
      lower rates of drug use and lower rates of HIV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, the research team in Jakarta will recruit 300 injecting drug users&#xD;
      as they enter treatment at the Drug Dependence Hospital and its five satellite programs.&#xD;
      Following informed consent procedures, research staff will randomize participants to either&#xD;
      the BDRC intervention or to treatment as usual. All subjects will be fuly assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will be build on collaborations that have been established with the&#xD;
      Indonesian Investigator Adhi Nurhidayat,MD during his NIDA INVEST Fellowship at University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania when he spent time with David Metzger, PhD and George Woody, MD. It will also&#xD;
      extend findings from a WHO study on substitution therapy of opiates and HIV/AIDS that was&#xD;
      completed by Riza Sarasvita, MS,MHS (former NIDA Humphrey Fellow at Johns Hopkins University)&#xD;
      and her colleagues at The Drug Dependence Hospital Jakarta, Indonesia.&#xD;
