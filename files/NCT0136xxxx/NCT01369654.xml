  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct formative research to gain an understanding of patients'&#xD;
      needs and desires regarding elective Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO) decision making,&#xD;
      and to develop and pilot test a BSO Decision Support Guide, in preparation for a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial of the effect of this decision aid on decision quality and use of BSO. The&#xD;
      proposed study will consist of 3 phases. In phase 1, the investigators plan to conduct focus&#xD;
      groups among women who have had a hysterectomy with or without bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) to gain an understanding of what they understood about BSO and&#xD;
      its possible outcomes at the time of their hysterectomy and what they would have liked to&#xD;
      have known, the extent and manner in which they were included in decision making regarding&#xD;
      BSO, and how they feel about the decision now. The investigators also will collect&#xD;
      qualitative data from women who are scheduled for hysterectomy and currently facing the&#xD;
      decision whether or not to undergo elective BSO. In phase 2, the investigators plan to create&#xD;
      a BSO Decision Support Guide using information obtained from the literature, from our&#xD;
      formative research, and the experience of providers who have counseled women about this&#xD;
      choice. In phase 3, the investigators plan to pilot test the BSO Decision Support Guide among&#xD;
      women scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for benign conditions to assess its usefulness and&#xD;
      usability for patients and their providers and to prepare for a randomized study of its&#xD;
      impact on decision quality and use of BSO. 62 women who are scheduled to undergo hysterectomy&#xD;
      for a non-cancerous uterine condition will participate in the pilot study. These women will&#xD;
      participate in a baseline interview, during which they will be provided access to the BSO&#xD;
      Decision Support Guide, and 2 follow up telephone interviews (one as they are making their&#xD;
      final BSO decision and a second after they have undergone and recovered from their&#xD;
      hysterectomy (with or without BSO). Data will be used to generate the final version of the&#xD;
      Decision Support Guide, to finalize evaluation measures for future studies of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the guide, and to determine effect sizes for the outcomes of knowledge, BSO&#xD;
      use, decision satisfaction and decisional conflict.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1) Conduct formative research to assess how sociodemographically diverse women&#xD;
      who will be undergoing hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions view elective BSO and to&#xD;
      assess their information needs and desires regarding shared decision making in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2) Create a BSO Decision Support Guide using information obtained from the&#xD;
      literature, from our formative research, and the experience of providers who have counseled&#xD;
      women about this choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3) Pilot test the BSO Decision Support Guide among women scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      hysterectomy for benign conditions to assess its usefulness and usability for patients and&#xD;
      their providers and to prepare for a randomized study of its impact on decision quality and&#xD;
      use of BSO.&#xD;
