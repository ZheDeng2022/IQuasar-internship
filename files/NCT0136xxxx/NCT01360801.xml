  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to test the hypothesis that the improved version of high definition&#xD;
      white light endoscopes and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are more accurate in detecting residual&#xD;
      Barrett's Metaplasia and Dysplasia disease after previous resection or ablation treatments&#xD;
      than current versions of these endoscopes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) dysplasia as the original indication for&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing any type of endoscopic BE resection or ablation treatment including RFA,&#xD;
             cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or EMR, or combinations of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt;1cm of circumferential, peninsular, or island-type BE on prior endoscopy or ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Deferral Criteria: This category is for patients in two specific situations, 1) Erosive&#xD;
        esophagitis, and, 2) presence of a nodule suspicious for the presence of neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Erosive esophagitis: patients found to have erosive esophagitis, will be deferred for&#xD;
             up to 3 months from their Index study procedure, to permit more aggressive medical&#xD;
             therapy to heal the erosive esophagitis. After healing, the Index study procedure will&#xD;
             be performed up to 3 months later, and the follow-up endoscopy (and study closure)&#xD;
             performed 3 to 6 months after that (total of no more than 9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of nodule suspicious for neoplasia: for patients found to have such nodular&#xD;
             lesions, the Index study procedure will be deferred for 3 months, while Endoscopic&#xD;
             Mucosal Resection is performed and subsequently heals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Only one deferral per patient is permitted, and this one deferral is allowed only for&#xD;
        these specific criteria. The end of the study will be defined by the time of follow-up of&#xD;
        the last patient who was not deferred; any deferred patients who have not completed&#xD;
        follow-up procedures by that time, may miss their follow-up visit as part of the study.&#xD;
        (This is to prevent the possibility of delaying the close of the study due to deferral of a&#xD;
        procedure late in the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete eradication of BE documented by biopsies in 3 or more previous endoscopic&#xD;
             procedures performed after resection/ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain biopsies due to anticoagulation, varices, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worse than Grade C erosive esophagitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 3 weeks from previous endoscopy with biopsy or 6 weeks from previous&#xD;
             endoscopic therapy (ablation or resection).&#xD;
