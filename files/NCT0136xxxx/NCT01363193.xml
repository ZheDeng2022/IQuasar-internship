  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard weight-based IV heparin for normal weight patients is based on actual body weight&#xD;
      (ABW). However, no well-defined guidelines have been established for patients considered to&#xD;
      be obese or morbidly obese. In current practice, the calculated ABW based heparin initial&#xD;
      bolus dose and infusion rates are quite high, and therefore often not used for obese/morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients for fear of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin is distributed in the body approximately the same as blood and does not get&#xD;
      distributed to adipose tissue. There are some studies suggesting that lean body weight (LBW)&#xD;
      might be a better basis for dosing heparin. LBW is a calculated weight that excludes the&#xD;
      weight of fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intravenous heparin dosing based on the Lean body weight&#xD;
      of obese/morbidly obese patients would be safe and effective in achieving a therapeutic level&#xD;
      of heparin in 24 hours compared to the usual practice in this patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unfractionated Heparin has been used as an anticoagulant in various disease states and&#xD;
      conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE),&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and peripheral vascular disease. Prior&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that a weight-based heparin (WBH) dosing regimen is superior to a&#xD;
      fixed dosing regimen (e.g. 5000 units bolus and 1000 units/hour) in achieving a therapeutic&#xD;
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) more quickly and with fewer complications (1,2).&#xD;
      The importance of achieving anticoagulation to a targeted aPTT range within 24 hours after&#xD;
      starting intravenous heparin infusion has demonstrated a therapeutic benefit (1,3,30-31). WBH&#xD;
      dosing is now the standard of care for intravenous heparin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have assessed the benefit of WBH utilizing the patients' actual body weight&#xD;
      (ABW), but have not significantly considered the issue of dosing and titrating WBH in the&#xD;
      obese and morbidly obese (O/MO) patient population (1,16-17, 32). There are few studies that&#xD;
      have examined the effect of obesity in heparin dosing, and there are wide variations in how&#xD;
      obesity is defined and how (if at all) WBH nomograms based on ABW are adjusted in this&#xD;
      patient population (4,12,16-18, 23, 25). In addition, there are but a few case reports&#xD;
      addressing WBH-dosing in the O/MO patient population according to a more modern definition of&#xD;
      obesity. These limitations make it difficult to apply in the clinical setting (16-18, 21-28).&#xD;
      In current practice, ABW-based heparin bolus doses and infusion rates are quite high and&#xD;
      therefore often not used for O/MO patients due to fears of over-anticoagulation and of&#xD;
      serious bleeding. Studies have in fact reported a higher potential of supratherapeutic aPTT&#xD;
      in the bariatrically-challenged population (19, 23-24, 26-27). Therefore, it remains&#xD;
      uncertain as to how to optimize intravenous heparin dosing in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of distribution (Vd) of heparin is similar to blood volume and adipose tissue has&#xD;
      little vasculature to account for heparin's distribution (5-11). LBW has recently been&#xD;
      proposed to be a better metric for dosing heparin in obese/morbidly obese patients&#xD;
      (14-15,20,29,34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intravenous heparin (IVH) dosing based on LBW of O/MO&#xD;
      patients would be safe and effective in achieving aPTT within 24 hours compared to the usual&#xD;
      practice in this patient population. In addition, the investigators postulate that it would&#xD;
      be cost-effective since it would reduce the number of blood draws and laboratory tests (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will involve the departments of emergency medicine, internal medicine&#xD;
      (sections of cardiology and critical care), laboratory, nursing, and pharmacy. Those patients&#xD;
      who are O/MO according to 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) definition (BMI &gt; 30) (33) and&#xD;
      have an IVH order will be enrolled to receive heparin via a LBW-based nomogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a comparison, the investigators will also have the calculated initial bolus and infusion&#xD;
      doses that would have been given in a traditional ABW-based treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A signed consent form from the patients will be obtained in order to use the LBW-based&#xD;
      heparin nomogram. In accordance with the standard weight-based heparin protocol and 2008&#xD;
      CHEST guidelines, the modified version of current Mercy Nazareth Hospital (MNH) weight-based&#xD;
      heparin protocol will be followed in all other aspects beyond the dosing nomogram. An aPTT&#xD;
      tracking form and data collection tool will be utilized to monitor and gather results.&#xD;

    <description>For patients who meet the inclusion criteria including body mass index of 30 and greater (and do not have any exclusion criteria), will have intravenous weight-based heparin (unfractionated heparin) dose based on their Lean body weight.&#xD;
Lean Body Weight is based on the formula by Janmahasatian et al. 2005. Calculated by a computer program; Male = [9270 x weight (kg)] / [6680+216 x BMI] Female = [9270 x weight (kg)] / [8780+244 x BMI]</description>
