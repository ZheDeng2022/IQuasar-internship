  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of morbid obesity (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2) is increasing rapidly in the UK, but the&#xD;
      investigators lack a coherent strategy for detailed assessment and treatment of the&#xD;
      individuals affected, who are at high risk of morbidity and early mortality. The&#xD;
      investigators already know that more than 1 in 20 severely-obese individuals have a simple&#xD;
      genetic cause of their obesity (usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Bariatric&#xD;
      surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity and certain surgeries can result&#xD;
      in the remission of type 2 diabetes. However, some patient fail to achieve the weight loss or&#xD;
      experience complications and re-operations. The investigators are unable to predict the&#xD;
      outcomes of bariatric surgery particularly in relation to type 2 diabetes remission which is&#xD;
      crucial for the assessment of risk to benefit balance before wider future applications of the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to investigate the mechanism underlying Type 2 diabetes remission&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery by A) examining the effect of Mendelian forms of obesity and diabetes&#xD;
      on T2D remission, B) studying changes in expression profiling patterns in insulin-responsive&#xD;
      tissues, C) identifying of eQTLs, and of other genetic variations affecting T2D remission and&#xD;
      D) studying the role of epigenetic variation in T2D remission.&#xD;

      SUBJECTS and SAMPLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients (n=2000) presenting to Obesity, Endocrine and Medical Clinics at Imperial&#xD;
      College Healthcare NHS Trust will be recruited at initial presentation to the service. The&#xD;
      patients will be included for this study are patients with BMI &gt;28 kg/m2 and aged between&#xD;
      18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo blood, saliva, urine and faeces sampling. Patients will also be asked&#xD;
      to consent for muscle, liver, subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue collected at the time of&#xD;
      surgery. If any of the patients have to undergo a re-operation then blood sample, muscle,&#xD;
      liver, subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue will need to be collected again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collections of samples from other centres ( e.g Gothenburg) may be analysed in a similar way&#xD;
      alongside the samples specified here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use methods representing the state-of-the-art at the time of the&#xD;
      analysis. Current plans are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard current methods will be used to extract DNA from saliva or blood and all patients&#xD;
      will be screened for monogenic obesity and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA will be extracted from blood and tissues to perform genome-wide expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be used for performing genome-wide targeted SNP genotyping for the identification of&#xD;
      eQTLs, and of genetic variations influencing the outcomes of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be extracted from blood and tissues using standard methods to perform epigenetic&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to bring an early morning urine sample as well as a faeces sample for&#xD;
      later metabonomic/ metagenomic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be used for measuring C-peptide, fasting glucose and insulin and&#xD;
      other biomarkers as they become available. Subject's weight will be taken at each of the&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Subjects will also be analysed for a range of phenotypes concerned with&#xD;
      obesity and its co-morbidity as well as for psychological and related outcomes.&#xD;

      QUESTIONNAIRES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the 1st study visit and at 12 months post-surgery, subjects will complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires to assess eating behaviour and personality measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ) - to identify number of binges per 28&#xD;
           days (Fairburn CG, Beglin S Int Jour. Eat Dis 16:363370, 1994) (Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) to measure restraint, emotional and external&#xD;
           influences on eating behaviour (Wardle J Psychosom Res 31:1619, 1987) (Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) - to measure restraint, disinhibition and hunger&#xD;
      (Stunkard &amp; Messick. J Psychosom Res 29:7183, 1985) (Appendix 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Barratt Impulsiveness Scale to measure impulsivity which has been linked to overeating&#xD;
      (Patton JM et al J Clin Psych 51: 76874, 1995; Yeomans MR et al. Appetite. 50:46976, 2008)&#xD;
      (Appendix 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. PANAS - questionnaire measuring positive and negative affect (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen. J&#xD;
      Pers Soc Psych 54(6): 10631070, 1988) (Appendix 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence - a questionnaire assessing current smoking&#xD;
      behaviour (Heatherton et al. British Journal of Addiction 86: 1119-1127, 1991) (Appendix 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire (IWQOLLite) - a questionnaire measuring&#xD;
      the change in subjective quality of life after bariatric surgery (Kolotkin et al. Obesity&#xD;
      Research 9: 102111, 2001) (Appendix 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. SF-36 - to assess health of individual patients, to evaluate cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      treatment and to monitor and compare disease burden (McHorney and Ware, 1995) (Appendix 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - to indentify psychiatric disorder or depression&#xD;
      (Spinhoven et al., 1997) (Appendix 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. AUDIT drug and alcohol questionnaire (to pick up the early signs of hazardous and harmful&#xD;
      drinking and identify mild dependence (Saunders et al., 1993) (Appendix 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SALIVA SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be collected using Oragene DNA vials. The acquisition of the saliva&#xD;
      sample is done accordingly to the manufacturer's instructions. The patient should not eat,&#xD;
      drink, smoke or chew gum for 30 minutes before giving the saliva sample. The patient has to&#xD;
      spit into the container until the amount of liquid saliva (not bubbles) reaches at least the&#xD;
      level shown in the manufacturer's instructions. The member of staff puts the container on a&#xD;
      flat surface, screws the cap onto the container and needs to make sure that the cap is closed&#xD;
      tightly. The container has to be mixed gently for at least 10 seconds and kept at room&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLOOD SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visit 1-7, venous blood samples will be taken. No more than 100 mls of blood will be&#xD;
      taken from each participant during the entire study (no more than 15 mls on each visit).&#xD;
      Standard methods will be used to obtain DNA, RNA and serum from blood. Plasma levels of&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and C-peptide will be measured by immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URINE AND FAECES SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and faeces will be collected for metabolomic analysis in 10ml and 20ml Sterilin&#xD;
      containers by patients. faeces samples will be collected in sterile containers containing 10&#xD;
      mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (containing, per liter, 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44&#xD;
      g of Na2HPO4, and 0.24 g of KH2PO4 [pH 7.2]) and stored in home freezers until brought to the&#xD;
      laboratory where samples were stored at -80°C until further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TISSUE SAMPLING DURING SURGERY&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies will be taken with scissors and/or Harmonic scalpel (ultrasound instrument for&#xD;
      dissection). Muscle tissue will be taken from the abdominal wall at a troachar site. Liver&#xD;
      tissue will be taken from the edge of the left liver lobe via needle biopsy. Subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      tissue can be taken from an incision for a troachar (about 2 g) and visceral fat tissue can&#xD;
      be taken from the major omentum at the greater curvature of the stomach. This will be done at&#xD;
      the time of the surgery, and again in any patients requiring re-operation. Standard methods&#xD;
      will be used to store the tissues and to stabilize and purify DNA and RNA from the tissues&#xD;
      for the purpose of our study.&#xD;
