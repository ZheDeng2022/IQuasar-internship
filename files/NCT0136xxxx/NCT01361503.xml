    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to conduct magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) and&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scans to assess the structural and neurochemical profile of the brain in 20&#xD;
      children and adolescents, 6-17 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). For comparison,&#xD;
      MRS and MRI will also be obtained from 10 healthy control subjects, matched to the 20&#xD;
      subjects with ASD in age, sex, dexterity, and IQ. All eligible subjects will be administered&#xD;
      a detailed assessment battery consisting of cognitive assessments (neuropsychological battery&#xD;
      including subsets of the DANVA2 and the CANTAB) and measures of psychosocial functioning&#xD;
      (SAICA and M-FES). The study includes 1-3 visits for the screening period at Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital (approximately 4 hours of assessments) and one scanning visit at McLean&#xD;
      Hospital (approximately 1.5 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that youth with ASD versus controls will exhibit increased&#xD;
      glutamate concentrations, reflecting glutamatergic overactivity, and increased Cho&#xD;
      concentrations, suggesting neuronal abnormality. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that compared to neurotypical controls, the structural integrity of white mater tracts will&#xD;
      be disrupted in ASD.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from current patients of The Alan and Lorraine Bressler Clinic&#xD;
        for Autism Spectrum Disorders. We propose to contact by letter (via regular mail or email)&#xD;
        or telephone patients who have been identified by clinicians as expressing interest in the&#xD;
        study. Subjects who have participated in previous protocols in our program may also be&#xD;
        eligible to participate in this study. We propose to contact by letter or telephone past&#xD;
        study participants who have expressed interested in being contacted about future studies&#xD;
        they may be eligible for in our office. If a potential subject's clinician ascertains that&#xD;
        the patient has an interest in study participation, the clinician will only offer contact&#xD;
        information for the study to the patient and/or the patient's parents. The patient and/or&#xD;
        parent can then contact the study coordinator for more information on the actual study.&#xD;
