    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine the impact of P-552 oral rinse&#xD;
      on salivary volume after administration of a single dose of P-552and versus vehicle rinse.&#xD;
      Changes in oral mucosal wetness will be assessed via collection of salivary output and via&#xD;
      measurement of oral wetness using the Periotron 8000 instrument.&#xD;

             urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has minimal level of unstimulated whole mouth salivary flow (greater than or equal to&#xD;
             0.05 milliliters [i.e., 0.05 grams] per 5 minutes) at the screening visit.&#xD;

             the European criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group European&#xD;
             Cooperative Community Classification Criteria for Sjogren's Syndrome.&#xD;

             study visit and until 2 hours after dosing at study visits; and is unable to take the&#xD;
             last nighttime dose at a standard time throughout the study.&#xD;

             affect the safety of the subject or might exacerbate during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has acutely infected salivary glands (with or without pain) or suspected closure of&#xD;
             the salivary glands.&#xD;
