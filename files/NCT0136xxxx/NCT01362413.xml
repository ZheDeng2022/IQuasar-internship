      The aim of the study is to determine whether the evaluation of pro-osteogenic activity of&#xD;
      autologous serum may predict the effectiveness of platelet gel in regenerating bone tissue in&#xD;
      patients with nonunions of long bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will be collected before the surgery, and their pro-osteogenic activity will be&#xD;
      evaluated by using a bioactivity test (mineralization assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether the pro-osteogenic activity of the serum is able to&#xD;
      discriminate between individuals who will achieve or will not achieve bone consolidation, the&#xD;
      laboratory results will be correlated with clinical and radiographic results at 12 months,&#xD;
      when patients will be considered as healed or not healed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pseudarthrosis (or 'nonunions') is defined as a bone movement which occurs after about 6&#xD;
      months from the traumatic event as consequence of the inadequate healing of a fracture. The&#xD;
      use of regenerative medicine for treating recalcitrant pseudarthrosis is considered a&#xD;
      promising strategy to promote bone consolidation. Among the various approaches used, the&#xD;
      local cell therapy based on autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), combined with or&#xD;
      without growth factors, has been extensively used. MSC reside within the stromal compartment&#xD;
      of bone marrow which may be obtained from the iliac crest. Growth factors may be discharged&#xD;
      from platelet gel (PG) which is obtained after activation of autologous platelet&#xD;
      concentrates. Nevertheless, the results of recent clinical studies show that the above&#xD;
      mentioned regenerative approach shows a failure rate of approximately 30% (Calori et al,&#xD;
      2008). The availability of a laboratory test which may predict the regenerative capacity of&#xD;
      the PG may help the orthopaedic surgeon in addressing the decisions regarding the&#xD;
      regenerative approach, e.g. to use or non use autologous platelet concentrates or to enhance&#xD;
      the use of autologous derivatives with recombinant factors.The rationale for the use of&#xD;
      platelet concentrates in pseudarthrosis is the significant reduction of osteoinductive growth&#xD;
      factors observed at the lesion site (Gandhi et al., 2005). Platelet gel mimics what happens&#xD;
      physiologically after any bone injury, when platelets are entrapped in a clot within a fibrin&#xD;
      matrix. Platelet activation determines the release of various growth factors promoting bone&#xD;
      healing. The optimal level and ratio of growth factors and their synergistic effects should&#xD;
      be more efficient than single recombinant molecules, even though no data are available on the&#xD;
      most relevant molecules and on their optimal amount. In this context, the in vitro&#xD;
      mineralization assay could be a valid tool to assess the pro-osteogenic activity of platelet&#xD;
      gel, thus obviating the measurement of the myriad of platelet-derived substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the evaluation of pro-osteogenic activity of&#xD;
      autologous serum may predict the effectiveness of PG in the regeneration of bone tissue in&#xD;
      patients with nonunions of long bones. The rationale is based on the following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in 30% of long bone nonunions treated with PG, bone consolidation is not obtained&#xD;
           (Calori et al, 2008);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the proportion of growth factors in serum is comparable to that observed in platelet gel&#xD;
           after activation, even if the concentration is lower;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the autologous serum is able to support the 'in vitro' osteogenic differentiation of&#xD;
           MSCs and the formation of mineral nodules (mineralization assay) (Granchi et al, 2010);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation between 'in vitro' mineralization and regenerative capacity has been&#xD;
           demonstrated in various experimental models (De Bari et al, 2008);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preliminary data obtained in our lab showed that in patients affected by congenital&#xD;
           pseudarthrosis of the tibia the presence of osteoinductive growth factors in serum is an&#xD;
           essential requirement to warrant the effectiveness of the local cell therapy with MSC&#xD;
           and PG (submitted paper).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the ability of the autologous serum in inducing the mineralization in&#xD;
      vitro the investigators will use a bioactivity test (mineralization assay). For this purpose&#xD;
      serum samples of patients candidates to the treatment with MSC and PG will be collected the&#xD;
      day before the surgery and used for cultivating normal MSC, whose ability to mineralize in&#xD;
      vitro will be previously verified in standard culture conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analysis will be conducted in order to determine whether the pro-osteogenic&#xD;
      properties are maintained over time, and serum samples will be collected the 1 month before&#xD;
      the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether the pro-osteogenic activity of the serum is able to predict and&#xD;
      discriminate between individuals who achieve or not achieve bone consolidation, the&#xD;
      laboratory results will be correlated with clinical and radiographic results at 12 months,&#xD;
      when patients will be considered as healed or not healed.&#xD;

    <description>The pro-osteogenic ability of autologous serum will be evaluated by using a bioactivity test (mineralization assay). For this purpose serum samples will be collected 1 day before the surgery and used for culturing osteogenic cells. The ability of inducing the mineralization will be assessed after 10 days of culture.&#xD;
At 12 months, clinical outcome will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
anteroposterior and lateral X-rays to assess the continuity of bone in the various plans;&#xD;
semeiotics of the consolidation;&#xD;
assessment of pain during loading (Visual Analogue Scale).</description>
