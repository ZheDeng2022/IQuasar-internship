  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of intravenous and subcutaneous&#xD;
      administered golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, randomized (study drug route of administration assigned by chance), open label&#xD;
      (both physician and patient know that golimumab has been assigned), study of golimumab in&#xD;
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (how the body effects the drug) and pharmacodynamic (how the drug effects the&#xD;
      body) effects of golimumab administered through a vein in the arm or by injection under the&#xD;
      skin. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and&#xD;
      evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the occurrence and&#xD;
      severity of adverse events. The study will also assess the clinical effects of golimumab on&#xD;
      RA. The study is planned for approximately 45 patients, which are randomized at a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive golimumab SC or IV. Male or female patients who have been diagnosed with RA for at&#xD;
      least 3 months and who are 18 years of age or older may be able to participate. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) injections of 100 mg golimumab every 4 weeks through Week 20 or intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administrations of 2 mg/kg golimumab on Days 1 and 85.&#xD;
