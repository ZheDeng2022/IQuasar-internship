      The purpose of this study is to determine whether contact sensitization occurs to the skin of&#xD;
      normal healthy human subjects, by repetitive application of IV Clear™, Tegaderm CHG™ and&#xD;
      Silicone Vehicle Control dressings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single center, within-subject randomized study design in healthy adult subjects. Qualified&#xD;
      subjects will complete three phases of the study (induction, rest and challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for irritation, adhesion and pain upon removal will be collected from the individual&#xD;
      patch sites.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at induction phase (evaluated before reapplication; 9 applications over 3 weeks, reapplied after every 48 or 72 hrs) and challenge phase (single 48-hr application of test article to naive sites and evaluation 30 mins, 24 and 48 hrs post-removal</time_frame>
    <description>Irritation assessed at the induction phase will be scored on a Berger and Bowman Scale. Irritation assessed at the challenge phase will be scored on a defined scale measuring erythema reactions, ranging from no reaction to strong erythema.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adhesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at each 72 hour evaluation over three weeks, and once for a single 48-hour challenge application</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion was scored as follows:&#xD;
0 = no lift from skin (≥90% adherence)&#xD;
= some edges only lifting from skin (≥75% to ˂90% adherence)&#xD;
= less than half of the test article lifing (≥50% to ˂75% adherence)&#xD;
= more than half of the test article lifing but not detached (≥25% to ˂50% adherence)&#xD;
= test article detached (0% adherence)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain upon removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed by subjects at 72 hour evaluations over three weeks and a single 48-hour challenge application</time_frame>
    <description>Any pain experienced during removal will be rated on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain.</description>
