  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, administering infusions of AUY922 with&#xD;
      hormonal therapy (letrozole) and oral targeted drug (lapatinib) will have on the patients&#xD;
      with advanced breast cancer known as ER+ HER2 +.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose and schedule of AUY922 is the MTD dose identified in the phase I, given as 1 hour&#xD;
      infusion weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II component will have a 2 stage design single arm design. (Section 9.0). Overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) is the primary endpoint. Estimated N=40 (12 in first stage) .A total of&#xD;
      39 response-evaluable participants is required. In the first stage, 12 response-evaluable&#xD;
      participants will be accrued; if there are 3 or fewer CR+PRs, the study will stop for&#xD;
      futility. There is a 55% probability of stopping early if, in fact, the ORR is 28%. If there&#xD;
      are 4 or more CR+PRs, the study will proceed to the second stage and an additional 27&#xD;
      response-evaluable participants will be accrued. We will accrue 1 additional patient (then&#xD;
      the needed 39 to account for attrition)&#xD;

             first administration of AUY922 (≤ 72 hours prior to dosing) in all pre-menopausal&#xD;
