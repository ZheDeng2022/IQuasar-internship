  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers are among the most frequent leading causes of death in Taiwan, and many of them show&#xD;
      their respective unique epidemiological and pathophysiological features in Taiwanese&#xD;
      population. One of the distinguishing features of cancers includes their potential to&#xD;
      metastasize outside the primary tumor. Pleural cavity and peritoneum are two of the most&#xD;
      frequent sites of metastases when serosal surfaces are involved. The prognoses of such&#xD;
      patients are extremely poor with a median survival of months. The understandings of cancer&#xD;
      biology of tumor metastasis demand more in-depth studies at the molecular and cell levels.&#xD;
      Studies based on cell culture are excellent approaches for this purpose as the cell culture&#xD;
      provides a relevant and renewable model for studying the pathological and molecular changes&#xD;
      underlying human malignant tumors.&#xD;

      Due to their easy accessibility, pleural effusions and ascites are two important clinical&#xD;
      sources of metastatic cancer cells, which upon isolation, permit comparative studies between&#xD;
      the biology nature of primary tumor and metastatic ones. In this study, we will try to&#xD;
      isolate cancer cells from human malignant effusions, said to be pleural effusions and/or&#xD;
      ascites. We will establish phenotypic alterations along the progression of malignant tumors&#xD;
      with serosal metastasis, with special emphasis on expression of some proteases, laminin&#xD;
      receptors and transcription factors involved in the process of invasion and metastasis. We&#xD;
      would also perform clinical correlations, including tumor type, staging, status of lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis and histopathological differentiation and grading, etc.&#xD;
