      The overall goal of this proposal is to study quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG ) as&#xD;
      a method for the detection of antidepressant treatment response. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed a QEEG algorithm called &quot;cordance&quot; that appears to provide much the same&#xD;
      information about brain function as PET or SPECT scanning, and has shown patterns of brain&#xD;
      function that appear to be indicative of depression. Of greatest interest is that these&#xD;
      patterns appear to normalize in response to antidepressant treatment.&#xD;

      Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Cordance. There is considerable evidence indicating that abnormal slow-wave activity in&#xD;
      the EEG is caused by partial cortical deafferentation. Despite this fact, no clinically&#xD;
      relevant measure of deafferentation has been available. The investigators sought to develop&#xD;
      such a measure by examining young and old subjects with white-matter lesions that presumably&#xD;
      undercut the cerebral cortex, as well as subjects with several different types of brain&#xD;
      disease who had undergone SPECT scanning. The investigators discovered an indicator termed&#xD;
      discordance, that is characteristic of cortex undercut by white-matter lesions, or that is&#xD;
      hypoperfused for any reason. The investigators also discovered an indicator the investigators&#xD;
      termed concordance , which is characteristic of cortex that has normal perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This overall technique for the non-invasive assessment of afferent function, cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion, and metabolism the investigators call cordance mapping, which is the subject of a&#xD;
      United States patent. A detailed explanation of the formulae used to calculate cordance is&#xD;
      provided in the manuscripts referenced above. The first of these two manuscripts contains&#xD;
      illustrative examples where discordance was useful in detection of white-matter lesions or&#xD;
      degenerative disease. The second manuscript shows a quantitative analysis of cordance and&#xD;
      HMPAO-SPECT data from 27 patients with a variety of conditions, and demonstrates that&#xD;
      cordance is superior to conventional EEG measures in its correlations with relative&#xD;
      perfusion. Like SPECT, cordance measurements vary according to the patients' state, but has&#xD;
      high test-retest reliability for detecting brain lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Differential diagnosis of depression. One promising application of cordance is to the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness. A &quot;normal&quot; cordance pattern is one of&#xD;
      posterior dominant concordance with cordance values near zero in the frontal regions. The&#xD;
      investigators have reported a &quot;classic&quot; cordance pattern for subjects with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (DAT), in which there is parietal discordance (in the beta or theta bands) in&#xD;
      conjunction with alpha concordance that has shifted from the occipital to the central head&#xD;
      regions. This finding is consistent with the pattern seen commonly on PET and SPECT, in which&#xD;
      there is parietal hypoperfusion or hypometabolism with preserved metabolism over the central&#xD;
      head regions (the motor strip), which is known to be less affected by Alzheimer's changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In evaluating treatment results, the investigators will need to determine what effect&#xD;
      medication status has upon QEEG measures. Although results thus far suggest that there is&#xD;
      little significant effect , the investigators will carefully examine the effects of&#xD;
      antidepressant and antianxiety medications further&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to examine cordance in 26 subjects undergoing antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment, and to use this neurophysiologic method to assess the response to treatment in&#xD;
      depressed patients. The project has the following three specific aims: 1) to identify&#xD;
      physiologic indices of fluoxetine treatment response using quantitative EEG; 2) to detect how&#xD;
      early in the course of fluoxetine treatment response this response may be detected; 3) to&#xD;
      determine if QEEG measures of response distinguish subjects who are not responding to&#xD;
      treatment from those who are responding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will tests the hypothesis that those subjects receiving active treatment who show&#xD;
      clinical improvement will demonstrate normalization of cordance maps. Conversely, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that those subjects who either do not show improvement, or who have&#xD;
      some improvement on placebo, will not show normalization of cordance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine these hypotheses with a four-step plan. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 26 patients with major depression and perform baseline assessments&#xD;
      of the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as QEEG studies. Second, the investigators&#xD;
      will enroll these patients in an eight-week, double-blind placebo-controlled study in which&#xD;
      they will receive either fluoxetine 20 mg. daily or placebo. Third, the investigators will&#xD;
      follow subjects with ratings of mood and serial QEEG studies to determine if there is an&#xD;
      association between resolution of depressive symptoms and QEEG cordance changes. Fourth, the&#xD;
      investigators will enroll subjects in open-label treatment at the end of the eight weeks and&#xD;
      examine cordance in those who previously received placebo and, where appropriate, in those&#xD;
      receiving fluoxetine 40 mg. daily.&#xD;

          -  Subjects also will have a score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale of &gt;&#xD;
             18 (with item #1 &gt; 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will be under the care of a clinician not affiliated with the study at&#xD;
             the time of entry into the study, and through the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have no serious medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude patients also meeting criteria for the following groups of axis I&#xD;
             diagnoses: delirium or dementia, substance-related disorders, schizophrenia or other&#xD;
             psychotic disorders, or eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, patients meeting criteria for cluster A or B axis II diagnoses will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of current or past active suicidal ideation, or suicide&#xD;
             attempts will be excluded, as will patients who previously have failed to respond to&#xD;
             an adequate clinical trial of fluoxetine, or have failed to tolerate the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had suboptimal trials, however, may still be considered for the&#xD;
