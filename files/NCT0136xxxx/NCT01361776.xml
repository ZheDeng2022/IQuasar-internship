    <textblock>
      Antibody titers after tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination are less in elderly and&#xD;
      vaccination breakthroughs are more common in this age group. This has prompted Swedish&#xD;
      authorities to recommend an additional dose in the initial vaccination schedule (= 0+30+90&#xD;
      days instead of the usually recommended 0+30 days. The investigators intend to evaluate this&#xD;
      regime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk for TBE increases in Sweden. Together with an increased awareness of the possibility&#xD;
      to acquire protection by vaccination, this has led to an increase in the number of doses of&#xD;
      the vaccine distributed in Sweden each year -now being approximately 400.000. The first year,&#xD;
      two doses with an interval of 1 month is recommended for the general population, followed by&#xD;
      a third dose approximately one year later and an additional booster dose three years after&#xD;
      the third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show that the antibody titers against TBE are substantially less in an older&#xD;
      population. This is in line with the present recommendation from Austria that booster&#xD;
      intervals should be shortened to 3 years in the age group 60+. It is also in line with a&#xD;
      report of vaccination failures where 13/27 patients were older than 60 years According to a&#xD;
      study by Jilkowa et al, 18 % (38/185) in the age group 60+ did not achieve putative levels of&#xD;
      antibody titers after the first two doses. Therefore, the manufacturer of Encepur recommends&#xD;
      a total of three doses to this age group using the same regimen as with &quot;accelerated&#xD;
      vaccination schedule (0+7+21 days). Unfortunately, GMT (geometrical mean of titers) after 3&#xD;
      doses with the accelerated schedule are not superior to 2 doses given at 0+30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manufacturer of FSME-immun instead recommends that serology should be checked one month&#xD;
      after the second dose and that a third dose should be given if titers are not sufficient&#xD;
      (0+30+60 days). Unfortunately, determinations of titers in a large number of samples put&#xD;
      severe strain on logistics and is not feasible in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to try to improve immunity in the age group 60+ , the Department of Communicable&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention in Stockholm therefore recommends a third dose two months&#xD;
      after the first two doses to the age group 60+ (0+30+60 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The investigators intend to give FSME-immune to 3 groups with varying&#xD;
      vaccination schedules ( 0+7+21, 0+30 or 0+30+90. 50 participants will be randomized to each&#xD;
      group. Half of them will be between 50-59 years and half will be at least 60 years old. A&#xD;
      younger age group (50 participants between 18-49 years) will serve as controls and will be&#xD;
      given FSME-immune according to standard recommendations (0+30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples (10 ml of blood) will be obtained at five times: 0,60,120,360 and 400 days&#xD;
      after first dose Samples will be analysed for neutralising antibodies at the Swedish&#xD;
      institute for Infectious disease control - other options possible.&#xD;
