  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A vaccine which interrupts malaria transmission is a critical tool to achieve the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of eradication of this disease. Transmission blocking vaccines work by inducing antibody&#xD;
      in vaccinated individuals that inhibits the development of malaria parasites in the mosquito,&#xD;
      thus interrupting the cycle of transmission to the next human host. Efficacy of these&#xD;
      vaccines may be estimated by in vitro membrane feeding assays using immune sera and&#xD;
      laboratory strain mosquitoes, but these assays need to be qualified to determine to what&#xD;
      extent they are predictive of transmission blocking in the field. Clinical trials of&#xD;
      transmission blocking vaccines are also anticipated and have started in this community. This&#xD;
      protocol will use a nested casecontrol cohort design to compare results of mosquito feeding&#xD;
      assays in a malaria exposed population in Bancoumana and surrounding villages in Mali.&#xD;
      Households will be identified using census data and individuals will be consented for&#xD;
      participation. Malaria smears will be obtained at monthly visits, and gametocytemic&#xD;
      individuals will be asked to participate in direct feed experiments using insectary-raised&#xD;
      mosquitoes. Infectivity in these mosquitoes will be compared against those of mosquitoes fed&#xD;
      in membrane feeding assays in Mali and the USA. Data will also be obtained on gametocyte and&#xD;
      parasite carriage rates through the year. A total of 250 volunteers from Bancoumana, ages 3&#xD;
      months to 50 years, were initially enrolled in 2011. In 2012, an additional 250 adults from&#xD;
      Bancoumana were enrolled and participants older than 5 years of age who were enrolled in 2011&#xD;
      and wanted to continue participation were re-enrolled into the study. A transmission blocking&#xD;
      vaccine trial started in May 2013, and has enrolled participants from this adult cohort in&#xD;
      that study. Up to 50 new adults from Bancoumana and surrounding villages will be enrolled in&#xD;
      2014 and those volunteers previously enrolled into the study over theage of 5 years old will&#xD;
      be offered re-enrollment into the study.&#xD;
