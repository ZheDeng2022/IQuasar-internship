      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of femur exposed to vibration on the rest&#xD;
      muscle electrical activity of hip adductors in cases with postmenopausal osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients who will be admitted to the investigators clinic for out-patients and whose&#xD;
      bone densitometric measurement will be made with a prediagnosis postmenopausal osteoporosis,&#xD;
      a total of 80 voluntaries [40 having postmenopausal osteoporosis (femur neck or total hip T&#xD;
      score &lt; -2.0) and 40 Controls (Hip and lumbar bone mineral density normal)] are planned to&#xD;
      include in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the left hip bone mineral density (BMD) and BMC is measured in all cases, whole body&#xD;
      vibration will be applied in PMO groups and Controls. The rest muscle electrical activity of&#xD;
      left hip muscles will be evaluated at pre-treatment, post-treatment and, during treatment in&#xD;
      patients with PMO and then their data will be compared with Controls data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma sclerostin level will be measured before and 10th minute after vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will stand on vibration plate. WBV will be applied at a frequency of 40 Hz and&#xD;
      amplitude of 2 mm for 30 + 30 seconds. WBV will be applied one session only. The left hip BMD&#xD;
      and BMC will be evaluated by bone densitometer (Norland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest muscle electrical activity of hip adductor muscles at rest will be measured by&#xD;
      PowerLab (data acquisition system, ADInstruments, Australia) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is planed to be completed in 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is usually reported that there is a parallelism between changes in the bone structure and&#xD;
      function and the muscle structure and function. Sarcopenia is frequently observed in&#xD;
      osteoporotic patients. Bone formation increases or bone resorption decreases with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important functions of bone bear mechanical loads include body weight. Bone&#xD;
      must be strong enough to resist the mechanical loading. Mechanisms need to protect bone when&#xD;
      bone is subject to excessive mechanical loading. These mechanisms may mainly focus on&#xD;
      strengthening the bone and/or changing vectorial properties of mechanical loading applied&#xD;
      bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vectorial properties of mechanical loading applied bone may be controlled by muscle&#xD;
      contractions. Bone contains wide mechanoreceptor net constructed by osteocytes.&#xD;
      So,distribution of the mechanical loading on bone cross-sectional area is possible to&#xD;
      perceive. It may be also possible that inappropriate distribution of mechanical loading on&#xD;
      bone crosssectional area is optimized by muscle contractions. To get this regulation, there&#xD;
      should be a mechanism that muscle activity is controlled by central nervous system based on&#xD;
      mechanical loading distribution on bone cross-sectional area. The investigators previously&#xD;
      showed that bone can regulate muscle activity, based on its bone mineral density. According&#xD;
      to this study result, it can be suggested there may exist a mechanism that bone sensing&#xD;
      mechanical stimuli can send the signals to central nervous system and neuronally regulate&#xD;
      muscle activity (bone myo-regulation reflex). (It is also well known that load-induced&#xD;
      adaptive bone formation is neuronally regulated. Taken together, a general mechanism, bone&#xD;
      reflex, may be defined that bone subjected to loading can neuronally regulate bone formation&#xD;
      and muscle activity) Vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. Vibration-induced bone&#xD;
      formation is neuronally regulated. Vibration can also effectively enhance muscle strength and&#xD;
      power. Previous studies have shown that vibration increases muscle electromyographic (EMG)&#xD;
      activity. It has been showed that bone has an effect on the increase in muscle EMG activity&#xD;
      caused by vibration in healthy young adults in a study. In this study, it was reported that&#xD;
      vibrations-induced increases in muscle electrical activity of flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was&#xD;
      related to ultradistal radius bone mineral content (BMC) and the FCR H-reflex was suppressed&#xD;
      or depressed during vibration. This findings were reported to support the assumption that the&#xD;
      bone exposed to cyclic mechanical loading may neuronally regulate muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of femur exposed to vibration on the rest&#xD;
      muscle electrical activity of hip adductors in cases with postmenopausal osteoporosis.&#xD;
