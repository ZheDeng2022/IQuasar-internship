  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The provision of HIV care and prevention services in resource-limited settings (RLS) entails&#xD;
      substantial challenges due to a human resource crisis.[1] One strategy to address this human&#xD;
      resource crisis is task shifting-the redistribution of tasks from higher trained providers to&#xD;
      health workers with less training. Peer supporters, a group of community health workers who&#xD;
      are people living with HIV (PLHIV), are an underutilized cadre to whom tasks can be shifted.&#xD;
      Peers have been used extensively and effectively in HIV/AIDS programs in RLS, typically as&#xD;
      peer educators who provide HIV prevention and education services.[2] Peers may be a potential&#xD;
      source for not only providing care, but also impacting patient behaviors through peer&#xD;
      counseling, education, and psychosocial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the scale up of HIV counseling and testing in RLS, increasing numbers of PLHIV know&#xD;
      their serostatus and could potentially be engaged in care and prevention services. While&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical component of care which has been a source of much&#xD;
      attention, PLHIV who are not yet on ART can also benefit from being engaged in care and&#xD;
      utilizing other evidence-based health interventions besides ART. Also, many HIV/AIDS care&#xD;
      programs have difficulty both retaining PLHIV in care prior to ART and initiating ART in a&#xD;
      timely fashion. Additionally, many PLHIV not yet on ART still engage in risky sexual&#xD;
      behaviors and do not fully utilize a proven basic preventive care package (BCP) set of&#xD;
      interventions (cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, bed nets, and safe water systems). Peers may be&#xD;
      able to impact PLHIV not yet on ART by improving linkages to care, facilitating timely&#xD;
      initiation of preventive interventions and ART, and decreasing risky sexual behaviors.&#xD;
      However, well-designed and evaluated operations research is needed to assess peer support&#xD;
      effects on these care and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a peer support home visit intervention&#xD;
      on patient engagement in care, utilization of a basic care package (BCP) of preventive care&#xD;
      interventions, and risky sexual behaviors among people living with HIV (PLHIV) not on&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) through an individually randomized, operations research,&#xD;
      community-based trial. We will compare outcomes between PLHIV who receive the peer-led&#xD;
      intervention to those who do not. The primary outcomes will be engagement in care, BCP&#xD;
      adherence, and condom use. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) PLHIV who receive the&#xD;
      peer intervention will have improved engagement in care compared to PLHIV not receiving the&#xD;
      intervention; (2) PLHIV who receive the peer intervention are more likely to adhere to a BCP&#xD;
      of interventions to prevent illness compared to PLHIV not receiving the intervention; (3)&#xD;
      PLHIV who receive the peer intervention will have less risky sexual behaviors compared to&#xD;
      PLHIV not receiving the intervention.&#xD;
