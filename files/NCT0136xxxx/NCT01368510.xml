  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with the best available treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), most&#xD;
      patients only partially recover and many patients do not respond at all. Such incomplete and&#xD;
      inadequate response contributes to greater public health costs in terms of morbidity and&#xD;
      patient care expenses. This study aims for a better understanding of abnormal brain chemistry&#xD;
      in OCD and how it is affected by cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in order to develop novel&#xD;
      therapies and improve the success of existing therapies. The main hypothesis is that CBT will&#xD;
      change levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in OCD patients in a region of the&#xD;
      brain involved in OCD known as the cingulate cortex.&#xD;

      This study will characterize the neurochemical abnormalities in important brain circuits&#xD;
      underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and the effects of&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Identification of such metabolite biomarkers will provide&#xD;
      an important foundation for translational clinical studies to maximize the ability of CBT to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms and to design medications that target core features of the disease, which is&#xD;
      particularly important for those who do not respond to, or have access to, CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCD is an often disabling and chronic psychiatric condition that affects approximately 2% of&#xD;
      the world's population. Most patients respond only incompletely to current treatments and&#xD;
      many do not respond at all. CBT, a form of psychotherapy, is one of the most effective&#xD;
      treatments for OCD, yet its mechanism of action is not fully understood. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to use neuroimaging to understand how neurometabolite abnormalities in neural&#xD;
      circuits relate to OCD symptoms, and how these are affected by CBT. In OCD, dysfunction is&#xD;
      suspected in several subregions of the cingulate gyrus, a brain region involved in relevant&#xD;
      neural circuits. This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to&#xD;
      measure concentrations of brain metabolites, including glutamate (Glu), in the cingulate. Glu&#xD;
      is an important excitatory neurotransmitter that is suspected to be disturbed in OCD. In this&#xD;
      study, MRSI scans will be performed on 25 adult OCD patients before and after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      daily CBT. They will be compared to 25 untreated healthy controls scanned 4 weeks apart. A&#xD;
      third group of 25 OCD patients will be scanned before and after 4 weeks while on the&#xD;
      waitlist, will then receive 4 weeks of CBT, and will be scanned a third time at its&#xD;
      completion. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Determine if levels of the Glu in the&#xD;
      &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;cognitive&quot; subregions of the cingulate differ between OCD patients and&#xD;
      controls; 2) Determine if Glu changes after CBT or waitlist in the OCD patients and if they&#xD;
      change in the controls after simple passage of time; 3) Determine if there are relationships&#xD;
      between Glu and clinical and neurocognitive symptoms of OCD before and after CBT.&#xD;
