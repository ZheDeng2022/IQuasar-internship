      The study is an open-label, single arm single Center Phase II study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the combination of Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF,&#xD;
      Leukine) and Ipilimumab (Yervoy) as therapy for patients with unresectable metastatic&#xD;
      malignant melanoma. The patient sample will be approximately 43 evaluable individuals, males&#xD;
      and females 18 years of age or older with measurable metastatic melanoma. Immunologic testing&#xD;
      will be done to evaluate correlation with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with 4 courses of GM-CSF and ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      GM-CSF will be administered subcutaneously daily for 14 days in a dose of 125 µg/m2 beginning&#xD;
      on D1 of each 21-day cycle. Ipilimumab intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg, with appropriate&#xD;
      stopping/de-escalation rules. After the initial 3 months (4 cycles) of treatment, GM-CSF&#xD;
      administration will continue for 4 additional cycles on the same schedule and dose without&#xD;
      ipilimumab for 14 days every 21 days until month 6. Maintenance therapy will begin at month 6&#xD;
      and will consist of ipilimumab in the same dose administered at the end of cycle 4 combined&#xD;
      with 14 days of GM-CSF. Administration of this combination will be repeated every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years or until disease progression, whichever occurs first. During the&#xD;
      maintenance phase, GM-CSF will only be administered for 14 days in conjunction with&#xD;
      ipilimumab and will not be administered in the intervening time period.&#xD;
