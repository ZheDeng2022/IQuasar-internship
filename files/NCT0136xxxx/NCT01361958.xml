  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of several doses of NOMAC in&#xD;
      combination with E2 to inhibit ovulation and to assess changes in the gonadotropin and&#xD;
      ovarian hormone profiles, in comparison to a control cycle in healthy-volunteer premenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was also designed to check whether the combined administration of E2 and NOMAC at&#xD;
      the dose of 2.5 mg daily induces any changes in the effects of the progestin compared to when&#xD;
      it is given alone.&#xD;
