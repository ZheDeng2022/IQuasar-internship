      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and ability of vorinostat, a drug&#xD;
      currently licensed for the treatment of a type of lymphoma, to 'turn on' dormant HIV infected&#xD;
      CD4 T-cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of HIV infection with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has led to&#xD;
      significant improvements in the life expectancy and quality of life of people living with&#xD;
      HIV. Nevertheless, life expectancy is significantly lower than uninfected individuals and&#xD;
      cART leads to several long term side effects. cART alone is not able to cure HIV infection&#xD;
      due to persistence of HIV infection in dormant cells. One potential strategy to eradicate HIV&#xD;
      infection is to 'wake up' these dormant infected cells by 'turning on' the cell. The small&#xD;
      number of cells that are dormant and infected would start to produce virus and die, but&#xD;
      infection of other cells would be prevented by cART. Ultimately this could lead to&#xD;
      eradication of dormant infected cells and a potential cure for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study in 20 individuals recruited at the Alfred Hospital only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses is that vorinostat will induce HIV transcription in CD4 T-cells with latent&#xD;
      HIV infection, it is safe and well tolerated in patients receiving effective cART and will&#xD;
      induce histone acetylation in vivo in patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run over 12 weeks, involving 9 study visits for the participant. Eligible&#xD;
      patients must be between 18 to 60 years of age with confirmed HIV infection, and receiving&#xD;
      successful cART as indicated by 'suppressed' HIV virus in blood (plasma HIV RNA &lt;50&#xD;
      copies/ml) for at least 3 years and a strong immune system (two CD4 counts greater than 500&#xD;
      cell/µl in the last 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at screening and days 1 (three time points), 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and&#xD;
      84 (week 12). They will have blood tests for HIV viral load assessment, CD4 cell counts,&#xD;
      biochemistry, hematology and storage samples. An electrocardiogram of the heart (ECG) will be&#xD;
      taken at screening, day 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study levels of HIV in blood and in white blood cells and the degree to which&#xD;
      cells are 'turned on' (histone (H3) acetylation) will be measured at 3 time points on day 1,&#xD;
      then once on days 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28. The level of one component of cART will be measured at&#xD;
      day 1 and 14. At baseline and day 14 a sigmoidoscopy if performed for the collection of&#xD;
      rectal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and how well vorinostat is tolerated will be determined based on physical exams,&#xD;
      laboratory tests and questions about any problems patients may have experienced during the&#xD;
      study. This study has an Independent Safety Monitoring Committee who in addition to&#xD;
      evaluating the overall safety of patients will be responsible for assessing safety of the&#xD;
      first patient enrolled prior to any recommendation to continue the study.&#xD;
