      Objective: To assess the relationship between maternal cardiovascular capacity and aerobic&#xD;
      water exercise during the gestational periods of hemodynamic overload. Study design:&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, with 41 healthy pregnant women assigned to one of two groups:&#xD;
      Control and Water exercise. Maternal cardiovascular capacity (maximum oxygen consumption,&#xD;
      cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate and mean arterial pressure), physical performance&#xD;
      (relative HR, treadmill speed and self-perceived exertion) and neonatal outcome (gestational&#xD;
      age, weight, Apgar index and length of infant's hospitalization) were assessed. Means were&#xD;
      evaluated by dependent and independent t-tests, and proportions by the chi-square method&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05). Results: The control variables showed that the groups were homogeneous. Water&#xD;
      exercise was associated with maintenance of VO2max, increase in stroke volume and cardiac&#xD;
      output, and better performance on stress tests in the third trimester of gestation. No&#xD;
      significant difference in neonatal variables was observed. Conclusion: Water exercise&#xD;
      maintained cardiovascular capacity and performance under submaximal stress, and did not&#xD;
      affect hemodynamic adaptation to gestation or neonatal outcome.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant hemodynamic changes take place during the short period of pregnancy, very often&#xD;
      placing a major burden on the maternal cardiovascular system. Normal pregnancy is&#xD;
      characterized by an increase in cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR) and&#xD;
      blood volume, and decrease in arterial pressure and vascular resistance. Classic studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated an increase of up to 50% in maternal CO during the second and third trimesters.&#xD;
      These circulatory adaptations are responsible for supplying nutrients and oxygen to the&#xD;
      placenta and the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological changes that follow regular exercise improve training efficiency and&#xD;
      performance, defining the concept of adaptation to exercise or aerobic training. Exercise&#xD;
      causes the heart and lungs to be more efficient by increasing cardiovascular capacity or&#xD;
      resistance. CO, SV and maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) increase while HR and AP decrease.&#xD;
      The importance of these effects on overall health has been recognized by the most outstanding&#xD;
      medical and scientific groups. Therefore, regular exercise has been widely promoted and a&#xD;
      large number of women decide to begin or continue to exercise during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This change in women's behavior has become a matter of concern among obstetricians and has&#xD;
      important practical implications - is the maternal body apt to bear the hemodynamic burden of&#xD;
      pregnancy in association with exercise stress? Studies on the effects of exercise on&#xD;
      pregnancy are scarce and show conflicting results, probably due to differences in exercise&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, type, duration, and gestational age at training initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming at standardizing exercise practice and thus promote materno-fetal health, the American&#xD;
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued, in 1985, guidelines for exercise&#xD;
      during pregnancy. In subsequent reviews, new recommendations were added, and water exercise&#xD;
      during pregnancy was recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water exercise offers some particular benefits that include the maintenance of body&#xD;
      temperature, control of gestational edema, and increase in diuresis. Moreover, it can be&#xD;
      easily performed up to the end of pregnancy, which favors compliance. These advantages added&#xD;
      to the fact that it has no adverse effect on the fetus explain the preference for this kind&#xD;
      of exercise during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the lack of scientific evidence of the effects of exercise during pregnancy, and&#xD;
      the results obtained in our previous work, the purpose of this study was to assess the&#xD;
      relationship of aerobic water exercise during the gestational periods of greater hemodynamic&#xD;
      burden with maternal cardiovascular capacity and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a project approved by the Committee of Research Ethics of the Botucatu&#xD;
      Medical School-UNESP on May 10, 1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: randomized clinical, without intention to treat. Study subjects: All the&#xD;
      eligible women who volunteered to participate were sequentially enrolled and randomized to&#xD;
      one of two groups according to a computer-generated randomization list of numbers created&#xD;
      with Epi-Info software. Each sequential number corresponded to a sealed opaque envelope&#xD;
      containing the information on the randomization group in order to ensure concealment. Group 1&#xD;
      consisted of 29 women engaged in Water Exercise, and group 2 included 31 pregnant women not&#xD;
      participating in the program (control). Variables: the independent variable studied was the&#xD;
      practice of water exercise. The control variables, which were assessed at baseline, included&#xD;
      age, parity, pre-gestational body mass index (BMI), HR and MAP, smoking, sedentarism, and&#xD;
      gestational age at baseline and at stress testing. The dependent variables regarding&#xD;
      cardiovascular capacity and physical performance at the submaximal stress test were VO2max;&#xD;
      SV; CO; HR and MAP, relative HR treadmill speed and scores obtained with the scale of Borg.&#xD;
      Neonatal variables included gestational age, weight; Apgar index at minute 1 and at minute 5,&#xD;
      and length (days) of infant's hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of cardiovascular capacity: performed during prenatal visits at 16-20, 28-33 and&#xD;
      34-39 weeks. Cardiovascular capacity was evaluated by using a treadmill submaximal stress&#xD;
      test, according to the protocol of Balke-Ware &amp; Bruce that requires five minutes on treadmill&#xD;
      at fixed incline and constant individualized speed with AP and HR monitoring. Assessment of&#xD;
      physical performance at stress testing - for this purpose, relative HR, treadmill speed and&#xD;
      the Borg scale scores, obtained during testing, were used. A specific questionnaire was&#xD;
      administered to all subjects in order to quantify stress perception during testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analyses - given that the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      (exploratory and not intention-to-treat) of water exercise during pregnancy, our analysis&#xD;
      included only the subjects who underwent cardiovascular assessment at the three study moments&#xD;
      and missed no more than 2 exercise sessions/month. These data were stored in a specific&#xD;
      database Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software version 10.0.7. Means were&#xD;
      compared using ANOVA followed by t-tests for independent (between groups) and dependent&#xD;
      (within groups) samples. Data were adequately transformed when necessary. Proportions were&#xD;
      compared by the chi-square test (X2). Statistical significance was set at 5% (p&lt;0.005).&#xD;

    <description>The hydrotherapy program of Prevedel et al.14 was used. One-hour sessions, led by a physiotherapist under the supervision of an obstetrician, were held three times a week in an indoor swimming-pool heated at 28oC-32oC, and consisted of exercises of moderate intensity (60-70% of maximum heart rate). Subgroups of up to 10 subjects participated in each session. Sessions were offered at different times of the day (morning, afternoon, and evening).&#xD;
The exercises included 5 phases: stretching, warm up, endurance training, strength training and relaxation with breathing exercises, in accordance with the recommendations of ACOG11.</description>
