      The purpose of the study is to inform decision-makers of the best strategies to implement&#xD;
      advanced care planning (ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An advanced care plan (ACP) is a verbal or written instruction describing what kind of care&#xD;
      an individual would want (or not want)if they are no longer able speak for themselves to make&#xD;
      health care decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advance Care Planning (ACP) may offer some assistance with reducing health care costs for&#xD;
      older Canadians and yet, at the same time, improving quality of care. ACP is the process by&#xD;
      which a person considers options about future health care decisions and identifies their&#xD;
      wishes. ACP has been shown to increase the quality of life of dying patients, improve the&#xD;
      experience of family members, and decrease health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been initiatives leading to the development and implementation of system-wide&#xD;
      strategies to increase ACP, however there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these efforts from the perspective of patients and families. Many questions pertaining to&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementation and impact of ACP on outcomes in Canada remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a perspective audit of current practice related to ACP&#xD;
      in elderly patients at high-risk for dying and their families. The investigators will&#xD;
      determine the extent to which these patients and families have engaged in ACP, what barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators they preceive, and how satisfied they are with communication and decision&#xD;
      making at the end of life. Informed by a baseline evaluation of site strengths, weaknesses&#xD;
      and barriers, the investigators propose to develop tailored interventions to enable&#xD;
      participating sites to improve their success with ACP during the entire study period. By&#xD;
      repeating the audit and feedback cycle annually, the investigators will enable sites to make&#xD;
      continuous efforts to improve their performance and be able to evaluate the effect of our&#xD;
      audit/feedback/tailored intervention strategy compared to baseline. Additionally, for those&#xD;
      patients who have engaged in ACP activities, the investigators can compare their outcomes to&#xD;
      those who have not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to inform decision-makers as the best strategies to&#xD;
      implement advance care planning (ACP).&#xD;

    <description>a. Does the patient have an advance directive or living will or some other written document expressing their wishes? b.patient and/or family been informed of the patients' prognosis? c.Has the patient and/or family been informed about the expected benefits and burdens of various treatment options? d.Has the patient considered how s/he wants to live in the final stages of life and what kinds of medical treatments they would want or not want? e.Have they discussed this with their family? A health care provider? g.Has there been a discussion about their goals of care with their health care provider? If so, are they aware of them? h.Has there been a decision made about medical treatments at the end of life? If so, what role did the patient/family play in that decision-making and was this consistent with their preferred role? i.Is there documentation in the medical record of the overall goals of care?</description>
