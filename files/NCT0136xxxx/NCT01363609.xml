    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if endogenous Glucagon Like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) has an&#xD;
      effect on brain satiety and reward systems and if there are alterations in obese patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Secondly, the aim is to investigate whether treatment with a&#xD;
      GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, restores these signals in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Finally, also the endogenous GLP-1 effects will be investigated in obese individuals before&#xD;
      and after gastric bypass surgery on brain satiety and reward systems.&#xD;

      First aim will be addressed in a cross-sectional randomized study. 20 healthy, lean and 20&#xD;
      obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be exposed to food cues and with&#xD;
      concomitant infusion of glucagon Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist or saline, to&#xD;
      assess the involvement of endogenous GLP-1, secreted in response to a meal. Measurements&#xD;
      activation of CNS circuits involved in satiety and reward will be performed using blood&#xD;
      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim will be addressed in cross-over randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the T2DM&#xD;
      patients only. Patients will be randomly assigned liraglutide vs insulin glargine treatment,&#xD;
      during a treatment period of 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout period in between. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform the same fMRI protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim will be addressed in a study with obese individuals who are scheduled for a&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery. The same protocol as for the first aim will be performed and this&#xD;
      will be before and after the surgery in the same individuals.&#xD;

- To investigate the involvement of the increased meal-related endogenous GLP-1 levels after gastric bypass surgery in these food-stimuli related CNS satiety and reward responses and to investigate whether pharmacological blocking of endogenous GLP-1 receptor activation, using a GLP-1 antagonist, differentially affects these responses before and after gastric bypass surgery in obese individuals.</description>

Patient will self-titrate the insulin glargine dosage based on self-monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations for the previous 3 days using the following guideline: If FBG levels are above 5.6 mmol/L (100-153 mg/dL) on 3 consecutive mornings, the daily dose is to be increased by 2 IU/day. If hypoglycemia documented by glucose concentration &lt; 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) or requiring assistance occurs without an easily identifiable reason (skipped meal, excessive physical activity), the daily dose is to be downregulated, with -2 IU/day</description>
