    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) and immune system effect of the BAT24 dosing regimen versus daily and pericoital dosing&#xD;
      regimens with vaginal use of tenofovir 1% gel after a single sex act and after multiple sex&#xD;
      acts.&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will be randomized to one of nine groups: (dosing regimen: BAT24, precoital or postcoital) x (sample collection time-point: 4, 12 or 72 hours after the single act of study-related sex). Approximately 30 women will be assigned to each dosing regimen.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 groups: (dosing regimen: BAT24, precoital, postcoital or daily) x (sample collection time-point: 4, 12 or 72 hrs after the last act of study-related sex). 30 women will be assigned to each the BAT24 and daily dosing regimens; 15 will be assigned to each the pre- and postcoital dosing regimens. Those assigned to the BAT24 or a pericoital regimen will have study-related sex twice weekly for 2 weeks. Those assigned to the daily regimen will use the gel at about the same time each day for 2 weeks and to have sex at least twice each week.</description>
