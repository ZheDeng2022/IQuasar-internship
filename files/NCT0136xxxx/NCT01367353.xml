      Specific aims: Identification and characterization of cancer stem cell-like population&#xD;
      (cancer stem cells or cancer initiating cells) from primary tumor tissue, primary ascites and&#xD;
      peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients and genetically engineered mouse ovarian cancer&#xD;
      cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: In the future, individualized therapy must incorporate analysis of the cancer&#xD;
      stem cells or cancer initiating cells of ovarian cancer cells when designing therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies for ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isolation and identification of cancer stem cell-like population (cancer stem cells or&#xD;
           cancer initiating cells) from primary tumor tissue, primary ascites and peripheral blood&#xD;
           of ovarian cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In vivo tumorigenicity assay will be performed to measure tumor formation from these&#xD;
           cancer stem cell-like population when equal numbers were injected into the dorsal fat&#xD;
           pad of nude mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a standard protocol of stem cell-like population maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screening of potential specific biomarkers involved in these ovarian cancer stem&#xD;
           cell-like population.&#xD;

      Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality of all gynecological cancers, with an overall 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of only 30-40%. The incidence of ovarian cancer also increased in recent year&#xD;
      in Taiwan, and it became a more and more important issue. The lack of symptoms, difficulties&#xD;
      in early diagnosis, insufficient accurate tumor markers, and lack of information about&#xD;
      ovarian tumor biology contribute to the poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. The&#xD;
      prognostic factors for ovarian carcinomas include tumor stage, subtype of histology, grade of&#xD;
      differentiation, the residual tumor after debulking surgery, and the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Especially the resistance to chemotherapy plays a great role in the prognosis&#xD;
      of the patients. However, the current studies present an incomplete picture of the tumor&#xD;
      biology of ovarian cancer. It will be quite helpful to clinical management if the&#xD;
      investigators can examine the possible underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis and drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignancy usually origins from the abnormal proliferate cells which accumulate several&#xD;
      genetic or epigenetic aberrations. The most important key question is &quot;What kind of cell&#xD;
      could be the cancer cell?&quot; Recent studies figure out there is &quot;cancer-initiating cell&quot; in the&#xD;
      malignant tumor. Cancer-initiating cells organized self-renewing, anchorage-independent&#xD;
      spheres and were reproducibly. Moreover, cancer-initiating cells were also capable of&#xD;
      intraperitoneal tumorigenesis (demonstrating activity in their native microenvironment) and&#xD;
      could serially propagate tumors in animals. Although the proportion of the cancer-initiating&#xD;
      cells in the cancer tissue is very low, the characteristic abilities of cancer-initiating&#xD;
      cells fulfill all currently accepted criteria for the existence of a subpopulation of&#xD;
      tumor-initiating cells, and their specific detection and targeting could be highly valuable&#xD;
      for therapy of tumor heterogeneity, uncontrolled proliferation, local invasion, distant&#xD;
      metastasis and even resistance to current management including chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some tumor initiating cells which have the properties of cancer stem cells have been isolated&#xD;
      from leukemia, breast cancer, and brain tumor. Some potential cell markers for cancer&#xD;
      initiating cells were identified, including CD34(+)/CD38(+) in leukemia, CD44(+)/CD24(+) in&#xD;
      breast cancer, and CD133(+)/nestin(+) in brain tumor. Aberrant cell signal transduction&#xD;
      pathway of stem cell is associated with malignant transformation, such as Wnt, Hedgehog, and&#xD;
      Notch pathways. Up to our knowledge, the specific antigens expressed on ovarian&#xD;
      cancer-initiating cells have not been identified and characterized yet. In the current study,&#xD;
      using primary human ovarian tumors, the investigators will isolate and characterized ovarian&#xD;
      cancer-initiating cells fully capable of reestablishing their original tumor hierarchy in&#xD;
      vivo. The investigators will also elucidate the novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers on&#xD;
      ovarian cancer-initiating cells by identifying numerous differentially potential surface&#xD;
      antigens and/or over-expressed genes. Furthermore, a mouse ovarian cancer study model will be&#xD;
      genetically engineered and investigated to monitor the possible therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      immunotherapy and chemotherapy to these ovarian cancer-initiating cells. The investigators&#xD;
      hope to specify and to stratify the molecular patterns, response to chemotherapy, prognostic&#xD;
      biomarkers in patients with ovarian cancer-initiating cells. These results might offer some&#xD;
      novel ovarian cancer therapy hypothesis to evaluate its function on tumorigenesis and&#xD;
      potential on targeting ovarian cancer-initiating cells.&#xD;
