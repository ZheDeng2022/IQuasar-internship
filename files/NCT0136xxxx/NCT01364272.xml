  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia or tic douloureux is severe, often debilitating, facial pain that&#xD;
      significantly impairs the patient's quality of life and health. Stereotactic radiosurgery has&#xD;
      been shown to provide pain relief in majority of patients treated. However, a common side&#xD;
      effect of radiosurgery is facial numbness. To better understand how radiosurgery can bring&#xD;
      about pain relief and facial numbness, we are conducting a study in which brain MRI scans&#xD;
      will be done following stereotactic radiosurgery to learn if there are any changes in the MRI&#xD;
      scans that correlate with symptoms.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients age 18 years and older with typical trigeminal neuralgia, as determined&#xD;
             by diagnostic criteria set by the International Headache Society, who are 1)&#xD;
             intolerant of or refractory to medical management and 2) not candidates for or&#xD;
             refusing a surgical micro-vascular decompression, will be evaluated for treatment with&#xD;
             SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status will not be employed, but patients must be&#xD;
             sufficiently healthy to tolerate all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must exhibit the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;

             brain aneurysm clip, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with MVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously had an ablative treatment, including prior SRS.&#xD;
