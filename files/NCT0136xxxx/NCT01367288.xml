  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading female cancer by a very wide margin in France. Despite&#xD;
      widespread breast cancer screening, many cases of breast cancer are discovered at a locally&#xD;
      advanced stage. The tumoral consequences of a cancer size greater than 3 cm are: increased&#xD;
      risk of metastasis and death and, most often, impossibility of performing breast-conserving&#xD;
      surgery (a mastectomy is usually advisable in case of a first surgical procedure). It is&#xD;
      increasingly recommended to treat locally advanced breast cancers with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Very numerous studies have shown that by proceeding that way, the oncologic&#xD;
      prognosis was not harmed and, on the contrary, it was possible to obtain sufficient tumor&#xD;
      response to allow breast-conserving treatment in more than 60% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of zoledronic acid (Zometa) has an established place in the management of&#xD;
      malignancies with a predilection for skeletal involvement (in particular metastasis).&#xD;
      Although the main target of biphosphonates is the osteoclast, there is also preclinical data&#xD;
      indicating that biphosphonates can have effects on cells other than osteoclasts, including&#xD;
      tumor cells. Anti-tumor activity including inhibition of tumor cell growth and induction of&#xD;
      tumor cell apoptosis, inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, and anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      effects have been demonstrated. In addition several in vitro studies have shown that Zometa&#xD;
      causes synergistic induction of breast cancer cell apoptosis when combined with clinically&#xD;
      relevant concentrations of chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Therefore&#xD;
      testing of combinations of biphosphonates with these agents in breast cancer is of&#xD;
      significant interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of locally advanced breast cancers, the combination of a bisphosphonate with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy appears to have an important potential: preventing possible bone&#xD;
      metastases, but also possibly amplifying the efficacy of the chemotherapy's tumoricidal&#xD;
      activity, both on the primary tumor and on potential metastatic localizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So it appears that, the use of bisphosphonates in a neoadjuvant situation presents a&#xD;
      potentially favorable benefit-risk ratio. That is why we are proposing to perform a&#xD;
      prospective randomized multicenter comparative study to evaluate 2 systemic neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatments, one with Zometa and the other without Zometa, in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer. Zometa will be administered according to the usual administration procedure:&#xD;
      one infusion every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic response will be evaluated by studying the different biological markers&#xD;
      (circulating blood and bone marrow tumor cells, serum cell apoptosis and neoangiogenesis&#xD;
      markers, bone resorption markers, etc.), but also by analyzing clinical, radiologic, and&#xD;
      histologic response and by breast conservation rates. The impact of other factors that may&#xD;
      affect therapeutic response will be taken into account: aggressivity of the tumor, presence&#xD;
      or absence of tumor receptors, tumor stage, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to show a marked benefit of treatment with Zometa in managing&#xD;
      locally advanced breast cancers with synergistic action of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      improvement in the laboratory parameters of tumor aggressivity. These markers will be used as&#xD;
      surrogate markers of long term outcome.&#xD;
