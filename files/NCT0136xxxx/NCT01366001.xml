  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ALKS33-BUP when&#xD;
      administered to opioid-experienced cocaine abusers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no currently available pharmacologic treatments for cocaine abuse and/or dependence&#xD;
      and the unmet medical need is growing. In collaboration with the National Institute on Drug&#xD;
      Abuse (NIDA), Alkermes, Inc. is investigating a fixed-dose combination product consisting of&#xD;
      ALKS 33 (also referred to as RDC-0313) and buprenorphine (ALKS 33-BUP) for the treatment of&#xD;
      cocaine abuse and/or dependence (Grant Number R01DA031000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design inpatient study.&#xD;
      Eligibility will be established which includes responses to cocaine infusions at baseline,&#xD;
      prior to study drug administration. Approximately 30 opioid-experienced cocaine abusers will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1:1 to receive study drug. Study drug will be administered once daily for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days. Pharmacodynamic assessments and drug-drug interactions will be closely&#xD;
      monitored during the study. Following study drug administration, subjects will receive&#xD;
      cocaine infusions to evaluate the effect of treatment on the subjective effects and the PK/PD&#xD;
      of cocaine. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit 2 days after the last&#xD;
      infusion of cocaine. Subjects will return for follow-up between 7 and 14 days after&#xD;
      discharge. The full study will take subjects approximately 28 days, with 17 days of inpatient&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
