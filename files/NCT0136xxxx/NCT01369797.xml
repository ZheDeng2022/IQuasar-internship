      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolving concept of frailty was born in the United States under the term of &quot; frail&#xD;
      elderly &quot;. It allows describing geriatrics situations, dominated by the weakness or the&#xD;
      functional instability of aged person, illustrating situations at risk. It is about an&#xD;
      effective concept, especially in the field of the prevention where it determines strategies&#xD;
      of specific care. The ageing, changing according to individuals, is characterized by a&#xD;
      decrease of the physiological reserves leading to a precarious balance and to a&#xD;
      destabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies show a very uneven distribution of three categories of old persons&#xD;
      according to their health status. Every year, approximately, 12 % of the independent&#xD;
      population of 75 years of age and older and living at home, lose their autonomy for one of&#xD;
      the activities of the daily life and turn into frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying frailty of old subjects is interesting in order to apply preventive and specific&#xD;
      care strategies to reduce the risks of decompensation. The Global Geriatric Assessment (GGA)&#xD;
      is the gold standard to detect frailty in this population. The beneficial effects of the GGA&#xD;
      during the hospitalization have been recognized in international literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ageing heterogeneousness complexity and the high time-consuming character of GGA led to a&#xD;
      difficult approach for the nurses or family practioners in taking care of old persons at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To balance these difficulties and to optimize prevention of dependence in the elderly, an&#xD;
      experimental unit of prevention was created : Unit for Prevention, Monitoring and Analysis of&#xD;
      Aging (UPSAV) on January 4th, 2010 within the geriatric department of the Hospital University&#xD;
      of Limoges. It is an innovative organizational structure because, for the first time, the&#xD;
      geriatric expertise is proposed freely to the elderly at home. A multidisciplinary&#xD;
      gerontological team consisting in a geriatrician, a nurse, a psychomotor therapist and an&#xD;
      occupational therapist, can, on requiry, move at old persons' home to make a preventive GGA&#xD;
      to detect the risks of loss of autonomy and to propose a coordination of preventive actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose :&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPSAV's endpoints are to prevent frail elderly persons from the risk of autonomy loss. This&#xD;
      action is led in partnership with all the professionals working around old persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized study endpoint is to evaluate elderly from 75 years of age and older at home&#xD;
      and to select two homogeneous groups: &quot;reference&quot; and &quot; specific intervention &quot;.&#xD;

      Abstract : The recruitment will be made in the Limousin region within a period of one year by&#xD;
      cooptation of families, patients, family practitioners and other partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After checking the inclusion criteria and obtaining the signatures of consents, patients will&#xD;
      be assessed using the functional status (SMAF) and the Global Geriatric Assessment (GGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the &quot;specific intervention&quot; group will benefit from a personalized&#xD;
      action plan presented in a multidisciplinary staff that will be established according to the&#xD;
      detected frailties. In follow up visits, a new evaluation will be done and the action plan&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month, patients of this group will receive a Unit for Prevention, Monitoring and&#xD;
      Analysis of Aging (UPSAV) phone call in order to complete the secondary assessment criteria&#xD;
      of the trial. Therefore, every patient will be re-evaluated according to the intervention&#xD;
      plan of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of the patient will be estimated by the scale EQ-5D. In every visit, will&#xD;
      be collected in a forward-looking way the medical direct costs (ambulatory, hospital care and&#xD;
      medicines) and the non medical costs (transport, helpers, arrangements of the place of&#xD;
      residence).&#xD;
