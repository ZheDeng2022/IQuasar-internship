      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate and&#xD;
      selumetinib sulfate in treating patients with solid malignancies. Cediranib maleate and&#xD;
      selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Cediranib maleate may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of cediranib maleate (AZD2171 [cediranib]) in&#xD;
      combination with selumetinib sulfate (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the toxicity profile associated with AZD2171 (cediranib) in combination with&#xD;
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the tumor responses and identify any activity of this AZD2171 (cediranib) in&#xD;
      combination with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore, through correlative studies, the effect of AZD2171 (cediranib) with or&#xD;
      without AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate on serum markers of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of AZD2171 (cediranib) in combination with&#xD;
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) with&#xD;
      the pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative&#xD;
      laboratory study) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and selumetinib sulfate PO QD&#xD;
      or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of cycle 1). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cycles may be extended to 12 weeks&#xD;
      after 1 year of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;
