    <textblock>
      In the last few decades much knowledge has been accumulated on the connection between&#xD;
      healthy, sufficient sleep and overall health, cognitive function, memory and job or school&#xD;
      performance, motor vehicle accidents and work accidents. There has been growing awareness&#xD;
      recently of the connection between physical activity and competitive sports performance, and&#xD;
      the amount and quality of sleep. Despite the dearth of scientific studies, there is a&#xD;
      constant effort to improve understanding in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An appropriate procedure designed to evaluate the influence of the quality and amount of&#xD;
      sleep on ability and athletic performance must fulfill a number of basic requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isolating the influence of components related to sleep homeostasis and factors relating&#xD;
           to circadian rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neutralizing as much as possible the influence of motivation on the evaluation - one&#xD;
           must presumably include a significant competitive event (it is not always possible to do&#xD;
           a simple extrapolation between physiological measurements and competitive performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Isolating and canceling as much as possible additional factors affecting performance,&#xD;
           such as: home advantage, weather, injury and field conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Athletic activity includes not just competitions but also training towards competitions,&#xD;
      since it is difficult to control for influences of competitions and other occasional events,&#xD;
      in this study the investigators focus on evaluation of the connection between sleep and&#xD;
      athletic performance in training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of adolescence, youth are busy in multiple activities related to studies,&#xD;
      social obligations and athletic activity. This is also the age they learn to drive. This is&#xD;
      an age in which physiologically a person needs more sleep relative to at other ages (9.25&#xD;
      hours of sleep a day), and paradoxically due to the multiple obligations the amount of sleep&#xD;
      is lower than needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the effect on mood, cognitive performance and memory, sleep deprivation causes&#xD;
      far-reaching changes in multiple systems, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular System:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many studies show that shortened sleep duration constitutes an independent cause of&#xD;
           increased cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting heart rate and maximum heart rate decrease after 30 hours of sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory System:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant decline in respiratory function as measured by: FVC, Maximal voluntary&#xD;
           ventilation, Maximal static inspiratory/expiratory pressures, Time to exhaustion with&#xD;
           exercise, Peak O2 consumption, Peak CO2 production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening of respiratory sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digestive System:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Changes in food consumption accompanied by changes in body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological System&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Disturbance of thermoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine System:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormonal changes associated with hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence on secretion of Ghrelin and leptin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence on secretion of growth hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of this, there is sound basis for the presumption that athletic performance is&#xD;
      connected to these influences directly and indirectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the connection between sleep quality and duration&#xD;
      and athletic performance among young athletes living and training at the Sport-Gifted Centre&#xD;
      at the Wingate Institute.&#xD;

      Aim The purpose of this study is to evaluate the connection between sleep quality and&#xD;
      duration and athletic performance among young athletes living and training at the&#xD;
      Sport-Gifted Centre at the Wingate Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 50 athletes of the Sport-Gifted Centre at the Wingate Institute, ages 13-20, male and&#xD;
      female, from the branches of triathlon and swimming. Participants and their parents will be&#xD;
      asked to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will have two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline assessment: In the first stage there will be an evaluation of sleep quality and&#xD;
           duration of the athletes over the course of two weeks, in parallel their athletic&#xD;
           performance will be evaluated using accepted measures such as: swimming times over set&#xD;
           distances, running times over set distances, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of intervention's effect of prolonging the duration of nighttime sleep on the&#xD;
           athletic performance of the participants, using the same measures as above. This stage&#xD;
           will take four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the study each participant will fill out a general health questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive a Suunto heart monitor belt to sleep with for two weeks. Each&#xD;
      participant will be asked to wear the belt before going to bed and take it off upon waking up&#xD;
      in the morning. Heart rate data stored on the belts will be transferred each morning to a&#xD;
      computer. Analysis of sleep architecture and duration over the course of the two weeks will&#xD;
      be carried out using the HC1000P system from HypoCore Inc. (see attached documents). In&#xD;
      addition average heart rate and maximal heart rate can be assessed while training at baseline&#xD;
      by recording heart rate using the Suunto belts. Sleep data will be analyzed and each&#xD;
      participant will receive a personalized analysis of his/her sleep. At this stage the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the baseline characteristics of the participants including sleep&#xD;
      duration, sleep efficiency, presence and duration of the different sleep stages, in&#xD;
      particular slow wave sleep during which it is known a growth factor is released which is&#xD;
      important for muscle recovery, times and durations of training sessions and athletic&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of athletic performance will be done using standard tests that are routinely&#xD;
      carried out as part of the athletes' training program in every branch of sports. For&#xD;
      triathletes running times for 3000 meters are measured, for swimmers their times for set&#xD;
      distances (50 meters,100 meters, 400 meters, etc). All these measures will be done without&#xD;
      deviation from the regular training routine. Also general parameters will be measured like&#xD;
      standing heart rate and reclining heart rate, and heart rate at awakening in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage the participants will be divided randomly into two groups. In the course of an&#xD;
      additional training cycle of two weeks one group labeled 'A' will be given additional sleep&#xD;
      time of one to two hours. The second group (group 'B') shall continue with no change. In the&#xD;
      course of the two weeks sleep parameters of both groups will be assessed and analyzed, and&#xD;
      athletic performance during routine training will continue to be measured and tabulated.&#xD;
      After these two weeks the two groups will be crossed over, group 'A' will return to a routine&#xD;
      sleep schedule, i.e. the extra sleep time will be removed and group 'B' will get additional&#xD;
      sleep time. All the aforementioned measures will be collected during two weeks (sleep&#xD;
      quality, athletic performance during training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analysis of the results further testing will be recommended as needed as well as&#xD;
      changes in training programs, daily scheduling and sleep schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study there will be close monitoring of injuries among participants. Events&#xD;
      will be defined as injuries (according to the number of treatments by a physiotherapist or&#xD;
      visits to a doctor) or near injuries and will be quantified, and correlations will be sought&#xD;
      between performance, injuries and sleep duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both stages in addition to wearing a heart rate belt, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire before and after sleep during the entire study (see attached&#xD;
      document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Suunto is a Finnish company that makes advanced sports watches and sensitive heart rate&#xD;
      belts used by athletes in their training. The belt is soft, of very high quality, lightweight&#xD;
      and contains a sensor and memory unit to store the heart rate data of the participant. It is&#xD;
      approved for routine use for monitoring heart rate in people engaged in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better understanding of the physiology associated with sleep among adolescents involved&#xD;
           in regular, competitive physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved performance by building a sleep program, optimal wakefulness and training.&#xD;
