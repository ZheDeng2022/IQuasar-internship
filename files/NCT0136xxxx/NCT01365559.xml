    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study for patients with Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma (MM) who will receive treatment with carfilzomib in place of bortezomib using the&#xD;
      same bortezomib-containing combination regimen to which a MM patient has progressed while&#xD;
      receiving. This study will enroll 45 patients total. These patients will be resistant to&#xD;
      bortezomib as demonstrated by progressive disease while on bortezomib or have relapsed within&#xD;
      12 weeks of the last dose of bortezomib in a combination regimen. Patients will be&#xD;
      sub-divided into 2 groups in this study, treatments containing (Group A) or not containing&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (Group B). Thirty patient will be enrolled into Group A and 15&#xD;
      patients into Group B for a total of 45 patients. Patients must have received 4 doses of a&#xD;
      minimum of 1.0 mg/m^2 of bortezomib in no more than 4 weeks per cycle. Patients must have&#xD;
      received at least one cycle meeting this definition and have shown progressive disease to be&#xD;
      considered eligible. Patients who have been refractory to or relapsed within 12 weeks of the&#xD;
      last dose of bortezomib in their most recent bortezomib-containing regimen that does not&#xD;
      include either thalidomide or lenalidomide are eligible regardless of when patients received&#xD;
      that regimen, as long as they meet the above criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib will subsequently replace bortezomib using the patient's most recent&#xD;
      bortezomib-containing regimen to which the patient progressed while receiving. Patients will&#xD;
      be eligible if they progressed from bortezomib with an alkylating agent (melphalan or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide), an anthracycline (doxorubicin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and/or a&#xD;
      glucocorticosteroid (prednisone, dexamethasone or medrol)and IMiD (thalidomide or&#xD;
      lenalidomide). The study will consist of a screening period, followed by up to eight open&#xD;
      label treatment cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last&#xD;
      treatment cycle, a follow-up period and maintenance cycles of single agent carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who complete the combination treatment period without progressive disease will be&#xD;
      eligible for maintenance therapy with single-agent carfilzomib. During maintenance therapy&#xD;
      carfilzomib will be administered at the same dose given during the last cycle of combination&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
