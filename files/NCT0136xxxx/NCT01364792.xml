  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-week, randomized, double blind add-on study of valaciclovir versus placebo in&#xD;
      24 clinical patients with Schizophrenia according to DSM IV, currently experiencing psychosis&#xD;
      as is defined by the positive items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS)&#xD;
      score, being five or higher on one item or four on two items of this scale. Each patient will&#xD;
      be randomized to double blind treatment with either valaciclovir or placebo for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to find a pre- and post-valaciclovir treatment difference in&#xD;
      hippocampal inflammation, as measured with positron emission tomography. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to improve cognition by the supposed anti-inflammatory effect on the hippocampus&#xD;
      of valaciclovir. This is measured by pre- and post-treatment performance on the PANSS, the&#xD;
      attention and memory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the treatment team and the patient will remain blinded during the course of the study.&#xD;
      Following the active treatment phase, patients will receive treatment as clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling brain disease, with unknown aetiology. Recently, we&#xD;
      have shown the presence of an inflammatory process in the hippocampus of schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients during psychosis. In addition, we found evidence for the presence of herpes viruses&#xD;
      in the temporal lobe of schizophrenic patients during psychosis. Taken together, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the hippocampal inflammation is caused by the presence of herpes viruses,&#xD;
      and that this inflammation interferes with the normal involvement of the hippocampus in&#xD;
      cognition. Anti-viral treatment, with valaciclovir, that reduces the activity herpes viruses&#xD;
      in the hippocampus could reduce the neuroinflammation and thus improve cognition and symptoms&#xD;
      in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to find a pre- and post-valaciclovir treatment difference in&#xD;
      hippocampal inflammation, as measured with positron emission tomography, in schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients exposed to a psychotic episode. The secondary objective is to improve cognition by&#xD;
      the supposed anti-inflammatory effect on the hippocampus of valaciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Study population: For this&#xD;
      study, 24 male patients compliant with schizophrenia disorder (DSM-IV codes 295.xx) are&#xD;
      included that have a psychosis. The age should be above 18 and patients of all ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 24 included patients, 12 patients will receive 8 g (4x2 g per day) of valaciclovir&#xD;
      daily for a period of 7 consecutive days and 12 patients will receive 8 g (4x2 g per day) of&#xD;
      placebo daily for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the pre-and post-treatment&#xD;
      [11C]-PK11195 binding potential (an inflammatory marker) in the hippocampus, the pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment performance on the PANSS, the attention, memory and IQ test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, if not already admitted as a part of&#xD;
      their regular treatment, and treated with valaciclovir for seven consecutive 24-h periods.&#xD;
      Patients have to fill in a questionnaire and have to undergo a part of the Schedules for&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview and a MRI scan once, and have to&#xD;
      undergo a PANSS interview, attention, memory and IQ tests, and PET scan twice. A total of 345&#xD;
      ml of blood will be taken for the determination of kidney and liver function, herpes virus&#xD;
      antibodies, acyclovir levels in blood and for the PET scan data-analysis. Treatment with&#xD;
      valaciclovir may cause nausea and headache but the risk of serious side effects is low (&lt;1&#xD;
      out of 10.000). For the PET scan, the arterial catheterization can cause discomfort and the&#xD;
      patients are exposed to radioactivity with minor to moderate risk. The patients treated with&#xD;
      valaciclovir can have direct benefit form the treatment, because it may reduce symptoms. In&#xD;
      general, when this study finds evidence for the involvement of herpes viruses in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, this can lead to improved treatment of these patients in the near future.&#xD;
