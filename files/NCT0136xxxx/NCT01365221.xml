    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare platelet reactivity between patients&#xD;
      receiving a loading dose of clopidogrel and a reloading dose of prasugrel to patients&#xD;
      receiving only a loading dose of prasugrel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized trial of approximately 260 patients with&#xD;
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In order&#xD;
      to compare platelet reactivity, as assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, we plan to recruit&#xD;
      two study groups of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have already received a 600 mg loading dose (LD) of clopidogrel in&#xD;
           preparation for PCI will receive a loading dose of 60 mg of prasugrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have not received a LD of clopidogrel will receive a 60 mg LD of prasugrel&#xD;
           prior to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 40 patients from each study group (80 patients total) will undergo additional&#xD;
      platelet reactivity testing with the vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay.All&#xD;
      patients will be followed throughout the duration of the hospital stay.&#xD;
