    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive jaundice (OJ) often require surgical, endoscopic or radiological&#xD;
      interventions to facilitate biliary drainage and relieve jaundice. However it is known that&#xD;
      patients with OJ have increased surgical risks than non-jaundiced patients undergoing the&#xD;
      same procedures. Surgery for severe OJ is associated with a significant post-operative&#xD;
      mortality (10-15%) and morbidity (30-65%). The commonest complications are related to sepsis&#xD;
      but the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this susceptibility to bacterial infection are&#xD;
      not clear. Recent work has shown a pivotal role of bile in the maintenance of enterocyte&#xD;
      tight junctions and the expression of tight junction-associated proteins which could account&#xD;
      for the translocation of enteric bacteria and bacterial products to mesenteric lymph node&#xD;
      complexes, the portal circulation and subsequently the liver. Some of these bacterial&#xD;
      products, such as endotoxin and quorum sensing signalling molecules (QSSMs), have&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties which may dampen normal immune responses to infection resulting&#xD;
      in life-threatening organ dysfunction. Bacterial endotoxin and quorum sensing signalling&#xD;
      molecules (QSSMs) represent good candidates for the mediators of this immune suppression and&#xD;
      although there is a compelling case for their involvement in the pathogenesis of sepsis,&#xD;
      evidence to support their involvement in the aetiology of infection in OJ is currently&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive jaundice (OJ) is a condition where a blockage of flow of bile from the liver&#xD;
      leads to the accumulation of bile products in the blood resulting in yellowing and itching of&#xD;
      the skin. Common causes of OJ include gallstones and also tumours of the pancreas or bile&#xD;
      duct. Relieving this type of jaundice and treating the underlying cause can include&#xD;
      endoscopic or surgical procedures. It is known however, that patients with OJ have increased&#xD;
      surgical risks than non-jaundiced patients who undergo the same operations. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that surgery for severe OJ is associated with a postoperative mortality in the region&#xD;
      of 10-15% and morbidity rates of 30-65%. Complications related to bacterial infection are&#xD;
      common and patients developing severe infections may require treatment with broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics with care in intensive or high dependency units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although antibiotics have proved invaluable in treating postoperative infections they carry&#xD;
      the potential for adverse effects. Antibiotics can suppress normal gut bacteria and allow&#xD;
      disease causing bacteria to proliferate, such as Clostridium difficile. This usually&#xD;
      manifests as mild-to-moderate diarrhoea but can occasionally cause life-threatening bowel&#xD;
      inflammation. The widespread use of antibiotics is also central to the development of&#xD;
      bacterial strains with antibiotic resistance. This clinical problem also has economic,&#xD;
      political and environmental implications for the National Health Service. Adherence to&#xD;
      measures of infection control, education and antibiotic policy can minimise antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance; however the limits surrounding such approaches have led to a demand for novel or&#xD;
      alternative strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been discovered that bacteria are able to communicate by producing&#xD;
      specialised molecules known as quorum sensing signalling molecules (QSSMs). An accumulation&#xD;
      of QSSMs in their surrounding environment allow for the bacteria to quantify the size of&#xD;
      colonies. At specific colony sizes the concentration of QSSMs reaches a critical threshold&#xD;
      leading to the activation of genes that cause an infection. Disruption of quorum sensing has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the severity of infection in animal studies and this has led to the&#xD;
      development of inhibitors of quorum sensing as a possible strategy in antibacterial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work conducted at the University of Nottingham has demonstrated that QSSMs also&#xD;
      influence the number and function of a specific type of immune cell known as 'antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells'. These cells are pivotal in allowing the immune system to recognise&#xD;
      components of bacteria as foreign and thereby mount the appropriate response. It was found&#xD;
      that large numbers of these types of cells underwent programmed cell death (cell suicide) in&#xD;
      the presence of QSSMs compared to when QSSMs were absent. This mirrors the situation in blood&#xD;
      sampled from patients with severe infections where there is a greater proportion of cell&#xD;
      deaths among antigen presenting cells than other types of immune cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that the susceptibility to infectious complications in patients with obstructive&#xD;
      jaundice is due to the interplay of various factors. The absence of intestinal bile has&#xD;
      implications for the integrity of the bowel wall as a barrier, changes in gut microflora&#xD;
      flora and translocation of both bacteria and their products. In addition, it is clear that a&#xD;
      form of immune dysfunction occurs, which dampens the normal response following exposure to&#xD;
      bacterial products. This immune dysfunction may avert powerful inflammatory cascades&#xD;
      resulting in life-threatening multi organ dysfunction but at the expense of conditions that&#xD;
      favour bacterial survival. QSSMs represent good candidates for the mediators of this immune&#xD;
      dysfunction and although there is a compelling case for their involvement in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of sepsis, definitive evidence to support their role in infective processes in OJ is&#xD;
      currently lacking.&#xD;
