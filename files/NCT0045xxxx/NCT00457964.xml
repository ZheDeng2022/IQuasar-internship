  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects RAD001 has on angiomyolipomas&#xD;
      of a person with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and to determine the safe dose of RAD001 without&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the drug will inhibit the growth of the angiomyolipomas and possibly&#xD;
      even cause regression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder with a birth incidence of approximately one&#xD;
      in six thousand. Angiomyolipomas occur in eighty percent of persons with TS, and in up to 60%&#xD;
      of persons with LAM. They are fatty tumors that often occur in kidney or liver as well as&#xD;
      other parts of the body. They can grow and cause damage to surrounding kidney tissue and even&#xD;
      renal failure. They may also leak blood causing potentially life-threatening hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies have shown that RAD001 suppresses the chemical that cause tumors to grow&#xD;
      in tuberous sclerosis and sporadic LAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of RAD001 in a 24&#xD;
      month trial. Although the primary goal is to determine if the drug RAD001 has effects on&#xD;
      angiomyolipomas, other diseases associated with tuberous sclerosis will be monitored too,&#xD;
      specifically any change in involvement of your brain or lungs with tuberous sclerosis. The&#xD;
      use of RAD001 to treat angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM is considered&#xD;
      experimental&#xD;
