  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      large tumors in order to render them operable for mastectomy or, in some cases, for&#xD;
      lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Building on this theme, several large hormonal therapies&#xD;
      are extensively investigated in the neoadjuvant setting, together with biologic correlates&#xD;
      for response and resistance. As a further extension, neoadjuvant therapies with biologic&#xD;
      agents are now too, being investigated for biologic evidence of efficacy before large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trials of thousands of patients are embarked on. The neoadjuvant setting is&#xD;
      especially attractive for these studies for several reasons including early assessment of&#xD;
      response to therapy, biopsiable access to the primary tumor, and considerable reduced sample&#xD;
      sizes compared to those required in the adjuvant setting. In addition, clinical response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a validated surrogate marker for improved survival. It may be&#xD;
      used to test the overall efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment regimens and mirrors the effect of&#xD;
      therapy on micrometastases setting. In a recent study, good clinical response to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy was the only independent variable, by multivariate analysis, associated with&#xD;
      decreased risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GW572016 is a new and promising dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against HER1/2. Hundreds of&#xD;
      patients were treated in phase I and II studies world-wide and results indicate that this&#xD;
      reversible, oral small molecule is generally well-tolerated. Studies of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      Trastuzumab indicate that HER2 interference leads to significant tumor regression even after&#xD;
      3 weeks of monotherapy. We aim to extend these findings with a novel agent, GW572016 that may&#xD;
      be more effective, especially from its in vitro data, and to discover the true response rate&#xD;
      to inhibiting HER1/2 signal transduction in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
