      The major purposes of this prospective, randomized, clinical study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine and compare the true incidence, nature, magnitude, and duration (INMD) of&#xD;
           bacteremia (bacteria found in the bloodstream) resulting from a highly invasive dental&#xD;
           office procedure (tooth extraction) and a minimally invasive and naturally occurring&#xD;
           source of bacteremia (tooth brushing);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the effect of the American Heart Association's guidelines for amoxicillin&#xD;
           prophylaxis (preventive treatment) on the INMD of bacteremia resulting from a single&#xD;
           tooth extraction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent distant site infections (DSI) from oral&#xD;
      pathogens remains a controversial issue in clinical practice. Little is known about the&#xD;
      incidence, nature, and duration (IND) of bacteremia resulting from dental extractions or&#xD;
      tooth brushing, either in the presence or absence of prophylactic antibiotic coverage. The&#xD;
      purpose of this prospective, randomized, clinical study of 300 subjects is to characterize&#xD;
      the bacteremia resulting from a highly invasive (single extraction) dental office procedure&#xD;
      and a minimally invasive and naturally occurring source of bacteremia (i.e., tooth brushing).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into three equal groups: extraction with amoxicillin, extraction&#xD;
      with placebo, and oral hygiene. The major goals are to: 1) improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      IND of bacteremias from 10 specific oral pathogens (S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. oralis, S.&#xD;
      intermedius, S. mutans, S. salivarius, F. nucleatum, A. Actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens&#xD;
      and P. gingivalis) that have been reported to cause DSI; 2) measure the effect of the&#xD;
      American Heart Association's guidelines for amoxicillin prophylaxis on the IND of bacteremia&#xD;
      resulting from a single dental extraction. Blood for aerobic and anaerobic cultures will be&#xD;
      drawn at six time points before, during, and following these oral procedures. We will employ&#xD;
      a highly sensitive broth-based culturing system (i.e., BACTEC) and improve the specificity of&#xD;
      the BACTEC results with the use of PCR sequence analysis. Detailed clinical information on&#xD;
      the extent of disease in and around the involved teeth will determine the significance of&#xD;
      local disease factors on the IND of the bacteremia from oral pathogens. Data from this study&#xD;
      should have implications regarding future guidelines and standards of care concerning&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis for individuals currently felt to be at risk for DSI.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have at least 10 teeth and the need for a dental extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be accepted into the study regardless of the extent of their odontogenic&#xD;
             and/or periodontal disease, to include Type I through IV American Association of&#xD;
             Periodontists classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who need surgical extractions that require initial removal of bone overlying&#xD;
             the surface of a tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have taken systemic antibiotics within the previous 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require antibiotic coverage, based on current practice guidelines, prior&#xD;
             to invasive dental procedures (e.g., cardiac valve abnormalities).&#xD;
