      The project outline which follows is a pilot investigation aimed at improving MRI parameters&#xD;
      in DCE-MRI to optimize the detection of treatment responses in LABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to define the activity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      biopsy proven operable breast cancer. Secondary objectives include evaluating a new MRI pulse&#xD;
      sequence to optimize DCE-MRI of LABC responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct DCE-MRI prior and after the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to monitor&#xD;
      response to therapy. This will be done in a pilot study of 5 patients enrolled at Sunnybrook&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre recruited through the project investigation. The patients will be&#xD;
      scanned on the research General Electric, 1.5 Tesla imaging system (version 12). We will use&#xD;
      specially designed coils which we have developed and optimized for breast MR imaging. These&#xD;
      allow modest compression of the breast in a medial-lateral direction and serves to bring&#xD;
      surface coils as close the breast as possible to both immobilize the breast and achieve&#xD;
      maximum coil couple and image signal/noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamic data needs to cover the entire breast, so we will use a fast T1 weighted, dynamic&#xD;
      breast MRI sequence [18, 19]. This will allow us to collect dynamic MRI data to cover the&#xD;
      tumour volume with a temporal resolution of at least 20 seconds per data set and adequate&#xD;
      spatial resolution (~1mm) to ensure adequate definition of the tumour boundary. The pulse&#xD;
      sequence will be a spoiled gradient recalled sequence (SPGR) with imaging parameters&#xD;
      TR/TE=8.2ms and min-TE. The image will be collected with a field of view of 16-20 cm&#xD;
      depending on the patient breast size. Imaging resolution will be approximately 1 mm in-plane&#xD;
      and 4-5 mm in slice thickness. The specific sequence of the imaging study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A set of localizer images to position the breast in the MRI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A series of 2D fast spin-echo T2 weighted images to cover the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An SPGR imaging sequence will be used to measure the T1 distribution over the breast for&#xD;
           subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis as described by Chen[20].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will administer intravenous Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg) followed by a saline flush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immediate prior to the Gd injection, we will start a continuous application of the&#xD;
           dynamic MRI sequence to the involved breast collecting data for 10 minutes post&#xD;
           injection of Gd-DTPA. The imaging will precede the Gd injection by approximately 2&#xD;
           minutes to provide adequate imaging data to serve as the non contrast-enhanced baseline&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 - Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These images will be used to assess the tumour as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The simplest measurement will be that of tumour size as determined by the region of&#xD;
           enhancement seen between prior to contrast enhancement versus that seen throughout the&#xD;
           10 minutes period post injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will calculate the T1 distribution throughout the breast based on the multi-angle T1&#xD;
           weighted SPGR sequence as per Cheng[20].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This data will then be used to calculate the [Gd] for each voxel in the image sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. These will be used to estimate Ktrans and Ve from a two compartment tumour model[15].&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We will calculate these parameters over a region of interest defined by the enhancing&#xD;
           tumour border.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. We will estimate these parameters on a pixel basis to study tumour heterogeneity over&#xD;
           the tumour as characterized by the statistics of the parameters Ktrans and Ve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumour volume measurements will be done by Dr. P. Causer of the Department of Medical&#xD;
      Imaging of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The analysis of the dynamic data will be done&#xD;
      by Dr. Plewes' group and Dr. A Martel of Imaging Research in conjunction with Dr. Causer. The&#xD;
      final result, will be measures of the changes in tumour volume before and after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In addition, we will have information regarding the distribution of Ktrans and&#xD;
      Ve over the regions of the tumour and their variation before and after therapy.&#xD;
