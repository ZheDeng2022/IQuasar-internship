    <textblock>
      Most patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) are treated with therapeutic doses&#xD;
      of radioiodine (131I) after initial surgery (total or near total thyroidectomy), aimed to&#xD;
      destroy microscopic residual normal or tumoral thyroid cells and to facilitate the early&#xD;
      detection of tumor recurrence based on serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement and 131I whole&#xD;
      body scan (WBS) (1-5). Recently, preparation of patients for thyroid ablation with rhTSH and&#xD;
      3700 MBq of 131I on l-thyroxine (l-T4) therapy has been approved in Europe by the European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency (EMEA) as an alternative to thyroid hormone withdrawal (6), after a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, multicenter study demonstrated that both methods of preparation are&#xD;
      equally effective (with 100% rate of successful ablation) and that patients prepared with&#xD;
      rhTSH received lower total body irradiation and experienced a better quality of life compared&#xD;
      to those rendered hypothyroid (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was aimed to compare the efficacy of fixed activities of 1850 MBq versus&#xD;
      3700 MBq of 131I for post surgical thyroid ablation in DTC patients prepared with rhTSH&#xD;
      (TSHα, Thyrogen®, Genzyme Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA) on l-T4 therapy.&#xD;

      Aim: Recently, a multicenter study in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients showed&#xD;
      that 3700 MBq of 131I after rhTSH stimulation had successful post-surgical thyroid ablation&#xD;
      rate similar to that obtained after thyroid hormone withdrawal. We investigated whether 1850&#xD;
      MBq of 131I have a rate of successful ablation similar to 3700 MBq in patients prepared with&#xD;
      rhTSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Seventy-two patients with DTC were randomly assigned after surgery to receive 1850&#xD;
      MBq (group A, n: 36) or 3700 MBq (group B, n: 36) of 131I after rhTSH. The two groups were&#xD;
      comparable for age, sex, histotype and tumor stage. One injection of 0.9 mg of rhTSH was&#xD;
      administered for two consecutive days; 131I therapy was delivered 24 hours after the last&#xD;
      injection. A post-therapy whole body scan (WBS) was performed 72 hours later. Successful&#xD;
      ablation was assessed 6-8 months after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Successful ablation, defined as no visible uptake in the diagnostic WBS after rhTSH&#xD;
      stimulation, was achieved in 88.9% of group A and group B patients. Basal and&#xD;
      rhTSH-stimulated serum Tg was undetectable (&lt;1 ng/ml) in 88.6 % of group A and 84.8% of group&#xD;
      B patients (p=0.65). Similar rates of ablation were obtained in both groups also in patients&#xD;
      with lymph node metastases. Dosimetric data showed similar thyroid bed uptake, effective&#xD;
      half-life and adsorbed dose in the two groups. Failure to ablate was not correlated with TNM&#xD;
      staging, peak TSH levels, thyroid bed uptake and urinary iodine excretion at the time of&#xD;
      ablation, but was influenced by the absorbed dose of 131I (&lt; or &gt;300 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that therapeutic 131I activities of 1850 MBq are equally&#xD;
      effective as 3700 MBq for thyroid ablation in DTC patients prepared with rhTSH, even in the&#xD;
      presence of lymph node metastases.&#xD;
