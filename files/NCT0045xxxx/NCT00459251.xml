    <textblock>
      This main purpose of this study is to understand the difference and distribution of&#xD;
      drug-metabolizing enzyme genetic polymorphisms among Taiwan ethnicities. The subjects of&#xD;
      study include Atayal, Pawlan, Yami, Tsou, Ami, Minnan and Hakka. We anticipate establishing a&#xD;
      reference for the clinical medication in various ethnic groups according to the difference&#xD;
      and distribution of the genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It has been shown that the same medication causes different responses in different&#xD;
      individuals. In addition to environments, diets, and physical conditions, the genetic&#xD;
      variations play an important role in the various responses. For instant, genetic variations&#xD;
      in drug-metabolism enzymes may be responsible to different abilities in drug metabolism. Some&#xD;
      people have higher drug-metabolizing enzyme activity for certain drug and may need higher&#xD;
      dose to reach the effective therapy; some are poor in metabolizing the same drug, and may&#xD;
      cause adverse drug reactions. Genetic variation also may cause different functions of the&#xD;
      cell transporters. The most notable example is that some tumor cells have a kind of&#xD;
      transporters called p-glycoprotein which can pump out the anti-tumor drugs to extracellular,&#xD;
      and it turns the tumor cells become resistant to the drugs. Hence, if we can elucidate the&#xD;
      gene variation of each individual, we can give each individual different therapy based on&#xD;
      their genetic variations. This approach is called 「individualized medicine」.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reach the goal of individualized medicine, many studies have been focused on&#xD;
      drug-metabolizing enzyme genetic variations between races or ethnicities. Especially, single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism provides a very important basis to clinical medication. N-&#xD;
      acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is one kind of drug-metabolizing enzymes and its single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms have remarkable effect on drug-metabolism. Only 10~30 % are slow acetylators in&#xD;
      Asian population, but 40~70% are found in Caucasian population. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450,CYP)&#xD;
      is another important drug-metabolizing enzyme family. Among the family, the CYP2C9, CYP2C19,&#xD;
      and CYP2D6 play key roles on drug metabolism. Many literatures showed that all the three&#xD;
      enzymes have various distributions of SNPs in different races. It indicates that different&#xD;
      races may have different abilities in drug-metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, it is important&#xD;
      to provide a strategy to overcome the difficulties in individualized medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous studies, scientists often take Chinese as the representatives of Asian people&#xD;
      and the Minnan/ Hakka or so-called Han people as the subjects when study the Taiwan&#xD;
      ethnicity. The genetic variations in the Taiwan aborigines are poorly investigated. It has&#xD;
      been showed that remarkable genetic variations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) between&#xD;
      Taiwan aborigines and Minnan/ Hakka by Lin ML and her colleagues. They are highly homogenous&#xD;
      within each tribe, but diversified among the different tribes due to long-term isolation.&#xD;
      Therefore, we expect to establish a database of genetic variations in drug-metabolism enzymes&#xD;
      among these groups in order to use as the basis for clinical medication. This study includes&#xD;
      seven groups, and each of them has 50 independent samples for drug-metabolizing enzyme&#xD;
      genetic polymorphism analysis. The important enzymes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and NAT2, etc.,&#xD;
      are studied in this project. ABI 7900HT instrument and traditional polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) - restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) both are used for SNPs analysis, and&#xD;
      gene sequence also would be used to confirm the results.&#xD;
