  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of a drug called betahistine on appetite and food intake&#xD;
      in overweight women. Betahistine has been used for many years to treat vertigo (dizziness).&#xD;
      It was taken off the market in the United States in 1970 because it was thought to be&#xD;
      ineffective for vertigo, but is still used for this purpose in many other countries. Some&#xD;
      research suggests that betahistine may reduce appetite and food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy overweight women between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates must have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 and weigh less than 300&#xD;
      pounds. They are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), breathing test and eating behavior questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 3-day/2-night stay for the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication: Subjects take either betahistine (in one of three possible doses) or placebo&#xD;
           capsules one time on the days of admission to the Clinical Center (day 1), three times&#xD;
           on day 2 and two times on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests and 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting metabolic rate: Subjects rest quietly for 1 hour after awakening and then rest&#xD;
           again under a clear plastic hood or while wearing a face mask, breathing normally for&#xD;
           about 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to measure body fat, muscle, and bone mineral content: Subjects lie on a table&#xD;
           above a source of X-rays while a very small dose of X-rays is passed through the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meal studies: Subjects food intake is measured on days 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: Subjects complete questionnaires about how hungry or full they are&#xD;
           feeling and rate how much they liked the foods they ate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current medications for the long-term treatment of obesity are moderately effective at best.&#xD;
      Therefore, research focusing on compounds that affect energy balance through novel mechanisms&#xD;
      is warranted. Preliminary human and animal data suggest central nervous system histaminergic&#xD;
      tone is important in the regulation of food intake. We therefore propose to study the effects&#xD;
      of betahistine hydrochloride, a histamine analogue which has agonist activity at the&#xD;
      histaminergic H1 receptor and antagonist/reverse agonist activity at the H3 receptor. Prior&#xD;
      animal studies have suggested that betahistine suppresses food intake and reduces body&#xD;
      weight, but there are sparse human data assessing the effects of betahistine on metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Betahistine s effects on women s food intake and metabolism will be evaluated through an&#xD;
      inpatient randomized double-blind placebo controlled dose-ranging study. We will examine the&#xD;
      acute effects of betahistine on food intake, hunger, and satiety, resting energy expenditure,&#xD;
      and on hormones and substrates relevant for body weight regulation. If results suggest&#xD;
      betahistine has salutary effects on food intake or metabolism in humans, these studies will&#xD;
      lay the groundwork for additional investigations to assess the efficacy of betahistine in the&#xD;
      treatment of obesity.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Good general health. In general, subjects will be required to take no medications.&#xD;
             However, individuals taking medications for obesity-related co-morbid conditions, who&#xD;
             have not had changes in dosage for more than 6 months, may be included, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female sex. In this pilot study, we seek to decrease the variability of subject&#xD;
             response to the greatest extent possible. Since women have a higher prevalence of&#xD;
             obesity than men, and tend to be the group that most uses weight loss pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
             we will only study women in the pilot investigation. Subsequent studies with include&#xD;
             both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Regular menses (either spontaneous or as a result of oral contraceptive pills) or&#xD;
             post-menopausal status (no menses for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 kg/m(2) but weight under&#xD;
             300 lbs, in order for subject to be able to undergo DEXA scanning with the Hologic&#xD;
             instrument available in the Nuclear Medicine Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A negative pregnancy test at the initial evaluation. Sexually active women must be&#xD;
             using an effective form of birth control. These methods include abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or&#xD;
             medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). (One of these methods&#xD;
             must have been used by the subject for at least two months prior to the start of the&#xD;
             study). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is&#xD;
             recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to participate in the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Volunteers will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as&#xD;
             needed) for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic (other than obesity-related&#xD;
                  steatosis), gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper-&#xD;
                  or hypothyroidism, pheochromocytoma), hematological problems or pulmonary&#xD;
                  disorders; or porphyria;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of anaphylaxis, asthma, urticaria, rhinitis, allergic rash, or other&#xD;
                  allergic disease requiring antihistamine treatment; subjects with a history of&#xD;
                  antihistamine treatment for a self-limited allergic reaction such as to poison&#xD;
                  ivy or to a medication that they are no longer taking may be included at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of peptic ulcer disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Baseline QT interval prolongation (greater than or equal to 480 msec QTc) because&#xD;
                  of reports of histaminergic compounds causing prolonged QT interval and cardiac&#xD;
                  arrhythmias in susceptible patients (i.e. those with prolonged QT interval at&#xD;
                  baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Current smokers of tobacco products;&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Self-reported lactose intolerance;&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Self-reported food allergy to foods used in standardized food array in this&#xD;
                  protocol or to betahistine itself;&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Subjects following a diet with specific food requirements such as vegetarian,&#xD;
                  vegan, or kosher because of the use of a standardized food array in this&#xD;
                  protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Subjects with a history of DSMIV classifiable eating disorders such as anorexia&#xD;
                  nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder will be excluded from the&#xD;
                  current proof-of-concept study;&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Women with reproductive potential who are pregnant or who are currently nursing&#xD;
                  an infant;&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Individuals who have current substance abuse or a psychiatric disorder or other&#xD;
                  condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence or&#xD;
                  compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Subjects who regularly use prescription medications unrelated to the&#xD;
                  complications of obesity (especially vasoactive compounds such as calcium channel&#xD;
                  blockers, nitrates, beta-blockers, etc.), subjects using H2 blockers for&#xD;
                  dyspepsia, and subjects who require chronic use of antihistamines for allergic&#xD;
                  conditions; oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided the contraceptive&#xD;
                  has been used for at least two months before starting study medication. The use&#xD;
                  of over-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed on a&#xD;
                  case-by-case basis; depending on the medication, subjects who have continued to&#xD;
                  take prescription medication for at least 3 months prior to study entry may be&#xD;
                  eligible. Allowable medications may include statins for the treatment of&#xD;
                  dyslipidemia and low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of acute coronary&#xD;
                  syndrome. Medications used for the treatment of hypertension will not be allowed&#xD;
                  because of the potential vasodilatory activity of betahistine.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Recent (3 months) use of anorexiant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Weight change of more than 3% of body weight in the past two months;&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Subjects with a consistently (2 weeks apart) elevated systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
                  greater than 160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg.&#xD;
