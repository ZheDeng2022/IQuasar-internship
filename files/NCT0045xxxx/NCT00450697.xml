      Premature infants, especially those less than 1250 gm at birth are extremely difficult to&#xD;
      feed. For unknown physiologic reasons oral feeding also called enteral feeding is not well&#xD;
      tolerated in these immature babies. Because of this challenge these infants require&#xD;
      intravenous fluids solution called parenteral nutrition (TPN). Intravenous nutrition is&#xD;
      inadequate because it cannot supply sufficient calories for growth both of body and brain.&#xD;
      The composition of intravenous nutrition is also toxic to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those reasons it is very important to achieve adequate enteral nutrition in premature&#xD;
      infants as soon as possible after birth. However the best feeding method for those babies has&#xD;
      not been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since premature babies are unable to suck and swallow properly, feeding is administered by a&#xD;
      tube inserted into the infant's stomach. The timing between feeds is inconsistent. Some&#xD;
      infants are fed every 3 hours, whereas others are fed every 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine which feeding method is better. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      feeding every 4 hours by allowing more time for digestion will improve feeding tolerance in&#xD;
      premature infants. In addition it will also facilitate discontinuation of TPN sooner, thus&#xD;
      causing less side effects.&#xD;

      In premature infants feeding tolerance is limited due to immaturity of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract. Motor patterns of the gastrointestinal tract differ greatly in preterm infants as&#xD;
      compared to adults. These differences in gastrointestinal motor function in premature&#xD;
      neonates translates into less efficient gastric emptying and slower intestinal transit time.&#xD;
      It usually manifests as residual feeds in the stomach prior to the next scheduled feeding and&#xD;
      may be associated with abdominal distention, bile-staining aspirates, or lack of stooling. In&#xD;
      most instances the gastric residuals are benign and relate to immature gastrointestinal&#xD;
      motility, however they may also be an early indication of bowel obstruction, ileus or&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis. Thus, feeding intolerance often leads to temporary cessation of&#xD;
      feeds, and prolongs the time to reach full feeds, as well as the time on parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (which predisposes the infants to nosocomial infection, hepatic dysfunction), and prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achievement of adequate enteral nutrition, as soon as possible after birth is the ultimate&#xD;
      goal for all low birth weight infants (&lt;1250 gm); however the best methods by which&#xD;
      sufficient enteral nutrition can be provided remain controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of feeding strategies are practiced. In our Neonatal ICU feeds are initiated by&#xD;
      boluses and infants are being fed either every 3 hours or every 4 hours. A review of the&#xD;
      literature (2006) revealed that there was no study comparing those two methods of feeding. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that very low birth weight infants (≤1250 gm) will tolerate feedings better when&#xD;
      introduced every 4 hours instead every 3 hours, by providing sufficient time for gastric&#xD;
      emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct this prospective, randomized, clinical trial to determine whether&#xD;
      intermittent bolus gavage feedings every 4 hours leads to better feeding tolerance than&#xD;
      intermittent bolus gavage feedings every 3 hours in very low birth weight infants &lt; 1250grams&#xD;
      birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very low birth weight infants fed by intermittent bolus gavage every 4 hours will achieve&#xD;
      full enteral feeding (120 kcal/kg per day) at an earlier postnatal age and have less feeding&#xD;
      intolerance than infants fed every 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent bolus gavage feeding every 4 hours will improve feeding tolerance, cause less&#xD;
      need for parenteral nutrition and its major complication - cholestasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective, randomized clinical study with recruitment at NY Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
           Cornell Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent will be obtained from one or both parents prior to enrollment&#xD;
           of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days to reach full feeds of 120 ml/kg per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of feeding intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days on parenteral nutrition (parenteral nutrition is discontinued when an infant&#xD;
           tolerates enteral feeding of 100 ml/kg per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of cholestatic jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether infants fed by intermittent gastric bolus gavage every 4 hours will have&#xD;
      less feeding intolerance and reach full feeds at least 2 days earlier than infants fed every&#xD;
      3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if feeding every 4 hours will facilitate discontinuation of parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      at an earlier postnatal age and result in less incidence of cholestasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Weight ≤ 1250 gm Sufficient stability to start early (day 3-5) enteral&#xD;
      feedings Appropriate weight for gestational age Infants receiving ventilatory support and&#xD;
      those with indwelling umbilical arterial catheters will be included Absence of major&#xD;
      congenital malformations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant will be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental request If feeding cannot be initiated prior to day of life 10 NEC requiring surgery&#xD;
      Prolonged (&gt; 3days) intolerance to the feeding regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants who meet all of the above criteria will be randomly assigned using sealed opaque&#xD;
           envelopes, to either every the 3 hour or every 4 hour feeding groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasogastric feeding will be initiated on the third to fifth postnatal day provided the&#xD;
           infant's cardiorespiratory status is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bolus feeding over 30 to 60 min will be given as per usual clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expressed breast milk is the nutrition of choice. If not available Premature Formula of&#xD;
           24 kcal/30 ml will be used as per usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding will be started and advanced in daily increments depending on infant's weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  500 gm to 750 gm - 10 ml/kg per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  751gm to 1000gm - 15 ml/kg per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1001 gm to 1250gm - 20 ml/kg per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric residual will be measured prefeed (every 3 or 4 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All feeding-related clinical decisions (when to withhold feedings) will be up to the&#xD;
           attending physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parenteral nutrition, including lipid emulsion, will be started on days 1 or 2 and&#xD;
           continued until each infant tolerates enteral feeding of 100 ml/kg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Successful achievement of full enteral feeding is defined as the ability to tolerate&#xD;
           enteral feedings of 110-120 ml/kg per day for at least 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily weight, intake and output, number of stools, number of guaiac positive stools,&#xD;
           number of hours that feedings were withheld, episodes of apnea and bradycardia will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
