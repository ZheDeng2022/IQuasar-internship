      In this study we will test the hypothesis that concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) with&#xD;
      temozolomide after induction chemotherapy by conventional high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)&#xD;
      plus dexamethasone may be an effective and well tolerated treatment for immunocompetent&#xD;
      patients with PCSNL. Corticosteroid can effectively reduce brain edema and corticosteroid&#xD;
      alone has resulted in complete or partial remission in about 40% patients with PCNSL. To&#xD;
      enhance local disease control, CCRT with temozolomide will be used in the study. Temozolomide&#xD;
      is a well-tolerated oral alkylating agent that is able to permeate the BBB. Concurrent&#xD;
      temozolomide with WBRT has shown superior effect to WBRT alone for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic brain tumors and glioblastoma multiforme. In addition, temozolomide has&#xD;
      single-agent activity for PCNSL (21% CR in relapsed or refractory PCNSL in a phase II trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center phase II study. The primary end point of&#xD;
      is the complete response rate. This study is a two-stage design for testing non-inferiority&#xD;
      of the proposed treatment as compared to the approximately 80% response rate reported for&#xD;
      conventional treatment. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 20%, a sample size of 25&#xD;
      subjects, which provides an 80% power for establishment of non-inferiority. At the first&#xD;
      stage, 15 subjects are to be enrolled. If equal to or more than 6 patients achieve complete&#xD;
      response, the study would accrue additional 10 subjects. The treatment regimen is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction chemotherapy: MS regimen (repeated every 14 days, total 4 cycles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate 3.5 g/m2 i.v. infusion 4 hours on day1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylprednisolone 200 mg/m2/day i.v. infusion 30 minutes, on day1-4 Concurrent&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy (CCRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) 2 Gy per fraction daily, 5 days per week&#xD;
           Temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day orally daily, only on the days of WBRT&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. 5.2 Ineligibility Criteria&#xD;
           Patient meets any of the following will be excluded form the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are seropositive for HIV, AIDS, use of immunosuppressant or who are post&#xD;
           organ transplant are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other investigational agents.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris. High risk uncontrolled&#xD;
                arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Uncontrolled infection (active serous infections that are not controlled by&#xD;
                antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Concurrent treatment with any other experimental drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 PLAN OF THE STUDY 6.1 Study Design This is an open-label, multi-center phase II study&#xD;
      designed to access the response rate (including CR, CRu and PR, definition refers to 10.2.2)&#xD;
      in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma receiving MS followed by CCRT with&#xD;
      temozolomide. The secondary objectives are to access time to progression and to the safety of&#xD;
      the combination in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Sample Size The primary end point of this phase II study is the objective tumor response&#xD;
      rate. This study is a two-stage design for testing non-inferiority of the proposed treatment&#xD;
      as compared to the approximately 80% response rate reported for conventional treatment.&#xD;
      Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 20%, a sample size of 25 subjects, which provides an 80%&#xD;
      power for establishment of non-inferiority, was selected based on the method described in&#xD;
      Batchelor et al.7 At the first stage, 15 subjects are to be enrolled. If fewer than six&#xD;
      patients respond (the one-sided 93% upper bound of the observed response rate is lower than&#xD;
      60%), the study would be terminated. Otherwise, the study would accrue additional 10&#xD;
      subjects. At the end of second stage, if the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit of the&#xD;
      point estimate of the response rate is greater than or equal to 60%, the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      study treatment is inferior to the conventional treatment would not be rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Treatments Schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy (MS regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient with leptomeningeal involvement or CSF+ at diagnosis, intrathecal&#xD;
           methotrexate will be given during the period of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two to 4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, if the disease is confined&#xD;
           within brain parenchyma or completely remitted, concurrent temozolomide with whole brain&#xD;
           radiation will be started. (Table 1. is and example of 2 weeks after induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease is beyond brain parenchyma or persistent leptomeningeal involvement&#xD;
           during or after completion of induction chemotherapy, the patient should be taken off&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Induction Chemotherapy (MS regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methotrexate 3.5 g/m2 i.v. infusion 4 hours on day1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylprednisolone 200 mg/m2/day i.v. infusion 30 minutes, on day1-4&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cycles will be repeated every 2 weeks on week 1, 3, 5, and 7, if no evidence of&#xD;
                disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sample orders are detailed in Appendix V.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Hydration and urine alkalization: It is mandatory that all patients receive&#xD;
                adequate hydration and urine alkalization (keep urine pH &gt;7) post the methotrexate&#xD;
                infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Antiemetics: All patients could receive prophylactic antiemetic medication 30&#xD;
                minutes before each methotrexate infusion. 5-HT3 antagonists are recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Leucovorin rescue: Leucovorin 30 mg i.v. every 6 hours should be started since 24&#xD;
                hours after the start of methotrexate infusion until serum methotrexate level is&#xD;
                less than 0.05 mcM and at least 8 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  In patients with delayed early methotrexate elimination and/or evidence of&#xD;
                     acute renal injury (serum methotrexate level of 50 mcM or more at 24 hours, or&#xD;
                     5 mcM or more at 48 hours after administration, or serum creatinine≧ 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
                     at 24 hours) give leucovorin 150 mg IV every 3 hours until methotrexate level&#xD;
                     is less than 1 mcM then 30 mg IV every 6 hours until methotrexate level is&#xD;
                     less than 0.05 mcM.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  In patients with delayed late methotrexate elimination (serum methotrexate&#xD;
                     level remaining above 0.2 mcM at 72 hours or more than 0.05 mcM at 96 hours&#xD;
                     after administration), continue leucovorin 30 mg i.v. every 6 hours until&#xD;
                     methotrexate level is less than 0.05 mcM;&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Others: Allopurinol and antacid are recommended during the first 5 days of each&#xD;
                cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Intrathecal Methotrexate  Methotrexate 12 mg intrathecal injection on day 8 of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Only for leptomeningeal involvement or CSF cytology positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks on week 2, 4, 6, and 8, if no evidence of disease&#xD;
           progression. If the induction chemotherapy with MS is delayed, intrathecal methotrexate&#xD;
           schedule will be decided by treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If CSF+ is newly found during treatment, the patient must be off protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Leucovorin 15 mg p.o. bid should be used 24 hours after intrathecal methotrexate for 3&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5 Concurrent Whole Brain Radiation with Temozolomide 7.5.1 Whole Brain Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) 2 Gy per fraction daily, 5 days per week&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For patients with CR or CRu after induction chemotherapy, a total of 30 Gy will be&#xD;
                given; for patients with non-CR/ CRu after induction chemotherapy, a total of 36 Gy&#xD;
                will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. WBRT should be initiated within 2-4 weeks after starting the last induction&#xD;
                chemotherapy if no active infection or life threatening complication is noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Continuation of WBRT as schedule is suggested unless the treating physicians judge&#xD;
                the patient's condition to be inappropriate to receive WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Physical Factors: Treatment will be delivered using megavoltage machines with&#xD;
                photon beams ranging from 4 to 8 MV. The minimum dose rate at the midplane in the&#xD;
                brain on the central axis must be 0.50 Gy/minute. Electron, particle, or implant&#xD;
                therapy is not permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Simulation, Immobilization, Localization: The patient will be treated in the supine&#xD;
                position. Adequate immobilization and reproducibility of position are encouraged.&#xD;
                The target volume will cover the brain and the meninges to the foramen magnum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Treatment Planning: Treatments must be delivered through parallel opposed or 5&#xD;
                degree RAO-LAO fields that cover the entire cranial contents. There should be beam&#xD;
                fall-off of at least 1 cm. The eyes will be excluded from the beam either by field&#xD;
                arrangement or shielding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Stereotactic radiosurgery and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) are not&#xD;
                allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7.5.2 Temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day orally daily, only on the days of WBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Criteria for starting Temozolomide: The initiation of temozolomide will be based&#xD;
                upon complete blood counts (CBC) obtained within 48 hours prior to starting the&#xD;
                treatment. If ANC is ≥ 1,000/mm3 and platelet count is ≥ 75,000/mm3, the&#xD;
                temozolomide may be started. If study drug cannot be administered on the scheduled&#xD;
                day of dosing, the CBC will be repeated every 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Since capsules of study drug are available in 20 and 100 mg capsules in Taiwan, all&#xD;
                doses will be rounded up to the nearest 20 mg to accommodate capsule strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects should be instructed to swallow capsules whole and in rapid succession and&#xD;
                to not chew capsules. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no&#xD;
                re-dosing of the subject is allowed before the next scheduled dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Temozolomide should be taken on an empty stomach. It should be administered at&#xD;
                approximately the same time every day within and during each cycle. In general,&#xD;
                patient tolerability is best when the drug is given at bedtime with antiemetics one&#xD;
                hour prior to temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Since this is an oral drug, episodes of emesis will result in under dosing.&#xD;
                Prophylactic antiemetics (oral metoclopramide is preferred, either oral or&#xD;
                intravenous administration 5-HT3 antagonist could also be used if intolerable or&#xD;
                not response to metoclopramide) must be administered to all subjects prior to&#xD;
                temozolomide administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7.6 Concomitant Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
                Concomitant medications allowed and not allowed are described below:&#xD;

                /mm3, neutropenic fever or documented infection while neutropenic. Prophylactic use&#xD;
                of G-CSF could be decided by treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Preventive oral or i.v. antibiotics when neutropenia &lt; 500/mm3 without fever are&#xD;
                recommended, but the decision to use antibiotics in this case will be left to the&#xD;
                current policy within the different hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Lamivudine 100 mg orally once a day is recommended for HBV carrier to prevent HBV&#xD;
                reactivation during whole treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Prophylactic anticonvulsant agents are not recommended. For patients with&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must fulfill all the following criteria to be eligible for admission for the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven central nervous system lymphoma of brain parenchyma with or&#xD;
