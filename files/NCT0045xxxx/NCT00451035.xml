    <description>QTc monitoring was performed on specified days (Cycle1: Day1, 5 and 26), as well as a single pre-dose ECG once weekly during Cycle1: Week2 and Week3, Cycle2, and all subsequent cycles. Patient eligibility was ensured by a screening QTcF interval calculated by eResearchTechnology(eRT) prior to the baseline assessments. Treatment decisions were based on QTc determined by the automated reading at the investigational site (commonly used the Bazett's correction,QTcB) or measured and calculated by trained personnel at the site. Dosing relied on the investigator's assessment of the 6 baseline ECGs (the average of the 6pre-dose QTc intervals) performed prior to Cycle1/Day1 dosing, of the 3pre-dose ECGs during Cycle1:Day5 and 26, and of the single pre-dose ECGs performed once weekly for the remaining weeks of Cycle1 and subsequent cycles. The Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value QTcF interval for analysis was calculated by eRT based on the 6 baseline ECGs obtained on Cycle1/Day1.</description>

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

        <description>QTc monitoring was performed on specified days (Cycle1: Day1, 5 and 26), as well as a single pre-dose ECG once weekly during Cycle1: Week2 and Week3, Cycle2, and all subsequent cycles. Patient eligibility was ensured by a screening QTcF interval calculated by eResearchTechnology(eRT) prior to the baseline assessments. Treatment decisions were based on QTc determined by the automated reading at the investigational site (commonly used the Bazett's correction,QTcB) or measured and calculated by trained personnel at the site. Dosing relied on the investigator's assessment of the 6 baseline ECGs (the average of the 6pre-dose QTc intervals) performed prior to Cycle1/Day1 dosing, of the 3pre-dose ECGs during Cycle1:Day5 and 26, and of the single pre-dose ECGs performed once weekly for the remaining weeks of Cycle1 and subsequent cycles. The Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value QTcF interval for analysis was calculated by eRT based on the 6 baseline ECGs obtained on Cycle1/Day1.</description>
