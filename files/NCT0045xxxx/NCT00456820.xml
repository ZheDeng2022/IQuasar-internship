  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out differences in activation of mood regulating areas&#xD;
      of the brain in response to negative and positive pictures, before and after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      additional Wellbutrin XL treatment. Participants should have been treated for depression with&#xD;
      an SSRI medication (e.g., Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa or Lexapro) and have decreased&#xD;
      depression symptoms but also be experiencing side effects of medications such as sexual side&#xD;
      effects and feelings of apathy (indifference, lack of interest) and lack of full emotional&#xD;
      response. We will first take a brain scan to measure activity in different parts of the&#xD;
      brain, while subjects are seeing pictures, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Then&#xD;
      we will add Wellbutrin XL - another well-known antidepressant that acts by increasing the&#xD;
      chemical dopamine in the brain, to subjects' treatment. Wellbutrin addition is useful in&#xD;
      decreasing the sexual side effects of SSRIs. After treatment with Wellbutrin XL for 6 weeks&#xD;
      subjects will have a second MRI scan with picture rating.&#xD;

      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.After wellbutrin XL addition for 6 weeks, SSRI treated subjects will show&#xD;
      increased activation and connectivity of prefrontal cortex and limbic regions such as the&#xD;
      amygdala on exposure to negative and positive pictures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.Increase in activation of the MRC (Mood Regulating Circuit) will correlate with&#xD;
      decrease in Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score and Sexual Dysfunction Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study a maximum of 15 subjects in this study. SSRI treated depressed patients who&#xD;
      after treatment of depression continue to suffer from sexual dysfunction and apathy will be&#xD;
      included in the study. fMRI will be conducted at baseline and after addition of Wellbutrin XL&#xD;
      treatment 300 mg po qd and then used at a dose of 300 mg - 450 mg from week 3 - 6 depending&#xD;
      on response and tolerance. Patients will also be rated weekly on 17-item Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRAS) (Montgomery and Asberg&#xD;
      1979), AES (Marin et al 1991), Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) and&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression (Improvement) weekly for 6 weeks. Depressed patients will also be&#xD;
      rated on the scan days on cognitive measures such as verbal memory and working memory.&#xD;
