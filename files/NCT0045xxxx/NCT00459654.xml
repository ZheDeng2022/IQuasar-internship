      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
      radioisotope Radium-223 in treatment of men with prostate cancer and bone metastases that no&#xD;
      longer respond to hormonal treatment.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the biological effectiveness of radium-223 therapy measured as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to occurrence of skeletal-related events(SREs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone-ALP) levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Frequency of new SREs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportions of patients with an SRE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportions of patients with SRE at different time points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment response with regard to pain and analgesic use(termed &quot;Palliative effect&quot; in&#xD;
           study protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment&#xD;
