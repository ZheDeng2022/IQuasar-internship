      The purpose of this study is to see if sequence inversion of Intensity - modulated&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer, can improve the safety and deliverability of&#xD;
      concurrent docetaxel chemotherapy with long - term hormonal therapy. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      inverting the traditional sequence of radiotherapy can delay the time to treatment - induced&#xD;
      bowel toxicity.&#xD;

      1.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if the inversion of sequencing of multi - phase, intensity - modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT), for the treatment of patients with high - risk prostate cancer, can&#xD;
      improve the delivery of concurrent, weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy, in concert with long -&#xD;
      term androgen deprivation (LTAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if the inversion of sequencing of multi - phase IMRT can improve the time to&#xD;
      grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal toxicity, the total amount of Docetaxel that can be delivered,&#xD;
      or the quality of life in patients receiving concurrent, weekly Docetaxel chemotherapy, in&#xD;
      concert with long - term androgen deprivation (LTAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Rationale to investigate chemo - radiation in high - risk, non - metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, compared to radiotherapy alone, has resulted in&#xD;
      improvements in overall survival and cure in patients with locally advanced head and neck ,&#xD;
      cervix , and lung cancer . Long - term androgen deprivation (LTAD) and radiotherapy results&#xD;
      in modest 10 year overall and biochemical - free relapse rates in patients with &quot;High risk&quot;&#xD;
      disease . Treatment intensification, in the form of escalation of radiotherapy dose, the&#xD;
      addition of chemotherapy, or the addition of radical prostatectomy, in highly - selected&#xD;
      patients, has been proposed in the literature , . Given the success of combining concurrent&#xD;
      chemotherapy with radiotherapy in other solid tumor sites, it would seem reasonable to&#xD;
      investigate this in patients with high - risk, non - metastatic prostate cancer, as defined&#xD;
      in the Canadian consensus document , who are in the worst prognostic category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Choice of chemotherapy agent and regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal chemotherapy to combine with radiation therapy is unknown for the treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. A recent phase III study has, however, shown the superiority of Docetaxel&#xD;
      and prednisone chemotherapy over the previous standard regimen, Mitoxantrone and prednisone ,&#xD;
      in men with metastatic prostate cancer, who demonstrated progression on androgen deprivation.&#xD;
      For the first time, an improvement in overall median survival was seen for the regimen&#xD;
      containing Docetaxel (18.9 vs 16.5 months, p = 0.009), with 48% of men having a 50% or&#xD;
      greater reduction in PSA, and improved HRQOL. Toxicity was felt to be acceptable, with the&#xD;
      main toxicities (&gt;30% probability) being: fatigue, alopecia, nausea and/or vomiting,&#xD;
      neutropenia, nail changes, sensory neuropathy, and diarrhea. The results of this study were&#xD;
      supported by a similar phase III study showing superiority of Docetaxel, estramustine and&#xD;
      prednisone over Mitoxantrone and prednisone in patients with progressive, hormone -&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review reveals that there is only one published study of concurrent Docetaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy and external beam radiation. The study by Kumar describes a phase I, dose -&#xD;
      escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly Docetaxel.&#xD;
      The patient population included twenty - two patients with localized, &quot;high risk&quot; prostate&#xD;
      cancer, and used modern external beam radiotherapy to a conventional dose of 70.2 Gray in 39&#xD;
      fractions, including treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes to a dose of 45 Gray in 25&#xD;
      fractions. They determined that the maximum weekly-tolerated dose of Docetaxel was 20 mg/m2,&#xD;
      and that at a dose level of 25 mg/m2, the dose - limiting toxicity was grade 3 diarrhea&#xD;
      (using the NCI common toxicity criteria, version 2.0 ), which occurred in 2 patients,&#xD;
      necessitating a 25% dose reduction. In addition to clinical feasibility, additional studies&#xD;
      suggest that Docetaxel may be a reasonable agent to study. There is evidence from in vitro&#xD;
      studies that Docetaxel increases the radio - responsiveness by 2.5 to 3 times , , . Docetaxel&#xD;
      inhibits the action of Bcl-2, through the phosphorylation of serine residues on the Bcl-2&#xD;
      molecule, promoting apoptosis via the caspase cascade , a pathway of cell apoptosis also&#xD;
      utilized by ionizing radiation. Docetaxel is also felt to inhibit the growth of Bcl-2&#xD;
      negative tumors through overexpression of p27, a protein often lost in androgen - insensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of predictors of radiation and androgen therapy resistance, compared to the&#xD;
      dominant targets of docetaxol also highlights why docetaxol may be an ideal agent. A small&#xD;
      study by Rossner examined patients who underwent salvage radical prostatectomy after&#xD;
      biochemical failure from external beam radiotherapy . Fifty - five percent of patient's&#xD;
      salvage radical prostatectomy specimens, that showed viable prostate cancer, demonstrated&#xD;
      Bcl-2 overexpression, whereas in a comparison group who underwent radical prostatectomy,&#xD;
      matched for known prognostic factors, who had no previous exposure to radiation, there was no&#xD;
      detectable Bcl-2 overexpression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would also appear that Bcl-2 overexpression is also prognostic for recurrence after&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy. In a study by Stackhouse, patients whose radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      specimens' demonstrated Bcl-2 overexpression had a 27% versus 69% actuarial probability of&#xD;
      relapse - free survival at 100 months, compared to patients whose surgical specimens did not&#xD;
      overexpress Bcl-2 (Stackhouse 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the scientific rationale of using concurrent Docetaxel include: providing&#xD;
      biological dose enhancement to tumor cells through radio - sensitization, independent cell&#xD;
      kill, aid in the destruction of prostate cancer cells that have radio - resistant phenotypes,&#xD;
      and to help overcome cells that have an androgen - insensitive phenotype. It is not&#xD;
      anticipated that sufficient drug can be delivered to eradicate distant micro - metastases,&#xD;
      therefore we are intentionally targeting patients who are 'high - risk', but not at a very&#xD;
      high risk of harboring distant micro - metastases. In personal communication with Dr. Ian&#xD;
      Tannock (email correspondence available at request), he supports the idea of weekly, as&#xD;
      opposed to every 3 weekly Docetaxel, when the intent is to enhance the efficacy of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for utilizing weekly Docetaxel, from a side - effect profile, instead of every&#xD;
      3 weekly Docetaxel, is to avoid the hematological toxicity and Myelosuppression of every 3&#xD;
      weekly Docetaxel, as with weekly administration, myelosuppression is only seen rarely (&lt;3%),&#xD;
      even in heavily - pretreated patients with metastatic, hormone - refractory prostate cancer8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Rationale for radiotherapy sequence inversion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard sequence of radiation therapy portals used to treat prostate cancer, is to treat&#xD;
      a large volume first, encompassing regional lymphatics, as well as the primary tumor site,&#xD;
      and then treat the prostate, and any local extension of tumor that may be extraprostatic,&#xD;
      which is usually a small volume. The major reason is to address all the tumor, both&#xD;
      microscopic and grossly evidence tumor, so that areas that harbour tumor do not re - seed an&#xD;
      area that has been irradiated, and to prevent progression of tumor. In the case of prostate&#xD;
      cancer, the initial radiation portals that encompass the regional lymphatics and prostate&#xD;
      also encompass small bowel, large portions of bladder and bone marrow. Whereas IMRT can&#xD;
      reduce the volume of small bowel, bladder and bone marrow in the high dose radiation volume,&#xD;
      it cannot avoid these organs completely. The smaller volume, which only treats the prostate,&#xD;
      can completely avoid the small bowel, largely by treating patients with a full bladder, which&#xD;
      pushes the small bowel away from the high dose radiation area. When small bowel, or any&#xD;
      organ, can be completely avoided by radiation, it will not result in side effects to that&#xD;
      organ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By treating a small volume first, which avoids small bowel and bone marrow, and knowing that&#xD;
      the toxicity of Docetaxel is cumulative, it may be possible to deliver more Docetaxel, in&#xD;
      full - doses, without delays, because the small bowel will not be irradiated at the same time&#xD;
      as the initiation of Docetaxel, as opposed to the tradition sequence of radiotherapy, where&#xD;
      the small bowel will be irradiated at the same time as the initiation of Docetaxel. if the&#xD;
      order of the large and boost portals were reversed, as well as, employing IMRT, to sculpt the&#xD;
      radiation dose away from the small bowel, for the larger fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason that a sequence inversion is possible for the treatment of prostate cancer, is&#xD;
      that neo - adjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation results in stasis of prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells in the radiation volumes, so that there is virtually no added risk of prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells migrating from the pelvic lymphatics while the prostate is being irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Overlapping treatment - related toxicities and rationale for sequence inversion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated dose - limiting acute toxicity, common to both modalities is, treatment -&#xD;
      related diarrhea. A recent study by Ashman retrospectively examined 27 patients who underwent&#xD;
      whole pelvic radiotherapy using 2D, 3D conformal techniques and IMRT. Overall, 9 patients&#xD;
      (33%) experienced acute Grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity, and only 1 of these patients was&#xD;
      treated with IMRT. Antidiarrheal medication was required for 6 patients (22%). However, 5 of&#xD;
      these 6 patients also received chemotherapy (either concurrent vinblastine/estramustine or&#xD;
      neoadjuvant carboplatin, estramustine and paclitaxel, breakdown by chemotherapy regiment not&#xD;
      specified in publication), and none were treated with IMRT. No Grade 3 or higher acute or&#xD;
      late GI toxicities were observed. No cases of late radiation enteritis were observed.&#xD;
