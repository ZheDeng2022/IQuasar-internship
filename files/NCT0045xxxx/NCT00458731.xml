    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab and cediranib&#xD;
      maleate in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor, lymphoma,&#xD;
      intracranial glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing&#xD;
      substances to them. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab and cediranib maleate may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving bevacizumab together with&#xD;
      cediranib maleate may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous bevacizumab (avastin)&#xD;
      administered in combination with oral AZD2171 (cediranib maleate) for patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of oral AZD2171 in combination with bevacizumab&#xD;
      (avastin) administered to patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the serum concentrations of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Nitric oxide synthase (NOS)&#xD;
      among patients treated with this regimen and to correlate with VEGF expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine changes in the tumor vasculature detected by DCE-MRI among patients treated&#xD;
      with this combination of VEGF receptor blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the potential predictive role of angiogenesis molecular endpoints in&#xD;
      malignant effusion samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess in a descriptive fashion the efficacy of the studied regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral cediranib&#xD;
      maleate once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab and cediranib maleate until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are acquired at baseline, on day 2, and after 2 courses of treatment for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed by TUNEL, immunofluorescence staining,&#xD;
      laser-scanning cytometry, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry to assess apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells, microvessel density&#xD;
      mean vessel volume, nitric oxide concentration, and signal transduction pathways (i.e., ERK&#xD;
      ½, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase B, circulating endothelial and&#xD;
      progenitor cells, basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
      receptor phosphorylation, VEGF, and hypoxia inducible factor-1α). Some patients also undergo&#xD;
      tissue biopsy at baseline and after 2 courses of treatment for characterization of vascular&#xD;
      and angiogenesis markers. Some patients also undergo DCE-MRI at baseline, once between days&#xD;
      22-24, and after every 2 courses of treatment to assess blood perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 6 weeks.&#xD;

             mother with AZD-2171, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;

             study; women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior&#xD;
