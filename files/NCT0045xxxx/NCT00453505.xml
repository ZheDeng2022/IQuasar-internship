      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system, including transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and&#xD;
      tACS, respectively) and cutaneous/peripheral nerve stimulation (C/PNS) alone or paired with&#xD;
      TMS (paired associative stimulation, PAS), has been increasingly used in the investigation of&#xD;
      cortical plasticity and as a possible adjuvant strategy in neurorehabilitation. It has been&#xD;
      shown that TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS can modulate motor function in healthy volunteers, as&#xD;
      well as in patients with neurological disorders such as stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One fundamental problem is that the optimal parameters of stimulation to modulate motor&#xD;
      function by all of these techniques are not known. The purpose of this protocol is to explore&#xD;
      within safe guidelines, the effects of different stimulation parameters on motor cortical&#xD;
      function, on oscillatory brain dynamics measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG), on eye movements, and on fMRI activation. In addition, this&#xD;
      protocol will be used to train new fellows coming to NINDS Human Cortical Physiology Section&#xD;
      (HCPS) in the use of TMS, tDCS, tACS and C/PNS techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that information emerging from these studies will allow us to 1) optimize&#xD;
      experimental protocols or stimulation parameters to collect pilot data in healthy volunteer&#xD;
      for future patient-oriented hypothesis-driven protocols,2)to collect pilot data for power&#xD;
      analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train new fellows&#xD;
      in the use of these different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1500 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in&#xD;
      combination: (1) single- and paired-pulse TMS with inter-stimulus intervals of greater than&#xD;
      1s and up to 20s and intensities of up to 100% of stimulator output; (2) 1 Hz TMS for up to&#xD;
      30mins and up to 115% of resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity; (3) tDCS applied at an&#xD;
      intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60mins, as long the total charge does not&#xD;
      exceed 7.2 C; (4) tACS applied at a peak-to-peak intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up&#xD;
      to 60 minutes, minutes, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (5) C/PNS applied&#xD;
      alone with intensities below 130% of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2&#xD;
      hours, or intensities up to 300% of sensory threshold when C/PNS is paired with TMS. All of&#xD;
      these parameters of stimulation and procedures have safely been used as previously reported&#xD;
      in the literature. Sham stimulations will be delivered for each modality as scientifically&#xD;
      needed. Some substudies may involve recording of behavior or brain activity only (such as&#xD;
      behavioral testing, MRI, and MEG) if brain stimulation targets are unknown. This information&#xD;
      can help design future brain stimulation protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject may participate in up to 20 sessions. A single session may last no longer than 8&#xD;
      hours to allow for initial testing paradigm followed by retests or performing other&#xD;
      components of the same substudy later in the day. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks&#xD;
      will occur during long sessions. Subjects participate in one experimental session per day&#xD;
      under this protocol. The 20 experimental sessions will be scheduled over a twenty-year&#xD;
      period. CTDB is used to track the number of sessions per subject so it does not exceed 20&#xD;
      sessions. The AIs are responsible for entering the subjects/sessions into CTDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the effects of these different forms of stimulation on motor cortical&#xD;
      excitability, cognitive and motor behavioral tasks, and brain state measures derived from&#xD;
      neuroimaging data (i.e. - MRI, fMRI, MEG and EEG). Stimulation may be applied before, after,&#xD;
      or during physiological (i.e. motor evoked potentials, M-wave, F-wave, or H-Reflexes),&#xD;
      neuroimaging or behavioral measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under this protocol, we conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Sub-studies: These substudies are exploratory in nature and are conducted in&#xD;
      order to develop information to generate better informed future hypotheses and/or power&#xD;
      analyses. We have set an upper limit of 40 subjects per sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis-Testing Sub-studies: Hypothesis-testing sub-studies are studies with specific&#xD;
      hypotheses to be tested. These sub-studies undergo statistical and PIRC review after 6&#xD;
      subjects per group (e.g., after 12 subjects, 6 per arm, if two groups are studied), before&#xD;
      additional subjects can be recruited. Together, the P.I. and PIRC will decide whether to&#xD;
      continue the sub-study with more subjects without an amendment or whether an amendment or&#xD;
      protocol would be necessary. A memo requesting a review of hypothesis-testing sub-studies for&#xD;
      possible additional enrollment (beyond 6) will be sent to PIRC and the statistical reviewer.&#xD;

      for power analysis for future patient-oriented hypothesis driven protocols, and 3) to train&#xD;
      new fellows in the use of these different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As instructed, we had stopped recruitment under this protocol at the time we were informed by&#xD;
      the NIH IRB that they determined this to be a thematic protocol (August 6, 2019). The four&#xD;
      specific aims addressed under this protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim 1. To identify resting behavioral and physiological substrates for neuromodulation&#xD;
           of motor behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 2. To identify task-dependent behavioral and physiological substrates for&#xD;
           neuromodulation of motor behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim 3. To understand variability, rigor or/and reproducibility of brain stimulation&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As instructed, the purpose of this amendment is to request authorization to proceed with data&#xD;
      analysis and publication. No new experiments will be carried out under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1500 healthy volunteers, age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      No new experiments will be carried out under this protocol. Previously, healthy volunteers&#xD;
      receive one or more of the following types of stimulation alone or in combination: (1)&#xD;
      single- and paired-pulse TMS with inter-stimulus intervals of greater than 1s and up to 20s&#xD;
      and intensities of up to 100% of stimulator output; (2) 1 Hz TMS for up to 30mins and up to&#xD;
      115% of resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity; (3) tDCS applied at an intensity of up to 4&#xD;
      mA for a duration of up to 60mins, as long the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (4) tACS&#xD;
      applied at a peak-to-peak intensity of up to 4 mA for a duration of up to 60 minutes, as long&#xD;
      the total charge does not exceed 7.2 C; (5) C/PNS applied alone with intensities below 130%&#xD;
      of the peripherally-elicited-motor-threshold for up to 2 hours, or intensities up to 300% of&#xD;
      sensory threshold when C/PNS is paired with TMS. All of these parameters of stimulation and&#xD;
      procedures have safely been used as previously reported in the literature. Sham stimulations&#xD;
      were delivered for each modality as scientifically needed. Some sessions included recording&#xD;
      of behavior or brain activity (such as behavioral testing, MRI, and MEG) if brain stimulation&#xD;
      targets were unknown. This information was used to inform the design of brain stimulation&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject was able to participate in up to one experimental session per day, and up to 20&#xD;
      total sessions over a twenty year period under this protocol. A single session lasted no&#xD;
      longer than 8 hours. Appropriate rest breaks and meal breaks occured during long sessions.&#xD;
      CTDB was used to track the number of sessions per subject to ensure they did not exceed 20&#xD;
      sessions. Protocol AIs are were responsible for entering the subjects/sessions into CTDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously tested the effects of different forms of stimulation on motor cortical&#xD;
      excitability, cognitive and motor behavioral tasks, and brain state measures derived from&#xD;
      neuroimaging data (i.e. - MRI, fMRI, MEG and EEG). Stimulation was applied before, after, or&#xD;
      during physiological (i.e. motor evoked potentials, M-wave, F-wave, or H-Reflexes),&#xD;
      neuroimaging or behavioral measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      No new outcome measures are proposed. Changes in motor cortical excitability were previously&#xD;
      measured as the change in the average peak-to-peak amplitude of a motor&#xD;
&#xD;
      evoked potential (MEP) as measured with EMG. Neuroimaging measures included&#xD;
&#xD;
      changes in oscillatory brain activity power as measured with EEG or MEG, changes in&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOLD fMRI activation or changes in functional connectivity (i.e. - covarying fluctuations&#xD;
&#xD;
      in BOLD or spectral power across the brain). Behavioral outcome measures focused on&#xD;
&#xD;
      changes in performance as a function of learning, or as a function of applied brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>EEG records the electrical activity of the brain. Small electrodes were either individually placed on the participant s scalp or multi-channel electrode arrays positioned using an electrode cap. The recording might have occurred while participants were sitting quietly or performing a cognitive or motor behavioral task. The electrodes were removed once the EEG was complete. A device consisting of computer hardware and digital signal processing software might have used to enable triggering of a stimulator system in response to a pre-defined EEG-signal. The device was used according to the Collaboration Agreement with University Neurology Hospital T(SqrRoot) bingen and Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research. The new device controls the timing of the stimuli based on pre-set parameters. Additional electrodes might have been placed on the scalp or limbs for offline removal of physiological artifacts from MEG or EEG data. Individual MEG or EEG sessions lasted up to 4 hours in length.</description>
