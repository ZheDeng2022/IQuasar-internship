  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a new radioactive tracer, [(11)C]MePPEP, for use in positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging. The tracer is used to visualize cannabinoid receptors, proteins in&#xD;
      the brain that mediate a variety of natural chemicals. These receptors may be important in&#xD;
      behavioral diseases such as addiction, obesity and psychiatric diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten participants undergo whole body PET imaging to determine where the [(11)C]MePPEP tracer&#xD;
      is distributed in the body in order to calculate radiation exposure from the tracer. Another&#xD;
      10 subjects undergo brain imaging with [(11)C]MePPEP to measure cannabinoid receptors in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are evaluated with a medical history and physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests and an electrocardiogram (ECG) before scanning. They then have a PET scan. For&#xD;
      this procedure, a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm through which the&#xD;
      tracer is injected. A special mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep&#xD;
      the head in place during the scan. Subjects undergoing brain imaging also have a catheter&#xD;
      placed in an artery in the wrist from which blood samples are collected during the procedure.&#xD;
      The scan lasts about 2 to 2.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing brain imaging also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 year of&#xD;
      the PET scan. For MRI, the subject lies on a bed that moves into the tubular scanner, wearing&#xD;
      earplugs to protect the ears from loud noises that occur during the scan. The procedure takes&#xD;
      about 1 hour.&#xD;

      BRAIN IMAGING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central cannabinoid receptor, CB(1) is one of the most abundant neuromodulatory receptors&#xD;
      in the brain. It is found on glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABA-ergic synaptic terminals&#xD;
      and belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor family. The CB(1) is a target for drug therapy,&#xD;
      including the use of an antagonist as an appetite suppressant. The central cannabinoid&#xD;
      receptor CB(1) has never been visualized in humans. In collaboration with Eli Lilly, we&#xD;
      developed a promising PET ligand for the CB(1) receptor: [(11)C]MePPEP. This study is known&#xD;
      by Eli Lilly as H6O-MC-GCEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current protocol, we wish to evaluate [(11)C]MePPEP in approximately 15 healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging studies will consist of subject evaluation followed by PET and MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to determine the kinetics of brain uptake and washout, clearance in the plasma, and&#xD;
      the distribution volume of [(11)C]MePPEP calculated with compartmental modeling. Distribution&#xD;
      volume is proportional to the density of receptors and is equal to the ratio at equilibrium&#xD;
      of uptake in brain to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHOLE BODY DOSIMETRY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the brain imaging studies prove to be successful, we will continue with whole body&#xD;
      dosimetry studies. Preliminary dosimetry studies with [(11)C]MePPEP have been performed in&#xD;
      nonhuman primates; however, these need to be continued in humans before further investigation&#xD;
      of this novel tracer can continue. This study is known by Eli Lilly as H6O-MC-GCEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current protocol, we wish to evaluate [(11)C]MePPEP in approximately 10 additional&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole body dosimetry studies will consist of subject evaluation followed by a PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to determine the whole body distribution of activity and thereby calculate&#xD;
      radiation exposure to organs of the body.&#xD;
