  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of OP-1 when&#xD;
      it is injected into the knee joint of patients who have osteoarthritis on the knee.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects with OA will be recruited and informed consent obtained. During a screening period&#xD;
      lasting 1 to 28 days, subjects will undergo medical and arthritis history, physical&#xD;
      examination, collection of concomitant medications, KOOS (which contains the WOMAC&#xD;
      questionnaire), SF-36 and global 100 mm VAS assessments, have samples obtained for&#xD;
      urinalysis, hematology, chemistry, immunology and serum and plasma for future biomarker&#xD;
      testing, ECG, bilateral knee x-rays and MRI of the index knee at selected sites. Subjects who&#xD;
      meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into&#xD;
      the first cohort of 8 subjects to receive either 1.0 mL lactose (placebo) (2 subjects) or 1.0&#xD;
      mL OP-1 (6 subjects) intraarticularly using ultrasound or fluoroscopy guidance in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting on day 1. Each cohort will consist of 8 treated patients, with treatment&#xD;
      allocation in a 3:1 active-to-lactose (placebo) ratio. After an observation period of at&#xD;
      least one hour, subjects will be released and contacted via telephone on Day 2 to query for&#xD;
      AEs and concomitant medications. Additional follow-up visits will be done on days 7, 14, 28,&#xD;
      56, 84 and 168 (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24) and safety and efficacy parameters evaluated&#xD;
      according to the Schedule of Events. When a minimum of 4 weeks have elapsed since the last&#xD;
      patient of the current cohort has been treated, all safety data will be collected and&#xD;
      reviewed by the Principal Investigators and the Sponsor. The safety review will be conducted&#xD;
      to ensure the demonstrated safety profile of OP-1 is acceptable for the treated patients.&#xD;
      Only after the current dose level has been judged to be safe will dose escalation to the next&#xD;
      dosing cohort occur.&#xD;

             and may include crepitus, swelling and/or effusion of the knee. In subjects with&#xD;
             bilateral knee OA, the more symptomatic knee is the index knee. Subjects may be taking&#xD;
