    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IV or recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and&#xD;
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride in patients with stage IV or recurrent&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. III.&#xD;
      Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of this drug&#xD;
      on angiogenesis inhibition using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. VI. Correlate the&#xD;
      effect of this drug on angiogenesis inhibition with the clinical benefit rate and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
