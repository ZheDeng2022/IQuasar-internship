  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IPTi, a strategy whereby infants are provided treatment doses of antimalarials at routine&#xD;
      vaccination visits, has been shown to significantly reduce malaria and anemia in two studies&#xD;
      in Tanzania. However the results obtained in Gabon are not similar. Many factors are likely&#xD;
      to influence the efficacy or effectiveness IPTi. It is reasonable to assume that the efficacy&#xD;
      of IPTi will be influenced markedly by the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to the&#xD;
      antimalarial drug (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine) used for IPTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to interpret the results of individual IPTi trials conducted by the IPTi Consortium,&#xD;
      and to provide information for policy makers regarding the predicted efficacy of IPTi, it is&#xD;
      essential to obtain information on antimalarial drug sensitivity of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine&#xD;
      now that the IPTi trial has been conducted. The simplest and most universally accepted&#xD;
      measure of testing for antimalarial drug efficacy is the &quot;in vivo efficacy study,&quot; which&#xD;
      follows a standardized World Health Organization protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second reason for evaluating drug resistance as an adjunct to the IPTi trials is to&#xD;
      determine if the intervention increases the carriage and/or spread of drug resistant P.&#xD;
      falciparum parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly the overall effect at the community level of selection of resistant genotypes in&#xD;
      IPTi-recipients is unclear.&#xD;

      Administration of standard single oral dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to children aged&#xD;
      6-59 month old children in Lambaréné at enrolment, if eligible according to the approved&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      139 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine for uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria. Thereafter each subject will be followed according to the approved protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of subjects with Adequate Clinical and Parasitological response (ACPR) by day&#xD;
      28, Early Treatment Failure (ETF), Late Clinical Failure (LCF) and Late Parasitological&#xD;
      Failure (LPF)will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondly the frequency of molecular markers for Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine drug resistance&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated because of Early Treatment Failure in child.The justification for this&#xD;
    decision are concerns about safety of children.&#xD;
