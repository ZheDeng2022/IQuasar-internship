    <textblock>
      Obesity among Mexican-American women has the potential to become a public health crisis.&#xD;
      Hispanics are one of the fastest growing minority populations in the United States and the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity in Mexican American woman is increasing at an alarming rate. Poor&#xD;
      dietary practices, especially food habits that are acquired as families acculturate to the&#xD;
      American food supply, and lack of exercise are thought to be associated with women's excess&#xD;
      weight gain. Accordingly, interventions are needed to improve the dietary intake and physical&#xD;
      activity levels of Mexican-American families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which women are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions and play group physical&#xD;
      activity sessions or group based nutrition and exercise classes and health related activity&#xD;
      worksheets to complete with their child. The FBC sessions, conducted by community health&#xD;
      advisors, will use photographs of the family's food practices, taken by mothers, as visual&#xD;
      aids in the counseling sessions. The control intervention will consist of group sessions&#xD;
      using curricula designed to motivate women to exercise and to promote the Food Guide Pyramid&#xD;
      recommendations using traditional Mexican-American foods. The primary outcome of the trial is&#xD;
      mother's BMI. The secondary outcomes are dietary intake, moderate to vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity and household food supplies. We hypothesize that within a one year time frame, women&#xD;
      who are exposed to the FBC will have lower BMI's compared to women who receive the active&#xD;
      placebo control intervention. The mechanisms through which we intend to change weight status&#xD;
      are altering the type of foods purchased and cooking practices and promoting mothers to&#xD;
      engage in physical activities with their children during their play. Measurements of&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include three 24 hour dietary recalls, a household food inventory and&#xD;
      activity monitoring using MTI actigraph monitors. In addition, mothers' reports of household&#xD;
      food security level, and food purchase motives, will be collected as covariates. Measurements&#xD;
      will be collected within one month of completing the interventions and at six months and one&#xD;
      year follow-up.&#xD;

      We propose to evaluate a family-based intervention designed to prevent obesity by increasing&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake, decreasing fat intake and increasing physical activity. The&#xD;
      target group for the intervention is low-income Mexican-American mothers of preschool aged&#xD;
      children. The intervention uses family-based behavioral counseling (FBC) sessions with a&#xD;
      community health advisor (CHA) to promote changing the types of foods that mothers prepare&#xD;
      and consume, and increasing the time that mothers spend being active with their children. In&#xD;
      previous research, we have used this approach to improve Mexican-American school aged&#xD;
      children's nutritional status. The mothers of these children were extremely motivated to&#xD;
      improve their children's diets, and in doing so, improved their own health behaviors and&#xD;
      reduced their BMI's. Accordingly, in the proposed research, we will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with a sample of 250 Mexican-American mothers-child dyads to evaluate a&#xD;
      family based intervention designed to prevent obesity in low income Mexican-American women.&#xD;
      As families enroll in the study, they will be randomly assigned to either the FBC sessions or&#xD;
      an active placebo control condition. Data will be collected immediately prior to&#xD;
      participation in the intervention, within one-month of completing the intervention and at six&#xD;
      months and one year follow-up. Mother's body mass index (BMI) will serve as the primary&#xD;
      outcome variable. Multiple 24-hour dietary recalls, a modified household food inventory and&#xD;
      physical activity monitoring will be used as secondary indices of program efficacy. The&#xD;
      following hypotheses will be examined in this experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly lower BMI one&#xD;
      year after randomization into the intervention compared to women whose families receive an&#xD;
      active placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly lower fat intakes and higher fruit&#xD;
      and vegetable intakes, as measured by 24 hour recalls, one year after randomization into the&#xD;
      intervention compared to women whose families receive an active placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who receive the FBC sessions will have significantly fewer high fat foods and&#xD;
      significantly more fruits and vegetables in their homes, as measured by targeted household&#xD;
      food inventories, one year after randomization into the intervention compared to women whose&#xD;
      families receive an active placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who receive the FBC sessions will be significantly more active one year after&#xD;
      randomization into the intervention, as measured by activity monitoring, compared to women&#xD;
      whose families receive an active placebo control.&#xD;
