      The duration of anticoagulant treatment in cancer patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of&#xD;
      the lower limbs is still uncertain. The present study addresses the possible role of the&#xD;
      Residual Vein Thrombosis (RVT) for establishing the optimal duration of Low Molecular Weight&#xD;
      Heparin (LMWH). Patients with a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked or provoked proximal&#xD;
      DVT will received LMWHs for 6 months; RVT, ultrasonographically-detected, will be then&#xD;
      assessed. Patients without RVT stop LMWH, whereas those with RVT will be randomized to either&#xD;
      stop or continue OAT for additional 6 months. Patients were followed-up at least 1 year after&#xD;
      anticoagulant discontinuation focusing on the study outcomes: occurrence of recurrent venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism and major bleeding&#xD;

      BACKGROUND. Currently there is no consensus on the optimal duration of antithrombotic therapy&#xD;
      in cancer patients experiencing a first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower limbs.&#xD;
      Recent guidelines suggest that patients with active cancer suffering of DVT of the lower&#xD;
      limbs should be treated for at least six months with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).&#xD;
      However, although the current scheme for establishing the duration of LMWH and/or Oral&#xD;
      Anticoagulants (OA) is based on the nature of index DVT (idiopathic or provoked), some new&#xD;
      data starting to select other parameters to individualise this decision. The use of D-dimer&#xD;
      has been proven to be effective for selecting OA duration but this information is valid only&#xD;
      for non cancer patients with idiopathic DVT. Moreover, D-dimer does not seem reliable in&#xD;
      patients with chronic condition (such as cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the presence of a Residual Vein Thrombosis (RVT) has been found to be associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk for recurrency (even in the contralateral leg or other venous sites)&#xD;
      and it can establishes the optimal duration of anticoagulant. However, such information is&#xD;
      not present in cancer patients, a population considered at high risk for recurrent&#xD;
      thrombosis. To test this hypothesis, we planned a randomized study in cancer patients with a&#xD;
      first episode of symptomatic idiopathic or provoked DVT treated with LMWH for 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients without RVT will not continue anticoagulation (group B), whereas those with RVT will&#xD;
      be randomized to either stop (group A2) or continue heparin (group A1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study patients. Cancer patients with a first episode of documented unprovoked and&#xD;
      provoked proximal DVT will be eligible for the study if they had completed 6 months of LMWH&#xD;
      (at therapeutic dosage for the first month, then dose reduced by 25% for the remaining 5&#xD;
      months). Provoked DVTs are defined as thrombotic episodes associated with pregnancy or&#xD;
      puerperium, recent (i.e. within three months) fracture or plaster casting of a leg,&#xD;
      immobilization with confinement to bed for three consecutive days and surgery with general&#xD;
      anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes. Unprovoked DVTs are defined as thrombotic episodes&#xD;
      occurred in apparently absence of risk factor other than cancer. Patients with known&#xD;
      thrombophilia, serious liver disease, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min.)&#xD;
      or those who lived too far from the center will be excluded from the study. The study has to&#xD;
      be approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN. This is a multicenter prospective study in cancer patients with a first episode&#xD;
      of symptomatic (either provoked or idiopathic) proximal DVT detected by Compression&#xD;
      UltraSonography (C-US) and receiving LMWH for 6 months. At this time, subjects who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study have a physical examination to assess baseline clinical conditions&#xD;
      and to exclude contraindications. C-US of the proximal deep vein system in both legs will be&#xD;
      performed, measuring the diameters of any detectable thrombus in the Common Femoral Vein&#xD;
      (CFV) and Popliteal Veins (PV). Images will be obtained in transverse section only. Lumen&#xD;
      compressibility will be then evaluated on CFV and PV by gentle pressure of the probe, as&#xD;
      previously described. Briefly, the major and the minor diameters of the vein segment are&#xD;
      measured and recorded before and after compression. C-US findings are scored as &quot;absence of&#xD;
      RVT&quot; when residual thrombus occupied, at maximum compressibility, less than 40% of the vein&#xD;
      area. Patients without RVT will not continue anticoagulation, whereas those with RVT will be&#xD;
      randomized to either stop or continue LMWH for additional 6 months. A different randomization&#xD;
      sequence for each different study site is computer generated and encapsulated in a&#xD;
      randomization computer program. The sequences are balanced by blocks of ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTCOMES AND FOLLOW-UP. From the assignment visit, patients will be followed up for at&#xD;
      least one year after LMWH discontinuation; during the follow-up period, patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by the clinical centers every 3 months. C-US will be performed only when recurrent&#xD;
      symptomatic DVT is suspected. The study outcome is the composite of confirmed recurrent&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (including DVT and/or fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) and major&#xD;
      bleeding events from the index DVT to the last day of follow-up. In cases of suspected DVT&#xD;
      recurrence the results of C-US will be compared with the previous examination. A diagnosis of&#xD;
      recurrent venous thrombosis is made if a previously fully compressible segment (contralateral&#xD;
      or ipsilateral) became incompressible. In absence of a previous normal C-US, DVT recurrence&#xD;
      is diagnosed if a previously non-occlusive thrombus shifted to occlusive thrombus, provided&#xD;
      the vein area before compression had increased by more than 50%); in undetermined cases,&#xD;
      contrast venography will be performed. In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      diagnosis of recurrence is based on objective algorithms using clinical probability,&#xD;
      ventilation-perfusion lung scanning/helical computed tomography, C-US and/or D-dimer if&#xD;
      indicated. The diagnosis of clinically relevant haemorrhage will be made in case of decrease&#xD;
      of haemoglobin levels &gt; 2.0 gr/dl, retroperitoneal, intracranial or life-threatening.&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to contact the clinical center immediately if symptoms developed&#xD;
      suggestive of venous thromboembolism or bleeding. All suspected outcome events and all deaths&#xD;
      will be evaluated by a central adjudication committee whose members were unaware of the name&#xD;
      of the subject, the enrolling center, the C-US findings and the assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The sample size has been calculated by considering, for the group with&#xD;
      worst prognosis (being it A1, or A2 or B) an incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism of&#xD;
      20%, and a percentage of complications of 5% in the group with the best prognosis. An overall&#xD;
      sample size of 300 patients (100 for each study group) has been calculated to reach a power&#xD;
      of 80% to document a difference of at least 15% in at least one of the different head-to-head&#xD;
      comparisons, by using Bonferroni method to distribute type I error (0.05) among multiple&#xD;
      comparisons. An interim analysis is planned after the inclusion of 200 patients. The chi&#xD;
      square test and 95% confidence intervals will be used to evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      recurrence of VTE or bleeding between groups. A multivariable analysis with logistic&#xD;
      regression model will be performed to identify risk factors predictive for recurrence of VTE.&#xD;
      The model of logistic regression will be applied for both possible categories of patients,&#xD;
      those with idiopathic or post-operative DVT. The planned duration of the enrollment phase is&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
