      Background. Antihypertensive therapy with ß-blockers (ßBs) and diureticts (Ds) is accompanied&#xD;
      by a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) than therapy with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or&#xD;
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Whether this difference is due to an antidiabetogenic&#xD;
      action of ACEIs and ARBs or to the fact that these agents are free of the diabetogenic&#xD;
      activity of ßBs and Ds is unknown. Prevention of DM as well as of HT is of primary health&#xD;
      concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The primary objective of PHIDIAS is to test whether in individuals with&#xD;
      components of metabolic syndrome making them predisposed to DM and HT, addition of either an&#xD;
      ACEI or an ARB to periodically reinforced lifestyle counselling can reduce 1) onset of DM and&#xD;
      2) onset of HT significantly more than lifestyle plus placebo. Secondary objectives are 1)&#xD;
      comparing the antidiabetogenic effects of ACEI and ARB, and 2) investigating whether the&#xD;
      effects of ACEI and ARB on DM and HT persist at least 6 months after treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. PHIDIAS is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm comparison trial.&#xD;
      300 general practitioners (members of SIMG with the assistance of hospital centres of SIIA)&#xD;
      will randomise 6000 untreated individuals aged 40-75 years, with SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89&#xD;
      mmHg, fasting glucose (FG) 100-125 mg/dl, waist circumference &gt;= 102 (M) or &gt;= 88 cm (W), to&#xD;
      three blinded treatments, given in addition to lifestyle advise: 1) Placebo; 2) the ACE&#xD;
      Enalapril (10 mg, then 20 mg od); 3) the ARB Losartan (50 mg, then 100 mg od).Double-blind&#xD;
      treatment will be maintained until 500 cases of DM are observed (presumably average of 36&#xD;
      months) (Treatment Phase: control visits, BP, FG every 6 months). This will be followed by a&#xD;
      6-month Withdrawal Phase (active treatment substituted by placebo). Primary outcomes are DM&#xD;
      (FG &gt;= 126 mg/dl) and HT (SBP &gt;= 140 or DBP &gt;= 90 mmHg) on 2 consecutive visits. PHIDIAS will&#xD;
      be governed by a Steering Committee assisted by a blinded Event Adjudicating Committee and an&#xD;
      independent DMSB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. The sample size is adequate (alfa 5%, power 90%) to evaluate whether&#xD;
      incident DM (expected rate 3.5%/year) or incident HT is reduced 25% by ACEI and ARB versus&#xD;
      placebo (primary hypothesis) and whether either the ACEI or the ARB reduces incident DM by&#xD;
      30% more than the other agent.&#xD;

      1. Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evidence available Data obtained from observational studies have shown that&#xD;
                subjects with hypertension have an increased prevalence of type II diabetes&#xD;
                mellitus compared to normotensives, and that the association between diabetes and&#xD;
                hypertension represents a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (1).&#xD;
                Also the recent overview of the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists'&#xD;
                Collaboration indicates that the risks for stroke, coronary events, heart failure,&#xD;
                and cardiovascular death are about twice as large in hypertensives with diabetes&#xD;
                than in hypertensives without diabetes, independently of absence of treatment or&#xD;
                use of different antihypertensive regimens (2). On the other hand, a number of&#xD;
                observational and randomised intervention trials has shown that antihypertensive&#xD;
                therapy may increase the risk of developing new diabetes mellitus in hypertensives&#xD;
                patients. This evidence has been reviewed and meta-analysed in several recent&#xD;
                papers (3,4). In brief, of 13 large randomised trials of antihypertensive therapy,&#xD;
                12 have shown a greater incidence of new diabetes mellitus in the treatment arms&#xD;
                using thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers (and often the two types of agent in&#xD;
                association) than in the treatment arms based on angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
                inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or calcium antagonists&#xD;
                (CAs) (often with addition of thiazides and sometimes of beta-blockers) (3).&#xD;
                Furthermore, a recent review analysed 48 groups of subjects without diabetes&#xD;
                mellitus at the time of randomization in 22 clinical trials. 17 of such trials&#xD;
                enrolled patients with hypertension, 3 enrolled high risk patients, and only 1&#xD;
                enrolled patients with heart failure. The primary outcome was represented by&#xD;
                incident diabetes mellitus. Overall, the antihypertensive classes that were found&#xD;
                to be associated with newly developed diabetes mellitus were, in increasing order,&#xD;
                ACEIs, ARBs, followed by CAs and placebo (4). It is debated whether thiazide&#xD;
                diuretics and beta-blockers are really diabetogenic, by exaggerating or&#xD;
                accelerating the time-dependent tendency to develop diabetes, and whether ACEIs and&#xD;
                ARBs are antidiabetogenic by retarding this normal trend, or simply lack the&#xD;
                diabetogenic effect of thiazides/beta-blockers. The issue, of obvious clinical&#xD;
                importance, can only be solved by placebo-controlled studies, but&#xD;
                placebo-controlled studies are ethically difficult to be conducted nowadays when&#xD;
                evidence favouring active treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular risk is&#xD;
                overwhelming.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Nonetheless, data from a small number of placebo-controlled studies are available.&#xD;
                The diuretic chlorthalidone, often associated with a beta-blocker, has been&#xD;
                compared with placebo in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension in&#xD;
                the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial: when the current&#xD;
                definition of diabetes was used (fasting glucose, FG, &gt;=126 mg/dl), a significant&#xD;
                higher incidence of diabetes was found in the actively treated group (13 vs 8.7%,&#xD;
                p&lt;0.0001) (5), a finding which substantiates the hypothesis that diuretic and&#xD;
                beta-blocker therapy exaggerates the trend towards developing diabetes, i.e. has a&#xD;
                diabetogenic effect. Placebo-controlled studies are also available concerning the&#xD;
                effects of ACEIs and ARBs on diabetes onset. Unfortunately, in all these trials&#xD;
                placebo groups were contaminated by administration of multiple therapies required&#xD;
                for the control of the cardiovascular pathologies of the patients under study. In&#xD;
                the Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE), concerning elderly&#xD;
                patients with hypertension, the use of hydrochlothiazide and beta-blockers was more&#xD;
                extensive in the so called &quot;placebo&quot; arm than in the active (candesartan) treatment&#xD;
                arm, and may explain the higher incidence of diabetes in the placebo than the&#xD;
                candesartan group (6). Likewise, in four large trials in which an ACEI or ARB were&#xD;
                compared to placebo in patients at high cardiovascular risk because of coronary&#xD;
                heart disease or heart failure, both the ACEI or the ARB and the placebo were given&#xD;
                on top of multiple background therapies required by the severity of the diseases&#xD;
                being investigated. Furthermore, little information is available from publications&#xD;
                of these trials as to what extent background therapies were modified during the&#xD;
                trials and whether these changes were balanced between the placebo and active&#xD;
                treatment arms of the trials (see 3). Therefore the issue whether ACEIs and ARBs&#xD;
                have an active antidiabetogenic action or simply lack the diabetogenic action of&#xD;
                thiazides and beta-blockers remains undecided, and any claim that agents blocking&#xD;
                the renin-angiotensin system exert an antidiabetogenic action appears unjustified.&#xD;
                Prevention of the onset of diabetes, as well as of hypertension, and even more of&#xD;
                the ominous association of diabetes and hypertension, remains, however, of primary&#xD;
                public health concern, because of the morbidity burden represented by these&#xD;
                ailments and the health care cost involved. Prevention must obviously be exerted&#xD;
                before a disease develops, and is most effective in those subjects in whom the risk&#xD;
                of developing the disease is high. Conditions predisposing to both hypertension and&#xD;
                diabetes are well known. Individuals with so-called high-normal blood pressure&#xD;
                (i.e., systolic blood pressure, SBP, 130-139,or diastolic blood pressure, DBP,&#xD;
                85-89 mmHg) have a 40% chance of becoming hypertensives (i.e.,SBP&gt;=140 or DBP&gt;=90&#xD;
                mmHg) over 4 years according to the Framingham Heart Study (7)and the initial&#xD;
                findings of the Trial Of Preventing Hypertension (TROPHY, 8). High-normal BP&#xD;
                together with impaired glucose tolerance (as indicated by fasting glucose, FG,&#xD;
                &gt;=100 mg/dl), abdominal obesity, a low HDL-cholesterol and high triglycerides are&#xD;
                often found clustered in a large portion of populations both in USA and Europe, the&#xD;
                cluster being commonly referred to as the metabolic syndrome (MS) (9).&#xD;
                Independently of the current debate whether all manifestations of MS are due to a&#xD;
                common pathophysiological mechanism (i.e., insulin resistance), it is undisputed&#xD;
                that coexistence of high-normal BP, a raised FG and an elevated BMI is a very&#xD;
                strong predictor of both hypertension and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Knowledge effect Lifestyle changes (suitable diet and physical exercise) are known&#xD;
                to be effective in preventing both hypertension (10) and diabetes (10-12), but&#xD;
                whether addition of an ACEI or ARB may further reduce both conditions is unknown.&#xD;
                Individuals with MS are ideal subjects for investigating whether agents blocking&#xD;
                the renin-angiotensin system exert a real antidiabetogenic effect in addition to&#xD;
                what can be achieved by non-pharmacologic measures, as there are no compelling&#xD;
                medical indications for treating these subjects with other drugs that may confound&#xD;
                interpretation of the findings. Therefore the PHIDIAS trial plans to study a large&#xD;
                cohort of individuals with high-normal BP, high FG (but below cut-off values of&#xD;
                diabetes) and abdominal obesity, all instructed to lifestyle changes. They will be&#xD;
                randomly and double-blindly assigned to placebo, or an ACEI or an ARB over a period&#xD;
                of approximately 3 years, in order to investigate whether blockade of the&#xD;
                renin-angiotensin system on top of lifestyle advise can further reduce onset of&#xD;
                diabetes, a hypothesis so far based only on animal studies suggesting that some&#xD;
                ARBs may be partial agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma&#xD;
                (PPAR-gamma) involved in regulating insulin sensitivity (13). Furthermore, the&#xD;
                subject will be followed up for additional 6 months after withdrawal of randomised&#xD;
                medications to investigate whether the preventive actions are enduring and survive&#xD;
                medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Implication for AIFA and the NHS Both the conduct and the results of PHIDIAS are&#xD;
                expected to have favourable implications both for the Italian Agency for Medicinal&#xD;
                Products (AIFA) and the Italian National Health System (NHS). The conduct of a&#xD;
                trial such as PHIDIAS that is committed to general practitioners and involve&#xD;
                individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease, will effectively promote&#xD;
                education to healthier lifestyle measures and help prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
                disease and diabetes. The results of the trial will also have considerable impact&#xD;
                both on AIFA and the NHS: 1) if addition of an ACEI or ARB to lifestyle measures is&#xD;
                shown not to have any further preventive effect on diabetes, the claim of an&#xD;
                antidiabetogenic action of these agents will be disproved, and their use in&#xD;
                diabetes prevention discouraged; 2) if both an ACEI and an ARB are found to prevent&#xD;
                hypertension and/or diabetes, but their effects are not significantly different or&#xD;
                an ACEI is found more effective than an ARB, the use of a generic ACEI- such as the&#xD;
                one to be administered in PHIDIAS- will represent a benefit for the subjects&#xD;
                combined with considerable savings for the NHS; 3) if an ARB is found to be&#xD;
                significantly more effective than an ACEI in preventing diabetes, this will&#xD;
                implicate temporarily increased costs for the NHS, largely compensated on the long&#xD;
                term by the decreased or delayed onset of diabetes and hypertension, as well as&#xD;
                their complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Differences from other current trials PHIDIAS substantially differs from a few&#xD;
                ongoing trials of diabetes prevention. The Diabetes Reduction Assessment with&#xD;
                Ramipril and Rosiglitazone Medication (DREAM) trial (14-15) and the Nateglinide and&#xD;
                Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) trial (16)&#xD;
                are only directed to diabetes prevention. Both of them intend to test an ACEI&#xD;
                (DREAM) or an ARB (NAVIGATOR) versus an antidiabetic agent (rosiglitazone in DREAM,&#xD;
                nateglinide in NAVIGATOR ) versus placebo with a factorial design, in individuals&#xD;
                selected primarily on the basis of impaired glucose tolerance, so that other&#xD;
                cardiovascular conditions are not excluded: in DREAM 43% of recruited subjects are&#xD;
                hypertensives and 35% are dyslipidemic, and in NAVIGATOR previous cardiovascular&#xD;
                disease or risk factors are criteria for eligibility. Therefore in both studies the&#xD;
                investigation of the possible antidiabetogenic effect of the ACEI or ARB is likely&#xD;
                to be confounded to some extent by concomitant therapies for hypertension and&#xD;
                cardiovascular disease. Finally the TROPHY trial (8) is only planned for prevention&#xD;
                of hypertension (by the ARB candesartan) and is not exploring the equally important&#xD;
                issue of diabetes prevention by blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary objectives. In a group of individuals with high-normal blood pressure (SBP&#xD;
                130-139, or DBP 85-89 mmHg), FG in the high but nondiabetic range (100-125 mg/dl),&#xD;
                and abdominal obesity (abdominal circumference &gt;= 102 cm in men and &gt;= 88 cm in&#xD;
                women), i.e. with those characteristics of the so called MS that are major&#xD;
                predictors of DM and HT, the trial will explore whether addition of an agent&#xD;
                blocking the renin-angiotensin system (either an ACEI or an ARB) over periodically&#xD;
                reinforced instructions for suitable lifestyle changes reduces: 1) onset of&#xD;
                diabetes (defined as FG &gt;= 126 mg/dl or need for antidiabetic therapy) or 2) onset&#xD;
                of hypertension (defined as SBP &gt;= 140 or DBP &gt;= 90 mmHg, or need for&#xD;
                antihypertensive therapy) to a significantly greater extent than addition of a&#xD;
                placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary objectives. In the same group of individuals, the trial will also&#xD;
                investigate whether 1) the diabetes preventing effects of an ACEI and ARB&#xD;
                significantly differ, because of the different blocking mechanisms on the&#xD;
                renin-angiotensin system, and the additional action on bradykinin and,&#xD;
                respectively, on PPAR gamma of the two agents, 2) the effects of the ACEI and ARB&#xD;
                on the onset of diabetes and hypertension are enduring, persisting 3 to 6 months&#xD;
                after substitution of the active drugs with placebo. Obviously, preventive effects&#xD;
                substantially surviving medication would strengthen the therapeutic role of these&#xD;
                agents, whereas disappearance of the effects after a short period would suggest a&#xD;
                masking effect only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                     . Men or women of any racial background&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Age &gt;= 40 years and &lt;= 75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  SBP&gt;= 130 mmHg and &lt; 140 mmHg or DBP &gt;= 85 mmHg and &lt; 90 mmHg, average of&#xD;
                          screening and randomisation visits (in absence of any antihypertensive&#xD;
                          medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  FG &gt;=100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) and &lt; 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) between&#xD;
                          screening and randomisation (in absence of any antidiabetic medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Waist circumference &gt;= 102 cm in men and &gt;= 88 cm in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Exclusion criteria (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Enrolment procedures. The study subjects will be enrolled by general practitioners&#xD;
                associated with the Italian Society of General Practitioners (SIMG). Candidates for&#xD;
                enrolment will be identified by the participating physicians among subjects in&#xD;
                their NHS list attending their clinics. Each physician will be asked to enrol and&#xD;
                randomise 21 subjects within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Type of the study. This is a prospective, Italian, multicentre, double-blind,&#xD;
                     randomised, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, parallel group comparison with a&#xD;
                     response dependent on fixed-dose interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Interventions. At the randomisation visit, as well as at follow-up visits, at&#xD;
                     6-month intervals, all subjects will receive written detailed instruction for&#xD;
                     an adequate diet and physical exercise, with the goal of a body weight&#xD;
                     reduction of at least 5% (see Annex 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
                In addition to lifestyle advise, all subjects will be randomised to one of the&#xD;
                three following blinded treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Placebo : 1 Enalapril placebo tablet and 1 Losartan placebo tablet, once&#xD;
                     daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. ACEI : 1 Enalapril tablet and 1 Losartan placebo tablet, once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. ARB : 1 Losartan tablet and 1 Enalapril placebo tablet, once daily. During the&#xD;
                     first four weeks, 10 mg Enalapril tablets and 50 mg Losartan tablets will be&#xD;
                     used, and 20 mg Enalapril and 100 mg Losartan tablets will be used for the&#xD;
                     rest of the treatment phase of the study. At the end of this phase, all&#xD;
                     subjects will receive the two placebo tablets daily for six months (withdrawal&#xD;
                     phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Among the ACEIs enalapril has been chosen as it has been the most widely prescribed&#xD;
                ACEI for about 20 years, is presently available as a generic agent, and is one of&#xD;
                the ACEIs for which a lower incidence of diabetes has been shown (SOLVD trial&#xD;
                [17]).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Among ARBs losartan may be chosen as animal studies indicates it may be a partial&#xD;
                antagonist of PPAR-gamma to a greater extent than other ARBs (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The detailed flow-chart of the study is in Annex 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Subject allocation. At the time of random allocation to double blind treatment an&#xD;
                individual number will be allocated to each individual subject and noted in the&#xD;
                clinical record form (CRF). The individual number determines which of the three&#xD;
                treatment schemes the individual will receive throughout the treatment period of&#xD;
                the study. By a computer-generated randomisation list prepared by the randomisation&#xD;
                centre using appropriate blocks each subject will be assigned to one of the three&#xD;
                treatment groups with identical probability. The individual numbers given to each&#xD;
                participating physician will be assigned to an individual subject in ascending&#xD;
                order.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Outcomes - Primary outcomes. Time to first event of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                1) New diabetes, defined as occurrence of a FG&gt;= 126 mg/dl at any six-month visit&#xD;
                during the treatment phase, to be confirmed at a subsequent visit within one month;&#xD;
                or initiation of any antidiabetic treatment during the treatment period of the&#xD;
                trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2) New hypertension, defined as occurrence of a SBP&gt;= 140 mmHg or of a DBP&gt;= 90&#xD;
                mmHg at any six-month visit during the treatment phase, to be confirmed at a&#xD;
                subsequent visit within one month; or initiation of any antihypertensive treatment&#xD;
                during the treatment period of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Secondary outcomes. Time to first event (during the treatment phase) of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. New diabetes (as defined above) or new hypertension (as defined above), which&#xD;
                     comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular&#xD;
                     death, heart failure, new documented angina, revascularization procedures )&#xD;
                     plus death by non-cardiovascular causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Variations of SBP and DBP during the treatment phase and, separately, during&#xD;
                     the withdrawal phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Variations fasting blood glucose during the treatment phase and, separately,&#xD;
                     during the withdrawal phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Estimated creatinine clearance (Cockroft and Gault formula) lower than 60&#xD;
                     ml/min in subjects with values &gt;= 60 ml/min at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Incidence at the end of the final 6-month withdrawal phase of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                1) New diabetes (as defined above). 2) New hypertension (as defined above)[in order&#xD;
                to test the possibility of a &quot;masking&quot; effect of treatment].&#xD;
&#xD;
                3) Variations of SBP and DBP. 4) Variations of fasting blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Information retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Forms. All relevant information will be filled up in CRFs for the screening&#xD;
                     and randomisation visits and all subsequent visits. When required additional&#xD;
                     documentation will be attached to the related clinical form.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Physical examination. See Annex 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Blood pressure measurement. See Annex 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Clinical laboratory measurements. See Annex 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Clinical Outcomes. See Annex 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
           l. Checking of bias and confounding. Compliance to randomised treatment will be checked&#xD;
           at each visit by counting return capsules, but even noncompliant individuals, as well as&#xD;
           individuals withdrawn from medication, will be kept in the trial. Careful search will be&#xD;
           made at each visit of concomitant medication used intermittently or continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           m. Follow up. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (Annex 2), follow-up visits will occur every 6&#xD;
           months (± 1). The trial (see Sample size calculation) will be event-driven, but it is&#xD;
           expected that the treatment phase will be of approximately 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           n. Subjects lost to follow up The subjects being all in the NHS list of the&#xD;
           participating physicians, it is expected that loss to follow up will be minimal&#xD;
           (probably less than 5%), and will consist only of those subjects withdrawing their&#xD;
           consent to participate in the study (and not only to take randomised medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
           o. Monitoring of the study Monitoring of the entire study, committees, centres, and&#xD;
           participating practitioners will be the responsibility of the coordinating institution,&#xD;
           under the supervision of the Principal investigator. Monitoring of participating units&#xD;
           will be done electronically on a continuous way, with the support of a professional&#xD;
           agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           p. Sample size estimates The primary hypothesis is that incidence of diabetes and,&#xD;
           separately, hypertension will be reduced by active treatment (cumulative data of&#xD;
           enalapril and losartan-treated groups) by 25% with respect to placebo treatment. For&#xD;
           evaluating this difference between the placebo group and the two actively treated groups&#xD;
           together, a two-tailed type I error of 5% and a power of 90% will be accepted. The main&#xD;
           secondary hypothesis is that either of the two active treatments (enalapril versus&#xD;
           losartan) will reduce incidence of diabetes by 25-30% more than the other, with a&#xD;
           two-tailed type I error of 5% and a power of 70-90%. On the basis of the Framingham&#xD;
           Heart Study data in high-normal BP subjects (7) and on initial findings of TROPHY (8),&#xD;
           incidence of hypertension in our study population can be expected to be close to 10% per&#xD;
           year. Assessment of the expected incidence of diabetes is more difficult because of&#xD;
           variable data provided by previous studies. In the hypertension trials that have&#xD;
           suggested a possible antidiabetogenic action of ACEIs and ARBs, annual incidence of&#xD;
           diabetes was between 1.2 and 4% (3), but those trials that have also explored predictors&#xD;
           of new diabetes suggest higher annual incidences in subjects at higher risk of diabetes,&#xD;
           as follows: 2.6% in ELSA, patients with metabolic syndrome (19), 2.7% in CAPPP, upper&#xD;
           risk tertile (20), 3.4% in LIFE, upper risk quartile (21), and 2.7% and 7.2% in VALUE,&#xD;
           third and fourth risk quartile (22) 6.2% in DREAM (15). Three recent trials&#xD;
           investigating interventions to prevent diabetes in subjects with impaired glucose&#xD;
           tolerance (presumably rather similar to those in PHIDIAS, as a multivariable definition&#xD;
           of risk such has ours has been shown to outperform a glucose tolerance test in&#xD;
           predicting onset of diabetes report yearly incidences of diabetes of 7.5% (23), 11% (23)&#xD;
           and 12.7% (24), reduced to 3.7-4.8% by intense lifestyle counselling. Finally, the DREAM&#xD;
           study (15) is based on the hypothesis that patients with impaired glucose tolerance have&#xD;
           a diabetes annual accrue rate of 4.5%. On the basis of this evidence, we have chosen a&#xD;
           conservative hypothesis of an yearly accrue rate of diabetes of 3.5%, i.e. an incidence&#xD;
           of 10.5% in 3 years. This being a lower incidence rate than that expected for&#xD;
           hypertension, the sample size has been calculated on the diabetes rate. It has been&#xD;
           assumed that, supposing a 4.8% loss to follow-up, a placebo-treated group of 2000&#xD;
           subjects will develop 200 cases of diabetes in three years, and the two actively treated&#xD;
           groups, of 2000 subjects each, will develop altogether 300 cases of diabetes. These&#xD;
           numbers will provide the required alpha of 5% and power of 90% to detect 25% reduction&#xD;
           of diabetes incidence in the two active treatment groups together (7.5% in 3 years)&#xD;
           compared to the placebo group (10% in 3 years). As to the secondary hypothesis, 2000&#xD;
           subjects in each of the enalapril or losartan groups will be sufficient to detect a&#xD;
           lower incidence of 25% in one group (6.4% incidence in 3 years) versus the other (8.5%)&#xD;
           (alpha 5%, power 72%) or a lower incidence of 30% (6.2 versus 8.8 in 3 years) (alpha 5%,&#xD;
           power 88%), again supposing a 4.8% loss to follow-up. In any case the study will be&#xD;
           event driven, and continued until 500 cases of diabetes are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           q. Organisation PHIDIAS will be governed by a Steering Committee, chaired by the&#xD;
           Principal Investigator (A.Zanchetti) and formed by 7 other members (G. Mancia, B.&#xD;
           Trimarco, M. Volpe, E. Agabiti Rosei, C.Cricelli, A. Filippi, G. Corrao). A Data&#xD;
           Monitoring and Safety Committee, chaired by L. Berrino and formed by G. Corrao, and E.&#xD;
           Ambrosioni, will monitor the study and review two interim analyses (180 and 360&#xD;
           accumulated cases of diabetes) using previously agreed conservative warning rules for&#xD;
           efficacy and harm. An Operating Committee (A. ZAnchetti, M. Valentini, F. Gregorini, A.&#xD;
           Filippi, E. Romagnoli)will supervise the daily management of the trial. An Endpoint&#xD;
           Committee will provide an independent and blinded assessment of efficacy endpoints (G.&#xD;
           Mancia, M. Volpe). Participating Units will be general medicine physicians associated&#xD;
           with SIMG. The Italian Society of Hypertension (SIIA) in accordance with SIMG will&#xD;
           identify a number of hospital hypertension centres located in areas close to the&#xD;
           participating units, able to provide consulting assistance to the participating&#xD;
           physicians, and yearly sessions of lifestyle counselling for the enrolled subjects. A&#xD;
           Monitoring Unit will be established at the coordinating institution, liaising with a&#xD;
           professional agency (Yghea, Bologna, Italy). A Statistical Unit will also be located at&#xD;
           the coordinating institution under the supervision of G. Corrao, with the responsibility&#xD;
           of randomising treatments, collecting data and analysing them at trial end. No&#xD;
           centralized laboratory is considered nor structured lifestyle support, nor oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance tests for diagnosis of diabetes, as the trial intends to reproduce, as far as&#xD;
           possible, the conditions under which the NHS can operate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           r. Feasibility The Principal Investigator, Alberto Zanchetti, has a long and extensive&#xD;
           experience in running trials of antihypertensive treatment and treatment of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis (see curriculum vitae). As Scientific Director of the Coordinating&#xD;
           Institution, he confirms that Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, accepts to conduct&#xD;
           the study and agrees for the use of the human and technological resources described in&#xD;
           the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           s. Timing The trial is expected to start about 6 months after eventual AIFA approval.&#xD;
           Recruitment of subjects is expected to be completed in one year. The treatment phase,&#xD;
           although its duration is event-driven, is expected to last an average of 3 years,&#xD;
           followed by a controlled withdrawal phase of 6 months. Predefined check points for&#xD;
           recruitment are at 6, 9, 12 months from study start. Interim analyses from the DMSC are&#xD;
           also considered (see above). A final report is expected within 1 year from study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
           t. Statistical analyses Data analysis will proceed according to CONSORT guidelines for&#xD;
           randomised controlled trials and to the intention-to-treat principle. Analysis are&#xD;
           detailed in Annex 7. In brief, there will be summary statistics on baseline variables,&#xD;
           while primary and secondary efficacy variables will be analysed as time to onset of&#xD;
           diabetes or hypertension, using a Cox regression model adjusted for selected number of&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           u. Ethical aspects. The trial is not expected to have potential risks for study&#xD;
           subjects. They have clinical characteristics for which no drug treatment is currently&#xD;
           indicated, and all of them will benefit by receiving detailed healthy lifestyle&#xD;
           counselling. The subjects will receive full written information on the study, and sign&#xD;
           an informed consent document. Approval has been obtained from the Ethical Review&#xD;
           Committee of the Coordinating Institution and will be obtained from those of the NHS&#xD;
           units from which the participating physicians depend.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Annex&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Annex 1. Lifestyle Interventions. At the randomising visit, all subjects will&#xD;
                receive written detailed instructions for adequate diet and physical exercise, with&#xD;
                the goal of a body weight reduction of at least 5%, as follows: diet: total fat&#xD;
                intake of less than 5% of energy consumed, saturated fat to less than 10% of energy&#xD;
                consumed, frequent intake of vegetables, fruit, olive oil (see ref. 8); exercise:&#xD;
                moderate exercise, such as walking, jogging, swimming for 30 min at least 5 days a&#xD;
                week Instructions will be reiterated at each 6-month visit, when adherence to&#xD;
                lifestyle measures and their results will be checked and annotated in the clinical&#xD;
                form. Recruited subjects will also be offered the possibility of an annual teaching&#xD;
                session on healthy lifestyle provided by a hospital hypertension centre located in&#xD;
                the vicinity&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Annex 2. Study Flow-Chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.The randomised treatment phase may be prolonged or shortened (and the withdrawal phase&#xD;
      delayed or anticipated) according to the accrual time for the primary outcome diabetes (500&#xD;
      cases) 2.Each time a BP or diabetes outcome is measured, an additional confirmatory visit&#xD;
      should be scheduled within one month 3.In individual cases, additional visits may be&#xD;
      scheduled at the physician's discretion 4.The randomised treatment doses are fixed for all&#xD;
      subjects. However in individual cases, the physician may decide to withdraw medication&#xD;
      (possibly temporarily, followed by rechallenge) but the subject should be maintained in the&#xD;
      trial to preserve intention to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Annex 3. Physical examination. For all physical examinations attention should be focused&#xD;
      on cardiovascular signs and symptoms. The initial physical examination (screening visit) and&#xD;
      the final one comprise the examination of the head, thorax, abdomen, spinal column,&#xD;
      auscultation of the heart and lungs, inspection of the skin, and measurement of bodyweight&#xD;
      and body height, and measurement of waist circumference. To measure waist circumference,&#xD;
      locate top of right iliac crest and place a measuring tape in a horizontal plane around the&#xD;
      abdomen at the level of the iliac crest. Measure at the end of a normal expiration. At&#xD;
      follow-up visits, physical examination comprises a short check of all organ systems including&#xD;
      auscultation of the heart and lungs, and a check for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Waist circumference and body weight must be measured at all follow-up visits. Data&#xD;
      will be recorded in specific boxes on Clinical Report Forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Annex 4. Blood pressure measurement. Using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer or a&#xD;
      validated digital device and appropriate size cuff, blood pressure will be measured with the&#xD;
      subjects' arm supported at heart level. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded by the investigator at phase I and V of Korotkoff sounds, or as indicated by the&#xD;
      digital device. The cuff should be deflated at a rate not greater than 2 mmHg/sec with the&#xD;
      patient sitting quietly for several minutes. Blood pressure will be measured 3 times at 1 min&#xD;
      intervals. Blood pressure will be measured in all subjects at the screening and randomization&#xD;
      visits, and during all follow-up visits at 6-month intervals. If a value of SBP&gt;= 140 or&#xD;
      DBP&gt;=90 mmHg (cut-offs for hypertension) is measured at a follow-up visit, this should be&#xD;
      confirmed during a second visit within one month. If the participating physician decides for&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment, the use of a calcium antagonist is less likely to interfere in&#xD;
      either way with development of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Annex 5. Clinical laboratory. Haematology: haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count,&#xD;
      white blood cell count, platelet count will be measured before randomization and study end.&#xD;
      Biochemistry: fasting glucose will be measured before randomization and at all follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 6-month intervals Fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol,&#xD;
      creatinine, potassium, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), as well as proteinuria (dip stick) will be&#xD;
      measured before randomization and subsequently at yearly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Annex 6. Clinical outcomes. Death and the cause of death will be documented in the&#xD;
      clinical report form of the first visit missed by a deceased individual. Non fatal&#xD;
      cardiovascular and renal events will be documented by careful inquiry with the subject and&#xD;
      family members, and every effort will be made to obtain hospital or similar documentation&#xD;
      when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. Annex 7.Statistical analysis. Data analysis will be performed according to CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines for randomised controlled trials and to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparability between groups Summary statistics on demographic and clinical baseline&#xD;
           variables will be calculated by treatment group, and comparisons between treatment&#xD;
           groups will be performed. Analysis of variance models or nonparametric tests will be&#xD;
           utilized for continuous variables, whereas Mantel-Haenszel, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel,&#xD;
           chi-square or Fisher's exact tests will be performed for between-group comparison of&#xD;
           categorical variables, as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of primary efficacy variables The time-to-event primary efficacy variables&#xD;
           (time to onset of diabetes and time to onset of hypertension, during the treatment phase&#xD;
           of the trial) will be analysed separately for diabetes and hypertension, using a Cox&#xD;
           regression model including treatment (placebo vs treatment), and the following baseline&#xD;
           covariates: age, gender, race, BMI, FG, SBP, DBP. Subgroup analyses will be performed&#xD;
           based at least on the following criteria: age groups, gender, BMI and FG groups (above&#xD;
           and below medians), SBP and DBP (above and below medians). The assumption of&#xD;
           proportional hazards will be checked for using graphic methods, and a secondary analysis&#xD;
           of sensitivity will be performed utilizing the log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyses of secondary efficacy variables Secondary variables for which time-to-event can&#xD;
           be defined will be analysed using the same models as for the primary variable. For the&#xD;
           secondary efficacy variables for which time-to-event cannot properly be calculated&#xD;
           (incidence of diabetes and hypertension at the end of the final 6-month withdrawal&#xD;
           phase), logistic regression models will be utilized adjusting for factors as for primary&#xD;
           variable analysis.&#xD;
