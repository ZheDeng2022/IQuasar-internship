      Patients at BWH receiving unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin who subsequently develop&#xD;
      heparin induced thrombocytopenia will be identified via a computer generated report designed&#xD;
      for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, we will compare the heparin induced thrombocytopenia rates associated with&#xD;
      heparin and low molecular weight heparin usage as well as evaluate the economic and long-term&#xD;
      clinical burden of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to investigate the outcomes and pharmacoeconomics of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a complication of heparin therapy receiving&#xD;
      wide-scale awareness, increasing detection, and concern. Data from controlled studies&#xD;
      demonstrate a lower incidence of HIT with low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) when compared&#xD;
      to unfractionated heparin (UFH) However, registry data comparing the incidence of HIT in&#xD;
      patients receiving LWMH vs. UFH are scarce. We will define the incidence of HIT in patients&#xD;
      receiving LWMH vs. UFH in the &quot;real world&quot; setting at Brigham and Women's Hospital. We will&#xD;
      evaluate the associated clinical and economic implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the HIT rates associated with heparin and LMWH usage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The incidence of HIT will be assessed for initial the type of heparin exposure&#xD;
           responsible for causing HIT. Patients will be categorized as receiving UFH with or&#xD;
           without LMWH or as receiving only LMWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the economic burden of HIT to hospitals and/or payors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will capture all expenses associated with each patient admission. Hospital expenses&#xD;
           will be tabulated daily using the hospital database and the proprietary cost accounting&#xD;
           system, Transition Systems, Inc (TSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expenses will be categorized by procedure or area of care and will include Emergency&#xD;
           Department care, operating room use, hospital room and board, hospital based physician&#xD;
           fees, nursing labor, dialysis, clinical laboratory studies (hematology, microbiology,&#xD;
           cytology, urinalysis), radiology (magnetic resonance imaging, computer axial tomography,&#xD;
           and ultrasound imaging), ancillary services (support nutrition support, occupational,&#xD;
           respiratory, and physical therapy services), medications, diagnostic procedures (cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization, electrophysiologic testing, endoscopy, vascular ultrasound, pathology),&#xD;
           and diagnostic testing (electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and electromyography).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will compare the mean total hospitalization costs of UFH induced HIT to those&#xD;
           associated with LMWH induced HIT. Where possible we will compare individual resources&#xD;
           used within the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the long-term clinical burden and recurrence of HIT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with HIT during the study period will be evaluated for a documented&#xD;
      prior diagnosis of HIT. Additionally, all patients will be monitored for 12 months following&#xD;
      initial diagnosis of HIT for subsequent diagnosis of HIT. The long-term clinical burden of&#xD;
      HIT will be assessed by tracking the rates of in-hospital and subsequent mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital has a sophisticated computerized system that integrates medical,&#xD;
      laboratory, and pharmacy data. Patients receiving UFH or enoxaparin who subsequently develop&#xD;
      HIT will be identified via a computer generated report designed for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a diagnosis of HIT during the study period (January 2004 - December 2005)&#xD;
      will be included in the evaluation. Criteria for a HIT positive diagnosis include: a clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of HIT, a decrease in platelets to &lt;150,000 or 50% from baseline, and serologic&#xD;
      confirmation defined as a positive PF4 ELISA test. Patients will be monitored for clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of HIT (new thrombosis, thrombocytopenia). Patients will be followed for clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and incurred expenses over the hospitalization period and subsequent outpatient&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A protocol specific database will be created on an Access platform to house all collected&#xD;
      data. Data will be analyzed internally by the Venous Thromboembolism Research Group.&#xD;
