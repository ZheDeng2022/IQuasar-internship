    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of switching from inhaled Ventavis to&#xD;
      intravenous Remodulin in PAH patients who are considered to be failing inhaled Ventavis&#xD;
      therapy. This study is intended to provide information on the safe transition from Ventavis&#xD;
      to Remodulin as well as the impact intravenous Remodulin may have on overall quality of life&#xD;
      and treatment satisfaction compared to Ventavis.&#xD;

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a&#xD;
      variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an&#xD;
      increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately&#xD;
      leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to&#xD;
      ameliorate symptoms of PAH and to improve quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remodulin (treprostinil sodium), a prostacyclin analog, possesses potent pulmonary and&#xD;
      systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in vivo. Remodulin&#xD;
      is an approved pharmacotherapy for PAH delivered as either a continuous subcutaneous infusion&#xD;
      or intravenous infusion. Ventavis (iloprost)is an inhaled prostacyclin analogue with similar&#xD;
      properties to Remodulin. In December 2004, Ventavis was approved for use in the United States&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) for patients&#xD;
      with NYHA III or IV symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the PAH community gains experience with the use of inhaled Ventavis, questions have arisen&#xD;
      as to how to transition a patient on inhaled Ventavis to Remodulin in the presence of&#xD;
      worsening symptoms or at a patient's request related to dissatisfaction with the frequency of&#xD;
      daily treatments. This study will examine effects of switching from Ventavis to IV Remodulin&#xD;
      and compare changes in exercise capacity, safety, HRQOL and treatment satisfactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 12 weeks. Study procedures include routine blood tests, medical&#xD;
      history, physical exams, disease evaluation, exercise tests and patient questionnaires.&#xD;
      Participates will have 4 clinic visits during the study and will spend at least one night in&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
