  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was undertaken to compare the two techniques (exteriorized vs in situ) of uterine&#xD;
      repair with respect to patient comfort, hemodynamic changes, surgical time and blood loss, in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective CD under a strictly standardized spinal anesthetic. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that in situ uterine repair would be more comfortable for the patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine repair during Cesarean delivery can be done either by exteriorizing the uterus and&#xD;
      replacing it into the abdominal cavity after the completion of a double layer closure, or by&#xD;
      suturing it in situ. Exteriorization of the uterus has been shown to decrease blood loss&#xD;
      during Cesarean delivery when compared to in situ repair. However, at the same time, it is&#xD;
      thought to be uncomfortable for the patient with respect to intraoperative nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      and pain. Intraoperative nausea and vomiting in patients who receive regional anaesthesia for&#xD;
      Cesarean section is a complex multifactorial problem arising from anesthetic and&#xD;
      non-anesthetic causes. Additionally, it can influence hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a prospective, randomized and single blinded study. It compared the effects of&#xD;
      exteriorization of the uterus and in-situ repair during Cesarean delivery with respect to&#xD;
      patient's comfort, hemodynamic changes, uterine contractility and blood loss in patients&#xD;
      under spinal anesthesia. All low risk patients undergoing elective C-delivery under spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia were considered for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia was performed in the sitting position with 10-12 mg of 0.75% hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine, mixed with 100 mcg of preservative free morphine and 10 mcg of fentanyl. Any&#xD;
      drop in blood pressure was treated with 100 mg of phenylephrine titrated to maintain systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure within 10% of the baseline values throughout the procedure. Oxytocin was used&#xD;
      judiciously, in aliquots of 0.5 IU. Obstetricians were asked to allow assisted spontaneous&#xD;
      delivery of placenta rather than manual extraction. During surgery, patient's complaints of&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, pain or any discomfort were recorded.&#xD;
