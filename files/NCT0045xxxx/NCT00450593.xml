      RATIONALE: Identifying gene mutations and other risk factors in patients with melanoma and in&#xD;
      families with a history of hereditary melanoma may help doctors identify persons at risk for&#xD;
      melanoma and other types of cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying gene mutations in patients with melanoma and in&#xD;
      families with a history of hereditary melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence and etiologic significance of variants of known melanoma&#xD;
           susceptibility genes (MSGs) in families with multiple cases of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of multiple-case families that are explained by high-penetrance&#xD;
           mutations in known MSGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of multiple-case families that are explained by these mutations&#xD;
           and whether it varies with latitude, as a surrogate for ultraviolet exposure, with&#xD;
           number of affected relatives, with average age at onset of melanoma in relatives, with&#xD;
           presence of multiple primary melanoma, or with other family-specific variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the penetrance of MSG mutations in these families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if the penetrance varies with age, sex, or birth cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if the penetrance varies with the gene involved or nature of the mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the penetrance in mutations that also have a deleterious effect on the&#xD;
           alternative splice product, p14ARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether carriers of MSGs have an increased susceptibility to other types of&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the risk of other types of cancers for mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine environmental exposures, in particular sun exposure, that modify risk of&#xD;
           melanoma in MSG mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the cutaneous phenotypes that correlate with melanoma risk in these families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate cutaneous phenotypes with the presence of MSG variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of other covariates, such as sun exposure or the presence of&#xD;
           alleles of putative modifying genes (e.g., MC1R or CDKN2A), on phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if modifier genes, such as those controlling pigmentation of the skin, and&#xD;
           therefore sun susceptibility, modify risk in MSG mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify any histopathological correlates of MSG status in primary tumors arising in&#xD;
           melanoma-susceptible individuals in these families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify any histopathological correlates of primary melanomas in carriers of MSG&#xD;
           mutations with other covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a case-control, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete 2 questionnaires and assist in the creation and expansion of a family&#xD;
      pedigree. Blood samples are examined for melanoma susceptibility gene mutations, including&#xD;
      CDK4 and CDKN2A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are also examined for moles and photographed. Physical variables (e.g., skin,&#xD;
      eye, and hair pigmentation) and sun damage (solar lentigines and freckling) are also noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If available, tissue samples are examined for Clark level, Breslow thickness, and frequency&#xD;
      of mitoses. Peri-lesional skin from tumors is examined by p53 staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed periodically to monitor cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer reviewed and funded or endorsed by Cancer Research UK&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,000 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
