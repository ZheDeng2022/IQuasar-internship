  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 2 different doses&#xD;
      of modified-release recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (MRrhTSH) when administered&#xD;
      with radioiodine in patients with multinodular goiter, a condition that involves the&#xD;
      enlargement of the thyroid gland. We will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      radioiodine therapy alone in these patients. The goal of the treatment is to determine if&#xD;
      there was a reduction in the size of the goiter and to study if goiter symptoms have improved&#xD;
      after 6 months and after 36 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of multinodular goiter, judged clinically and by ultrasound at&#xD;
             Screening to be at least 40 mL, but less than or equal to 140 mL in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically free of thyroid cancer as determined by Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of all&#xD;
             dominant and/or highly suspicious cold nodules in the goiter and cytology reports as&#xD;
             negative for thyroid cancer. (Note: Results of FNA and cytology reports that were&#xD;
             performed within 18 months prior to commencing Screening procedures and meet these&#xD;
             criteria are acceptable for inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Principal Investigator must believe that there is a minimal risk of coexistent thyroid&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Principal Investigator feels that the patient's iodine intake and/or levels will not&#xD;
             significantly impact the results of the study (urinary iodine assay at Screening and&#xD;
             low-iodine diet are optional and associated data will not be collected for study&#xD;
             purposes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline serum level of free thyroxine index (FTI) within the normal range, as&#xD;
             determined by central lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) ranges from undetectable to&#xD;
             the upper limit of the normal range, as determined by central lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing potential must be on a stable hormonal contraceptive regimen&#xD;
             (i.e., &gt; 6 months continuous use) and/or use a double barrier method (i.e., condom and&#xD;
             foam) through Visit 8 (i.e. the end of the Core Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Through Visit 8 (6 months) of a male patient's participation in the study, it is&#xD;
             recommended that his sexual partner(s), who are females of child-bearing potential,&#xD;
             use the above described methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy tests for all women of child-bearing potential prior to&#xD;

             have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Routine blood laboratory values within normal range at Screening, as determined by&#xD;
             central lab. Abnormal values considered to be not clinically significant by the&#xD;

             patient. Patients who have ECG findings of occasional premature atrial beats, abnormal&#xD;
             PR intervals not associated with supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) or heart block,&#xD;
             right bundle branch block, and heart rates ≤ 100 beats per minute (BPM) and ≥ 50 BPM&#xD;
             may be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             supplements containing kelp or iodine (taking a multivitamin that does not contain&#xD;
             iodine or kelp is acceptable), medications that significantly affect iodine handling&#xD;
             such as high dose corticosteroids, high dose diuretics, or lithium (low or moderate&#xD;
