  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see if Pegasys (IFN-alpha2a) can help to&#xD;
      control the disease in patients with ET, PV, AMM/MF, and Ph-negative CML. The safety of this&#xD;
      treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IFN-alpha2a has been used for the treatment of a variety of disorders (such as hepatitis C).&#xD;
      IFN-alpha2a is a drug that may affect the way infections and malignant diseases develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, you will have blood (around 2 teaspoons) and bone marrow samples&#xD;
      collected. To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with&#xD;
      anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. These&#xD;
      samples will be used for tests to confirm the diagnosis of the disease. Women who are able to&#xD;
      have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, you will receive IFN-alpha2a as an injection under the skin once a week.&#xD;
      You (or your caregiver) will be taught how to give the injections, and you will receive&#xD;
      treatment on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue (injections once a week) as long as the disease does not get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken&#xD;
      off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment you will have blood (around 1 teaspoon) collected every other week for 2&#xD;
      months, then once every 1 or 2 months for a year, then every 3 months. You will also have&#xD;
      bone marrow samples collected every 3 to 6 months during the first year of treatment. After&#xD;
      the first year of treatment, bone marrow samples will be collected only when your doctor&#xD;
      feels they are needed. The blood and bone marrow samples will be used for tests to check on&#xD;
      the response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. IFN-alpha2a has been approved by the FDA for the treatment&#xD;
      of hepatitis C and is commercially available. However the use of IFN-alpha2a in this study is&#xD;
      investigational. The commercial prepartion of IFN-alpha2a(Pegasys) will be used in this&#xD;
      study. Up to 280 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Following diagnoses: --ET: Patients with PLT &gt; 600 x10 9 /l documented in the past 12&#xD;
             months; hyperplasia of marrow megakaryocytes in the absence of identifiable cause of&#xD;
             thrombocytosis and in the absence of Ph chromosome. Patients with ET and lower PLT&#xD;
             will be eligible if attributable to prior ET therapy. --PV: Patients should have Hb&#xD;
             &gt;/= 15g/dl (except if patient is having phlebotomies done) and documented past&#xD;
             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Performance status &lt;/= 2 (ECOG scale).&#xD;
