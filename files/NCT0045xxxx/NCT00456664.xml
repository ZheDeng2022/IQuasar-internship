      Various diagnostic methods are available for CMV infection. But none of them could be a&#xD;
      standard and highly valuable. Our first goal is to setup a series of molecular diagnostic&#xD;
      tools for HIV-1 infected person. By using these tools, physicians can easily select cases&#xD;
      with CMV disease or immune restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) to enroll this study.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will seek for a predict marker for CMV reactivation, CMV disease and IRIS.&#xD;
      Finally, our research will focus on the mechanism of the IE gene alternative splicing between&#xD;
      lytic and latent stage.&#xD;

      At present, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a major health threat in immune compromised&#xD;
      patients. Especially HCMV will cause blind and death in HIV-1 infected person. Currently, few&#xD;
      antiviral drugs can be chosen for treatment of HCMV infection. Besides, more and more drug&#xD;
      resistant virus strains were reported and led failure in antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various diagnostic methods are available for CMV infection. Such as shell vial assay, CMV&#xD;
      antigen test, pp65 antigen assay and polymerase chain reaction. But none of them could be a&#xD;
      standard and highly valuable. Although CMV-PCR is very sensitive, it can't distinguish&#xD;
      between active disease and asymptomatic infection or latency, can't predict symptomatic&#xD;
      disease nor can't monitor the successful antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our first goal is to setup a series of molecular diagnostic tools for HIV-1 infected person.&#xD;
      By using these tools, physicians can easily select cases with CMV disease or immune&#xD;
      restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) to enroll this study. Furthermore, we will seek for&#xD;
      a predict marker for CMV reactivation, CMV disease and IRIS. Finally, our research will focus&#xD;
      on the mechanism of the IE gene alternative splicing between lytic and latent stage. We may&#xD;
      find out new therapeutic concept and prevent virus reactivation from latency.&#xD;
