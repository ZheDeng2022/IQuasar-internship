    <textblock>
      This study will check the efficacy of balneological therapy of bathing in Dead Sea fountain&#xD;
      waters over a 6 week period on a twice a week basis (overall 12 treatments) in patients&#xD;
      suffering from osteoarthritis of the knees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since stay in the Dead Sea for a long period of time is an expensive matter, it is important&#xD;
      to determine whether twice a week treatments can be as beneficiary as two straight weeks of&#xD;
      treatments as was shown to be effective in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will follow the patients for a longer period of time (6 months) than was done in&#xD;
      previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional advantage will be separating the therapeutical effect of our specific treatment&#xD;
      from the therapeutical effect of being in a comfortable hotel away from the daily nuisances&#xD;
      for 2 weeks which by itself has been shown to be pain relieving in patients suffering from&#xD;
      rheumatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will take 50 patients suffering from Osteoarthritis of the knees and divide them in&#xD;
      to 2 equal groups. One group will be treated twice a week with thermo-mineral baths at the&#xD;
      temperature of 35-36 degrees Celsius for approximately 20 minutes. The other group will be&#xD;
      treated twice a week with hot sweet water tub (without the water jets!) of the same&#xD;
      temperature and for the same length of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will change nothing in their current medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be examined at 5 points during this study: a few days before their first&#xD;
      treatment, right after their last treatment (after 6 weeks), after one month, after 3 months&#xD;
      and after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examination will be performed in the Soroka University Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical indexes and questionnaires which would be filled during this trial will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. WOMAC index&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lequesne's index&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual analogue scale by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visual analogue scale by the doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. SF 36 and Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ)&#xD;
