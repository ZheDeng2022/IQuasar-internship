  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood morbidity and death in many developing countries&#xD;
      including Bangladesh, causing about 2 million deaths worldwide each year. Pneumonia is an&#xD;
      infection of the lungs, most commonly caused by viruses or bacteria like Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Depending on the clinical presentation, pneumonia can&#xD;
      be classified as very severe, severe or non-severe, with specific treatment for each of them&#xD;
      except for antibiotic therapy. Severe and very severe pneumonia require hospitalization for&#xD;
      additional supportive treatment such as suction, oxygen therapy and administration of&#xD;
      bronchodilator. In Bangladesh, the number of hospital beds is inadequate for admission of all&#xD;
      pneumonia cases that require hospitalization; however, it is also important to provide&#xD;
      institutional care to those children who cannot be hospitalized due to bed constraints.&#xD;
      Provision of appropriate antibiotics and supportive cares during the period of stay at&#xD;
      established day-care centres could be an effective alternative. The impetus for this study&#xD;
      came from the findings of our recently completed study titled &quot;Daycare-based management of&#xD;
      severe pneumonia in under-5 children when hospitalization is not possible due to the lack of&#xD;
      beds&quot;. This study successfully managed children (n=251), but it was not a randomized trial&#xD;
      and thus direct comparison of the efficacy of management of severe pneumonia at the day-care&#xD;
      centre, essential for building confidence for implementing this management policy, is not&#xD;
      possible. We, the researchers at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research,&#xD;
      Bangladesh, could not plan a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) because of ethical reasons.&#xD;
      Now that we have data suggesting effectiveness as well as safety of the day-care based&#xD;
      treatment for management of children with severe pneumonia, a RCT should be possible. Two&#xD;
      hundred fifty-one children with severe pneumonia were enrolled at the Radda Clinic from June&#xD;
      2003 to May 2005. The mean age was 7±7 (2-55) months, 86% infants, 63% boys and 91%&#xD;
      breast-fed. History of cough was present in 99% cases, fever in 89% and rapid breathing in&#xD;
      67% cases. Forty-four percent of children were febrile (≥38°C), 93% children had vesicular&#xD;
      breath sound and 99% bilateral rales. Fifty-seven percent of children were hypoxic with mean&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of (93±4)%, which was corrected by oxygen therapy (98±3)%. Eighty percent&#xD;
      of children had severe pneumonia and 20% had very severe pneumonia. The mean duration of&#xD;
      clinic stay was (7±2) days. Two hundred thirty-four (93%) children completed the study&#xD;
      successfully, 11 (4.4%) referred to hospitals (only one participant had to visit hospital at&#xD;
      night due to deterioration of his condition, 9 were referred to hospital at the time of&#xD;
      clinic closure i.e., at 5 pm and one participant was referred to hospital during the morning&#xD;
      hours) and 6 (2.4%) left against medical advice (LAMA). There was no death during the period&#xD;
      of clinic stay but only four (1.6%) deaths occurred during the 3 months follow-up. The study&#xD;
      indicated that treatment of severe pneumonia in children at the day-care centre is effective&#xD;
      and safe and thus it is comparable to the hospital care. If the day-care based management is&#xD;
      found to have comparable efficacy to that of hospitalized management of severe pneumonia in&#xD;
      children then they could be managed at outpatient, day-care set ups reducing hospitalization&#xD;
      and thus freeing beds for management of other children who need hospitalized care.&#xD;
      Additionally, availability of the treatment facility in community set-ups will be cost and&#xD;
      time saving for the population. Children of either sex, aged 2-59 months, attending the Radda&#xD;
      Clinic and Institute of Child Health and Shishu Hospital (ICHSH) with severe pneumonia will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either the day-care management at the clinic or hospitalized&#xD;
      management at the ICHSH. Children randomized to receive day-care treatment will stay at the&#xD;
      clinic from 8 am-5 pm and will receive antibiotics and other supportive cares. At 5 pm, they&#xD;
      would be send to respective homes with advice to bring back their children to the clinic next&#xD;
      morning, and advised to provide other supports at home. The same management would be&#xD;
      continued till improvement and discharged and followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months.&#xD;
      Children randomized to receive hospitalized management would be admitted at ICHSH and receive&#xD;
      standard treatment like antibiotics and other supportive cares. The same treatment would be&#xD;
      continued for 24 hours/day (rather than 9 hours/day at the day-care clinic) till improvement&#xD;
      and discharged and followed-up at the ICHSH every 2 weeks for 3 months. About 3000 children&#xD;
      with pneumonia visit Radda Clinic each year and about 200 of them will have severe pneumonia&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization. Thus, we hope to enroll 368 (184 in each site) children with&#xD;
      severe pneumonia during a 2-year study period.&#xD;

      Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), particularly pneumonia is the leading cause of&#xD;
      childhood morbidity and death in the developing countries including Bangladesh. Acute&#xD;
      respiratory infection (ARI) causes more than 2 million child deaths worldwide each year; most&#xD;
      of these deaths are due to pneumonia and 90% of them occur in less-developed countries.&#xD;
      Recent estimates suggest that 1.9 million (95% CI 1.6-2.2 million) children died from ARI&#xD;
      throughout the world in 2000, and 70% of them occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia. ARI is&#xD;
      also a major cause of visits to the outpatient and emergency departments as well as&#xD;
      admissions to the hospitals. Although bronchiolitis, tracheobronchitis and pneumonia, each&#xD;
      accounts for about one-third of ALRI cases, pneumonia is responsible for most ALRI deaths.&#xD;
      Three studies that reported diagnoses in children who died of ALRI revealed that a median of&#xD;
      89% (range 71% to 100%) of ALRI deaths were associated with pneumonia. In Bangladesh, ALRI&#xD;
      accounts for 25% of under-5 children deaths and 40% of infantile deaths. In a study conducted&#xD;
      at the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh&#xD;
      (ICDDR,B) in 1986-88 among 401 under-5 children with ALRI, it has been observed that the most&#xD;
      common manifestation was pneumonia and a respiratory pathogen (both bacterial and viral) was&#xD;
      identified in 30% cases. The case fatality rates were 14% in bacterial pneumonia and 3% in&#xD;
      viral pneumonia. Bacterial infections play a major role as a cause of pneumonia in children&#xD;
      in developing countries. Pooled data from lung aspiration studies, mostly from developing&#xD;
      countries, reported 52-62% isolation rates of bacteria. The case-fatality rate in severe ALRI&#xD;
      in children aged 1-4 years is 10-15 times higher in the developing than in the developed&#xD;
      countries. It is an infection of the lungs, most commonly caused by viruses or bacteria. It&#xD;
      is usually not possible to determine the specific cause of pneumonia by either clinical or&#xD;
      chest X-ray features. In children, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are&#xD;
      the two most important bacterial pathogens. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is also an&#xD;
      important cause of ARI among preschool children. Emerging evidence suggests that Mycoplasma&#xD;
      pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause pneumonia among older children. Available data&#xD;
      also suggests that mixed viral and bacterial infections are common in children in developing&#xD;
      countries, which need to be treated with antibiotics. More recently, data from a large&#xD;
      vaccine trial suggested Streptococcus pneumoniae to play a major role in the development of&#xD;
      pneumonia associated with viral infections. The WHO recommendations for treatment of&#xD;
      pneumonia are based on data that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the&#xD;
      most common causes of bacterial pneumonia in developing countries. Depending on clinical&#xD;
      presentation, pneumonia can be classified as very severe, severe or non-severe with specific&#xD;
      treatment guidelines available for each of them. The WHO defines very severe pneumonia as&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia (cough or difficulty breathing with one or more&#xD;
      danger signs like cyanosis, convulsions, drowsiness, stridor in calm child or inability to&#xD;
      drink, all signifying hypoxaemia or severe respiratory distress) and severe clinical&#xD;
      malnutrition. Severe pneumonia is defined as cough or difficulty breathing with lower chest&#xD;
      wall in drawing with or without fast breathing defined as the respiratory rate ≥ 50 breaths&#xD;
      per minute for children aged 2-11 months and ≥ 40 breaths per minute for children aged 12-59&#xD;
      months. Lower chest wall in drawing is defined as inward movement of the bony structures of&#xD;
      the lower chest wall with inspiration, observed while the child is at rest. Finally,&#xD;
      non-severe pneumonia is defined as cough or difficulty breathing with fast breathing as&#xD;
      defined earlier. Antibiotic therapy is indicated irrespective of the severity of pneumonia.&#xD;
      Proper management of children presenting in health centres and hospitals with respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms is the cornerstone of acute respiratory infection control. To address the high&#xD;
      mortality associated with ALRI, WHO launched a programme for control of ARI with the major&#xD;
      objective to reduce the child mortality and to promote rational use of antibiotic. Current&#xD;
      standard ARI case management recommends that children with cough and normal breathing be&#xD;
      treated as outpatients without any antibiotics assuming viral infection or mild bacterial&#xD;
      infections; those with rapid respiration (tachypnoea) indicating lower respiratory infection&#xD;
      or pneumonia be treated with an antibiotic on an ambulatory basis (non-severe pneumonia);&#xD;
      while those with chest wall in drawing (indicative of severe pneumonia) be admitted to&#xD;
      hospital and treated with parenteral antibiotics and supportive cares. Vaccination against&#xD;
      measles, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae can help&#xD;
      decrease the incidence and lessen the severity of respiratory infections. However, newer&#xD;
      vaccines against respiratory infections such as Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are&#xD;
      not widely available in developing countries. Under-5 children with respiratory symptoms are&#xD;
      brought to the general practitioners as well as to primary health care facilities for&#xD;
      treatment. At these respective places, the health care providers are required to&#xD;
      differentiate between acute upper respiratory infections (AURI) and acute lower respiratory&#xD;
      infections (ALRI)/pneumonia, and categorize severity of pneumonia taking into consideration&#xD;
      the nutritional status of the patients and provide either ambulatory therapy or refer&#xD;
      patients for hospitalization, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe and very severe pneumonia require hospitalization for additional supportive treatment&#xD;
      like oro or nasopharyngeal suction, when indicated, using a suction device; oxygen therapy to&#xD;
      hypoxic children, bronchodilators to patients with bronchospasm, bronchodilatation by&#xD;
      nebulizer if the patients fulfill the criteria for nebulization, and fluid and nutritional&#xD;
      management and close monitoring. In Bangladesh, the number of hospital beds are inadequate&#xD;
      for admission of all pneumonia cases that fulfill the criteria for hospitalization.&#xD;
      Hospitalization may also not be possible for inability of the parents to visit a hospital due&#xD;
      to distance or, financial reason(s), despite appropriate referral. However, it is also&#xD;
      important to provide institutional care to those children who cannot be hospitalized, at&#xD;
      least until stabilization of their acute conditions. If such children are sent home with&#xD;
      antibiotics, it would be important to establish an expensive, home follow up system, without&#xD;
      which a significant proportion of them would be expected to have a fatal outcome. Provision&#xD;
      of broad-spectrum antibiotics and appropriate supportive care during the period of stay at&#xD;
      established day-care centres could be an effective alternative. To examine this possibility,&#xD;
      we have recently completed a study entitled &quot;Daycare-based management of severe pneumonia in&#xD;
      under-5 children when hospitalization is not possible due to the lack of beds&quot; (ICDDR,B&#xD;
      Protocol No. 2002-036) at the Radda MCH-FP Centre, located in Mirpur Section-10, Dhaka,&#xD;
      Bangladesh. The estimated catchment population of the Radda Clinic is about 1.5 million. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of our recently completed study was that it would be possible to provide effective&#xD;
      treatment and care to under-5 children with severe pneumonia at a day-care clinic set up, and&#xD;
      if so, the need for hospitalization could be significantly reduced. The study examined if&#xD;
      children, who required hospitalization according to WHO guidelines but were not hospitalized&#xD;
      due to any reason, could be managed at a day-care facility (modified primary care set up),&#xD;
      which is important to reduce morbidity and more importantly deaths among such children. We&#xD;
      are impressed with the results, which suggested that this model of management is effective.&#xD;
      251 children with severe pneumonia were enrolled at the Radda Clinic from June 2003 to May&#xD;
      2005. The mean age was 7±7 (2-55) months, 86% were infants, 63% boys, and 91% breast-fed. On&#xD;
      admission, history of cough was present in 99% cases, fever in 89%, rapid breathing in 67%&#xD;
      and difficulty in breathing in 33% cases. On examination, 44% children were febrile (≥38°C),&#xD;
      97% children had tachypnoea with respiratory rate ≥ 50 per minute and 98% had lower chest&#xD;
      wall in drawing. On auscultation, 93% children had vesicular breath sound and 99% bilateral&#xD;
      rales. Most children were well nourished but 57% were hypoxic with mean oxygen saturation of&#xD;
      (93±4)% on admission, which was corrected by oxygen therapy (98±3)%. According to WHO&#xD;
      criteria, 80% children had severe pneumonia and 20% had very severe pneumonia. The mean&#xD;
      duration of clinic stay was (7±2) days. 234 (93%) children completed the study successfully&#xD;
      without any problem, 11 (4.4%) referred to hospitals (only one participant had to visit&#xD;
      hospital at night due to deterioration of his condition, 9 were referred to hospital at the&#xD;
      time of clinic closure i.e., at 5 pm and one participant was referred to hospital during the&#xD;
      morning hours), and 6 (2.4%) left against medical advice (LAMA). There was no death during&#xD;
      the period of clinic stay but only four (1.6%) deaths occurred during the 3 months follow-up&#xD;
      period after discharge from the clinic. This study indicated that treatment of severe&#xD;
      pneumonia in children at the day-care centre is effective and safe and thus it is comparable&#xD;
      to the hospital care. Although this study successfully managed all children (n=251), but it&#xD;
      was not a randomized trial and thus direct comparison of the effectiveness of management of&#xD;
      severe pneumonia at the day-care centre, essential to recommend implementation of this&#xD;
      management policy, is not possible. We could not plan for a RCT due to ethical reasons for&#xD;
      our recently completed day-care pneumonia study. Now that we have data suggesting&#xD;
      effectiveness as well as safety of the day-care based treatment and care of under-5 children&#xD;
      with severe pneumonia, a RCT would now be possible. In the proposed study, we would identify&#xD;
      under-5 children attending the outpatient department of the Radda Clinic and ICHSH with&#xD;
      severe pneumonia and randomize them, in equal numbers, for management at the day-care centre&#xD;
      (Radda Clinic) or hospital (ICHSH) subject to consent of respective parents/guardians.&#xD;
      Children with very severe pneumonia, who needs hospitalization, would not be enrolled as they&#xD;
      need hospital care and it would be unethical at this stage to enroll them in the proposed&#xD;
      study. About 3000 children with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia visit the clinic each year,&#xD;
      and we estimate that about 200 of them will have severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization -&#xD;
      the patient population of our study. We hope to enroll requisite 368 (184/site) children with&#xD;
      severe pneumonia during 2-year study period.&#xD;
