  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle intervention and certain medications have been shown to be effective for&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain, but no controlled studies have compared psychological and&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of lifestyle intervention and metformin alone and in combination for&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial, with research assessors&#xD;
      and patients intended to be blind to the intervention status. The staff members performing&#xD;
      the assessment were not involved in implementing any aspect of the intervention.128 patients&#xD;
      were randomized to one of four 12-week individual treatments: metformin (750mg/day), placebo,&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention plus metformin (750mg/day) or lifestyle intervention plus placebo.&#xD;
      Medications were provided in double-blind fashion.The assessments include body weight, body&#xD;
      mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
