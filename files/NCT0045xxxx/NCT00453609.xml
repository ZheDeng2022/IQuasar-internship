  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to improve the treatment of alcohol dependence in&#xD;
      patients with serious mental illness (SMI). SMI for this study is defined as any patient with&#xD;
      any of the following diagnoses: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar type I&#xD;
      or type II disorder. Alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs) are common among&#xD;
      individuals with SMI. SUD comorbidity is associated with many adverse consequences. However,&#xD;
      to date, few reports have addressed the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for SUDs in&#xD;
      this population. Naltrexone pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment for alcohol dependence,&#xD;
      but it has not been systematically applied to the care of patients with SMI. The primary aim&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the feasibility of long-acting injectable naltrexone&#xD;
      administration in a clinical trial in patients with SMI who also have a diagnosis of alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. Secondary aims include providing a preliminary assessment of the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of long-acting injectable naltrexone in patients with SMI who also have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence. An additional aim is to provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy&#xD;
      of long-acting injectable naltrexone in reducing alcohol use from baseline levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a 1-year pilot program of research, which will examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a new, intramuscular (IM) long-acting form of naltrexone. The long-acting form&#xD;
      of naltrexone may improve medication adherence, which has been shown to be critical to&#xD;
      successful naltrexone treatment of alcohol dependence. The study is a 16-week, randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, open-label trial, including a 12-week course of monthly naltrexone injections. A&#xD;
      follow-up interview will be conducted 4 weeks after discontinuation of medication. Thirty&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited. Voucher-based incentives will be provided to all subjects to&#xD;
      ensure attendance for medication administration. Weekly motivational counseling sessions will&#xD;
      be conducted and will focus on improving motivation to stop alcohol use. Study outcomes&#xD;
      consist of self-report and biological measures of alcohol use; measures of psychiatric&#xD;
      symptom severity and neurocognitive functioning; and genetic testing to examine functional&#xD;
      polymorphism (Asn40Asp) differences in the subjects' μ-opioid receptors (OPRM1), which may&#xD;
      predict response to naltrexone treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females, age 18 to 69, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Schizophrenia,&#xD;
             Schizoaffective Disorder, or Bipolar Type I or Type II Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. DSM-IV diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Level of Drinking:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. At least four days of drinking in the 30 days prior to consent and/or during&#xD;
                  screening period OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For prospective subjects who are currently in an inpatient or residential&#xD;
                  facility or recently discharged within 30 days prior to consent: At least 4 days&#xD;
                  of drinking during the period of time immediately prior to inpatient admission&#xD;
                  and/or during post-discharge.&#xD;
