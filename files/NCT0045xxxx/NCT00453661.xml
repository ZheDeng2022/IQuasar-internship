  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to improve the use of cancer prevention&#xD;
      services, increase early detection, and treatment of cancer. A secondary outcome of this&#xD;
      demonstration project proposes that a structured patient navigator (PN) will reduce the cost&#xD;
      of Medicare services.&#xD;

      Screening Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start on this study, you will answer a 20 minute Triage questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask you if you have had cancer, what type of cancer, and when you were&#xD;
      last treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-Screening Groups and Treatment Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you answer the Triage questionnaire and if you are found to be eligible to take part in&#xD;
      this study, you will be placed in the Cancer Screening Group or the Treatment Group based on&#xD;
      your answers to the Triage questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have not been treated for cancer in the past or if it has been more than 5 years since&#xD;
      you were last treated, you will be in the Cancer Screening Group and you will complete the&#xD;
      screening Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA). The CSA will ask you about cancer screenings,&#xD;
      lifestyle, and other health related items. The questionnaire should take about a total of&#xD;
      45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have been treated for cancer in the past 5 years, you will be in the Treatment Group.&#xD;
      The CSA will ask you about cancer screenings, cancer treatment, and other health related&#xD;
      items. The questionnaire should take about a total of 45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the Cancer Screening Assessment (CSA) for either the Cancer Screening&#xD;
      Group or the Treatment Group, you will complete a CSA addendum questionnaire. This CSA&#xD;
      addendum questionnaire will ask you about barriers and factors that may influence your health&#xD;
      related decisions. The questionnaire should take 15-20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Comparison Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in either the cancer-screening group or the treatment group will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to one of 2 additional groups, the &quot;Intervention group&quot;&#xD;
      or the &quot;Comparison&quot; group. You will have an equal chance of being in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Intervention Group, you will work with a staff member, called a patient&#xD;
      navigator (PN), who will assist with medical care and/or screenings (intervention group). For&#xD;
      example, the staff member may help schedule screening appointments, medical care&#xD;
      appointments, or any other necessary assistance to meet health care needs. The PN will be&#xD;
      responsible for recording information about your care and any cancer treatment, should that&#xD;
      be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete a CSA questionnaire 1 time a year for up to 4 years. A staff member will&#xD;
      contact you by phone to set up an appointment to give you the CSA questionnaires. All&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed at a time and place that you and the study staff agree upon.&#xD;
      For example, the study staff may meet you at a community center, independent-living center,&#xD;
      or another agreed upon location. The questionnaire should take about 45-60 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Comparison Group, you will not work with a staff member and you will not&#xD;
      complete any additional questionnaires during the 4 years on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention group and the comparison group will receive educational materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exit Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 years after you join the study, you will be contacted by a staff member and you will&#xD;
      set up an exit questionnaire meeting. This questionnaire will be completed at a time and&#xD;
      place that you and the staff member agree upon. This questionnaire will contain similar&#xD;
      questions to those you have been answering since your participation in the study. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will take about 45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off-study after 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 11,964 participants will take part in this study. A&#xD;
      total of 2,812 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
