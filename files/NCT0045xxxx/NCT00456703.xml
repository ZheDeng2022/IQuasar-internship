  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liberal intravenous fluid resuscitation during open abdominal surgery may predispose the&#xD;
      patients to multiorgan dysfunction, prolong hospital stay and increase postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity. The main aim of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of restricted&#xD;
      fluid regimen in open abdominal bowel surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective controlled trial in patients (ASA I-III) undergoing open&#xD;
      abdominal surgical procedures in a single center. This study will be done in two phases. The&#xD;
      first phase is designed to evaluate and prove the safety of restricted fluid regimens in&#xD;
      maintaining tissue perfusion using a central venous oximetric catheter and arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis. In the second phase of the study, we plan to mimic the usual clinical practice&#xD;
      without the central venous oximetric catheter and arterial lines (invasive monitors) and the&#xD;
      postoperative total morbidity will be compared between the liberal and restricted fluid&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study, 90 patients coming in for open bowel surgery will be&#xD;
      randomized to three groups using a random number generator. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      standard bowel prep regimen (Go-Lyte-half a liter the night before surgery). Group A will&#xD;
      receive current standard of care (liberal fluid therapy), Group B and C will receive&#xD;
      restricted fluid regimens. All patients will receive 500 cc of intravenous fluids (lactated&#xD;
      ringers in Group A and B, 6% hetastarch in Group C) in the preoperative holding area to&#xD;
      correct preoperative fluid deficits due to fasting and bowel preparation. Patients younger&#xD;
      than 18 years, ASA IV or V, pregnant patients, those with coagulopathy, renal insufficiency,&#xD;
      unstable angina, unstable congestive heart failure, and those with contraindication to&#xD;
      central venous pressure catheter insertion will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After instituting anesthesia monitors, patients will be anesthetized with a standard&#xD;
      anesthetic regimen. An arterial line and a central venous catheter with oximetric capability&#xD;
      will be inserted in all three groups. A baseline blood gas will be drawn to note the base&#xD;
      excess, lactate levels and the hematocrit at the start of surgery. Parameters like heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, mixed venous oxygen saturation and arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and urine output will be continuously monitored. Both the regimens will be&#xD;
      started in the operating room and continued into the postoperative period until they resume&#xD;
      their oral intake. Patients in the liberal group will receive (10ml/kg/hr) the current&#xD;
      standard of care for bowel surgery whereas those in the restricted group will receive&#xD;
      4ml/kg/hour. Post induction hemodynamic instability will be treated with ephedrine and&#xD;
      phenylephrine at the discretion of the anesthesiologist in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative treatment of tachycardia, hypotension in both the groups will be treated using&#xD;
      a standard fluid regimen algorithm (appendix A). All patients will receive the same&#xD;
      postoperative fluid regimens as the current standard of care. Postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      evaluation (appendix B) will be done at patient's discharge from the hospital. The data entry&#xD;
      will be prospectively done during their hospital stay. The accuracy of the data will be&#xD;
      checked by one of the study investigators.&#xD;
