  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what parts of the brain have increased or decreased&#xD;
      activity with individuals who have bipolar disorder and how medicine changes this activity in&#xD;
      bipolar subjects. Another purpose of this study is to compare data obtained from bipolar&#xD;
      depressed subjects with data obtained from healthy subjects. In this study we will measure&#xD;
      activity in different parts of the brain, while participants see pictures, using Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. We will do two MRI scans with each subject before and after&#xD;
      treatment for eight weeks with a standard bipolar disorder medication called lithium.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Our first aim is to use a novel fMRI experimental paradigm to investigate the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) in terms of the strength of connectivity (as&#xD;
      measured by LFBF correlations) between the different emotion regulating areas of the brain&#xD;
      rather than in terms of increase or decrease in localized brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Our second aim is to investigate whether lithium works by altering the&#xD;
      connectivity of areas of the brain implicated in the pathophysiology of BD, thereby leading&#xD;
      to changes in the abnormal positive or negative emotional reactions to the environment seen&#xD;
      in mania and depression respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Out third aim is to investigate whether patients with the s/s or s/L alleles&#xD;
      of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism will have greater amygdalar activation and decreased&#xD;
      cortico-amygdala connectivity compared to patients with L/L genotype. We will also&#xD;
      investigate whether lithium treatment differentially affects these fMRI measures in the s/s&#xD;
      or s/L and L/L genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study unmedicated subjects satisfying DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder current&#xD;
      episode depressed or hypomanic/manic or who are euthymic. Subjects will undergo fMRI before&#xD;
      and after 8 weeks of treatment with lithium a mood stabilizer that is known to be effective&#xD;
      in both phases of BD. Healthy subjects will have a scan at baseline and after 8 weeks but&#xD;
      will not be treated with any medication. We will also test for the serotonin transporter gene&#xD;
      (the gene that controls the availability of a chemical called serotonin in the brain), which&#xD;
      has been shown to effect how lithium works.&#xD;
