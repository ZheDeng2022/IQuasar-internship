  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the feasibility of evaluating YSPSL for the amelioration of&#xD;
      ischemia reperfusion injury following liver transplantation by administering YSPSL into the&#xD;
      liver graft directly ex vivo via the portal vein and to the recipient intravenously prior to&#xD;
      reperfusion. Recently, P-selectin expression has been associated in liver grafts with&#xD;
      prolonged cold storage times and rejection. By examining biomarkers of IRI including&#xD;
      P-selectin by immunohistochemistry and/or quantitative PCR, liver histology and hepatic blood&#xD;
      flow using established techniques, the goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      using these modalities for future studies of safety and efficacy.&#xD;

      This will be a single-center, single-dose study. The study will be a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study. Patients who are undergoing cadaveric&#xD;
      orthotopic liver transplantation and are at risk for development of DGF, based upon known&#xD;
      risk factors, will be eligible to participate in the study. 12 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

             allograft;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient's age is &gt;=18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is not a recipient of a multivisceral transplant or simultaneous kidney&#xD;
             transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has not undergone prior organ or cellular transplant of any type;&#xD;

             other factor that indicates a risk for excessive blood loss and therefore a need for&#xD;
             veno-veno bypass +/- autologous recovery during surgery);&#xD;
