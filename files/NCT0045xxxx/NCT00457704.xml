  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which is one of the principal multidrug&#xD;
      resistant organisms found in the hospitals all over the world, has recently emerged in the&#xD;
      community. However, for the moment (2002), the hospital remains the principal reservoir of&#xD;
      MRSA so far and the patients discharged with a MRSA carriage can be the source of MRSA&#xD;
      spreading in the community. In particular patients admitted to home care (HC) from acute care&#xD;
      facilities represent a patient group with a high risk of MRSA carriage and of being the&#xD;
      source of MRSA spreading in the community. The objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether HC patients are effectively a MRSA reservoir and a source for MRSA spreading in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that, from February 2003 to March 2004 any adult patient (except obstetric patient)&#xD;
      (approximately 3360 patients for 16 HC settings), will be screened [nasal and skin lesion (if&#xD;
      any) swabs] for MRSA carriage within the 48 h before his/her transfer. The patients found to&#xD;
      be MRSA carriers will be visited by a physician who will ask patients as well as family&#xD;
      members to participate in the study. Each patient and each family member who will have given&#xD;
      agreement to participate, will be sampled (nasal swab for both patient and family members,&#xD;
      and skin lesion swab for the patients with skin lesions) every month for 12 months by the&#xD;
      nurse of the HC setting in which the patient will have been admitted. As soon as the patient&#xD;
      will be discharged from HC setting and if the 12 month survey is not finished, patient and&#xD;
      family member swab sampling will be performed by the nurse of the research team (NRT) every 3&#xD;
      months until the end of the survey period. These swabs will be transmitted by the NRT to the&#xD;
      research center and analyze by the microbial technician of the research center. The&#xD;
      bacteriological survey will be accompanied with an epidemiological survey in order to&#xD;
      determine the risk factors for a long term MRSA carriage in the patients admitted in HC and&#xD;
      also the risk factors for transmitting MRSA to their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre and multi-investigator study will be performed over a period of 32 months&#xD;
      (1 month to prepare the study, 13 months to screen patients with regard to MRSA carriage&#xD;
      before their transfer from acute care settings into HC settings, 12 months to survey HC&#xD;
      patients and their family members and 6 months to analyze data and prepare publications).&#xD;
      Such a study will provide us with descriptive and quantitative data on MRSA strains&#xD;
      introduced in the community by HC patients. From the analysis of risk factors of MRSA&#xD;
      transmission from these patients to their family members, suggestions to limit this&#xD;
      transmission might be drawn.&#xD;
