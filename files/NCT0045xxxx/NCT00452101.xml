    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Aquamin F alone or in combination&#xD;
      with glucosamine sulfate versus placebo on symptoms of joint pain, stiffness and immobility&#xD;
      in subjects with painful osteoarthritis of the knee. The following hypotheses were tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Hypothesis 1) After 12 weeks of treatment, subjects taking Aquamin F alone or in combination&#xD;
      with glucosamine sulfate will have significantly less joint pain, stiffness and immobility&#xD;
      compared to subjects taking glucosamine sulfate alone or placebo alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Hypothesis 2) No significant differences will be seen for adverse events between the&#xD;
      subjects taking Aquamin F, glucosamine sulfate, Aquamin F + glucosamine sulfate or placebo.&#xD;

      Method: Subjects were randomized to receive 12 weeks of Glucosamine sulfate vs Aquamin F vs&#xD;
      Placebo vs Aquamin F + Glucosamine sulfate while controlling for pain with acetaminophen.&#xD;
      Subjects were then followed for blood chemistry measurements only over an additional 12-week&#xD;
      period specifically to assess blood calcium levels post treatment. All participants were&#xD;
      subjected to the same diet and exercise regimen and measurements included: WOMAC scores&#xD;
      (pain, stiffness, mobility, total score), 6 Minute Walking Distances, active and passive&#xD;
      range of motion measurements, DXA scans, blood chemistry, hematology, CRP levels and lipid&#xD;
      profiles as well as rescue medication diary measurements and adverse event assessments. An&#xD;
      independent statistician analyzed the data using independent t-tests and ANCOVA for&#xD;
      between-group comparisons and matched-pair t-tests for within-group comparisons of patients&#xD;
      included in ITT-LOCF and completer analyses.&#xD;
