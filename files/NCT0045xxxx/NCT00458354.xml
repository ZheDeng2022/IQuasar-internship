      1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Spinal Sealant as an adjunct to sutured dural&#xD;
           repair compared with standard of care methods (control) to obtain watertight dural&#xD;
           closure intraoperatively in patients undergoing spinal surgery.&#xD;

      The CSF provides a liquid cushion for the brain and spinal cord. The dura holds in the CSF.&#xD;
      In order to do spinal surgery, the doctor will cut an opening in the dura. At the end of&#xD;
      surgery, the dura must be sealed in order to keep the CSF from leaking out. The doctor will&#xD;
      close the dura with stitches and also a piece of tissue taken from another place on your&#xD;
      body, to help close the opening. Other standard sealant methods have included the use of&#xD;
      Oxicel, Gelfoam, or fibrin glue, but these methods were not designed for closing the dura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. Your doctor will see you within 30 days before your operation. At this visit, your&#xD;
      medical history will be recorded, and you will be asked questions about any other operations&#xD;
      you have had in the past. You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), height, and&#xD;
      weight. You will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons) collected for kidney and&#xD;
      liver function tests to make sure they are functioning properly. You will also be asked to&#xD;
      fill out 2 questionnaires about your health, daily activities, and back pain. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will take about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups. Participants in one group will receive&#xD;
      the Spinal Sealant. You have a 2 out of 3 chance of being randomly assigned to the spinal&#xD;
      sealant group. Participants in the other group will receive other standard methods such as&#xD;
      the closing of the dura with stitches. However, you will not know which one of the two&#xD;
      treatments you receive. Also, (if needed) a piece of your muscle, fat, or other soft tissue&#xD;
      may be taken from another place on your body to help seal the opening. Doctors may also use&#xD;
      Oxicel, Gelfoam, or fibrin glue to help with the sealing of the dura .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your already scheduled spinal surgery, your doctor will try to close the opening in the&#xD;
      dura, which may be done with stitches alone or, if needed, stitches and a piece of your&#xD;
      muscle, fat, or other soft tissue taken from another place on your body. After this try, if&#xD;
      there is still some CSF leaking from the dura, you will be assigned to one of the 2 groups&#xD;
      for treatment. If you do not have a CSF leak that needs treatment, you will not be able to&#xD;
      take part in this study, and you will not have to come back for any study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the first group will receive treatment with the Spinal Sealant,&#xD;
      which will be sprayed over their stitches to close the opening in their dura. The Spinal&#xD;
      Sealant is made of 2 plastic-type liquids. When mixed together, a gel is formed that is&#xD;
      mostly made up of water. The gel looks and feels sort of like a soft contact lens. After the&#xD;
      doctor tries to seal the opening in the dura, the Spinal Sealant is then sprayed over the&#xD;
      stitches. It acts like a thin, stretchy covering to help stop the CSF from leaking out&#xD;
      through the stitches until the area has properly healed on its own. It is blue-colored, so&#xD;
      that the doctor can see where it has been sprayed. Within 1 to 2 months, the gel is naturally&#xD;
      broken down by the body and is removed through the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the second group will be treated with the doctor's choice of other&#xD;
      standard treatments to close the opening in their dura. You will not know which group you&#xD;
      were assigned to until after the end of your study participation (about 90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are still in the hospital (within 7 days after your operation), you will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, and your doctor will do a clinical test to check for any CSF leaks. Also, you&#xD;
      will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for kidney and liver function&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For follow-up, you will be seen by your doctor at about 30 days and again at about 90 days&#xD;
      after your operation. It will be very important for you to return to see your doctor at your&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visits, even if you are feeling fine. At the follow-up visits, your&#xD;
      doctor will perform a physical exam and check to see how your dura wound is healing and if&#xD;
      there is any CSF leakage. You will have a sample of your blood (about 2 tablespoons)&#xD;
      collected for kidney and liver function tests. You will also be asked to fill out 2&#xD;
      questionnaires about your health, daily activities, and back pain. The questionnaires will&#xD;
      take about 20 to 30 minutes to finish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after your 90-day follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. The Spinal Sealant has been authorized by the FDA for use&#xD;
      in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 158 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Between 15 to 20 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
