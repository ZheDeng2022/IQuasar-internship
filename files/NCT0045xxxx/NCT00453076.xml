      The primary goal is to determine stent patency and overall survival of the conventional&#xD;
      covered self expandable metallic stent versus paclitaxel eluting covered self expandable&#xD;
      metallic stent in unresectable malignant bile duct stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goals are to assess reinterventions, complications, technical difficulties, and&#xD;
      physician graded ease of placement and to assess toxicity of paclitaxel eluting covered self&#xD;
      expandable metallic stent.&#xD;

      1.1 Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement is&#xD;
      a well-established and widely used treatment for patients with unresectable malignant biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. This palliative technique prolongs survival, shortens hospital stay, and&#xD;
      improves quality of life in patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, SEMS have the disadvantage of occlusion over time because of tumor ingrowth&#xD;
      (tumor invasion through the metal wire mesh of the stent) or overgrowth (tumor growing at the&#xD;
      end of the stent), and mucosal hyperplasia as a consequence of chronic irritation. The&#xD;
      occlusion rate of SEMS varies from 10% to 50% of cases of malignant biliary obstruction. 6-9&#xD;
      Duration of SEMS patency is important for patients with a short life-expectancy because&#xD;
      quality of life and cost-effectiveness are mainly determined by stent occlusion. Previous&#xD;
      studies have suggested that covered metallic stents may prevent tumor ingrowth and reduce the&#xD;
      occlusion rate, but tumor overgrowth is still problematic. 11 12 13 Therefore, there is a&#xD;
      dire need for a metallic stent that prevents both tumor ingrowth and overgrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Paclitaxel Paclitaxel is a potent antineoplastic drug extracted from the bark of the&#xD;
      pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) and has been utilized for the therapy for ovarian, breast,&#xD;
      lung, and other cancers. This potent drug exerts its pharmacological effects through a unique&#xD;
      mechanism. Paclitaxel causes formation of numerous decentralized and unorganized microtubules&#xD;
      and enhances the assembly of extraordinarily stable and dysfunctional microtubules. In&#xD;
      addition, it inhibits activation processes like activation of protein kinases or release of&#xD;
      transcription factors. In addition, paclitaxel has several pharmacokinetic characteristics&#xD;
      that make it well suited for locoregional cancer therapy. It has rapid cellular uptake and a&#xD;
      first pass effect because of its extremely lipophilic character and long lasting action over&#xD;
      a broad concentration range. Furthermore, paclitaxel has antiangiogenic and antimetastatic&#xD;
      properties. The efficacy in dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of human&#xD;
      gallbladder epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells makes&#xD;
      paclitaxel a very promising substance for local drug delivery to reduce the proliferative and&#xD;
      migratory components that are involved in tumor growth. This inhibitory effect of paclitaxel&#xD;
      on the cell lines had served as the basis to develop drug-eluting stents for malignant&#xD;
      biliary strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Paclitaxel-eluting covered metallic stent Covering the stent with chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agent, such as paclitaxel, should give protection against tumor ingrowth, overgrowth, or both&#xD;
      resulting in increased patency, longer survival rates and increased remaining quality of&#xD;
      life. There had been only few studies on the effect of a paclitaxel-eluting covered metallic&#xD;
      stent on animal bile duct. In a study on porcine bile duct, the degree of histologic changes,&#xD;
      which included inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous reactions, corresponded to the&#xD;
      amount of paclitaxel incorporated within the stent. The degree of inflammatory change was&#xD;
      more severe in porcine bile duct in contact with the stent with 20% concentration (% wt/v) of&#xD;
      paclitaxel than the stent with 10% concentration. There was no case of transmural necrosis&#xD;
      and perforation. The results of this particular study had served as a basis for further&#xD;
      research. In our preliminary study, no significant complications such as perforation or stent&#xD;
      migration have occurred in either DDS or CS group. Therefore, it can be suggested that this&#xD;
      paclitaxel-eluting SEMS is safe in the normal canine bile duct.&#xD;
