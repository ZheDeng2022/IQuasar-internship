  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major complication of diabetes mellitus is diabetic nephropathy. In previous studies the&#xD;
      investigators could demonstrate that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite&#xD;
      unaltered basal and stimulated nitric oxide (NO) - activity, the renal response to the&#xD;
      antioxidant vitamin C was more pronounced compared to control subjects. These data suggest&#xD;
      that oxidative stress is increased in the renal vasculature of diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, NO-activity in diabetic patients appears to be up regulated to compensate for&#xD;
      increase in oxidative stress. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of increased&#xD;
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in kidney biopsies of diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiotensin receptor blockers have been found to reduce oxidative stress in various vascular&#xD;
      beds. Some drugs of this class, Telmisartan for example, also exhibit partial agonist&#xD;
      properties to the PPARγ receptor and might be of great benefit for patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus or metabolic syndrome due to an additional improvement in insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Despite its effect on oxidative stress angiotensin receptor blockers beneficially alter renal&#xD;
      haemodynamics by reducing intraglomerular pressure and thus protect against glomerular&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging lead to the development of new techniques that&#xD;
      allow a separate measurement of renal medullar and cortical perfusion. This magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging technique might be a useful tool to detect alterations at an early level in&#xD;
      the kidneys of patients at high risk for diabetic nephropathy. In the current study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate the new magnetic resonance imaging technique by measuring&#xD;
      medullar and cortical renal perfusion before and after pharmacological intervention with&#xD;
      telmisartan in patients with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
