    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out how successfully non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients are able to give an immune response to injections of the immunotherapeutic product&#xD;
      GSK1572932A, and to find out more about the safety of this treatment. A course of eight&#xD;
      injections will be administered over 21 weeks; including screening for suitability and all&#xD;
      tests, the duration of the study for a patient will be 30-35 weeks. During this period&#xD;
      various tests will be performed, including physical examinations and blood tests. The&#xD;
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, four-arm, parallel-group study, to be conducted at approximately 20 centers&#xD;
      in Europe and Canada. All patients will receive the same immunotherapeutic treatment with&#xD;
      GSK1572932A, but they will be recruited into four cohorts according to the details of their&#xD;
      disease. Cohort 1: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are due for&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will receive chemo-and&#xD;
      immunotherapy in parallel. Cohort 2: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who&#xD;
      are due for standard chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine. These patients will first&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy and then immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Patients with resected stage IB, II or IIIA tumors who are not due for&#xD;
      chemotherapy. These patients will receive immunotherapy only. Cohort 4: Patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage III tumors, following standard chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These&#xD;
      patients will receive immunotherapy only. Immunotherapeutic treatment will comprise eight&#xD;
      doses of GSK1572932A. Doses will be administered at three-week intervals; in Cohort 1 this&#xD;
      may be adapted to fit in with the patient's chemotherapy. During the study, adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy is allowed in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 for patients in stage III only and is&#xD;
      prohibited in Cohort 4. Chemotherapy during the study is allowed in Cohort 1 only as&#xD;
      described above, and is prohibited in Cohorts 2-4. The total maximum duration of the study&#xD;
      for a patient will be 30-35 weeks.&#xD;
