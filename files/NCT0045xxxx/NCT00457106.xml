      This study compares the efficacy of risperidone to that of paroxetine in the treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks in patients with Panic Disorder and with Major Depressive Disorder with Panic&#xD;
      attacks and compares the side effect profile of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks and compares response rates of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment of panic&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2A/2C and D2&#xD;
      receptors (Chouignard et al, 1993; Marder &amp; Meibach, 1994). In its serotonergic activity,&#xD;
      risperidone resembles both the atypical antidepressant and 5HT2-antagonist nefazodone (Bakish&#xD;
      et al, 1993) and a 5HT2-antagonist ritanserine (Lima &amp; Moncrieff, 2000; Preskorn 1995).&#xD;
      Nefazodone treats anxiety symptoms and induces less agitation than other reuptake blockers&#xD;
      (Fawcett et al, 1995) while ritanserin shows effectiveness in treatment of dysthymia in&#xD;
      clinical trials. Moreover, risperidone increases release of dopamine and norepinephrine in&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex (Zhang et al, 2000), an activity that in other pharmacological agents&#xD;
      is associated with their antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antipanic properties (Thase, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, risperidone has a potential to be effective for treatment of either Generalized&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder, or Panic Disorder, or Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Attacks (DSM-IV,&#xD;
      1994) as a single agent. Moreover, due to its D2 and 5-HT2A/2C antagonism and proven&#xD;
      antipsychotic efficacy, the drug could be uniquely effective for severe panic attacks with&#xD;
      psychotic features or para-psychotic features (Galynker et al, 1996). Consistent with this&#xD;
      supposition, Marder et al (1997) reported that in patients with schizophrenia, risperidone&#xD;
      produced significantly greater improvements than haloperidol in PANSS scores measuring&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical experience with over 50 patients with panic attacks showed that low dose&#xD;
      risperidone, similar to lorazepam, reduced or eliminated anxiety and panic, often after the&#xD;
      first dose. Risperidone was most effective for patients experiencing obsessive, intrusive,&#xD;
      anxiety-inducing thoughts. In contrast to lorazepam, risperidone treatment did not result in&#xD;
      building of tolerance to the drug or disinhibition. We did not observe extrapyramidal side&#xD;
      effects in patients treated with risperidone for panic attacks. Thus, our preliminary&#xD;
      clinical data indicate that due to its efficacy, quick onset of action, absence of addictive&#xD;
      potential, and lack of side effects, risperidone could be superior to both benzodiazepines&#xD;
      and SSRIs for treatment of panic attacks, particularly for severe panic attacks. Moreover,&#xD;
      risperidone has a potential to be the first line drug for treatment of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, at present, a clinical study of risperidone for treatment of panic attacks is&#xD;
      indicated and is of great potential value. We propose an exploratory, open-label,&#xD;
      single-blind trial of risperidone vs. paroxetine for treatment of panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective One: To compare the efficacy of risperidone to that of paroxetine in treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks in patients with Panic Disorder and with Major Depressive Disorder with Panic&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hypothesis One: Risperidone and will be more efficacious in treatment of panic symptoms in&#xD;
      both patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Two: To compare the side effect profile of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment&#xD;
      of panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis Two: Risperidone, compared to paroxetine, will cause less sexual side&#xD;
           effects, anxiety, and restlessness. There will be no difference in extrapyramidal side&#xD;
           effects between the paroxetine and the risperidone groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Three: To compare response rates of risperidone vs. paroxetine in treatment of&#xD;
      panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis Three: Patients with panic attacks will respond significantly faster to&#xD;
           risperidone than to paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Four: To examine demographic and clinical predictors of robust response to&#xD;
      risperidone treatment using appropriate statistical analyses of individual scales items and&#xD;
      treatment response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis Four: The subgroup of participants who have high scores on items reflecting&#xD;
           somatic anxiety, and ruminative-intrusive thinking, and those with nocturnal panic&#xD;
           attacks will show better response to risperidone therapy than patients with low scores&#xD;
           on those items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study hypotheses are confirmed, future research could include a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      fixed-dose study of risperidone as the sole agent for treatment of panic disorder and Phase&#xD;
      IV trials aimed at determining the effectiveness of 0.125 mg and 0.0675 mg doses of&#xD;
      risperidone for the treatment of anxiety and panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will consist of psychiatric outpatients who meet criteria for the&#xD;
      DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Attacks or Panic Disorder. The&#xD;
      subjects will be primarily recruited from the Psychiatric Outpatient Services for Adults&#xD;
      clinic (POSA) located at Beth Israel Medical center that provides care to approximately 900&#xD;
      patients per year. At present, the patient ethnic and racial mix at POSA is 50% Hispanic, 15%&#xD;
      African American, 32.5% Caucasian and 2.5% Asian. The gender distribution is approximately&#xD;
      33% male and 67 % female. The outpatient payer mix is 20 % Medicare, 74 % Medicaid and 6%&#xD;
      combined. Of those patients, approximately 40% (360) manifest panic attacks. In addition,&#xD;
      patients will be recruited from the Emergency Department and from inpatient psychiatric units&#xD;
      at Beth Israel Medical Center and from newspaper advertisements. Based on our previous&#xD;
      experience with recruitment for research studies, we expect that 10-12% of patients (36-42)&#xD;
      who meet diagnostic criteria will also meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, will sign&#xD;
      informed consent and will participate in the study. We expect to recruit 40 patients per year&#xD;
      and to complete the study in 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Males and females, ages 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ability to sign an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder, or MDD with Panic attacks, single episode, recurrent, or&#xD;
           chronic&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HAM-A score &gt;17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alcohol or substance abuse within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Bipolar Mood Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of antipsychotic medications over the two months preceding enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in antidepressant or mood stabilizer dosing over the two months preceding&#xD;
           enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Previous adverse reaction to risperidone or paroxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Drug Regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an 8-week parallel comparison (with a blinded rater) of risperidone and&#xD;
      paroxetine for treatment of three groups of patients with panic attacks. Each group will&#xD;
      consist of 30 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent, the subjects will be randomly assigned in an open manner&#xD;
      to treatment with risperidone or paroxetine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Treatment with risperidone will be flexible-dose and will be initiated at 0.25 mg po&#xD;
      qhs. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic symptoms, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 0.5 mg po qhs on day 3. For subjects who experienced morning sedation, the dose&#xD;
      will be decreased to 0.125-mg po qhs on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Treatment with paroxetine will be flexible-dose and will be initiated at 10-mg po qhs.&#xD;
      For subjects who experienced morning sedation, the dose will be decreased to 5-mg po qhs on&#xD;
      day 3. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic symptoms, the dose will be&#xD;
      increased to 20-mg po qhs. For the subjects who did not achieve a remission of panic&#xD;
      symptoms, the dose will be increased to 40-mg po qhs as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Treatment with paroxetine on a fixed dose schedule will be initiated at 10 mg po qhs&#xD;
      on day 1. On day 3 it will be increased to 20 mg po qhs. On day 7 it will be increased to 30&#xD;
      mg po qhs. Most patients respond to an average therapeutic dose of 30 mg of paroxetine. Many&#xD;
      patients in Arm 2, since it was flexible-dose, never achieved a therapeutic dosage, which&#xD;
      could potentially create a bias in the comparison. The third arm was added to ensure that a&#xD;
      subgroup of study participants would receive an optimum therapeutic dose of paroxetine, to&#xD;
      allow for an unbiased comparison between the two study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized on any of the above arms, and not responding or having side effects will&#xD;
      be taken off the study and referred for regular psychiatric treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receiving fixed dose antidepressants or mood stabilizers prior to their enrollment&#xD;
      in the study will be continued on these medications throughout the study. No dose adjustment&#xD;
      of antidepressants or mood stabilizers will be allowed. At the end of study, participants can&#xD;
      choose to continue their study medications under the care of one of study physicians or one&#xD;
      of the other psychiatrists at POSA. Those wishing to stop study medications at the end of the&#xD;
      study will be able to do so under the supervision of one of the study physicians. Paroxetine&#xD;
      will be tapered over a two-week period to avoid SSRI withdrawal. Risperidone will be stopped&#xD;
      abruptly since no withdrawal symptoms have been reported in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to evaluate mood and severity of panic attacks will be performed by a rater&#xD;
      blinded to medication status on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants' will receive psychiatric treatment, free of charge, for at least one&#xD;
      month following the end of the study. At the end of that period, participants will be&#xD;
      assisted in finding further psychiatric care. Subjects will receive $10 (paid in cash) as&#xD;
      reimbursement for travel expenses for each assessment that they attend. Subjects will have to&#xD;
      sign a receipt of reimbursement in order to receive the cash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients (r) will be calculated for each of the&#xD;
      treatment outcome variable groups. This will enable determination of the degree of&#xD;
      association between treatment and outcome. More importantly, (r) can be interpreted with the&#xD;
      Binomial Effect Size Display (BESD) (Rosenthal, 1991). The BESD will enable estimation of a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful improvement rate and the number of people that would improve as a&#xD;
      result of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis and Precision Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the measure of effect size will be the Pearson Product Moment correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (r). For this study, the effect size of r = .50 was chosen as the smallest effect&#xD;
      size that would be clinically meaningful, and a sample size of 26 was calculated as necessary&#xD;
      to obtain power of 81% and a 95% confidence interval (r = .13 to r = .75) that would not&#xD;
      include zero (Rosenthal, 1991).&#xD;
