  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide long-term follow-up care of patients previously enrolled in a&#xD;
      vaccine study that involved poxviral vectors. Vectors are sequences of genetic material that&#xD;
      can be used to introduce specific genes into genetic makeup. The study does not involve the&#xD;
      use of any drug or biologic agent. Participants will undergo an annual health history.&#xD;
      Because certain viruses enter into cells and create proteins from the viral genes, the type&#xD;
      of vaccine treatment used is referred to gene therapy. The genes expressed by poxviral&#xD;
      vectors do not become part of the genetic material left behind. Because gene therapy is a&#xD;
      somewhat new technology, a prolonged monitoring of patients' health status is necessary,&#xD;
      according to new specific reporting requirements for harmful events in patients who undergo&#xD;
      such gene therapy studies. The risk of any long-term negative effects from the gene therapy&#xD;
      that patients had received is quite small. Still, it is important that there be updates at&#xD;
      least annually. This annual monitoring of health status will extend for 15 years, according&#xD;
      to guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, or for as long as patients are willing&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who received poxviral vectors (vaccinia or fowlpox, or both) at the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute, through a trial affiliated with the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology,&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in the following forms of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual medical history and physical examinations for the first 5 years following the&#xD;
           last vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annual telephone contact during the last 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health status check, including primary cancer status, secondary malignancies, neurologic&#xD;
           disorders, autoimmune disorders, and hematologic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for the presence of HIV antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reporting of medical problems, including information on unexpected hospitalizations and&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has died, the study will document the cause of death and autopsy information&#xD;
      if available.&#xD;

      This protocol aims to provide long-term follow-up and continued use of research specimens of&#xD;
      participants previously enrolled on gene transfer or other immunotherapy studies at the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute as well as follow-up of subjects at extramural sites receiving&#xD;
      these agents as part of a multi-site trial. Subjects will undergo an annual health history&#xD;
      for up to 15 years.&#xD;
