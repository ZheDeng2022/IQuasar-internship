    <textblock>
      On February 2004, a law (n. 40/2004) regulating assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) was&#xD;
      approved in Italy. This law aimed to regulate the treatment of infertility in Italy, contains&#xD;
      several restrictions, such as the prohibition to fertilize more than three oocytes and the&#xD;
      obligation to transfer simultaneously all embryos obtained. Several evidences showed that the&#xD;
      outcome of the in-vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques is strongly correlated with quality of&#xD;
      transferred embryos (choosing the right embryos). Furthermore, this prerequisite is actually&#xD;
      illegal in Italy, and an optimal oocyte selection can be considered as the only one crucial&#xD;
      factor in the determining the outcome of the IVF cycle (choosing the right oocytes).&#xD;
      Experimental data have demonstrated that perifollicular blood flow assessment is a good&#xD;
      marker of oocyte competence, embryo viability, implantation potential, and subsequent&#xD;
      pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate in a clinical setting whether the assessment of&#xD;
      the perifollicular vascularity is a feasible and useful procedure for the selection of&#xD;
      oocytes with the best developmental potential in IVF programs when only a limited number of&#xD;
      oocytes can be fertilized.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One hundred fourteen women with tubal factor or unexplained infertility undergoing IVF&#xD;
      programs in our department will be enrolled in a wild protocol. Successively, the enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two different sub-protocols evaluating the role of the&#xD;
      perifollicular vascularity in good- and poor-prognosis patients. The diagnosis will be&#xD;
      established by hysterosalpingography and/or laparoscopic dye test and with partner's semen&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be randomly allocated in two independent groups (experimental and control&#xD;
      groups) using a computer-software, and the random allocation sequence will be concealed in&#xD;
      closed and dark envelope until the interventions will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental group alone, a power Doppler assessment of perifollicular vascularity&#xD;
      will be performed the day of oocyte retrieval (36 h after hCG injection). The vascularity of&#xD;
      each ovulatory follicle will be successively studied using an advanced image analysis&#xD;
      software and its extension will be graded using a well validated grading system. The&#xD;
      periovulatory follicles will be categorized in high-grade (grades 3-4) and low-grade (grades&#xD;
      1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patient' sedation with IV propofol, oocytes will be retrieved using a 17 G double-lumen&#xD;
      aspiration needle with a low pressure and individually cultured marking the test-tube and,&#xD;
      successively, the culture plate with a code corresponding to perifollicular vascularity&#xD;
      degree. The retrieved oocytes will be washed and the mature oocytes, determined by the&#xD;
      presence of a first polar body (metaphase II; MII oocytes), will be classified by an&#xD;
      experienced biologist initially blinded to previous perifollicular vascularization. In&#xD;
      particular, MII oocytes will be graded into three groups according to the number of&#xD;
      anomalies: grade I, oocytes without any anomaly; grade II, oocytes with one anomaly; and&#xD;
      grade III, oocytes with at least two anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three oocytes with the highest grade will be considered &quot;the best&quot; oocytes to fertilize&#xD;
      in the control group, whereas in the experimental group they will be selected integrating&#xD;
      morphological and ultrasonographic criteria. In particular, the embryologist will use the&#xD;
      ultrasonographic criteria to choice within oocytes with similar morphologic degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, three MII oocytes will be inseminated at 4 h after recovery with 10000-20000&#xD;
      motile sperm and placed in the CO2 incubator at a temperature of 37°C in 5% CO2 in air, and&#xD;
      the fertilization will be evaluated 18 h later and confirmed by the presence of two pronuclei&#xD;
      and two polar bodies. The fertilized oocytes will be classified with a well standardized&#xD;
      scoring system for zygotes and cultured for a total of 48 h from oocytes IVF. Before&#xD;
      transfer, the cleavage embryos will be again graded according to the embryo morphology and&#xD;
      the relative proportion of anucleate fragments present in the zona pellucida.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All embryos, with exclusion of those arrested (not cleaved after 24 h from IVF), will be&#xD;
      replaced in each patient without ultrasonographic guidance using ultrasoft Frydman catheter.&#xD;
      The luteal phase will be supported by 100 mg natural progesterone daily administrated. A&#xD;
      serum β-hCG assessment will be performed on 15th day after embryos transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cycle, the serum estradiol levels and the number of dominant follicles on the day of&#xD;
      hCG administration, the duration of ovarian stimulation, and the units of r-FSH administered&#xD;
      will be recorded. The concordance between the ultrasonographic grading score and the oocyte&#xD;
      degree will be also evaluated in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancelled cycles (cases of absence of follicular response after 35 days of treatment or a&#xD;
      serum E2 value &gt;2500 pg/ml), fertilization (percentage of fertilized oocytes / total&#xD;
      oocytes), implantation (percentage of intra-uterine gestational sacs / total transferred&#xD;
      embryos), clinical (percentage of rising β-hCG with sonographic evidence of intrauterine&#xD;
      gestational sac and fetal cardiac activity at 7 weeks of pregnancy / total non-cancelled&#xD;
      cycles) and ongoing (percentage of vital pregnancies confirmed by ultrasonography at 12 weeks&#xD;
      of gestational age / total non-cancelled cycles) pregnancies rates will be evaluated in each&#xD;
      patients. The number of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndromes (OHSS)&#xD;
      will be also recorded in both groups.&#xD;
