      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinflunine and capecitabine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vinflunine together with&#xD;
      capecitabine works in treating patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the tumor response rate in patients with previously treated metastatic breast&#xD;
           cancer treated with vinflunine and capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vinflunine IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on&#xD;
      days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every other course, and at the completion of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
