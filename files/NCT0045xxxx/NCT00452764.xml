    <textblock>
      Lymphoid follicles, consisting of T-and B cells, are involved in the chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      response in COPD. Foxp3 positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) are present in these follicles&#xD;
      and may be involved in the suppression of this chronic inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that a dysfunction of Tregs underlies the development of the inflammatory&#xD;
      response in COPD. This could be either due to a decreased presence of Tregs in COPD, or to an&#xD;
      altered function of Tregs possibly caused by a decreased HO-1 expression and/or an altered&#xD;
      TGFβ regulation.&#xD;

      COPD is a leading cause of death worldwide and its morbidity and mortality are still&#xD;
      rising.So far, no effective treatment is available To find better treatment methods more&#xD;
      insight is needed in the nature/origin of the chronic inflammation that underlies the&#xD;
      development of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The important role of neutrophils, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells is well established in&#xD;
      this respect, yet the role of CD4 T cells and B cells has only recently (re)attracted&#xD;
      attention. We detected the presence of lymphoid follicles in lung tissue of COPD patients,&#xD;
      consisting of B cells surrounded by T cells. Recently, we have found the presence of Foxp3&#xD;
      positive T cells as a component of these lymphoid follicles in COPD. Since Foxp3 is a&#xD;
      distinctive marker of regulatory T cells (Tregs), this finding suggests that Tregs are&#xD;
      involved in the inflammatory response in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tregs are important in controlling immunological tolerance and preventing auto-immune&#xD;
      responses by inhibiting T-cell responses. Dysfunction of Tregs can lead to auto-immune&#xD;
      diseases, allergy and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, nothing is known so far about&#xD;
      their contribution to the chronic inflammatory response in COPD. Recent studies show that,&#xD;
      next to direct inhibition by cell-cell contact, the inhibitory effects of Tregs are mediated&#xD;
      by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and membrane bound TGFβ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that a dysfunction of regulatory T cells underlies the development of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response in COPD. This could be due to a decreased presence of Tregs in COPD, or&#xD;
      to an altered function of Tregs. The latter may be due to a decreased HO-1 expression, as we&#xD;
      have shown in macrophages of COPD patients compared to those in healthy controls, and/or an&#xD;
      altered TGFβ regulation, a cytokine that plays a prime role in COPD.&#xD;
