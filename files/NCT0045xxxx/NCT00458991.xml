      The purpose of the study is to understand the effect of rhGH therapy on hepatic drug&#xD;
      metabolism in children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency is a prominent cause of short stature, affecting approximately&#xD;
      14,000 children in the US. Although a single study has demonstrated reduces CYP1A2 activity&#xD;
      following Gh replacement therapy, the effect of GH on the most abundant phase 1&#xD;
      biotransformation pathways (e.g. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) remain largely uncharacterized. This&#xD;
      information gap exists largely due to the lack of sufficiently safe, specific and&#xD;
      non-invasive methods appropriate for the longitudinal evaluation of enzyme activity in young&#xD;
      children. We can overcome these problems by employing validated phenotyping methods using&#xD;
      caffeine, a commonly ingested dietary substance and dextromethorphan, a safe, non-sedating&#xD;
      over the counter anti-tussive agent. Application of these methods will permit us to identify,&#xD;
      characterize and describe the isoform-specific effects of rhGH on major phase 1 hepatic drug&#xD;
      biotransformation pathways, thereby addressing this information gap with minimal risk to&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects received standard medical therapy with rhGH and at specified times low doses of the pharmacologic &quot;probes&quot; (e.g., caffeine and dextromethorphan) as surrogate markers to determine CYP450 activity. The only direct treatment effect measured was the biological response to rhGH.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Children recently diagnosed with idiopathic GH deficiency who were candidates for rhGH&#xD;
        therapy were eligible for enrollment. All subjects were recruited via informed parental&#xD;
        consent and patient assent (for children &gt; 7 years). The anticipated sample size was 12&#xD;
        children.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children ages 4 to 14 years with a height less than the 5th percentile for age and sex&#xD;
             or having a decelerated across two major percentiles (5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 90th, and&#xD;
             95th) on standard pediatric growth curves, poor growth velocity (less than 5&#xD;
             centimeters/year), radiographic evidence of delayed bone age (i.e. greater than 1 SD&#xD;
             below the mean for chronological age) and a documented diagnosis of idiopathic growth&#xD;
             hormone deficiency [as determined by failure to raise serum GH concentrations 10&#xD;
             microgram/Liter following provocative testing with two growth hormone&#xD;
             secretagogues(e.g. insulin, arginine, or clonidine)].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will be prepubertal, as determined by Tanner staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children receiving medications known to induce or inhibit hepatic CYP1A2, NAT-2, XO,&#xD;
             CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of smoking (including exposure to second hand smoke &gt; 8 hours&#xD;
             per day) or illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hepatic, renal, cardiac or thyroid disorders. Presence of&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, cardiac or thyroid disease will be established based on clinical&#xD;
             history and results of recent laboratory tests conducted as part of the routine&#xD;
             medical evaluation of children who are being considered for rhGH therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children experiencing fever or acute viral illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to dextromethorphan or&#xD;
             caffeine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have received prior treatment with rhGH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who are receiving corticosteroids or thyroid hormone&#xD;
