    <textblock>
      Most of the patients suffering from renal colic have a distal ureterolithiasis. It had been&#xD;
      demonstrated that α adrenoreceptors antagonists, given to patients suffering from renal&#xD;
      colic, due to distal ureterolithiasis, had increased the frequency of stone expulsion rate ,&#xD;
      reduced the time to expulsion and reduced analgesics consumption.Most of the studies&#xD;
      evaluated the efficacy of Tamsulosin, which is a selective α 1A and α 1D adrenoreceptors&#xD;
      antagonist.(The lower intramural portion of the ureter, where it passes through the detrusor&#xD;
      muscle contains mostly α 1D and α 1A adrenergic receptors)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study these days describes the use of Alfuzosin, which is an α adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      blocker and not selective for any α 1 adrenergic receptor, for expulsion of distal ureteric&#xD;
      stones.Alfuzosin is a drug with a proven efficacy and considered uroselective with high&#xD;
      specificity and sensitivity, for the treatment of BPH. There was no significant difference in&#xD;
      efficacy between the two α blockers (Alfuzosin vs. Tamsulosin) concerning symptoms relief or&#xD;
      flow improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare patient who would receive the standard treatment&#xD;
      for distal ureterolithiasis (analgesics, Rowatinex) to patients who would receive also a non&#xD;
      selective α blocker (Alfuzosin) or a selective α blocker (Tamsulosin). This in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of treatment with α blockers for expulsion of distal ureterolithiasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of alpha-blockers for expulsion of distal ureteral stones&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urolithiasis is estimated among 8%-15% of the population in Europe and North America.1-5&#xD;
      Patient who suffer from renal colic represent a very common reason for visiting the emergency&#xD;
      room or for hospitalization. The stones are usually located in the ureter, mostly in its&#xD;
      lower third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the distal ureteral stone would pass spontaneously, depending on a few factors such&#xD;
      as the stone's size, location, shape, smooth muscle spasm, submucosal edema and anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since renal colic is one of the most painful conditions, the time until expulsion of the&#xD;
      stone should be reduced as much as possible. In case the stone obstructs and does'nt pass,&#xD;
      damage to the kidney might occur, and surgical intervention should be considered. However,&#xD;
      surgery and anesthesia are not risk free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local reaction to obstructing ureterolithiasis manifests in ureteric smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction, edema, inflammation and pain. The ureter contains α -adrenergic receptors in the&#xD;
      smooth muscle layer, along it's entire length. Since these receptors play an important role&#xD;
      in ureteric contraction during renal colic, several studies were performed in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of α receptors blockade. These studies had demonstrated that different α&#xD;
      blockers had increased the frequency of stone expulsion rate among patients with renal colic,&#xD;
      reduced the time to expulsion and reduced analgesics consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies evaluated the efficacy of Tamsulosin, which is a selective α 1A and α 1D&#xD;
      adrenoreceptors antagonist. The lower intramural portion of the ureter, where it passes&#xD;
      through the detrusor muscle contains mostly α 1D and α 1A adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common treatment these days to obstructive uropathy due to benign prostatic hypertrophy&#xD;
      (BPH) is Alfuzosin. Despite the fact that it is an α adrenergic receptor blocker and not&#xD;
      selective for any α 1 adrenergic receptor subtypes, it is a drug with a proven efficacy and&#xD;
      considered uroselective with high specificity and sensitivity, for the treatment of BPH.&#xD;
      There was no significant difference in efficacy between the two α blockers (Alfuzosin vs.&#xD;
      Tamsulosin) concerning symptoms relief or flow improvement, and side effects were similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study these days describes the use of Alfuzosin for expulsion of distal ureteric&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare patient who would receive the standard treatment&#xD;
      for distal ureterolithiasis (analgesics, Rowatinex) to patients who would receive also a non&#xD;
      selective α blocker (Alfuzosin) or a selective α blocker (Tamsulosin). This in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of treatment with α blockers for expulsion of distal ureterolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - Individuals who will be referred to the emergency room or be admitted to the&#xD;
      urology department in Soroka hospital, (Beer-Sheva, Israel) because of acute renal colic. The&#xD;
      patient would be considered for the study only if the stone would be located in the distal&#xD;
      ureter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is estimated to include 120 patients and last 6 months. The patients would be&#xD;
      divided randomly to three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patients with renal colic that would receive Abitren and Rowatinex B. Same therapy plus&#xD;
      Tamsulosin (0.4 mg/daily) C. Same therapy as A plus Alfuzosin (10 mg/daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment would last up to 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial would be until expulsion of the stone, but not longer than 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients who would not pass the stone spontaneously, would be referred to intervention (ESWL,&#xD;
      ureteric stent insertion, ureteroscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment discontinuation would be due to hospitalization (intractable pain, fever, the need&#xD;
      for an intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The α blockers treatment would be once daily, until stone expulsion, or up to four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment protocol would be the standard treatment - I.V fluids and analgesics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient would be initially evaluated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abdominal radiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum creatinine and leukocytes measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  renal ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure measurements would be taken by the family physician, two days and one week&#xD;
      after the beginning of the treatment. Four weeks after the treatment begins, each patient&#xD;
      would be checked in the out patient clinic. Unenhanced CT scan, serum creatinine and blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement would be taken. In case the patient would not pass the stone,&#xD;
      intervention would be scheduled.&#xD;
