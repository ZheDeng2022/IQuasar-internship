&#xD;
          -  Outpatients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treatment with venlafaxine (immediate release [IR] or extended release [ER]) within 90&#xD;
             days of study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to venlafaxine (IR or ER).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant risk of suicide based on clinical judgment, including common suicidal&#xD;
