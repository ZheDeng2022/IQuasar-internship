      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Batracylin advanced through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug development&#xD;
           pipeline until its evaluation at Stage 3 on July 1989, It was then proposed for a phase&#xD;
           I investigation based on its activity against as TOPO II inhibitor in s.c. mouse colon&#xD;
           38, PANC03, COLO9, and cisplatin- and doxorubicin-resistant P388 tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IND-directed oral toxicology studies indicated interspecies variation in toxicity. Rats&#xD;
           were found to be highly sensitive to batracylin. Ames et al showed that the interspecies&#xD;
           variation in toxicity was consistent with the pattern of metabolism of the compound by&#xD;
           N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to the acetylated form, N-Ac-batracylin, (a highly toxic&#xD;
           molecule)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that batracylin can be administered safely in slow acetylator NAT2&#xD;
           genotype patients and can be rapidly evaluated for its potential as a tumor-suppressing&#xD;
           agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and toxicity profile&#xD;
           associated with the oral administration of batracylin daily x7 consecutive days,&#xD;
           repeated every 28 days in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the pharmacokinetics of oral batracylin administered daily x7 consecutive days&#xD;
           every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of batracylin in patients with solid&#xD;
           tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate polymorphisms in slow acetylators NAT2 genotypes (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7, and&#xD;
           NAT2 14) with pharmacokinetics results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the inter-subject variability and toxicity ratio, (N-Ac-Batra) / (batracylin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of batracylin treatment on gamma-H2AX levels in tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7, or&#xD;
           NAT2 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with advanced, histologically confirmed malignancies refractory to standard&#xD;
           therapy, or those for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients should have adequate liver, renal, and bone marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In accordance with the accelerated titration design 4B[3], dose levels will initially be&#xD;
           increased at 100% increments, and one new patient per dose level will be treated&#xD;
           according to a 4-week course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accelerated phase ends when one patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
           during the first course of treatment, or when two different patients experience grade 2,&#xD;
           batracylin-related toxicity during the first course of treatment, or when the&#xD;
           N-acetyl-batra AUC value reach 0.33 uM-Hour (i.e., the lower end of the range in the&#xD;
           rat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the first instance of grade 2 batracylin-related toxicity is observed, two&#xD;
           additional patients must have been treated at that dose, or a higher dose (during any&#xD;
           course), without experiencing moderate (grade 2) or worse (grade 3) toxicity, in order&#xD;
           for the accelerated phase to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the accelerated phase ends, the dose-escalation will revert to a more conservative,&#xD;
           modified Fibonacci scheme with 40% dose-step increments, with at least 3 patients&#xD;
           treated per dose level.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the NIH pathology department) solid&#xD;
             tumor malignancy or lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard&#xD;
             curative measures do not exist, or are associated with minimal patient survival&#xD;
             benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy or biologic therapy greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C,&#xD;
             or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior&#xD;
             administration of study drug in a exploratory IND/Phase Zero study. Patients must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major surgery. Patients&#xD;
             must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.&#xD;
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen&#xD;
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to&#xD;
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 normal institutional limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with&#xD;
             creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             We will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The effects of batracylin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the&#xD;
             study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order&#xD;
             to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with batracylin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with batracylin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7,&#xD;
             or NAT2 14. Theoretically slow acetylators will have lower Ac-BAT concentrations. A&#xD;
             number of different polymorphisms in the NAT2 give rise to amino acid substitutions,&#xD;
             and these have been demonstrated to result in absence of catalytic activity in vitro&#xD;
             (http://www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html). Screening for the four&#xD;
             variant alleles (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7 and NAT2 14) results in the detection of the&#xD;
             vast majority of Caucasian slow acetylators, though additional alleles are also common&#xD;
             in other ethnic groups. The precise percentage of slow acetylators also varies with&#xD;
             ethnic origin, ranging from 90% in North Africans to less than 10% in many Asian&#xD;
             populations, with a frequency of 50% in Caucasians. The incidence of fast acetylators&#xD;
             (potentially with increased toxicity) is as follow: 50% among Caucasians, 50% among&#xD;
             Africans, 90% among Japanese, and 20% among Egyptians. We plan to select the slow&#xD;
             acetylators NAT2 subjects and determine the batracylin MTD in this population. The&#xD;
             screening will occur prior to the study start and before patients sign the informed&#xD;
             consent form. Cogenics will be performing the NAT2 analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the&#xD;
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 6 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without&#xD;
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion&#xD;
             of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in&#xD;
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune&#xD;
             deficiencies or confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Women and Minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both men and women, and members of all races and ethnic groups, are eligible for this&#xD;
        trial.&#xD;
