    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a frequent problem in general practice and one of the most common reasons&#xD;
      for referral to a respiratory clinic. Prospective studies have shown that the vast majority&#xD;
      of cases of chronic cough are due to one or more of three conditions: rhinitis/postnasal drip&#xD;
      syndrome, asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Other significant causes of chronic&#xD;
      cough include postviral (post-infectious) cough, and eosinophilic bronchitis. In only a&#xD;
      minority of the patients with a chronic cough no cause can be found. This is called&#xD;
      idiopathic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and treatment of patients with chronic cough often proved to be difficult and&#xD;
      disappointing. Nevertheless, centers in which a comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      protocol was implemented reported excellent results. Therefore the first cough clinic is&#xD;
      started in The Isala Klinieken, Zwolle/The Netherlands in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic cough is often accompanied by the more typical symptoms of dyspnoea and wheezing.&#xD;
      In a subgroup of asthmatics, however, cough is the sole or predominant symptom. This&#xD;
      condition is termed cough-variant asthma (CVA). Cough due to CVA usually improves within the&#xD;
      first week of inhaled bronchodilator therapy, however, complete resolution of cough may&#xD;
      require up to 8 weeks of combination therapy with inhaled bronchodilators and&#xD;
      corticosteroids. A subgroup of CVA patients with severe, refractory cough may require&#xD;
      systemic (oral) steroids, alone or followed by inhaled therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukotrienes are contributing significantly to the pathobiology of asthma. These 'pathways of&#xD;
      asthma' could be suppressed by leukotriene inhibitors. Multiple clinical trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability of the leukotriene modifiers to improve symptoms, pulmonary function&#xD;
      and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in chronic asthma, as well as in exercise-induced and&#xD;
      aspirin-induced asthma. Until recently, the antitussive effects of this drug class had not&#xD;
      been investigated properly. Spector and Tan concluded in a pilot trial with only 14 patients&#xD;
      that 10 mg montelukast seems to be effective in CVA. However, nowadays in care of asthma,&#xD;
      montelukast is widely used in a dosage of 10 mg. Therefore we intend to study the effects of&#xD;
      montelukast on chronic cough (VAS-cough-score) on a wider patient population; is montelukast&#xD;
      superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with chronic cough and a demonstrated&#xD;
      bronchial hyperreactivity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to determine whether montelukast during 6 weeks has superior antitussive&#xD;
      effects (measured with the VAS cough) compared with placebo in patients with cough lasting &gt;&#xD;
      8 weeks and enhanced bronchial hyperreactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast trial: prospective single-centre, double blind randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the montelukast study 84 patients between 18 and 90 years old, referred to the cough&#xD;
      outpatient clinic with chronic cough and enhanced bronchial hyperreactivity will be recruited&#xD;
      after informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised (for gender, age, smoking, duration of symptoms and the use of&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids) to 6- week treatment with 10 mg daily montelukast or placebo. Before&#xD;
      randomisation all patients have to fill in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for detection of&#xD;
      the degree of cough in the last 24 hours and the dutch version of the Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionnaire (LCQ) for the detection of illness specific quality of life. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be noted in this period. Finally, both groups will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids may be continued during the study at a constant dose. Nasal,&#xD;
      ophthalmologic and dermatological steroids are allowed according to individual needs, but&#xD;
      their dose should be kept constant throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1 blockers, nasal anticholinergics as well as nasal or ophthalmologic preparations of&#xD;
      nedocromil or cromoglycate are permitted for treatment of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 90 years old, referred to the cough outpatient clinic with chronic&#xD;
      cough and enhanced bronchial hyperreactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 16 and 90 years old, referred to the cough outpatient clinic with chronic&#xD;
      cough and enhanced bronchial hyperreactivity will receive daily montelukast 10 mg or placebo&#xD;
      during 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Difference in cough VAS scores; montelukast vs placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difference in average score on the Leicester Cough Questionaire (LCQ) between the two&#xD;
           treatment groups; montelukast vs placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the adverse events of montelukast vs placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised by a computer minimisation program for the following factors:&#xD;
      gender, age, smoking, duration of symptoms and the use of inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. The mean change in the primary&#xD;
      endpoint (LCQ total and domain scores) after 6 weeks between the groups will be analysed&#xD;
      using an unpaired t-test. This test will also be used to analyse differences after 6 weeks in&#xD;
      secondary endpoints (VAS cough score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both the primary and secondary endpoints in the study will be measured more than two&#xD;
      times (repeatedly measured) the course of these scores over time will be tested using&#xD;
      MANOVA-analysis. To test for differences in proportions (proportion of patients with adverse&#xD;
      events) the Chi2 -test will be used. Data analyses will be performed using SPSS version 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden, risks and advantages associated with participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects have been reported in 10 % of the cases; mostly of headache and abdominal pain.&#xD;
      Also gastrointestinal problems, allergic reactions, psychiatric disorders, liver, and&#xD;
      haematological disorders could occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions: Montelukast is metabolised by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducing&#xD;
      medication like fenytoïne, phenobarbital, or rifampicin must be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication metabolised by CYP2C8 must also be avoided, because in vitro studies have shown&#xD;
      that montelukast is an powerful CYP2C8 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: superior resolution of cough compared to placebo.&#xD;
