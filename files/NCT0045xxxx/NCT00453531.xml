  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a model system that can be used to test medications for improving the&#xD;
      ability of blood vessels to resist damage from diseases such as heart attack and stroke. The&#xD;
      endothelium (inner layer of blood vessels) has built-in defense mechanisms to prevent&#xD;
      blockage of blood flow, including the ability to stretch the vessel when it senses that blood&#xD;
      flow is threatened. People with heart attack risk factors, such as high cholesterol, smoking&#xD;
      and diabetes lose this ability. This study will develop a model that can measure the response&#xD;
      to a lack of blood flow in the arm and be used to test new medicines to improve blood vessel&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy males between 18 and 45 years of age who have no history of high blood pressure, high&#xD;
      cholesterol, or diabetes and who have not smoked for at least 3 months before entering the&#xD;
      study may be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants lie in an adjustable reclining bed. Small catheters (tubes) are placed in the&#xD;
      artery and vein of the forearm of the non-dominant arm at the inside of the elbow. Blood&#xD;
      samples are collected from the tubes. Then, pressure cuffs are placed on both wrists and&#xD;
      upper arms. A strain gauge (rubber band-type device) is placed around the forearms. The&#xD;
      pressure cuffs are inflated and blood flows into the forearm, stretching the strain gauge at&#xD;
      a rate proportional to the blood flow. Then, small doses of acetylcholine (a medicine that&#xD;
      causes blood vessels to expand) are injected into the artery tube. After 20 minutes, blood&#xD;
      flow to the non-dominant arm is blocked by inflating the pressure cuff. The subject squeezes&#xD;
      a rubber ball about every 2 seconds for 90 seconds. The cuff is deflated after 15 minutes and&#xD;
      blood samples are withdrawn from the tube in the vein. After 15 minutes, the procedure is&#xD;
      repeated one more time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction denotes abnormal contractile function of the inner lining of blood&#xD;
      vessels. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and diabetes and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
      normal physiology, endothelial cells synthesize and release factors that modulate blood&#xD;
      vessel growth, inflammation, homeostasis, and vascular tone. Recently, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction has been recognized as an early event in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. IR&#xD;
      injury causes damage to tissue and is important in many settings including acute coronary&#xD;
      artery occlusions and cerebral ischemia. A model to examine the physiology of IR induced&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and to test pharmacologic agents to prevent IR induced endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction is of paramount importance given the rise in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease. Recently in Protocol 06-H-0024, our group found that 20 minutes of ischemic stress&#xD;
      causes no absolute endothelial dysfunction to the forearm using venous plethysmography to&#xD;
      measure blood flow, despite numerous publications that support this model. We believe that&#xD;
      the previously published data are based on a computational error resulting in an erroneous&#xD;
      data interpretation (discussed in the introductory section of this proposal). Using NMR&#xD;
      spectroscopy in protocol 06-H-0024 we have found that by adding exercise to exhaustion&#xD;
      (usually 1 to 2 minutes of concentric exercise) to a 15-minute period of forearm ischemia&#xD;
      results in a significantly more robust metabolic stress to the forearm, than 20 minutes of&#xD;
      ischemia alone. Given the potential utilization of the restoration of endothelial function as&#xD;
      a therapeutic strategy, we propose this pilot study to examine whether 15 minutes of ischemia&#xD;
      with exercise to exhaustion (usually 1-2 minutes of concentric exercise) will cause transient&#xD;
      IR dependent blunting of endothelial vasodilation as measured by venous plethysmography. In&#xD;
      this study, an extension of Protocol 06-H-0024, we hypothesize that in human subjects the&#xD;
      addition of concentric exercise to exhaustion, as a means to deplete high energy phosphate&#xD;
      stores, will contribute to the development of transient endothelial dysfunction when&#xD;
      performed in parallel with a 15-minute forearm ischemic stress. The establishment of a human&#xD;
      system to enable the study of transient forearm vessel endothelial dysfunction will enable us&#xD;
      to explore therapeutic interventions to protect against endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
