      Argumentation The frequency of post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD) is estimated around 1%&#xD;
      of the entire European population. In some specific populations, this percentage increases&#xD;
      (soldiers - 15 to 22%, war or persecuted refugees - 80%, post office or bank employees&#xD;
      submitted to an hold-up - 17%, firemen - 10 to 30%, emergency care employees - 11%, people&#xD;
      who underwent a terrorist attack or any violence - 20 to 65%...)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention is yet poor, secondary prevention trying to avoid a post traumatic disorder&#xD;
      apparition early after the traumatic event. There is currently two types of secondary&#xD;
      prevention :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitchell's debriefing based upon stress and its theories, using cognitive and&#xD;
           behavioural approaches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  French debriefing (post-immediate psychotherapeutic intervention) based on the&#xD;
           traumatism, never realised before second day post event and applied by mental health&#xD;
           professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current controversy of the Mitchell's debriefing leads us to evaluate the post-immediate&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intervention, never evaluated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Objectives Primary objective: To verify that post-immediate psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions (proposed after 2 days and before the end of first month post event) decrease&#xD;
      incidence, duration and intensity of psychotraumatic disorders at one year, versus a control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the efficacy of these interventions regarding professional, social and&#xD;
           familial adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify predictive factors of response to this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Experimental Design National multicentered, randomized, single blind study Study&#xD;
      Population 330 men or women aged 18 to 65, subjected to a potentially traumatic event&#xD;
      (criteria A1, DSM IV) and having presented an emotional reaction (intense fear, impotency or&#xD;
      horror, criteria A2, DSM IV). This event must have happened within 8 days prior&#xD;
      randomization. Patients treated with βblockers and patients suffering from psychopathologic&#xD;
      disorders won't be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome: PTSD frequency (on the basis of questionnaire CAPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete and subsyndormic PTSD occurence (CAPS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of psychotraumatic disorders (Sheehan scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychopathologic disorder frequency (CIDI SF),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of anxiety/depression (HAD scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcoholization frequency (CAGE scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of somatic adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to health care (number and types of contacts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits The post-immediate psychotherapeutic intervention shall avoid psychological&#xD;
      disorders apparition or improve its symptoms. This would decrease consequences on personal&#xD;
      life (social, relational and professional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will allow a better knowledge of these post traumatic disorders.&#xD;

      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Post-immediate psychotherapeutic intervention, 2 to 3 seances within the first month&#xD;
      following the potentially traumatic event. Each intervention last about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2-control: no psychotherapeutic intervention, only 2 to 3 supporting sessions.&#xD;
