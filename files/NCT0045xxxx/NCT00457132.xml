      Context: The many treatments and devices developed to unload the diseased articular surface&#xD;
      in knee osteoarthritis have provided limited solutions. A novel biomechanical device&#xD;
      comprising of four individually calibrated elements attached onto foot-worn platforms was&#xD;
      recently developed. This device is capable of such unloading during standing and walking,&#xD;
      simultaneously strengthening dynamic stabilizers and training neuromuscular control by&#xD;
      controlled biomechanical perturbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To asses the effectiveness of this device in reducing pain and improving function&#xD;
      in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Setting: Randomized, controlled and double blind prospective trial, conducted from&#xD;
      September 2005 to February 2006, in the Department of Orthopedics, Asaf Harofeh Medical&#xD;
      Center (Zerifin, Israel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Sixty-one patients with diagnosed knee osteoarthritis who self-reported&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe level pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned into active and control groups and underwent 8&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. The active group was treated with the device and its four biomechanical&#xD;
      elements that had been individually calibrated to accommodate a pain-free joint alignment.&#xD;
      The control group was treated with the device's platforms without the biomechanical elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures: The patients were evaluated three times during the study: at&#xD;
      baseline, after 4 weeks and at the 8 week endpoint. Primary outcomes were the Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Aggregated Locomotor Function (ALF)&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

      The Biomechanical System The biomechanical system is a biomechanical device (US Patent No.&#xD;
      6,979,287) combined with a treatment methodology (US Patent No. 7,101,330). The device is&#xD;
      calibrated for the individual patient according to pathology and motion characteristics.&#xD;
      Appropriate calibration is defined as bringing the damaged joint to a biomechanical alignment&#xD;
      that minimizes/eliminates pain by shifting and/or changing the applied forces and,&#xD;
      consequently, altering pressure distribution within the joint. Together with the&#xD;
      biomechanical perturbation applied through all phases of the step-cycle (i.e. initial&#xD;
      contact, mid-stance and toe-off), this enables home-based, dynamic, functional and repetitive&#xD;
      training to strengthen dynamic stabilizers and improve neuromuscular control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device consists of two half spherical-shaped biomechanical elements attached to each of&#xD;
      the patient's feet. One is located under the hindfoot region and the other is located under&#xD;
      the forefoot region. The elements are available in different degrees of resilience and&#xD;
      convexity, and are attached to the patient's foot using a platform in the form of a shoe. The&#xD;
      platform is equipped with a specially designed sole, which consists of two mounting rails to&#xD;
      enable flexible positioning of each element under each region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific level of &quot;unloading&quot; under a specific level of perturbation is required for&#xD;
      controlling pain in the affected compartment while reducing excessive loads of soft tissue&#xD;
      structures. Primary guidelines for calibration dictate the choice of resilience, convexity&#xD;
      and the position of each element. For example, in a genu-varus deformity the elements are&#xD;
      positioned under the neutral axis of the patient's leg. The element under the hindfoot is&#xD;
      further translated laterally to the longitudinal axis of the patient's leg in order to apply&#xD;
      wedging, while the element under the forefoot is further translated medially to reduce the&#xD;
      tension applied by soft tissue in the medial compartment, and to decrease adduction moment.&#xD;
      When required, further soft tissue tension and/or pressure can be decreased by adding plantar&#xD;
      flexion and/or forward translation of the hindfoot element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and motion instability are periodically evaluated to determine whether recalibration is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment (Active) Protocol The device was calibrated for each patient after baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Then, treatment was initiated and continued daily for a period of 8 weeks, during&#xD;
      which the device was again calibrated, as necessary, after the first, third and sixth week.&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to follow a treatment protocol which was based on walking during&#xD;
      activities of daily living and started with 10 minutes of indoor walking each day during the&#xD;
      first week and gradually increased to 30 minutes of daily outdoor walking in the last week.&#xD;
      Other than that, they were told to continue their daily activities wearing their regular&#xD;
      footwear. They were also instructed not to ingest any pain relief medication, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs or food supplements except for the acetaminophen tablets (unmarked)&#xD;
      that had been given to them at study entry to be taken when needed. The consumption of&#xD;
      acetaminophen or any other medication was monitored during each assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Protocol Patients in the control group were fitted with a platform which was&#xD;
      identical in appearance but had a regular sole and did not include the biomechanical&#xD;
      elements. They were instructed to follow the same treatment protocol as the active group and&#xD;
      not to ingest any medication or food supplement apart from the unmarked acetaminophen tablets&#xD;
      that had been given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment We tested the clinical efficacy of a device designed for reducing pain and&#xD;
      improving function in knee osteoarthritis patients by means of the self-reported Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the measured aggregated locomotor&#xD;
      function (ALF). The WOMAC is composed of a 5 items pain scale, a 2 items stiffness scale and&#xD;
      a 17 items function scale. All 24 items are rated by the patients on a visual-analogue-scale&#xD;
      (in cm) from 0 (no symptoms/limitations) to 10 (maximal symptoms/limitations). The ALF scale&#xD;
      is a sum of mean timed score (seconds) of three locomotor functions: time taken to walk 8&#xD;
      meters, time taken to accent and decent 7 stairs and time taken to transfer from sitting to&#xD;
      standing. The patients were evaluated three times during the study: at baseline, after 4&#xD;
      weeks and at the 8 week endpoint. Measurements were made with the patients barefooted as&#xD;
      required by the outcome protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure our ability to detect clinically significant differences, we also used the SF-36&#xD;
      health survey and the Knee Society Score as self-reported secondary outcomes (the latter&#xD;
      includes a physical examination subscale).&#xD;
