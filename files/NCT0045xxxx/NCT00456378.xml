      This pivotal clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the DIAM™ Spinal Stabilization&#xD;
      System for the treatment of single-level moderate lumbar degenerative disc disease. The&#xD;
      implant under investigation in this clinical trial is the DIAM Spinal Stabilization System,&#xD;
      and the device will be implanted using a posterior surgical approach. Patients in the control&#xD;
      group will receive nonoperative treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Success</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient will be considered an overall success if all of the following conditions are met:&#xD;
Pain/disability (Oswestry) success;&#xD;
No serious adverse event classified as &quot;implant associated&quot;, &quot;implant-/surgical procedure associated&quot;, or &quot;nonoperative treatment associated&quot;; and&#xD;
For patients in the investigational group, no additional surgical procedure at the involved level classified as a failure. For patients in the control group, no &quot;treatment surgery&quot; at the involved level that was the result of a poor response to conservative care treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire will be used. Success will be defined as pain/disability improvement according to the following definition:&#xD;
Pre-treatment Score - Post-treatment Score ≥ 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on four types of measurements: motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raising. Each of the sections is comprised of a number of elements. Overall neurological success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in all sections ( motor, sensory, reflex, and straightleg raising ) for the time period evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Status (Back Pain and Leg Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales will be used to evaluate pain intensity and duration. The pain score (0 min, 20 Max) is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity (0-10, with a score of 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot;) and duration scales (0-10, with a score of 0 being &quot;pain none of the time&quot; and a score of 10 being &quot;pain all of the time&quot;). Success for back pain and leg pain is described as follows: Pre-treatment Score - Post-treatment Score &gt;0</description>

    <measure>General Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be used to assess general health status. The SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) measures a patient's physical wellbeing and will be calculated according to algorithms formulated by the Medical Outcomes Trust. To be classified as a success, the following criterion must be met for SF-36 PCS:&#xD;

             scans or x-rays):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decreased disc height &gt;2mm, compared to the disc space at the next adjacent&#xD;

                  capsule;&#xD;
