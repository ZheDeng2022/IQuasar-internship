  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) of&#xD;
      Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with Cytoxan,&#xD;
      Adriamycin, Vincristine, Prednisone, Rituximab (CHOP-R) on diffuse Large B cell Non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL). The standard of care for DLBCL is the combination of drugs known as&#xD;
      CHOP-Rituximab (CHOP-R). The drugs that make up CHOP-R are the chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine, prednisone and rituximab. GM-CSF is a drug&#xD;
      that stimulates the immune system by increasing the numbers of white blood cells. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown that GM-CSF might help rituximab to be more effective in treating&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Study treatment is divided into 21-day time periods called cycles. Almost all&#xD;
           participants will be treated as outpatients unless they have an existing medical problem&#xD;
           that requires them to be treated as in inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drugs used in this study treatment are standard of care for this type of lymphoma&#xD;
           and participants could receive these even if they are not taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will start receiving GM-CSF 11 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1 for 10 days.&#xD;
           They will receive the first dose of GM-CSF at the clinic. At least 1 1/2 days after the&#xD;
           last GM-CSF injection (Day 1), they will receive chemotherapy (CHOP-R). Eleven days&#xD;
           before they start the next cycle (Days 11-20), they will again start to receive GM-CSF&#xD;
           injections for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive up to 6 cycles of study treatment if their disease is&#xD;
           responding and they are tolerating the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional medications may be given to prevent lung infection, return of brain and&#xD;
           nervous system disease and tumor lysis syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before beginning GM-CSF during each cycle of treatment blood will be drawn to monitor&#xD;
           the participants health and to check for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of each cycle a physical examination and blood tests will be performed. On Day&#xD;
           7 and Day 14 of each cycle, routine blood tests will also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After Cycle 2 and 4 CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed to&#xD;
           check the status of the participants disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 6 cycles of study treatment, the participant will return to the clinic for an End&#xD;
           of Treatment Visit. At this visit a physical exam, routine blood tests, and CT scan of&#xD;
           neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be asked to return to the clinic every 3 months for the first year&#xD;
           after study treatment and every 6 months up to 2 years after study treatment for the&#xD;
           procedures outline in the End of Treatment Visit.&#xD;
