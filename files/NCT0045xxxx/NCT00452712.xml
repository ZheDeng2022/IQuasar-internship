      Objective:to determent if children suffering from acute febrile illness has higher rate of&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension compared with children with no febrile illness. Design: a prospective&#xD;
      cohort study. Subjects: children aged 4-18 year with fever (temperature &gt; 38.) for up to 48&#xD;
      hours, presenting to the pediatric emergency department. Interventions: All subjects will&#xD;
      have their blood pressure measured in supine position (after 5 minute of rest) and after 3&#xD;
      minute of standing.&#xD;

      Orthosatic hypotension describes a condition in which the autonomic nervous system fails to&#xD;
      maintain a stable blood pressure in the face of postural change. Children presenting to the&#xD;
      pediatric ED with fever often describe symptom like syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness,&#xD;
      pallor, fatigue and weakness. These symptom may result from orthostatism related to acute&#xD;
      febrile illness. We assume that fever may be associated with autonomic changes (e.g.&#xD;
      vasodilatation) that can cause orthostatism. Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determent if children suffering from acute febrile illness has higher rate of orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension compared with children with no febrile illness. Design: a prospective cohort&#xD;
      study. Subjects: children aged 4-18 year with fever (temperature &gt; 38.) for up to 48 hours,&#xD;
      presenting to the pediatric emergency department. Interventions: All subjects will have their&#xD;
      blood pressure measured in supine position (after 5 minute of rest) and after 3 minute of&#xD;
      standing. Data analysis: The proportion of children with orthostatic hypotension in febrile&#xD;
      and non febrile patients will be compared using Ï‡2 test. The changes in blood pressure in&#xD;
      both groups will be compared using the Student t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumption: We assumed that the incidence of orthostatism is higher among children with&#xD;
      fever, because fever can cause orthostatism. Significance: Orthostatism can cause syncope&#xD;
      which is a potentially dangerous symptom (e.g. head trauma). Syncope accounts for 1-3% of&#xD;
      hospital admissions in US. The incidence in youths is estimated at about 15%) Patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with syncope may undergo numerous and expensive work up with low&#xD;
      diagnostic yield. -understanding that fever itself can cause orthostatism and syncope may&#xD;
      help us with precaution and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key word: orthostatism, fever children, emergency medicine.&#xD;
