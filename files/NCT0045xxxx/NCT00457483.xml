      High blood pressure is an important risk factor for diseases of heart and blood vessels like&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and stroke. Many patients are not treated to target blood pressures,&#xD;
      even though good blood pressure lowering drugs are available. Not all blood pressure drugs&#xD;
      are equally effective in individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that individual patient characteristics can predict the best response on&#xD;
      different blood pressure lowering drugs. In this study we will investigate whether a set of&#xD;
      patient characteristics (anthropometric and laboratory) obtained before treatment may predict&#xD;
      the blood pressure lowering response to representatives of two groups of drugs: those that&#xD;
      inhibit renin-angiotensin system activity and those that decrease blood volume.&#xD;

      Population-wide elimination of hypertension would reduce the incidence of all stroke, MI and&#xD;
      heart failure with 30 to 50% and contribute to a reduction of between 25 to 50% of the total&#xD;
      mortality related to these cardiovascular conditions. However, despite increasing numbers of&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication prescriptions, hypertension control rates are still insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will focus on improving the success rate of the initial treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension. The individual response to antihypertensive drugs varies between individuals:&#xD;
      many patients responding well to one drug respond poorly to another. We hypothesize this&#xD;
      difference in response to depend on the presence of certain characteristics of patients, like&#xD;
      waist circumference, age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major objective of our study will be to identify patient characteristics that predict the&#xD;
      efficacy of different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Despite pleas in international&#xD;
      publications to tailor antihypertensive treatment on individual basis, until now patient&#xD;
      characteristics are not taken into account in the medical treatment of hypertension. We will&#xD;
      address our study objective by the use of a PRospective, Open label (medication not blind),&#xD;
      Blinded End-point crossover design (PROBE) in which 100 general practice based, newly&#xD;
      diagnosed hypertensive patients, aged 18 - 65 years will be included to be treated with a&#xD;
      diuretic and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Each patient will be treated with&#xD;
      standard doses of both medications consecutively. Treatment duration for each medication will&#xD;
      be four weeks, with a four weeks washout period in between. The choice for a diuretic versus&#xD;
      an ARB is based on the substantial difference in working mechanism representing the two major&#xD;
      determinants of blood pressure: effect on intravascular volume (diuretic) or vascular tone&#xD;
      (ARB). Blood pressures will be assessed with both 24 hour-monitoring and practice based&#xD;
      standardized measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-three different patient characteristics will be studied and were selected based on&#xD;
      review of literature and pathophysiologic theory. These characteristics will be (1) simple&#xD;
      anthropometric measures like body mass index and fat distribution, (2) demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity or (3) disease characteristics such as baseline&#xD;
      diastolic and systolic blood pressure, co-morbidity and blood plasma levels of easily&#xD;
      measured bioactive compounds, like renin and B-type natriuretic peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the difference in blood pressure response between both&#xD;
      study drugs; secondary outcome measures will be the difference in the number of patients&#xD;
      achieving target blood pressure and the number of adverse drug events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to find three to six significant patient characteristics that predict response to&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication in terms of blood pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our study indeed identifies relevant patient characteristics GPs will be able to initiate&#xD;
      antihypertensive medical treatment more efficiently. We expect this will result in increased&#xD;
      initial therapeutic success and reduction of the number of antihypertensive drugs needed. As&#xD;
      a consequence we expect compliance and hypertension control rates to increase. These&#xD;
      expectations will need to be confirmed in a general practice-based follow-up study on&#xD;
      implementation in daily practice of the use of patient characteristics with compliance and&#xD;
      hypertension control rates as outcome measures.&#xD;
