      Medications for memory improvement are available but they may not actually improve the&#xD;
      ability to do real world tasks. The purpose of this research study is to determine if a&#xD;
      medicine used to treat memory problems donepezil(Aricept) enhances the ability to remember&#xD;
      steps of functional tasks and the actual ability to perform tasks relevant to real-life&#xD;
      independence. Aricept is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      Aricept is an investigational drug for the purposes of this study, and is not approved for&#xD;
      this purpose.&#xD;

      All participants will receive a behavioral intervention as part of the testing protocol: they&#xD;
      will be asked to generate words to complete a phrase as they read written steps to perform&#xD;
      functional tasks. Mood will be assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale.(see page 8)&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to estimate their memory, immediate attention mood, functional&#xD;
      tasks (performing cooking and financial task) and &quot;ability to take medications correctly&quot;&#xD;
      (pre-test or &quot;offline&quot; ratings, abstract judgments of their own ability not based directly on&#xD;
      performance). They will perform self-assessments of their cognitive, functional abilities and&#xD;
      mood using Likert scales. They will mark each of 5 vertical (23.5 cm) lines centered on white&#xD;
      paper to indicate their ability. Each line will be labeled for each domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate of naming ability, show the subject the Likert Scale (attached) for the naming&#xD;
      domain. Then explain: &quot;This scale is to measure how well you think your ability to name. Here&#xD;
      is the top where you will mark if you think your performance is perfect, here is the bottom&#xD;
      if you think you are terrible. You may be somewhere in between. (broadly indicated the whole&#xD;
      middle area) mark where you think your performance would belong on this scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This standard protocol will be used by the examiner in this study to explain each domain with&#xD;
      specific types of tasks, and give subjects practical hypothetical examples of good and poor&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability to take medication: Functional memory as applied to medication compliance will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Hopkins Medication Schedule (HMS). This test has two part, HMS and pill&#xD;
      box. The test will serve as a good evaluation of subject's functional memory, which we&#xD;
      suspect it will be most strongly affected by Anosognosia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HMS: the participant was read (and read along with) a hypothetical scenario in which her&#xD;
      physician gave her 1 prescription for an antibiotic and for aspirin to treat an infection&#xD;
      along with directions for taking each. The participant was then asked to plan a schedule for&#xD;
      taking these medications and water during the course of a day, following the instructions&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
