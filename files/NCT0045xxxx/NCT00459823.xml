             curative therapies are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Surgery and radiotherapy must have been completed at least four weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry, and prior chemotherapy and other anti-cancer therapy, excluding bisphosphonates&#xD;

          5. Written informed consent prior to any study specific screening procedures, which will&#xD;
             include voluntary additional consent to provide specimens specifically for&#xD;
             pharmacogenomic analysis, with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent&#xD;
             at any time without prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Anticipated life expectancy &gt; three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. After MTD has been reached: patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;

             discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least two weeks&#xD;
             before starting treatment with E7107.&#xD;
&#xD;
