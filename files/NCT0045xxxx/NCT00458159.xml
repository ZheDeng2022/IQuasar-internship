             contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual&#xD;
             intercourse for at least 28 days before starting study drug, while on study drug,&#xD;
             during dose interruptions, and 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The two&#xD;
             methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e.&#xD;
             intrauterine device, hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants], tubal&#xD;

             days and then every 28 days while on study drug, during dose interruptions and at day&#xD;
             28 day following discontinuation of study drug. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the&#xD;
             pregnancy testing must occur every 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than a 28-day supply of study drug is to be dispensed at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP&#xD;
             that they are continuing to use the two reliable methods of birth control at each&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Counseling about pregnancy precautions must be done at a minimum of every 28 days.&#xD;
             Subjects must be reminded of the potential risks of fetal exposure at each visit and&#xD;
             to not share drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject missed her period or&#xD;
