      Primary aldosteronism (PA), a common curable disease of hypertension, is characterized by&#xD;
      inappropriate production of aldosterone, which is at least partially autonomous of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system. A recent clinical study reported that patients with PA experience a&#xD;
      higher sate of a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those with essential&#xD;
      hypertension(Corry and Tuck 2003; Milliez, Girerd et al. 2005). The prevalence of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome was higher in primary aldosteronism than in essential hypertension was also reported&#xD;
      (Fallo, Veglio et al. 2006). The wide applying of the plasma aldosterone/plasma rennin&#xD;
      activity (ARR) as a screening test among hypertensive patients have reported a much higher&#xD;
      prevalence of this disease, up to 12% of hypertensive patients. In the past decade, an&#xD;
      increase in diagnosis rate of PA has been observed in National Taiwan University Hospital,&#xD;
      with an average of 15-20 newly diagnosis cases every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH) and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) are&#xD;
      the leading causes of primary aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenalectomy is the reasonable&#xD;
      therapeutic option of APA and aldosterone antagonists usually brings about well blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) control in BAH. Not every APA patient would accept operation because of other&#xD;
      medical conditions, or the cure rate of hypertension in APA after adrenalectomy is 50-70% in&#xD;
      most studies. For patients with BAH, aldosterone antagonists are the first choice of&#xD;
      treatment, however, intolerance to high dose of these medications is not uncommon. To our&#xD;
      best knowledge, there is no alternative treatment for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopaminergic regulation of aldosterone secretion has been well demonstrated in normal&#xD;
      subjects as well as patients with PA. We have shown that D2 receptor can down-regulate the&#xD;
      transcription of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) via a specific PKC isoform and probably&#xD;
      intracellular calcium level. Furthermore, there is a reciprocal change of the mRNA of D2&#xD;
      receptor and CYP11B2 in APA. D2 receptor has also been demonstrated in other neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors, eg., pheochromocytoma, prolactinoma, GH-secreting adenoma ect. [Camacho &amp; Mazzone&#xD;
      1999] Administration of D2 agonist, bromocriptin (BMC), is a standard treatment of&#xD;
      prolactinoma, either for pre-operative reduction of the tumors or for non-surgical patients&#xD;
      [Chattopadhyay et al., 2005]. Reduction or shrinkage of prolactinoma has been observed in&#xD;
      patients treated with BMC [Biswas et al., 2005]. Anti-proliferative effect and apoptosis of&#xD;
      BMC have been demonstrated in several cell lines [Wasko et al., 2004]. Recently, we also&#xD;
      demonstrated that BMC, in addition to decrease aldosterone secretion and expression of&#xD;
      CYP11B2, could inhibit cell proliferation of H295 cells, an adrenocortical carcinoma cell&#xD;
      line, with a down-regulation of ERK. In this context, we propose that BMC may be an&#xD;
      alternative treatment of PA, both APA and BAH.&#xD;
