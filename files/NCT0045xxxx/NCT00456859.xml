    <textblock>
      The CAP-KD trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel&#xD;
      group comparison clinical trial and will be conducted as a researcher-directed study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of Kremezin in preventing the progression of CKD. We compare two groups&#xD;
      of patients: those receiving conventional treatment alone and those receiving such treatment&#xD;
      paired with Kremezin.&#xD;

      A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the oral carbonaceous adsorbent Kremezin in&#xD;
      preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease (the Carbonaceous Oral Adsorbent's&#xD;
      Effects on Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease [CAP-KD] trial) in predialysis patients. In&#xD;
      the trial we are comparing two treatments: conventional treatment comprising an ACEI and/or&#xD;
      ARB together with a low-protein diet, and combination treatment comprising the conventional&#xD;
      treatment paired with Kremezin. Furthermore, we will compare the QOL in both groups of&#xD;
      patients&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's serum creatinine value is 5.0 mg/dl or less at the time of case&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inverse serum creatinine value, calculated using measurements at four or more time&#xD;
             points during an observation period that occurs within 48 weeks of case registration,&#xD;
             is decreasing, on average, according to linear-regression analysis performed at the&#xD;
             case registration center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's blood pressure is well controlled before the initial serum creatinine&#xD;
             measurement during the observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
