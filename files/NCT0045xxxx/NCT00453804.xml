    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of long-acting injectable&#xD;
      naltrexone administration in a clinical trial in patients with SMI who also have a diagnosis&#xD;
      of alcohol dependence. Secondary aims include providing a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of long-acting injectable naltrexone as compared with oral naltrexone&#xD;
      in patients with SMI who also have a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. An additional aim is to&#xD;
      provide a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of long-acting injectable naltrexone as&#xD;
      compared with oral naltrexone in reducing alcohol use from baseline levels&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to improve the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence&#xD;
      in patients with serious mental illness (SMI). SMI for this study is defined as any patient&#xD;
      with any of the following diagnoses: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type I&#xD;
      disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, or psychotic disorder not&#xD;
      otherwise specified. Alcohol and other substance use disorders (SUDs) are common among&#xD;
      individuals with SMI such as schizophrenia. SUD comorbidity is associated with many adverse&#xD;
      consequences. However, to date, few reports have addressed the efficacy of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments for SUDs in this population. Naltrexone pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for alcohol dependence, but it has not been systematically applied to the care of patients&#xD;
      with SMI. This pilot study plans to use a new intramuscular long-acting form of naltrexone&#xD;
      that needs to be administered every 4 weeks compared to daily oral naltrexone, which we are&#xD;
      also studying in this pilot. This could improve adherence to a medication regimen, which has&#xD;
      been shown to be critical to successful naltrexone treatment of alcohol dependence. The&#xD;
      proposed project is a 1-year pilot program of research. It is a randomized prospective&#xD;
      parallel groups open-label trial of long-acting intramuscular (IM) naltrexone injected every&#xD;
      4 weeks compared to monthly prescriptions of oral naltrexone in a cohort of 20 subjects, ten&#xD;
      for each treatment modality. The study is 16 weeks in duration, consisting of a 12-week&#xD;
      course of naltrexone plus one follow-up interview at 4 weeks after discontinuation of&#xD;
      medication. Voucher-based incentives are provided to all subjects to ensure attendance for&#xD;
      medication administration. Weekly motivational counseling sessions are conducted and focus on&#xD;
      improving motivation to stop alcohol use. Study outcomes consist of self-report and&#xD;
      biological measures of alcohol use as well as measures of psychiatric symptom severity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females, age 18 to 69, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Schizophrenia,&#xD;

          2. DSM-IV diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Level of Drinking:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. At least four days of drinking in the 30 days prior to consent and/or during&#xD;
