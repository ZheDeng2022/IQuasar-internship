  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results from the DECODE Study have shown that postprandial (1 - 2 hours after a meal)&#xD;
      hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar) is more common in elderly people with diabetes than&#xD;
      younger people with diabetes and is the best predictor of the development of complications.&#xD;
      The DECODE Study involved 6941 people who already had diabetes and 702 who did not have&#xD;
      diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed when the blood sugar 1st thing in the morning is over 7.0&#xD;
      mmol/L. The DECODE Study showed that people at risk for diabetes can have a normal blood&#xD;
      sugar 1st thing in the morning but have a high blood sugar 2 hours after a meal and that&#xD;
      these people are at risk for developing heart disease and other complications of diabetes.&#xD;
      These people would not be identified as at risk if only a fasting blood sugar is done.&#xD;
      Studies in younger people with diabetes have shown that after a meal, insulin levels are more&#xD;
      like a person without diabetes and glucose (blood sugar) levels are lower with GlucoNorm than&#xD;
      with Glyburide. There is no data available that demonstrates this in elderly people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You have been invited to participate in this study because you have type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      controlled by diet and/or exercise or metformin only and are over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GlucoNorm has a greater effect than&#xD;
      Glyburide on insulin levels and glucose (blood sugar) levels after a meal in elderly people&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes who control their diabetes with diet and exercise.&#xD;

      The results from the DECODE Study have shown that postprandial hyperglycemia is more common&#xD;
      in elderly people with diabetes than younger people and is the best predictor of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity. Studies in younger people with diabetes have shown that in response to a meal,&#xD;
      insulin profiles are more physiologic and glucose levels are lower with GlucoNorm than with&#xD;
      Glyburide. There is no data available that demonstrates this in elderly people with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Subjects will undergo 2 Standard Meal&#xD;
      Tests with Ensure 325 ml separated by 15 - 30 days. Group 1 will receive GlucoNorm 1 mg&#xD;
      during the 1st Standard Meal Test and Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive Glyburide 2.5 mg during the 1st Standard Meal Test and GlucoNorm 1mg&#xD;
      during the 2nd Standard Meal Test.&#xD;
