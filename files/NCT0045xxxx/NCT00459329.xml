      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a home-based depression treatment&#xD;
      intervention called &quot;Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives (PEARL)&quot;. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that over a 12-month period, compared to usual care, those receiving the PEARL intervention&#xD;
      will show more improvement with their depression, have higher quality of life and function,&#xD;
      and use fewer medical services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to non-depressed individuals with epilepsy, those with depression have significantly&#xD;
      higher rates of suicide, lower social and occupational functioning, decreased quality of life&#xD;
      independent of seizure frequency, and higher non-psychiatric health care utilization. Adults&#xD;
      with epilepsy are more likely to be homebound as a result of reduced function and&#xD;
      restrictions in driving, opportunities to obtain enhanced quality of care for depression may&#xD;
      be limited. This study tests the effectiveness of a home-based multi-modal depression&#xD;
      treatment intervention called Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives (PEARL). PEARL&#xD;
      consists of problem solving treatment, social and physical activation, pleasant events&#xD;
      scheduling, support and education regarding antidepressant medication use as well as&#xD;
      psychiatric consultation and recommendations regarding initiation or adjustment of&#xD;
      antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sample of adults with epilepsy who have minor depression, major depression and/or&#xD;
      dysthymia, we hypothesize that over a 12-month period, compared to usual care, those&#xD;
      randomized to the PEARL intervention will: achieve higher levels of depression response and&#xD;
      remission, achieve higher quality of life and function, and utilize less non-psychiatric&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing a multi-modal, home-based stepped collaborative care intervention for adults&#xD;
      with depression and epilepsy, this program will offer practical alternatives to usual care&#xD;
      and will provide a program for improving depression outcomes, quality of life and&#xD;
      potentially, epilepsy outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Eight 50-minute in-home sessions over 19 weeks with a masters-level social work counselor using Problem Solving Therapy (PST).&#xD;
PST is a skills-enhancing behavioral depression treatment based on the assumption that an accumulation of problems in living cause and maintain depressive symptoms, and through systematically identifying and addressing these problems, patients achieve decreased depressive symptoms. Counselors also help participants to increase social and physical activities and to incorporate pleasant activities into patients' lives.&#xD;
Counselors provide education and monitoring for antidepressant use, and work with the participant's physician and PEARL psychiatrist to recommend initiating or adjusting antidepressant medications. The PHQ-9 is administered at each session to track depression change.&#xD;
After 19 weeks, counselors will maintain monthly telephone calls with participants, administering the PHQ-9 and assessing PST success.</description>
