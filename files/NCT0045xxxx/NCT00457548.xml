  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a brief counseling intervention, delivered by&#xD;
      telephone, is more effective than standard ED care, to reduce future alcohol related injuries&#xD;
      and alcohol related negative consequences, among patients treated in the ED for injuries from&#xD;
      an MVC and other injury mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol related motor vehicle crashes (MVC) continue to be a substantial public health&#xD;
      problem. Brief interventions for alcohol (BI) for injured ED patients have been demonstrated&#xD;
      to be effective, and perhaps more so for MVC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone interventions have been utilized in varying ways in health care. We compared the&#xD;
      delivery of two brief interventions by telephone against an assessment only condition.&#xD;
      Participants who received the BI and the assessment only condition were contacted 3 and 12&#xD;
      months after recruitment. Data about alcohol use, injuries and high risk behaviors, including&#xD;
      drinking and driving behaviors were collected at the 3 and 12 month follow-up assessments.&#xD;
