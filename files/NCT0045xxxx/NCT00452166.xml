      30 non-diabetic, non-obese patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in this metabolic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of rosiglitazone on insulin&#xD;
      resistance in non-obese patients with non-diabetic stage 4 CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points are the effects on inflammation (hsCRP), lipid profile, bone density and&#xD;
      body composition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This part of the study will be performed in 30 non-diabetic non-obese patients. In this study&#xD;
      patients will receive single-dose oral placebo and rosiglitazone once daily to be taken in&#xD;
      the morning. During the first 8 weeks the patients will be dosed with 4 mg rosiglitazone.&#xD;
      Then the concentration of the serum transaminases will be checked and if these are within an&#xD;
      acceptable range, the doses will be doubled for the remainder of the study. If the changes in&#xD;
      serum transaminases are considered clinically significant the patient will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study and if the transaminases have increased but not to clinically significant level&#xD;
      then the treatment of patient may be continued on the 4 mg daily dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insulin sensitivity will be measured by using a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp&#xD;
      technique, which is validated technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of eligible patients: fasting glucose ≤ 7,0 mmol/L and BMI ≤ 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for which the patient uses insulin;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant co-morbidities which, according to the treating nephrologists, makes it&#xD;
           unlikely that the patient will be able to complete the foreseen study period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant cardiovascular co-morbidities which are likely to interfere with the&#xD;
           objectives of the study (morbid obesity, family history of dyslipidemia, etc.); at the&#xD;
           discretion of the treating nephrologists or the principal investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy for PPAR's;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac disease with marked limitation of functional capacity (New York Heart&#xD;
           Association III or IV clinical status);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of immunosuppressant agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of renal transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic insufficiency (defined as transaminase concentrations above &gt; 2.5 times the&#xD;
           upper limit of normal for the laboratories);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history of alcohol abuse or excessive alcohol use defined as more than 21 consumptions&#xD;
           per week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For female patients: pregnancy, the intention to become pregnant within the study&#xD;
           period, or lactating patients Eligible patients will receive insulin (Actrapid; Novo&#xD;
           Nordisk A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) at an infusion rate of 40 mU (288 pmol)/kg/m2 body&#xD;
           surface area per minute. Euglycemia (target blood concentration of 5 mM) will be&#xD;
           maintained by adjusting the rate of 20% glucose infusion according to whole blood&#xD;
           glucose concentration measured from arterialized venous blood; the patient keeps his or&#xD;
           her right arm in a box containing heated air (60°C). Insulin and glucose will be infused&#xD;
           in the left arm. In healthy subjects, hepatic glucose production is completely&#xD;
           suppressed when the serum insulin level is &gt;60 mU/L. Here the expected insulin level in&#xD;
           serum is 80 mU/L. Blood samples will be drawn at 5 min intervals for the determination&#xD;
           of blood glucose, and at 10 min intervals during the period of 90 -120 min for the&#xD;
           determination of serum insulin and free fatty acids. The insulin-sensitivity index (ISI)&#xD;
           will be calculated by dividing the average glucose-infusion rate by the mean&#xD;
           steady-state serum insulin levels during a period of 90 -120 min. In addition to&#xD;
           glucose-infusion rate and insulin sensitivity index, the influence of the clamp on&#xD;
           levels of FFA will also be assed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and during the follow-up of the study inflammatory parameters (hsCRP) and lipids&#xD;
      will be measured. At baseline and at the end a bone densitometry (DEXA) will be performed.&#xD;
