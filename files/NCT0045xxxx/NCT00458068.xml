      Background: Preterm infants are at risk of iron deficiency. The smaller the infants are at&#xD;
      birth, the smaller the iron stores at birth and the higher the risk of iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1301g require iron&#xD;
      supplementation earlier than previously recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (1996-1999). Results: Early iron&#xD;
      supplementation may reduce the incidence of iron deficiency and the need for late blood&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;

      Objectives. To examine whether early enteral iron supplementation (EI) would improve serum&#xD;
      ferritin as a measure of nutritional iron status at 2 months of age and would prevent&#xD;
      definite iron deficiency (ID) in infants with a birth weight of &lt;1301 g. Methods. Infants&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to receive enteral iron supplementation of 2 to 6 mg/kg/day as soon as&#xD;
      enteral feedings of &gt;100 mL/kg/day were tolerated (EI) or at 61 days of life (late enteral&#xD;
      iron supplementation [LI]). Nutritional iron status was assessed: 1) at birth, 2) at 61 days&#xD;
      of life, 3) when the infants reached a weight of 1.6 times birth weight, and 4) before blood&#xD;
      was transfused at a hematocrit of &lt;.25. ID was defined by any one of the following criteria:&#xD;
      ferritin, &lt;12 mg/L; transferrin saturation, &lt;17%; or increase of absolute reticulocyte counts&#xD;
      by &gt;50% one week after the onset of enteral iron supplementation. Restrictive red cell&#xD;
      transfusion guidelines were followed and all transfusions were documented. Erythropoietin was&#xD;
      not administered. The primary outcome variables were: 1) ferritin at 61 days and 2) the&#xD;
      number of infants with ID. Results. Ferritin at 61 days was not different between the groups.&#xD;
      Infants in the LI group were more often iron-deficient (26/65 vs 10/68) and received more&#xD;
      blood transfusions after day 14 of life. No adverse effects of EI were noted. Conclusions. EI&#xD;
      is feasible and probably safe in infants with birth weight &lt;1301 g. EI may reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of ID and the number of late blood transfusions. ID may occur in very low birth&#xD;
      weight infants despite early supplementation with iron and should be considered in the case&#xD;
      of progressive anemia. Pediatrics 2000; 106:700 -706; preterm infant, iron supplementation,&#xD;
      iron deficiency, blood transfusion.&#xD;
