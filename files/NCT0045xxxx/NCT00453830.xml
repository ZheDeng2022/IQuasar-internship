      Aim: This is a prospective, randomized comparison of traditional open (OS) and laparoscopic&#xD;
      sigmoidectomy (LS) in patients with complicated diverticular disease. The study is designed&#xD;
      in order to minimize bias by standardizing the two procedures and blinding patients and&#xD;
      nurses during the preoperative and early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A laparoscopic approach for sigmoidectomy has significant advantages over the&#xD;
      open technique with respect to postoperative pain, duration of ileus, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, and perioperative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with complicated diverticular disease who are candidates for elective&#xD;
      sigmoidectomy will be randomized the day before surgery, and anaesthetic technique and&#xD;
      postoperative management will be standardized between groups. Surgeons with experience in&#xD;
      both laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomy will perform both types of procedures. At the&#xD;
      end of the operation, identical, opaque wound dressings will be applied and left in place&#xD;
      until postoperative day 4. Both patients and nursing staff will therefore be blinded to the&#xD;
      type of surgical technique during the early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Postoperative pain assessed by the Visual Analog Scale at postoperative days 1, 2, and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Postoperative intake of systemic opiates (morphine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Duration of postoperative ileus, quantified by the interval in hours between the end of&#xD;
      the procedure and passage of first stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Duration of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Surgical complications, such as wound infection, anastomotic leakage, bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) General medical complications, such as cardiopulmonary, pneumonia, and renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: This study will determine whether a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy is associated with&#xD;
      significant clinical advantages over the traditional open approach when patients with&#xD;
      complicated diverticular disease are blinded to the operative technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonic diverticulosis is an increasingly common condition in the Western societies; in our&#xD;
      country, a third of the population is affected by the 6th decade and two-thirds by the 9th&#xD;
      decade. Fortunately, a majority of patients with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic;&#xD;
      diverticulitis, the most common presentation of complicated diverticular disease, has an&#xD;
      estimated incidence of 10 patients per 100,000/year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonic diverticular disease is usually restricted to the sigmoid colon, and conservative&#xD;
      treatment with antibiotics is indicated in cases of a first attack of uncomplicated&#xD;
      diverticulitis, the rationale being that a majority of patients treated for a first episode&#xD;
      of acute inflammation will eventually recover and have no further problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective sigmoidectomy is currently recommended in the following clinical situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who had two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who had one episode of complicated (perforated) diverticulitis, with either&#xD;
           pericolic of pelvic abscesses (Hinchey stage I and II respectively), fistula formation&#xD;
           and/or stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resection of the sigmoid colon is now commonly performed by laparoscopy, and a number of&#xD;
      non-randomized publications have demonstrated that this approach is safe and feasible in&#xD;
      patients with diverticular disease. The theoretical advantages of celioscopy over the open&#xD;
      techniques include decreased postoperative pain, a shorter duration of postoperative ileus&#xD;
      and hospital stay, and improved cosmetic. Surprisingly, however, most published data on the&#xD;
      topic are restricted to case-control series, and so far the putative advantages of&#xD;
      laparoscopy have not been substantiated through a prospective randomized trial.&#xD;
