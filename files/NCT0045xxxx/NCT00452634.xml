    <textblock>
      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as the statins,&#xD;
      have proven therapeutic and preventative effects in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there&#xD;
      are emerging interests in their use as anticancer agents based on preclinical evidence of&#xD;
      their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, anti-invasive, and radiosensitizing properties.&#xD;
      Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase by the statins interferes with the&#xD;
      rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, leading to reduced levels of mevalonate and its&#xD;
      downstream products, many of which play important roles in critical cellular functions such&#xD;
      as membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression.&#xD;
      Perturbations of these processes in neoplastic cells by the statins may therefore result in&#xD;
      control of tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. The statins have demonstrated growth&#xD;
      inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and preclinical tumor models in animals.&#xD;
      Simvastatin, a member of the statin family, profoundly impaired basal and growth&#xD;
      factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with&#xD;
      simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover,&#xD;
      SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin. Therefore, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct this phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy &amp; toxicity of irinotecan/cisplatin plus&#xD;
      simvastatin in patients with chemo-naïve ED-SCLC.&#xD;
