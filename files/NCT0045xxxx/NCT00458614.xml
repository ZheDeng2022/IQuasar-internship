  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disposition of a number of drugs has been reported to be altered in patients with Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis (CF). Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters observed included increased volumes of&#xD;
      distribution and increased clearance of renally eliminated drugs. The purpose of this this&#xD;
      study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of IV lansoprazole and its metabolites in&#xD;
      normal healthy children and children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) ages 2 to &lt; 10 years. It is&#xD;
      suspected that children with CF will have a more rapid clearance as compared to healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) impacts 1:2500 Caucasian newborns and results from a defect in the&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (CFTR) responsible for&#xD;
      electrolyte regulation. Between 25 to 81% of the CF population have gastro-esophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease (GERD), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are frequently prescribed for this&#xD;
      condition. Moreover, PPIs are commonly used in patients with CF to allow for better gastric&#xD;
      acid stabilization so that pancreatic enzyme efficacy is optimized and nutritional status is&#xD;
      improved. Lansoprazole is a PPI that is widely used for acid-related disorders including&#xD;
      GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disposition of a number of drugs has been reported to be altered in CF. Changes in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters observed in patients with CF include increased volumes of&#xD;
      distribution and increased clearance of renally eliminated drugs. To date, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of PPIs in patients with CF have not been characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of&#xD;
      IV lansoprazole in CF and normal children 2 to &lt; 10 years of age. A goal of 12 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects ranging from 2 to &lt; 10 years of age including both males and females with CF ∆F508&#xD;
      genotype will be recruited from CF clinic or inpatient. As a comparison group, six evaluable&#xD;
      subjects who are normal, healthy children of similar demographic profile (age, gender, and&#xD;
      race) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent/assent is obtained, screening procedures will be completed within 30&#xD;
      days of study participation. The pre-study screen includes an age-appropriate physical exam,&#xD;
      medical history (current medication/herbal use), vital signs (non-crying sitting blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate), height, weight, AST, ALT, and CBC. Subjects will be studied during&#xD;
      a current hospitalization or scheduled for an approximately 12-hour study visit.&#xD;
