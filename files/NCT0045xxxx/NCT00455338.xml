  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if meals of different fat and fiber content affect&#xD;
      postprandial plasma testosterone concentration in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a high-fiber meal will have a greater reduction in testosterone&#xD;
      composition compared with a high-fat meal.&#xD;

      The study participants are 15 women with PCOS between the ages of 19-40. All participants&#xD;
      must be in good health, non-smokers, and not pregnant or lactating. For three days prior to&#xD;
      both study visits, participants follow a standard 2,000 calorie meal plan of approximately&#xD;
      30% fat, 55% carbohydrate and 15% protein. On the morning of the two study visits,&#xD;
      participants arrive at the General Clinical Research Center at 0700 h. A venicatheter is&#xD;
      inserted into an antecubital vein for collection of blood samples and the catheter is kept&#xD;
      open with saline. A baseline blood sample is taken for measurement of estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone, glucose, insulin, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).&#xD;
      Participants are then served the test meal and asked to consume it within 15 minutes. The&#xD;
      high-fat, low-fiber and low-fat, high-fiber meals are isocaloric and are 62% and 6% fat, 24%&#xD;
      and 81% carbohydrate, and have 1g and 26.8g of fiber, respectively. After each meal, a blood&#xD;
      sample is taken at 30 minutes and every hour for six hours for measurement of testosterone,&#xD;
      SHBG, glucose and insulin. During this time participants remain comfortably seated or&#xD;
      reclined. After the last blood draw, the catheter was removed and participants are given a&#xD;
      complementary meal.&#xD;
