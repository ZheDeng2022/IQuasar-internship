      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of sorafenib in patients&#xD;
      with PAH already on existing therapy with a prostacyclin [epoprostenol (Flolan)],&#xD;
      treprostinil (Remodulin), or iloprost alone, or with or without sildenafil (Viagra/Revatio).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an angioproliferative vasculopathy resulting from&#xD;
      abnormal endothelial and smooth muscle cell interactions. Idiopathic and familial PAH&#xD;
      (formerly known as primary pulmonary hypertension) occurs more often in women than in men,&#xD;
      with a median survival of 2.8 years if untreated and a mean age at diagnosis of 35 years. The&#xD;
      key features of this vasculopathy causes a progressive narrowing of the pulmonary artery and&#xD;
      their branches, resulting in right heart failure and death. Proliferating endothelial cells&#xD;
      obliterate medium-sized precapillary arteries, thereby forming the characteristic &quot;plexiform&quot;&#xD;
      lesions. When combined with the expansion of both vascular smooth muscle cells and&#xD;
      adventitial cells in pulmonary arteries, these observations evoke comparisons to cancer&#xD;
      pathobiology. Currently, FDA-approved therapies for PAH such as prostacyclins (epoprostenol,&#xD;
      treprostinil, and iloprost), endothelin receptor blockers (bosentan) and phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors (sildenafil) all produce functional improvement (6 minute walk distance- 6MW) with&#xD;
      minimal change in hemodynamic measurements at cardiac catheterization. Only epoprostenol has&#xD;
      provided survival benefit with the 5-year survival, remaining at 50% without demonstrable&#xD;
      reversal of the vasculopathy. Clearly there is a critical need for novel targets and&#xD;
      therapies for PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, the principal investigator (PI) will leverage a large PAH referral practice&#xD;
      with an established clinical database to assess the potential utility of kinase inhibitors as&#xD;
      a new class of agents for protease-activated receptor (PAR). These drugs inhibit processes&#xD;
      important to pathological blood vessel branching and growth and have been a focus for the&#xD;
      internationally renowned University of Chicago Phase I/II trials unit in oncology led by Dr.&#xD;
      Mark Ratain (Co-Investigator). The University of Chicago has had a major role in the drug&#xD;
      development of the recently (12/05) FDA-approved drug, sorafenib, for advanced renal&#xD;
      carcinoma. Sorafenib inhibits Raf-1 kinase, a regulator of endothelial apoptosis, and&#xD;
      inhibits angiogenesis growth factor receptors VEGFR-2, PDGFR-B, and VEGFR-3.&#xD;
