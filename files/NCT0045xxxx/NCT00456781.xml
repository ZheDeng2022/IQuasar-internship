      This study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GraftJacket, a human tissue product&#xD;
      used in fixing large and massive reparable rotator cuff tears.GraftJacket allograft (Wright&#xD;
      Medical Technology, Inc., Arlington, TN) is a biologic tissue that is derived from human&#xD;
      dermis. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether rotator cuff repair&#xD;
      augmentation using GraftJacket allograft provides a viable alternative, based on observed&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, versus outcomes traditionally achieved with suture and anchor repairs. The&#xD;
      study will secondarily investigate the difference in outcomes in patients treated&#xD;
      arthroscopically versus open. This study will report patient progress and results at early (6&#xD;
      month) and late (2 year) time points in patients treated for large and massive reparable&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears (&gt;3cm). A reparable tear is defined as a tear of the rotator cuff where it&#xD;
      is possible to bring the retracted tendon edge back to the greater tuberosity of the humerus&#xD;
      without excessive tension. Restoration of rotator cuff integrity, clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      re-tear rate will be included in the study evaluations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center clinical study evaluating GraftJacket in the augmentation&#xD;
      of large and massive rotator cuff tears compared to the traditional surgical technique of&#xD;
      sutures and anchors alone. The study group will consist of 160 patients (early withdrawals or&#xD;
      drop outs will not be replaced). Surgical approach for each patient will be either mini-open&#xD;
      or arthroscopic. Safety assessments for this clinical study will be based on reported adverse&#xD;
      events. Any adverse event that occurs during the study that represents a change from the&#xD;
      patient's condition as noted at baseline [determined by normal standard of care] that is&#xD;
      related to the procedure will be documented by completing the adverse events case report&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigator will indicate which operative technique (mini-open or arthroscopic) will be&#xD;
      used during the study period at their site. The site selection process will be used to&#xD;
      attempt to attain an equal distribution of both operative techniques used in the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment groups A or B. A randomization scheme&#xD;
      using a 2 block model will be used within each surgical technique. Randomization cards&#xD;
      meeting the requirements for this process will be generated by the statistician. Both&#xD;
      surgical technique treatment groups will use the same assessments for comparisons throughout&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Plan for the GraftJacket Rotator Cuff Tendon Reinforcement Scaffold Surgical&#xD;
      Technique Open Surgical (suture and anchor) Arthroscopic Group A without augmentation Group B&#xD;
      with GraftJacket Group A without augmentation Group B with GraftJacket&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with reparable rotator cuff repairs must present with large and massive rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears of more than 3cm, which can be repaired either arthroscopically or by open surgery to&#xD;
      be eligible for enrollment. A reparable rotator cuff tear is defined as a tear of the rotator&#xD;
      cuff where it is possible to bring the retracted tendon edge back to the greater tuberosity&#xD;
      of the humerus without excessive tension. It should be possible to accomplish a watertight&#xD;
      repair or only leave a residual defect of less than or equal to 1cm. The anteroposterior and&#xD;
      mediolateral dimensions of the rotator cuff tear will be assessed intra-operatively by&#xD;
      measurements either including the edges or after the edges are trimmed depending on the&#xD;
      judgment of the surgeon. Rotator cuff tears involving the subscapularis tendon will not be&#xD;
      included in the study, because the postoperative rehabilitation is more difficult and may&#xD;
      confound the outcome results of either group. Surgical variables that should be documented on&#xD;
      source documents and appropriate CRFs are the size of rotator cuff tear, the number of&#xD;
      tendons involved, the type of repair (open, mini-open, arthroscopic) and the type and number&#xD;
      of sutures and anchors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both clinical assessments and magnetic resonance imaging will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the surgical techniques in both groups A and B. A screen/baseline MRI will&#xD;
      be obtained of the affected shoulder during the preoperative visit. This MRI will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the extent of involvement and determine suitability for enrollment into the study&#xD;
      including the size of the tear and extent of muscle atrophy. Images obtained within 3 months&#xD;
      of signing consent may be used to assess eligibility for enrollment. Three additional&#xD;
      follow-up MRIs of the affected shoulder will be obtained as part of the 2 year post-operative&#xD;
      evaluation and will be used to evaluate structural success of group A, suture and anchor or&#xD;
      group B, GraftJacket® allograft augmentation. The MRI scans performed at 6 months, 12 months&#xD;
      and 24 months will be used to determine the rate of re-tear and to help to assess the&#xD;
      integrity of the rotator cuff. Re-tears which are evident on the 6-month MRI will be&#xD;
      considered a failure of the surgical technique, will be excluded from further follow-up&#xD;
      within the study and followed separately. The comparison of the proportions of re-tears in&#xD;
      patients in groups A and B who complete the MRI regimen through 2 years will be used to&#xD;
      determine if GraftJacket® augmentation is a viable alternative to suture and anchor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will use clinical, functional, radiological, assessment of adverse events&#xD;
      and assessment of the surgical techniques of groups A or B to evaluate each patient enrolled&#xD;
      in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre Operative Procedures - Screen (Baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening activities are performed during Visit 1. The protocol requires the following&#xD;

&#xD;
      The protocol requires completion of the following assessments during Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;

      4.7 Scientific validity of the study design: Address the strengths and weaknesses of the&#xD;
      selected design. Specifically indicate why a particular design was selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1 page maximum - adhere to page limitations) Strengths: Prospective Randomized Clinical&#xD;
      Trial Weakness: While not a true weakness, this trial is not randomized in the regular way&#xD;
      but is using the &quot;Expertise Randomization&quot; style where the surgeon chooses his particular&#xD;
      expertise of surgical repair of the rotator cuff (mini-open or arthroscopic) and the patients&#xD;
      are randomized within that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone randomization scheme cannot be used so there will be envelopes available to the&#xD;
      surgeon in the OR for the group.&#xD;
