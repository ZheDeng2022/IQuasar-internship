    <textblock>
      Context: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), i.e., snoring with difficulty breathing&#xD;
      during sleep, is common in children. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is&#xD;
      the usual treatment for children who do not improve following surgery. However, CPAP is&#xD;
      uncomfortable and is often not tolerated. We therefore plan to study a modification of&#xD;
      bilevel positive airway pressure therapy, BiPAP with Bi-Flex that may be more comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether BiPAP with Bi-Flex&#xD;
      results in improvement in adherence as compared to CPAP. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine whether Bi-Flex has similar therapeutic efficacy compared to CPAP, as determined by&#xD;
      sleep study. Additional objectives include comparing CPAP and Bi-Flex effects on comfort and&#xD;
      determining which parameters predict adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Setting/Participants: A single center, randomized controlled double-blind study&#xD;
      of Bi-Flex vs CPAP use in children with OSAS over a 3 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Bi-Flex vs CPAP Study Measures: Objective compliance recordings, sleep study&#xD;
      results, subjective questionnaire results. .&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONALE The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects approximately 2% of&#xD;
      children and results in significant morbidity. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is&#xD;
      the standard therapy for children who fail tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, or for those in&#xD;
      whom surgery is not indicated. However, CPAP is uncomfortable and is often not tolerated by&#xD;
      children. Thus, a more comfortable technology that would enhance adherence would be highly&#xD;
      desirable. This proposal aims to compare a new technology, Bi-Flex, to standard CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP): Whereas conventional CPAP therapy delivers a&#xD;
      constant, steady pressure during inspiration and expiration, BiPAP therapy is intended to&#xD;
      respond to both inspiration and expiration by the patient and to deliver a set amount of&#xD;
      pressure when the patient begins spontaneous inhalation, and decreasing pressure when&#xD;
      exhalation begins. Exhaling against lower pressure is thought to be more comfortable for most&#xD;
      patients than the continuous pressure delivered by conventional CPAP therapy, although it has&#xD;
      not been shown objectively to improve adherence. The BiPAP waveform is fixed in that it&#xD;
      provides for set inspiratory and expiratory pressures. For example, the patient's clinically&#xD;
      prescribed BiPAP pressures may be set at an Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) =12&#xD;
      cm water (H2O), and Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) = 8 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bi-FlexÂ® feature provides a variation of conventional BiPAP that provides a reduction in&#xD;
      the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) provided toward the end of the inspiratory&#xD;
      portion of the breathing cycle when the patient's inspiratory airflow normally diminishes,&#xD;
      compared with the level of pressure provided during the majority of inspiration, and also&#xD;
      allows reduction in the expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) during the initial portion&#xD;
      of exhalation compared with that provided during the latter portion of expiration. The&#xD;
      purpose of this modification is to provide pressure relief for the patient to smooth the&#xD;
      transition period between the end of IPAP and the beginning of EPAP to allow for a more&#xD;
      comfortable delivery of PAP therapy. Because Bi-Flex provides both a lower expiratory&#xD;
      pressure and pressure relief, it has the potential to be the most comfortable mode of&#xD;
      positive pressure therapy delivery available, and therefore to improve adherence. However,&#xD;
      there have been no studies of adherence to therapy using Bi-Flex in either children or&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether BiPAP with Bi-Flex as compared to CPAP results in improvement in&#xD;
           adherence of &gt; 30 minutes a night averaged over 3 months of home use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether BiPAP with Bi-Flex as compared to CPAP results in a lower study&#xD;
           dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether Bi-Flex has similar therapeutic efficacy compared to CPAP, as&#xD;
           determined by polysomnographic measurements of OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether Bi-Flex, compared to CPAP, results in improved subjective comfort&#xD;
           and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether objective parameters (including demographic and polysomnographic&#xD;
           variables) or subjective parameters predict adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This will be a 3-month, double-blinded, randomized trial of BiPAP with Bi-Flex&#xD;
      vs CPAP in children with OSAS in whom CPAP is medically indicated Subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline diagnostic sleep study as part of their routine clinical care, prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Those who agree to participate will then be consented and assented to participate&#xD;
      in this study. They will be randomized to either a Bi-Flex or CPAP treatment arm, in a three&#xD;
      to one fashion. In each arm, each subject will undergo a clinical Bi-Flex or CPAP titration&#xD;
      sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these studies, the subjects in both arms will be asked to use their respective&#xD;
      machines, in either the BiPAP with Bi-Flex or CPAP mode, at home for 3 months. During that&#xD;
      time, they will have monthly visits to assess adherence as well as subjective measures of&#xD;
      comfort and quality of life. A repeat sleep study will be performed at the end of 3 months on&#xD;
      the mode assigned (Bi-Flex or CPAP). Subjects will complete standardized questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding symptoms and quality of life throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS Adherence will be assessed by the mean nightly usage as determined by&#xD;
      the equipment compliance recording. Drop-out will be assessed by determining which subjects&#xD;
      are using the device &lt; 2 hours a night. Efficacy of treatment will be assessed using&#xD;
      polysomnographic parameters such as the apnea hypopnea index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Polysomnographic parameters such as the apnea hypopnea index, arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and end-tidal PCO2 will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL AND ANALYTIC PLAN The primary effectiveness endpoint is the hours of device use&#xD;
      per night over a three month period, as determined from the equipment software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two analysis populations will be evaluated. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis will include&#xD;
      all patients in the trial by their assigned treatment and will be used for effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety. For patients with missing data, values will be imputed as described below. A second&#xD;
      analysis will be done on evaluable patients, i.e., those who have complete data and these&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of adverse events will be compared between the two groups by assessing the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects who experience at least one adverse event by Fisher's exact test. If&#xD;
      the test is statistically significant, then this univariate analysis will be followed by a&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of possible covariates will be done by a method similar to that described in Hosmer&#xD;
      and Lemeshow 25 for logistic regression models. A complete list of clinically relevant&#xD;
      variables to be screened will be provided in a detailed statistical analysis plan formulated&#xD;
      prior to database lock but will include age, gender, height, weight, and others. The&#xD;
      variables on this list will be augmented with variables found to be out of balance between&#xD;
      the treatment groups from the comparability analysis described above. Models will be fit for&#xD;
      each possible covariate to include treatment, the covariate, and the interaction between the&#xD;
      covariate and treatment will be used. Any covariate or interaction significant at a P-value&#xD;
      of 0.15 or lower from the screening analysis will allow the variable to enter the backward&#xD;
      elimination procedure for the final model. If the interaction is significant, then both the&#xD;
      covariate and its interaction need to be included in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The backward elimination will be done manually starting with the interaction with the highest&#xD;
      P-value. Interaction terms will be removed from the model first and then non-significant main&#xD;
      effects. Variables will be retained in the model if the P-value for the variable or its&#xD;
      interaction is 0.05 or less. This analysis is intended to demonstrate that the treatment&#xD;
      affect adjusted for possible covariates is still statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Safety Analyses The secondary safety analysis will include a descriptive&#xD;
      presentation of individual adverse events each tested with Fisher's exact test. Serious&#xD;
      adverse events will be presented separately with narratives of the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness variable is the hours of use per night over three months. This&#xD;
      variable will be summarized with mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The&#xD;
      one-sided lower 95% confidence interval will be computed for the Bi-Flex treated subjects and&#xD;
      the upper one-sided 95% confidence interval will be computed for the CPAP treated subjects.&#xD;
      These two intervals will be visually compared to determine if either interval excludes the&#xD;
      mean of the other treatment. Such exclusion will provide suggestive evidence that the Bi-Flex&#xD;
      treatment leads to higher compliance than the CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, a mixed models analysis of hours of use will be done through three months. This&#xD;
      multivariate analysis incorporating clinically important covariates will screen variables for&#xD;
      inclusion in a manner similar to that described above. Screening of possible covariates will&#xD;
      be done by a method similar to that described in Hosmer and Lemeshow 25 for logistic&#xD;
      regression models as discussed above. The same set of potential covariates as described in&#xD;
      the safety analysis above will be screened. Models will be fit for each possible covariate to&#xD;
      include treatment, the covariate, and the interaction between the covariate and treatment&#xD;
      will be used. Any covariate or interaction significant at a P-value of 0.15 or lower from the&#xD;
      screening analysis will allow the variable to enter the backward elimination procedure for&#xD;
      the final model. If the interaction is significant, then both the covariate and its&#xD;
      interaction need to be included in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The backward elimination will be done manually starting with the interaction with the highest&#xD;
      P-value. Interaction terms will be removed from the model first and then non-significant main&#xD;
      effects. Variables will be retained in the model if the P-value for the variable or its&#xD;
      interaction is 0.05 or less. This analysis is intended to demonstrate that the treatment&#xD;
      affect adjusted for possible covariates is still statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Effectiveness Analyses The drop out rate will be compared between the two groups&#xD;
      will be estimated. The rate for each group will be tabulated and computed with 95% exact&#xD;
      binomial confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective sleep parameters of Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI), arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
      nadir, time with elevated end-tidal partial pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) and the arousal&#xD;
      index will be presented descriptively by treatment group. The tables will include the mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective sleep measures of OSA 18 score, modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the NOSE,&#xD;
      and pediatric quality of life index (PedQL) will be presented descriptively by treatment&#xD;
      group. The tables will include the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Analysis Exploratory analyses of the relationships of study variables to outcomes&#xD;
      will be done to determine if there is the treatment difference is particularly strong is&#xD;
      specific sub-groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Accountability and Missing Data The number and proportion of patients eligible for&#xD;
      and compliant with each follow-up examination will be presented. Patients who withdraw from&#xD;
      the study will be tabulated with the reasons for the withdrawal. If the proportion of&#xD;
      patients withdrawn is larger than the 15% from either arm, an analysis of the demographic and&#xD;
      prognostic characteristics will be made between patients who withdraw and those who remain in&#xD;
      the study. For continuous variables, parametric or non-parametric analysis of variance will&#xD;
      be used. For categorical variables, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of withdrawn patients presents a special concern. All clinical studies analyze&#xD;
      the results based on the evaluable patients, i.e., those who complete the study. Because&#xD;
      withdrawn patients do not have final data, they present a problem. The statistical community&#xD;
      26-29 recommends that multiple sensitivity analyses be conducted to determine the robustness&#xD;
      of the result in patients who complete the study. The intention of these analyses is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the results obtained from the evaluable patients are not biased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation analyses will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the robustness of the study result accounting for missing observations. The&#xD;
      imputation will be a non-parametric multiple imputation in which patients withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study will be randomly assigned outcomes by grouping on demographic and prognostic&#xD;
      characteristics including treatment assignment maintaining masking, matching the&#xD;
      characteristics to the withdrawn patients, and randomly selecting the result for the missed&#xD;
      observation from the results for patients with similar characteristics by method such as &quot;hot&#xD;
      deck&quot; imputation or imputation by regression 30. All imputations will be stochastic&#xD;
      imputations to preserve the variability of the imputed value. Also, imputations will be done&#xD;
      in a manner that is consistent with the assumptions of multiple imputation theory including&#xD;
      missing at random to the extent possible. If the missing at random assumption is clearly&#xD;
      violated by the data, other procedures including selection modeling and pattern mixture&#xD;
      modeling will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Analysis Plan Prior to database lock a detailed statistical analysis plan will be&#xD;
      written to provide a detailed description of the statistical analysis to be used in the final&#xD;
      analysis. This plan will incorporate lists of relevant clinical variables to be tested as&#xD;
      possible covariates and will incorporate any protocol changes that would affect the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Software&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses will be done using SAS version 9.1 or later, statistical software&#xD;
      (StatXact Version 7 or later, and Systat 10 or later). Each of these software packages&#xD;
      provides special features that will be exploited to provide a comprehensive analysis with&#xD;
      excellent graphics support.&#xD;

            <groups_desc>Mann-Whitney test. We hypothesized that Bi-Flex would result in improved adherence but similar efficacy to CPAP.&#xD;
The study sample size of 45 in the Bi-Flex group and 15 in the CPAP group had 80% power to detect an effect size â¥ 0.85 with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. In addition, with this sample size, the 95% CI for the difference between the 2 means had a range of 1.282 SD.</groups_desc>
