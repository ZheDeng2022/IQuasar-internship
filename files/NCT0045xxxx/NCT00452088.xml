    <textblock>
      This will be a study of the safety of MSP 3 LSP candidate malaria vaccine in children aged&#xD;
      1-2 years in Burkina Faso. Three imminizations at 28 day intervals will be administratered&#xD;
      subcuteneously on the shoulder region. The study will compare MSP3 with Engerix B vaccine to&#xD;
      evaluate whether it is just as safe to give to children in malaria endemic country. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate whether the vaccine induces the expected immune responses. Two dose levels&#xD;
      of MSP 3 will be evaluated; 15µg and 30µg to determine the one with the best safety and&#xD;
      immune response profile.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single centre randomized controlled and blinded study (observer blind). It&#xD;
      will be conducted at the CNRFP Vaccinology unit located in Balonghin. Children in the&#xD;
      catchments area within the 1-2 years age group, whose parents consent will be screened to&#xD;
      randomise 45 eligible participants. Two MSP 3 dose levels will be evaluated; 15µg and 30µg.&#xD;
      The study will start with immunizing older children with the lowest dose observing safety&#xD;
      parameters closely, then proceed to to the higher dose with a two week of observation apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, biological and immune response data gathered after vaccination with 15µg and 30µg&#xD;
      MSP 3 LSP will be compared to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The children's baseline data before vaccinations, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The post vaccination data of children in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will ensure that the comparison groups are similar in relevant characteristics&#xD;
      at baseline. The concealment of allocation before enrolment will further enforce the&#xD;
      randomisation. Individuals who will make the assessment of the study end points will be&#xD;
      completely blinded of the vaccine administered. This will ensure that there is no observer&#xD;
      bias. Further, reporting or information bias will be minimised, because the recipients will&#xD;
      also not be aware of which vaccine they have been administered. This is possible because the&#xD;
      selected control vaccine has not been in routine use in this area, and has only now been&#xD;
      recommended by the Ministry of Health. Cross over immunisation at the end of the trial will&#xD;
      involve only those children who will received the study vaccine; they will be administered&#xD;
      the control vaccine in the interest of public health benefits for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule of vaccination at 0, 1 and 2 months has been adopted because it is suitable for&#xD;
      the target group. The idea is to eventually deploy the vaccine through the expanded programme&#xD;
      on immunisation should the vaccine become registered for public use. For the EPI age group,&#xD;
      it is not only an efficient delivery mechanism, but they are also the most vulnerable group&#xD;
      to malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the groups will be allocated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 23 participants (15 receiving MSP-3 vaccine 15 µg and 8 receiving Hepatitis B&#xD;
           vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 22 participants (15 receiving MSP-3 vaccine 30 µg and 7 receiving Hepatitis B&#xD;
           vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization schedule will be 0, 1, and 2 months for all cohorts and provisionally as&#xD;
      following for each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study days 0, 28 and 56 for group 1; and Study days 14, 42, 70 for group 2 Vaccinations of&#xD;
      groups 1 and 2 will be staggered: immunization in group 2 will start 2 weeks after group 1.&#xD;
      This interval may be extended if deemed necessary due to SAEs or other safety&#xD;
      concerns.Randomization will be done for each group at the times of first vaccinations.Route&#xD;
      of inoculation will be by subcutaneous injection into right or left deltoid (alternately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will be observed for at least 60 minutes after vaccination to evaluate and treat&#xD;
      any acute adverse events (AEs). Study duration will be approximately 13 months per&#xD;
      participant. There will be a seven (7) day follow-up period for solicited adverse events (day&#xD;
      of vaccination plus 6 subsequent days); and twenty eight (28) day follow-up period for&#xD;
      unsolicited adverse events (Vaccination day plus 27 subsequent days). The follow-up for&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAE's) will be for 12 months following the first dose of study&#xD;
      vaccine (9 months after dose 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the follow-up period for unsolicited AEs (i.e., one month after the third&#xD;
      dose), participants will be followed by field workers at home at monthly intervals to record&#xD;
      SAEs. For data collection, conventional paper Case Report Forms (in triplicate copies) will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis is foreseen after day 84 of follow up. At this stage decision will be&#xD;
      considered whether to proceed to a phase 2b study or not, and with which dosage of MSP 3,&#xD;
      based on the safety and immunogenicity profile.&#xD;
