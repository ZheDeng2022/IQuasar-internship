      (Lupron-Depot-3) in relieving symptoms of endometriosis, 2) to compare bone density in the&#xD;
      two treated groups in order to demonstrate that NA does not affect bone density; (B) Minor:&#xD;
      1) To compare the lipid profiles of patients in the two groups to confirm the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the effects of NA and GnRH agonists on lipid profiles are similar, 2) To determine whether&#xD;
      quality of life, assessed by questionnaire, is better in patients assigned to NA than in&#xD;
      patients assigned to GnRH, 3) To determine whether NA has fewer adverse effects than GnRH&#xD;

      Objectives: (A) Major 1) to compare the effectiveness of norethindrone acetate (NA) with GnRH&#xD;
      agonist (Lupron-Depot-3) in relieving symptoms of endometriosis, 2) to compare bone density&#xD;
      in the two treated groups in order to demonstrate that NA does not affect bone density; (B)&#xD;
      Minor: 1) To compare the lipid profiles of patients in the two groups to confirm the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the effects of NA and GnRH agonists on lipid profiles are similar, 2) To&#xD;
      determine whether quality of life, assessed by questionnaire, is better in patients assigned&#xD;
      to NA than in patients assigned to GnRH, 3) To determine whether NA has fewer adverse effects&#xD;
      than GnRH agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an IRB approved consent from 112 women with symptomatic endometriosis,&#xD;
      diagnosed surgically, will be treated with NA or Lupron-Depot-3 for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks&#xD;
      both groups will be treated only with NA until 52 weeks. After that, both groups will be&#xD;
      followed for an additional 52 weeks to assess any return of clinical symptoms and to&#xD;
      determine whether laboratory tests of drug related changes return to pretreatment levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens are as follows: For the first 24 weeks, women in the NA group will be&#xD;
      treated with 5 mg NA daily and a placebo injection every 12 weeks. In case of bleeding, the&#xD;
      NA dose will be increased (max 15 mg) until bleeding stops, and then decreased by 2.5 mg&#xD;
      every 4 weeks to a final dose of 7.5 mg which will be maintained for the remainder of the 24&#xD;
      weeks. For the first 24 weeks, women in the GnRH groups will receive Lupron-Depot-3&#xD;
      injections every 12 weeks plus placebo pills daily - bleeding will be treated with an&#xD;
      increase in placebo pills to simulate treatment in the NA group. After 24 weeks, all women&#xD;
      will be on identical regimens of 5 mg NA pills daily and no injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first treatment day, subjects will have the following tests/assessments: bone density&#xD;
      with DEXA, scoring of endometriosis symptoms, quality of life questionnaire, general physical&#xD;
      examination, lipid profile, estradiol (E2), N-telopeptide, and pregnancy test. All tests,&#xD;
      except bone density and lipid profile, will be repeated at 12, 24, and 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Bone density will be performed at 24 and 52 weeks and lipid profile will be performed at 12&#xD;
      and 52 weeks of treatment. In the follow-up period, physical examination, quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, scoring of symptoms will be done at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Lipid profile,&#xD;
      N-telopeptide and E2 will be performed at 3 and 12 months and bone density at 12 month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives stated above will be compared between the two groups at 12, 24, and 52 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment and at 6-month intervals during the follow-up period.&#xD;
