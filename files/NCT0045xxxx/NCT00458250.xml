  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients suffering various malignant and non-malignant diseases need hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation from a healthy person. In the majority of cases there is no matched&#xD;
      related or unrelated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some researchers have been performed transplantation from semi-matched (haploidentical)&#xD;
      related donors with relatively good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese researchers have been performed this kind of transplantation using CAMPATH-1H and&#xD;
      their reports indicates good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese populations have more homogenous genetic background than Iranians. In this project,&#xD;
      we are going to study the feasibility of this method of haploidentical transplantation in&#xD;
      Iranian patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a very important therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention for treatment of some genetic disorders and hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the majority of cases, there is no matched related or unrelated donor. Haploidentical&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a promising alternative for critical cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), two types of T cell depletion (TCD) had&#xD;
      been used: total TCD and partial TCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total TCD has disadvantages such as increased rate of rejection and relapse, and increased&#xD;
      rate of infections due to delayed immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial TCD has been done by in vivo and/or in vitro methods. In haploidentical&#xD;
      transplantation, donor partial TCD (ex vivo TCD) without recipient TCD increases the rate of&#xD;
      rejection and can not prevent severe GVHD successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo TCD by partial depletion of donor and recipient T cells has been done in&#xD;
      haploidentical transplantation with good results (to some extent inferior to full matched&#xD;
      transplantations) by using CAMPATH, ATG, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these studies have been performed in Chinese and Japanese populations that have more&#xD;
      homogenous genetic background than other populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the feasibility of this kind of transplantation in Iranian patients, we&#xD;
      defined a project to perform haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation by using&#xD;
      in vivo CAMPATH-1H.&#xD;
