      The purpose of the study is to establish the normal levels of the hormone adiponectin in&#xD;
      women. Adiponectin is a newly discovered hormone, which is said to be associated with many&#xD;
      changes in the human body and metabolism. The researchers aim is to establish the normal&#xD;
      levels of this hormone. Hence, the researchers can identify people with abnormal levels who&#xD;
      may be at risk of diseases and can do more studies to help them.&#xD;

      The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent years . It is commonly&#xD;
      associated with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and the&#xD;
      coexistence of these diseases has been termed the metabolic syndrome. White Adipose Tissue&#xD;
      (WAT) has been increasingly recognized as an important endocrine organ that secretes a number&#xD;
      of biologically active &quot;adipokines&quot; . Of these adipokines, adiponectin has recently attracted&#xD;
      much attention because of its antidiabetic and antiatherogenic effects and is expected to be&#xD;
      a novel therapeutic tool for diabetes and the metabolic syndrome . Adiponectin directly&#xD;
      regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by activation of AMPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adiponectin expression is reduced in obese, insulin-resistant rodent models. Plasma&#xD;
      adiponectin levels are also decreased in an obese rhesus monkey model that frequently&#xD;
      develops type 2 diabetes. Levels have also been reported to be reduced in obese humans,&#xD;
      particularly those with visceral obesity, and to correlate inversely with insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Prospective and longitudinal studies have shown that lower adiponectin levels are associated&#xD;
      with a higher incidence of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoadiponectinemia has been demonstrated to be independently associated with the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Reduced plasma adiponectin levels are also commonly observed in a variety of states&#xD;
      frequently associated with insulin resistance, such as cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, and hypertension. In women, lower adiponectin levels were associated with breast&#xD;
      cancer, endometrial cancer, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By establishing normal serum levels of Adiponectin, researchers will be able to demonstrate&#xD;
      deviations from the norm associated with investigated diseases and variables. When applied to&#xD;
      pregnancy, it will help identify obstetrical complications associated with abnormal levels.&#xD;
