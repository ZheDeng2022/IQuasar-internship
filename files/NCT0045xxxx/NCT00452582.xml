  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of&#xD;
      serious long-term disability. Approximately 50% of the 750,000 people affected by stroke each&#xD;
      year have residual physical impairment. Treatment options for recovery are limited at this&#xD;
      time. Sildenafil (Viagra) has demonstrated the capability of significantly improving recovery&#xD;
      in several animal experiments of stroke. This study is aiming to establish the safety of&#xD;
      treatment with sildenafil in people with stroke with the ultimate aim of testing its&#xD;
      usefulness to improve recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious long-term&#xD;
      disability in the United States. Approximately 15-30% of stroke survivors are permanently&#xD;
      disabled. Twenty eight percent of stroke patients are under age 65 which results in a loss of&#xD;
      work income. While many restorative therapies are touted as promising for the treatment of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, to date none are approved for this purpose. Sildenafil (Viagra®), a&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce mortality and improve the&#xD;
      functional outcomes of young and aged rats when administered 24 hours and 7 days after stroke&#xD;
      onset. Such results are encouraging and warrant further investigation in human stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to assess the safety of treating ischemic stroke patients&#xD;
      with sildenafil (Viagra®) and to evaluate their outcomes at day 90. This will be a phase I&#xD;
      dose-escalation study with cohort sizes of 12 patients (depending on the occurrence of&#xD;
      serious adverse events). A total enrollment of 120 patients is planned. Patients who are&#xD;
      between 4 and 7 days from stroke onset will receive 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200&#xD;
      mg daily of sildenafil for a period of 14 days. Of the 120 patients, 24 will be randomly&#xD;
      selected to receive standard treatment but will not receive sildenafil. All patients and&#xD;
      physicians will be aware of treatment assignment. Evaluation of potential toxicity will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the course of treatment and during a formal visit at day 16 after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment. Plasma monitoring of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will&#xD;
      be made prior to treatment, at days 7, 16, 30, 60, and 90. Measurements of NIHSS scores,&#xD;
      Rankin scores, and Barthel indices will be made at days 30, 60, and 90. Patients will also be&#xD;
      assessed for color vision changes and sexual function during day 16 and day 90 visits. There&#xD;
      will be every other day phone calls to patients while on treatment. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be death, recurrent stroke, and myocardial infarction during treatment.&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis will include functional outcomes as measured on the neurological scales,&#xD;
      and changes in VEGF levels in relation to clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective is to identify a safe and easily administered treatment that improves&#xD;
      functional outcome in patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
