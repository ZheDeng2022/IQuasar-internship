    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the drug ranibizumab is an effective treatment for macular&#xD;
      telangiectasia, a condition in which existing blood vessels near the macula (the back part of&#xD;
      the eye responsible for sharp central vision) become dilated and twisted, and new abnormal&#xD;
      blood vessels may form under the retina. Both the existing dilated vessels, as well the new&#xD;
      subretinal vessels can leak fluid and blood, distort the retina, and affect vision. This&#xD;
      study will see if ranibizumab can slow or stop the leakage and growth of existing, dilated,&#xD;
      macular vessels in cases where new vessel formation under the retina is absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have macular telangiectasia without new blood vessel&#xD;
      formation may be eligible for this study. Visual acuity must be 20/40 or worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive at least four injections of ranibizumab into the eye over a 12-week&#xD;
      period. After the fourth injection, additional injections may be given every 4 weeks for up&#xD;
      to 1 year if the doctor determines that they may be of benefit. In addition to ranibizumab&#xD;
      treatment, patients undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, including dilation of the pupils and measurement of the fluid pressure&#xD;
           in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiogram: A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the&#xD;
           blood vessels in the eyes. Photographs of the retina are taken with a special camera&#xD;
           that flashes a blue light into the eye. The photos show whether any dye has leaked from&#xD;
           the vessels into the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine green angiography: This procedure identifies feeder vessels that may be&#xD;
           supplying the abnormal blood vessels. The test is similar to fluorescein angiography,&#xD;
           but uses a green dye and flashes an invisible light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autofluorescence imaging: This test examines how well the retina functions. The back of&#xD;
           the eye is photographed with a bright light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography: This test measures retinal thickness. A light shined into&#xD;
           the eye produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. The measurements are repeated&#xD;
           during the study to determine if retinal thickening is getting better or worse, or&#xD;
           staying the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography: The pupils are dilated and special photographs of&#xD;
           the inside of the eye are taken to evaluate the retina and measure changes that occur&#xD;
           over time. The camera flashes a bright light into the eye for each picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits: The doctor evaluates the effects of the study treatment before and&#xD;
           after each injection. Patients are contacted by phone 3 days after each injection to&#xD;
           check on any treatment side effects. A final follow-up visit is scheduled 8 weeks after&#xD;
           the last treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retinal telangiectasis is a group of rare, idiopathic retinal vascular anomalies affecting&#xD;
      the retinal capillaries in which irregular capillary dilation and incompetence occur in the&#xD;
      macula. This is the former group 2 in the Gass classification of idiopathic juxtafoveal&#xD;
      telangiectasia in which fluorescein angiography showed leakage with capillary dilation. These&#xD;
      patients typically are diagnosed in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Both sexes may be&#xD;
      affected. Minimal exudation, superficial retinal crystalline deposits, and right-angle&#xD;
      venules characterize this disorder. As the disease progresses, intraretinal pigment plaques&#xD;
      and eventually subretinal/choroidal neovascularization develop. Currently, these patients&#xD;
      will be classified as macular telangiectasia. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown.&#xD;
      Because of the leakage of the retinal vessels and also the finding of neovascularization, it&#xD;
      is possible that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be implicated in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of ranibizumab for the treatment&#xD;
      of five participants with macular telangiectasia with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography, with vision decreased to 20/40 or worse, without neovascularization. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be a visual acuity change, either increase or decrease of 15 letters or more at&#xD;
      one year. The secondary outcomes measured at one year will include visual acuity changes of&#xD;
      10 letters or more, the change in retinal thickening documented by OCT, the extent and degree&#xD;
      of fluorescein leakage, the change in area of hypofluorescence, and the change in central&#xD;
      retinal sensitivity. This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of treating patients with macular telangiectasia in a larger, phase III study within&#xD;
      the organization of the MAC TEL Research Group, sponsored by the Lowy Foundation. Currently,&#xD;
      the research group is enrolling 200 patients affected with this condition for a natural&#xD;
      history study in 22 international clinical centers.&#xD;
