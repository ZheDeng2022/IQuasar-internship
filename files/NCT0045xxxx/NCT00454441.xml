  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopausal women often complain of difficulty sleeping and the transition from pre- to&#xD;
      postmenopausal status is associated with an incresase in self-reported sleep disturbance. Hot&#xD;
      flashes have been associated with self-reported measures of sleep disturbance and changes in&#xD;
      sleep pattern as measured by plysomnography, including an increase in stage 4 and a latency&#xD;
      or shortened time in rapid-eye movement sleep. Although there are some data on the effect of&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy on self-reported sleep measures in symptomatic postmenopausal&#xD;
      women, there are no data on the effect of herbal extracts on subjective or objective measures&#xD;
      of sleep quality in this population group. Actigraphy, the use of a device to record movement&#xD;
      generally placed on the wrist, has been used over 20 years to provide objective data&#xD;
      concerning sleep/wake patterns. The advantage of actigraphy over traditional polysomnography&#xD;
      is that actigraphy can conveniently record continuously for 24-hours a day for longer periods&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of MF101 (a combination of Chinese herbs) compared to placebo on&#xD;
           change in sleep quality utilizing baseline and follow-up actigraphy obtained from a&#xD;
           subset of approximately 90 women enrolled in the randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
           placebo-controlled Chinese Herbs for Menopausal Symptoms (CHIMES) trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TO identify the correlates of sleep quality as assessed by actigraphy in women with&#xD;
           frequent hot flashes. We will evaluate demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, medical&#xD;
           and gynecologic history and hormonal factors that may relate to the actigraphic measures&#xD;
           of sleep quality, including self-reported measures of sleep.&#xD;
