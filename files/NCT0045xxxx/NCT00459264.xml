      The purpose of this study is to determine whether daily folic acid supplements can prevent&#xD;
      new episodes of mood disorder in young people (aged 14-24 years) of biological parents with&#xD;
      current or past history of depression or bipolar disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder and recurrent major depression are life-long disabling illnesses that often&#xD;
      first become clinically apparent in the late teenage years or early twenties. People who&#xD;
      develop clinical mood disorders characteristically have milder, short-lived symptoms of mood&#xD;
      disturbance prior to the onset of clinical illness. These sub-clinical disturbances represent&#xD;
      a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical disorders (Angst 2000; Aalto-Setala,&#xD;
      2002). A number of physiological abnormalities associated with depression persist after&#xD;
      symptom resolution, suggesting that depression may cause a kind of biological &quot;scarring&quot; of&#xD;
      the brain that can predispose to further episodes of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional supplements are a feasible intervention for primary prevention because they are&#xD;
      likely to be acceptable and intuitively would seem to have a greater chance of being&#xD;
      effective at a preventative stage, rather than later when disease progression has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folate and mood disturbance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low plasma and red cell folate have long been associated with clinical depressive disorders&#xD;
      and treatment with folic acid (500mcg daily) has been shown to improve the therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of fluoxetine in depressed patients (see Coppen and Bailey, 2000). A growing number of&#xD;
      epidemiological studies also suggest links between low folate status, increased homocysteine&#xD;
      and depressive symptomatology in the general population (Tiemeier et al, 2002; Bjelland et&#xD;
      al, 2003; Morris et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine whether folic acid supplementation can prevent new episodes of mood disorder&#xD;
      in teenage children of parents with recurrent depression or bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether folic acid supplementation can improve depression scores on the&#xD;
           Mood and Feeling Questionnaire in teenage children of parents with recurrent depression&#xD;
           or bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether folic acid supplementation can improve scores on the Altman Mania&#xD;
           Rating Scale in teenage children of parents with recurrent depression or bipolar&#xD;
           disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether there is a correlation between genotypes for folate enzymes and&#xD;
           response to folate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Occurrence of an episode of Axis 1 mood disorder on DSM-IV as determined by the Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Score on The Mood and Feeling Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in score on the Altman Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation between genotypes for folate enzymes and response to folate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, concealed allocation, placebo-controlled study with masking of&#xD;
      participants and investigators. Participants will initially enter a 4 week run-in phase&#xD;
      during which they take folic acid (2.5mg). If consent and compliance are maintained during&#xD;
      the active run-in, participants with then be randomised to one of two treatments in a&#xD;
      parallel group design (a) Folic acid (2.5mg daily) or (b) identical placebo liquid. A&#xD;
      web-based algorithm will be used which will be accessed by researchers either online or by&#xD;
      phone call to the study office. Access to the randomisation code will be limited to the trial&#xD;
      programmer with temporary access given to another member of the trial team during her&#xD;
      absence. The treatment period will be thirty six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-EMPT will continue screening until there are 200 teenagers in the randomised phase, male&#xD;
      and female (14-24 years of age) who have a biological parent with a life-time history of&#xD;
      recurrent major depression, bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Family history will be assessed&#xD;
      using proband questions. Subjects will be excluded if they have any current or past DSM-IV&#xD;
      Axis I disorder. This will be assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV&#xD;
      (SCID). Current or past sub-syndromal mood and anxiety disorder will not be a reason for&#xD;
      exclusion but will be assessed and used in the minimization process.We will also exclude&#xD;
      subjects with a significant on-going medical condition, particularly epilepsy or those who&#xD;
      are already using folate supplements and who are unwilling to give them up for the duration&#xD;
      of the study. All subjects will give informed written consent to the study and a parent or&#xD;
      guardian will also give written consent where subjects are under 16 years of age.&#xD;
      Minimization will be carried out for age, gender, family history and the presence of&#xD;
      sub-syndromal mood disturbance to ensure balanced treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratings and follow-up On entry to the study subjects will complete ten self-rating&#xD;
      instruments, the Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (MFQ), a 32-item scale designed to detect and&#xD;
      monitor adolescent depression in the community (Cooper and Goodyer, 1993; Wood et al, 1995).&#xD;
      Subjects will also complete the Altman Mania Rating Scale, a 5-item scale designed to mania&#xD;
      (Altman et al, 1997), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a 5-item scale designed to detect&#xD;
      the severity of insomnia (Morin 1993), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a&#xD;
      14 item scale to determine anxiety and depression (Zigmond and Snaith 1983). Subsequently&#xD;
      subjects will complete the MFQ, Altman, ISI and HADS monthly. We will have available both&#xD;
      web-based assessments and written forms, whichever the participant prefers. The other rating&#xD;
      scales to be completed on entry are the Cambridge Life Events Rating Scale (CLE), Eysenck&#xD;
      Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Response Styles Questionnaire (RSQ), Parental Bonding&#xD;
      Inventory (PBI), Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire (CAS). and the&#xD;
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At six monthly intervals subjects will be re-interviewed with the SCID to assess whether they&#xD;
      have met criteria for any DSM-IV Axis I disorder in the preceding six months. The CLE and CAS&#xD;
      will also be repeated at six monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entry to the investigation we ask subjects to provide a blood sample for the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full blood count, Red cell folate, B12, homocysteine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DNA sample for polymorphisms of the proteins involved in folate metabolism and related&#xD;
           neurotransmitters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measures (apart from the DNA analysis) will be repeated annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to entry we also wish to assess waking salivary cortisol. In a separate study we have&#xD;
      found that healthy young people with a parent who has a history of mood disorder (ie the same&#xD;
      participant population that we are recruiting for this study) have elevated waking levels of&#xD;
      salivary cortisol relative to controls.The measurement of waking salivary cortisol is a&#xD;
      simple non-invasive test which may represent a marker of vulnerability to depression. If this&#xD;
      is the case it might be altered by folate treatment which we are using in the present study&#xD;
      to decrease the risk of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to ask subjects to take a sample of waking salivary cortisol before they&#xD;
      begin folate/placebo treatment and again after about six months in the study. In this way we&#xD;
      will be able to assess the effect of folate/placebo treatment on waking salivary cortisol.&#xD;
      The eventual aim will be assess whether relative to placebo folic acid treatment lowers&#xD;
      waking salivary cortisol and whether this is associated with decreased risk of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the point of view of storage and custody the saliva samples will be treated exactly as&#xD;
      the blood samples taken for folate estimation.&#xD;
