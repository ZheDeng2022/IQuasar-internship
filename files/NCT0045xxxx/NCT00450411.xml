      RATIONALE: Implant radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a&#xD;
      tumor to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      implant radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer&#xD;
      previously treated with external-beam radiation therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the late treatment-related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU)&#xD;
           adverse events in patients with locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
           previously treated with external-beam radiotherapy who are currently receiving&#xD;
           transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the acute treatment-related GI and GU adverse events in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine clinical patterns of tumor recurrence (time to local tumor progression or&#xD;
           distant failure) in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103&#xD;
      brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive at 5 Years (Overall Survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival time is defined as time from registration to date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis occurred after all patients were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive Without Disease (Disease-free Survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An event for disease-free survival is defined as local progression, distant progression, biochemical failure, initiation of salvage hormone therapy, or death due to any cause.Biochemical failure is defined as a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by at least 2 ng/mL over the current nadir. Local progression is defined as documented progressive disease on digital rectal examination or a post-implant prostate biopsy showing carcinoma. Distant progression is defined as documented lymphatic or hematogenous metastatic disease. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of first event or last known follow-up (censored). Disease-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Prostate Cancer Death at 5 Years (Disease-specific Survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An event for prostate cancer death is defined as any of the following: primary cause of death certified as due to prostate cancer, death associated with tumor progression occurring after initiation of salvage anti-tumor therapy, death associated with a rise in the serum PSA level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurs during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy, death associated with disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy, or death from a complication of protocol therapy irrespective of disease status. Time to prostate cancer death is defined as time from registration to date of first event, last known follow-up (censored), or death unrelated to prostate cancer (competing risk). Prostate cancer death rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Local Failure at 5 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Local progression is defined as documented progressive disease on digital rectal examination or a post-implant prostate biopsy showing carcinoma. Time to local failure is defined as time from randomization to the date of first local failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local failure (competing risk). Local failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all patients were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Distant Failure at 5 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Distant failure is defined as documented lymphatic or hematogenous metastatic disease. Time to distant failure is defined as time from registration to the date of first distant failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without distant failure (competing risk). Distant failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Biochemical Failure at 4 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical failure is defined as PSA 2 ng/ml or more higher than the nadir PSA value, or initiation of hormone therapy at any time after brachytherapy. (If the PSA rise is within 36 months following brachytherapy and is followed by a subsequent non-hormonal induced PSA decrease, the patient will not be considered as a failure.) Time to biochemical failure is defined as time from registration to the date of first biochemical failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without local recurrence (competing risk). Biochemical failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>

        <description>An event for prostate cancer death is defined as any of the following: primary cause of death certified as due to prostate cancer, death associated with tumor progression occurring after initiation of salvage anti-tumor therapy, death associated with a rise in the serum PSA level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurs during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy, death associated with disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy, or death from a complication of protocol therapy irrespective of disease status. Time to prostate cancer death is defined as time from registration to date of first event, last known follow-up (censored), or death unrelated to prostate cancer (competing risk). Prostate cancer death rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>

          <description>An event for prostate cancer death is defined as any of the following: primary cause of death certified as due to prostate cancer, death associated with tumor progression occurring after initiation of salvage anti-tumor therapy, death associated with a rise in the serum PSA level on at least two consecutive occasions that occurs during or after salvage androgen suppression therapy, death associated with disease progression in the absence of any anti-tumor therapy, or death from a complication of protocol therapy irrespective of disease status. Time to prostate cancer death is defined as time from registration to date of first event, last known follow-up (censored), or death unrelated to prostate cancer (competing risk). Prostate cancer death rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis occurred after all participants were potentially observed for at least 5 years from registration.</description>
