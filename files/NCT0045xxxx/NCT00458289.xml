  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) commonly have high concentrations of&#xD;
      phosphorous, a mineral, in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). This is a result of their inability&#xD;
      to excrete phosphorous by the kidneys. This in turn may result in the development of a&#xD;
      condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy or bone disease. As&#xD;
      such, these patients often receive medications known as phosphate binders such as calcium&#xD;
      carbonate or acetate, sevelamer, aluminum hydroxide and lanthanum carbonate to manage and&#xD;
      treat hyperphosphatemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lanthanum carbonate is a newly available phosphate binding agent that is effective in the&#xD;
      management of hyperphosphatemia and preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism. It works in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract by binding to the phosphorus in the diet. ESRD patients taking&#xD;
      lanthanum carbonate are counseled to chew the tablets completely before swallowing, with or&#xD;
      immediately after meals. However, patients who are intubated or receiving nutrition via&#xD;
      feeding tubes are unable to chew the tablets. For these patients, medications are commonly&#xD;
      crushed and administered via the tube. Moreover, some patients prefer to crush the tablets&#xD;
      and mix it with food instead of chewing. To date, it is not known if crushing the lanthanum&#xD;
      carbonate tablets prior to administration and taking it with food would be as effective as&#xD;
      chewing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of phosphate binding between chewed and&#xD;
      crushed lanthanum carbonate tablets.&#xD;
