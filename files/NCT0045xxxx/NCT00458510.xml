  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients taking regular medication for their pain often still have episodes of severe&#xD;
      pain that 'break through' despite their background pain treatment. Fentanyl is a strong,&#xD;
      short-acting pain killer often used to treat this 'breakthrough' pain. Nasalfent contains&#xD;
      fentanyl in a patented drug delivery system called PecSys and is given via a simple nasal&#xD;
      spray. This study will examine the long-term safety of Nasalfent in the treatment of&#xD;
      breakthrough cancer pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) work too slowly to meet the fast onset&#xD;
      of most BTCP episodes, they continue to act longer than the episode of pain lasts and so can&#xD;
      have unwanted side effects due to this 'over treatment' of the pain episode. In addition most&#xD;
      cancer patients have oral problems which make taking pain relief medication by mouth&#xD;
      uncomfortable for the patient. Nasalfent is administered via the nose as a simple spray and&#xD;
      can be taken by patients or given by their carers. The nasal route is a common way to&#xD;
      administer medication for example in the treatment of migraine or allergy. At any time during&#xD;
      the study the patient may take their regular treatment for BTCP should they so wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the long-term safety of Nasalfent treatment for breakthrough cancer&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study is completed, patients may continue to take medication if their doctor feels&#xD;
      it is in the patient's best interest to do so. Safety information will continue to be&#xD;
      collected during this period. Treatment may continue on study for as long as the patient&#xD;
      requires treatment or until Nasalfent becomes commercially available.&#xD;
