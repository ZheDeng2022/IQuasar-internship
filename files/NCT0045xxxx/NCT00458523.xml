      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well alemtuzumab works in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in partial remission or complete&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of achieving minimum residual disease (MRD) negativity after&#xD;
           treatment with alemtuzumab in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)&#xD;
           who have low levels of MRD after conventional therapy or who relapse at an MRD level&#xD;
           after a prior MRD-negative remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of alemtuzumab in patients treated in the MRD-positive setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to MRD relapse in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of this drug when administered as consolidation/maintenance therapy&#xD;
           on CD52 expression on CLL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of repeated drug dosing required to achieve sustained&#xD;
           MRD negativity in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation: Patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status are observed&#xD;
           every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter. If they become&#xD;
           MRD-positive, then they are eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Patients with MRD-positive status receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously or IV&#xD;
           over 2 hours three times weekly for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
           or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 weeks of study therapy, patients are&#xD;
           evaluated for response. Patients who remain MRD-positive and are responding to study&#xD;
           therapy receive an additional 6 weeks of treatment. Patients who remain MRD-positive and&#xD;
           show no significant improvement in the level of leukemic cells detected in their&#xD;
           peripheral blood or bone marrow are removed from the study. Patients achieving&#xD;
           MRD-negative remission are removed from study therapy and monitored for disease&#xD;
           recurrence at an MRD level. If MRD-level relapse is confirmed in these patients, they&#xD;
           may be retreated with alemtuzumab provided their initial response to therapy lasted for&#xD;
           at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood and bone marrow periodically during study for&#xD;
      assessment of MRD by MRD flow cytometry, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis,&#xD;
      somatic mutation analysis, and B-cell selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
