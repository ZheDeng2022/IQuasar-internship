      This study is a retrospective chart review of recently deployed veterans who served during&#xD;
      the Iraq conflicts and were seen at the TVAMC in the outpatient Primary Care outpatient&#xD;
      clinic that was recently set-up for newly returning veterans since its inception through July&#xD;
      1, 2005. Identical data will be collected on non-combat veterans that were seen in other&#xD;
      primary care clinics at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center during June 2004 and July 1, 2005.&#xD;
      This information will be used for comparison with the Iraqi veterans group. The data will be&#xD;
      retrieved from a computerized list of these patients. Charts will then be examined to&#xD;
      determine sociodemographic, medical, psychiatric, and health care utilization&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

      The information will also be used internally at the TVAMC to better define treatment needs&#xD;
      and also used in presentations and possible publications at professional meetings and in&#xD;
      journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this study is designed to be hypothesis generating for large prospective studies, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that a majority of the recently deployed veterans who served in the Iraq conflict&#xD;
      are in need of basic primary health care needs for illnesses that are common place among&#xD;
      patients within this age group, except for a higher than expected prevalence of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders compared to usual primary care treatment-seeking populations.&#xD;
