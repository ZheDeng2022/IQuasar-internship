  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial in healthy, post-menopausal women is designed as a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending single-dose safety trial. MF101 will be&#xD;
      administered as a single oral dose to a total of 32 enrolled subjects between the ages of&#xD;
      40-65 years. Eight subjects will be assigned to each of four cohorts. Within each cohort, six&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive MF101 and two subjects will receive placebo. MF101&#xD;
      doses will be incrementally escalated until the stopping criteria are reached. If stopping&#xD;
      criteria are reached before the fourth cohort receives dosing, the next cohort may receive a&#xD;
      dose between the dose that was administered to the cohort exhibiting symptoms of MF101&#xD;
      toxicity and the next lower dose group.&#xD;

      The primary goal of this study is to identify the highest safe oral dose of MF101 that is&#xD;
      well tolerated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals include: characterizing clinical symptoms of MF101 toxicity in healthy&#xD;
      subjects and evaluating the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of key MF101 active components&#xD;
      after a single oral dose.&#xD;
