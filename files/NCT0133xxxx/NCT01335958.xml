        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at&#xD;
             least one dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Ovarian Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has&#xD;
             progressed or relapsed during or within 6 months of the most recent treatment with a&#xD;
             platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen, and for which no standard therapy exists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients in the dose-expansion cohort of the study only, no more than two prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria Specific to Patients with Pancreatic Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incurable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease for which no standard therapy&#xD;
             exists, consisting of unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including&#xD;
             recurrence of previously-resected disease that is considered unresectable with&#xD;
             curative intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than one chemotherapy regimen (approved or experimental) administered in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-tumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal&#xD;
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palliative radiation to bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including&#xD;
             HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail&#xD;
             beds)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current Grade &gt;1 toxicity (except alopecia and anorexia) from prior therapy or Grade&#xD;
             &gt;1 neuropathy from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy&#xD;
             (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,&#xD;
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or requiring&#xD;
             anticonvulsants or corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Patients with a history&#xD;
             of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following&#xD;
             criteria: evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS, radiographic demonstration&#xD;
             of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim&#xD;
             progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening&#xD;
             radiographic study, and the screening CNS radiographic study is &gt;= 8 weeks since&#xD;
             completion of radiotherapy and &gt;= 4 weeks since the discontinuation of corticosteroids&#xD;
             and anticonvulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment&#xD;
             complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases, such as cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease (including stroke, New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease&#xD;
             or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to screening, unstable arrhythmias, and&#xD;
             unstable angina); nervous system, pulmonary (including obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             and history of symptomatic bronchospasm), renal, hepatic, endocrine, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders; or a serious non-healing wound or fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding&#xD;
