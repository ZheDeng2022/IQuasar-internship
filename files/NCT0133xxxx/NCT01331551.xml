    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of high exposure to dibutyl&#xD;
      phthalate (DBP) from the use of Asacol with clinical and intermediate markers of male&#xD;
      fertility, including semen quality, sperm DNA damage, transcript profiles of sperm mRNA and&#xD;
      sncRNAs, and reproductive hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with decreased sperm&#xD;
      concentration and motility, and increased sperm DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with decreased serum&#xD;
      testosterone, altered LH:testosterone ratio, and decreased inhibin-B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: High exposure to DBP from the use of Asacol is associated with altered&#xD;
      transcript profiles of sperm mRNAs and sncRNAs.&#xD;

      There are 2 ways you can participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 1 involves 6 one-hour visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Andrology&#xD;
      Clinic over a 9 month period. At each visit you would be asked to fill out questionnaires and&#xD;
      to provide a urine, semen, and blood sample. Following Visit 2, you are asked to switch your&#xD;
      brand of mesalamine medication. After 4 months, you change back to your original brand of&#xD;
      medication. The change in medication will be done in consultation with your primary GI&#xD;
      doctor. If the cost of co-payment is greater for the new brand of medication, we will provide&#xD;
      compensation to cover the difference. In the case you do not have prescription drug health&#xD;
      insurance coverage, the study will reimburse up to $4000 to cover the cost for Asacol,&#xD;
      Pentasa or Lialda medication taken during your study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 2 involves 4 one-hour visits to MGH Andrology clinic. At each visit you complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and provide a blood, urine and semen sample. You are eligible for Option 2 if&#xD;
      you are currently taking Asacol or Asacol HD and do not want to change your medication.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Altered semen quality and sperm transcriptome analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial analysis takes place approximately 4-5 months after patient enrolls and after he has completed first crossover of medication. The second phase takes place about 8-10 months later after he crosses back to original medication.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum levels of reproductive hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Analysis of hormone levels take place at the same intervals described above, 4-5 months after enrollment and then again 8-10 months after enrollment when patient has resumed taking orginal medication.</time_frame>
