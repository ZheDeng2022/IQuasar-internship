  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalation, inpatient study of&#xD;
      single doses of S. sonnei. Health adult subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 45 years of age&#xD;
      (inclusive) will be screened. Enroll serial groups up to 90 subjects. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate safety and tolerance of WRSs2 by monitoring presence, frequency and severity&#xD;
      of clinical signs and symptoms. A secondary objective is to evaluate the immune response in&#xD;
      blood and stool following ingestion of WRSs2 and WRSs3.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalation, inpatient&#xD;
      study. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of WRSs2, WRSs3 or placebo. Five doses of&#xD;
      each vaccine, ranging from 1x10^3 to 1x10^7 colony forming units (cfu) will be evaluated in&#xD;
      this study. For each dose, a cohort of 18 subjects (n=18) will be randomized into 3 groups to&#xD;
      receive WRSs2 (n=8), WRSs3 (n=8) and placebo (n=2). The three groups will receive&#xD;
      approximately the same inoculum dose. Ingestion of the vaccine will be preceded by ingestion&#xD;
      of a sodium bicarbonate buffer. Subjects will be enrolled in serial groups at escalating&#xD;
      doses to enable the identification of the dose that minimizes reactogenicity while inducing a&#xD;
      robust immune response while allowing for a head-to-head comparison of the 2 vaccine&#xD;
      candidates. Dose escalation will proceed by approximately 1 log10 cfu levels based on the&#xD;
      observations from the preceding group (up to a maximum dose of 1x10^7 cfu). During the 10-13&#xD;
      day inpatient monitoring period, subjects will be evaluated at least twice daily. This&#xD;
      assessment will include asking about any symptoms they may be experiencing, with targeted&#xD;
      questions for reactogenic symptoms twice each day. Additional assessments will include daily&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs, daily-history directed physical examinations and the collection,&#xD;
      and grading (for consistency) of each stool along and weighing of all loose or watery stools.&#xD;
      Stool specimens or rectal swabs (if unable to produce a stool) will also be evaluated for&#xD;
      grossly visible and occult blood and will be cultured for the presence of the vaccine strain.&#xD;
      All volunteers will receive antibiotic therapy 8 days after inoculation (unless meeting&#xD;
      criteria for early treatment). Subjects will be discharged after initiating antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment and passing 2 consecutive stools (at least 6 hours apart) negative for S. sonnei&#xD;
      using standard stool culture and identification techniques. Following evaluation and&#xD;
      history-directed physical examination, subjects will be discharged, with follow-up on study&#xD;
      days 14+/-1, 28+/-2 and 56+/-4 to provide additional specimens for safety checks or&#xD;
      immunology monitoring. Subjects will be given an ice-pack and cooler for collection of a&#xD;
      stool sample at home which is to be brought to the clinic on the day of the follow-up visit.&#xD;
      An interim safety report will compile findings from the preceding group with the PI's&#xD;
      interpretation and plan to go forward. The Data Safety Monitoring board (DSMB)/Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (SMC) or its equivalent must concur with the plan before proceeding. The&#xD;
      decision to advance to the next highest dose level will be based solely on the safety profile&#xD;
      at the tested dose level and will be made independently for each vaccine candidate. The next&#xD;
      inpatient group (at the next higher dose) will not be admitted until a minimum of 4 weeks&#xD;
      have elapsed from the time of the preceding group's vaccination to ensure adequate time for&#xD;
      safety monitoring. The primary objectives are: to evaluate the safety and clinical tolerance&#xD;
      of WRSs2 and WRSs3 by monitoring the presence and severity of clinical signs and symptoms.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: to evaluate the immune response in blood and stool following&#xD;
      ingestion of WRSs2 and WRSs3; to assess frequency and duration of fecal shedding of WRSs2 and&#xD;
      WRSs3 following ingestion; and to assess any secondary infectious spread of different vaccine&#xD;
      strains (WRSs2 or WRSs3) to subjects.&#xD;
