      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 when given&#xD;
      together with cetuximab in treating patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). Biological therapies, such as TLR8 Agonist&#xD;
      VTX-2337 may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 together with&#xD;
      cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and to assess the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
      VTX-2337 (TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337) when given in conjunction with cetuximab in order to define&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic immune response to VTX-2337 in combination with&#xD;
      cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlative assessments of immunologic response and activity will be performed,&#xD;
      including: Quantitative evaluation of baseline immune status via in-vitro assessment of&#xD;
      cytokine and chemokine response to immunostimulatory agents; quantitative assessment of&#xD;
      plasma cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory markers via protein array; quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of natural killer (NK) cells via flow cytometry; quantitative assessment of&#xD;
      antigen-specific responses in cytokine-producing cells to common prognostic SCCHN antigens&#xD;
      via interferon (INF)gamma-enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether subjects with functional genetic variations in the TLR8 and FC-gamma-R&#xD;
      IIIA genes have altered biological and/or clinical responses to VTX-2337, genetic&#xD;
      characterization of subjects will be performed via standard genotyping assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity for the combination of VTX-2337 and&#xD;
      cetuximab, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days -28, -21, -14, -7&#xD;
      of weeks -4 to -1. Patients then receive cetuximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and TLR8&#xD;
      agonist VTX-2337 subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;
