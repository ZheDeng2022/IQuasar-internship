      Aims: To prove the benefits of an specific strength training program in COPD patients&#xD;
      compared to those achieved with the traditional endurance training. We will assess which is&#xD;
      the proper training modality and which of them is the most beneficial according to the&#xD;
      features of the patient to whom it is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods: We will study 66 patients diagnosed of COPD with a moderate-severe&#xD;
      obstruction (FEV1&lt;60%) and clinically symptomatic. The monitoring will be done for 3 moths.&#xD;
      Patients will be differentiated between COPD with &quot;predominant chronic bronchitis&quot; and COPD&#xD;
      with &quot;predominant emphysema&quot;, with regard to clinical, functional and radiological criteria.&#xD;
      After stratification of the sample, patients will be prospectively assigned to three groups&#xD;
      of 22 patients each: a) Endurance training group, on cycle ergometer at a workload of 70%&#xD;
      VO2max. b) Strength training group, with 5 different weightlifting exercises (4 sets of 6-8&#xD;
      repetitions). c) Mixed training group, with half the time dedicated to each type of training.&#xD;
      Training will be developed during 12 weeks, three times per week, in 40 minutes sessions.&#xD;
      Analysed variables, at the beginning and at the end of program will be: Chest X-ray, basic&#xD;
      blood analyses, electrocardiogram, simple spirometry and bronchodilator test, blood gases,&#xD;
      static pulmonary volumes, diffusion measurement and respiratory muscle pressure. Muscle&#xD;
      strength will be assessed by means of 1RM test and the Myometer® dynamometer. Using the&#xD;
      muscle skeletal ultrasound, we will control changes in muscle fibre size. Maximal and&#xD;
      submaximal exercise tests on cycle ergometer will be also performed, so as a walking test&#xD;
      (shuttle walking test). At last, we will assess treatment effect on dyspnea (Mahler's test)&#xD;
      and quality of life (CRDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A strength training program would significantly increase peripheral muscle power.&#xD;
      This type of training would mainly have effect on the &quot;predominant emphysema&quot; COPD patient,&#xD;
      where the important weight lost causes a decrease in muscle strength.&#xD;

                subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The training of the different groups were carried out for 12 weeks, three times per week&#xD;
           in sessions of 40 minutes duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The resistance training will take place in cycle ergometer with a level of initial&#xD;
                charge of about 70% of initial maximal oxygen consumption, increasing the load&#xD;
                every two weeks as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The strength training with weight lifting practice and will consist of 4 sets of&#xD;
                6-8 repetitions of simple exercises. These are held at a station multigimnástica&#xD;
                (CLASSIC Fitness Center, KETTLER) and are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Simple bending of the arms (pull cable to the chest &quot;Chest pulls&quot;): Effects on&#xD;
                     the latissimus dorsi, deltoids and biceps. Sitting in the face of the tower of&#xD;
                     strength, approaching the bar to the chest and arm span later after return to&#xD;
                     the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Simple extension arms (force to the neck &quot;Neck presses): Effects on the&#xD;
                     deltoids and triceps. Sitting upright on the bench and held the weight to&#xD;
                     shoulder height, arm span will be held over his head, slowly returning after&#xD;
                     bending arms to starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  arm flexion and extension against resistance (Mariposa &quot;Butterfly&quot;): Effects&#xD;
                     on the pectoral and deltoid muscles. Sitting upright on the bench with your&#xD;
                     forearms and elbows on a lever, takes it to the midline, giving way slowly to&#xD;
                     the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Extension legs (leg extension): Effects on quadriceps. Sitting on the bench&#xD;
                     leg extension is performed against resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Leg Curl (leg curls): Effects on femoral biceps and calves. Lying prone on the&#xD;
                     bench legs are flexed against the peso.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Resistance is increased gradually from 50% of the maximum weight you can lift the&#xD;
                patient on one occasion, early in the week, up to 85%. Every two weeks the weight&#xD;
                limit is reassessed to adjust the training load in each patient (Test 1 RM).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In the group that carried out the joint training, half the time of each session&#xD;
                will be devoted to strength training, following the same methodology (same number&#xD;
                of years but with two sets of each), and the other half training resistance bike,&#xD;
                beginning with one or the other interchangeably.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon completion of 12 weeks of training will be repeated all baseline tests (except for&#xD;
           chest CT) and compared the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Exit criteria of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient's clinical decompensation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Loss of 3 or 5 consecutive sessions staple&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On the initiative of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzing the effect size at the expense of an improvement in work reached more than about 15&#xD;
      W in the stress test, considered a standard deviation of this parameter of ± 10 W, an alpha&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a beta of 0.1 (statistical power 90%) and calculating a loss ratio of 15%, we&#xD;
      estimate a sample size of 22 patients for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing before and after the training response in each group were performed using the&#xD;
      paired t test. Comparisons between trained groups were made using analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA). The Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis will allow to&#xD;
      examine relationships between physiological variables. Be considered significant at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
      The dispersion of a mean value is expressed as mean ± standard deviation.&#xD;
