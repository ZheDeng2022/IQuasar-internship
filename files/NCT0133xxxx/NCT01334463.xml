      1. To determine whether tasks taken from the field of cognitive neuroscience can detect and&#xD;
           distinguish impairments in executive function above and beyond standard&#xD;
           neuropsychological measures in individuals with: a.) Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI),&#xD;
           b.) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), c.)Mild TBI+PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether performance on these tasks is linked to pertinent psychiatric&#xD;
           outcomes (e.g. history of suicidality), which is associated with compromised executive&#xD;
           function and impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether information regarding brain anatomy can provide additional&#xD;
           information above and beyond behavior performance in distinguishing between these two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)&#xD;
      are reporting histories of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and symptoms associated with post&#xD;
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Standard neuropsychological measures are ineffective at&#xD;
      distinguishing between TBI and PTSD. This pilot project will examine whether methods from&#xD;
      cognitive neuroscience can determine the effects of TBI and/or PTSD on executive function.&#xD;
      Executive function includes many aspects of goal-oriented behavior, including the ability to&#xD;
      inhibit inappropriate behaviors and thoughts. In the proposed study, the investigators are&#xD;
      focusing on inhibitory processing, as it is a core component of executive function. Although&#xD;
      both TBI and PTSD compromise executive function and TBI often occurs in the context of a&#xD;
      traumatic event, very little research has attempted to disentangle the effects that each of&#xD;
      these conditions has on inhibitory control. In addition, the investigators are interested in&#xD;
      how disinhibition may be linked to impulsive real-world behaviors, such as suicidal&#xD;
      tendencies, which are observed at elevated rates in individuals with TBI as well as those&#xD;
      with PTSD. Knowing the ways in which inhibitory functions are compromised in these&#xD;
      individuals should aid in the development of appropriate treatments aimed at functional&#xD;
      improvement for those with mild TBI, PTSD, or mild TBI+PTSD.&#xD;

        psychological or other services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Eastern&#xD;
        Colorado Healthcare System , 2.) those in existing clinical and research databases, and 3.)&#xD;
        Veterans in the community not seeking care within the VHA.&#xD;
