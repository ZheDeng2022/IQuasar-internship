        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors,&#xD;
             refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects&#xD;
             must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if&#xD;
             in the judgment of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and&#xD;
             ethically acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 tumor lesion measurable by computer tomography (CT) scan or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated creatinine clearance 60 mL/min according to Modification of Diet in Renal&#xD;
             Disease Study Group (MDRD) formula(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hypertension should be on a stable anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             treatment for more than 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed&#xD;
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with potentially curable disease will be explicity excluded from&#xD;
             enrollment into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active investigational medicinal product or&#xD;
             excipients of the preparations) or any agent given in association with this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II, unstable angina&#xD;
             (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina (within the past 3 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry), myocardial infarction within the past 3 months prior to study entry, or&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are&#xD;
             permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment, i.e. Child-Pugh class B or C(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B or C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt;3 months from&#xD;
             definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry, and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time&#xD;
             of study entry. Subjects must not be on acute steroid therapy or taper off steroid&#xD;
             therapy (chronic steroid therapy is acceptable provided that the dose is stable for 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry and following screening CT / MRI scan). Subjects with&#xD;
             neurological symptoms should undergo a CT / MRI scan of the brain to exclude new or&#xD;
             progressive brain metastases. Spinal cord metastasis is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or coexisting cancer that is distinct in primary site or histology from the&#xD;
             cancer evaluated in this study EXCEPT cervical cancer in-situ, treated basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, superficial bladder tumors [Ta and Tis], or any cancer curatively treated&#xD;
             &gt;3 years prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry. Mitomycin C or&#xD;
             nitrosoureas should not be given within 6 weeks of study entry. Anticancer therapy is&#xD;
             defined as any agent or combination of agents with clinically proven anti tumor&#xD;
             activity administered by any route with the purpose of affecting the malignancy,&#xD;
             either directly or indirectly, including palliative and therapeutic endpoints.&#xD;
             Accepted exceptions are bisphosphonates, Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)&#xD;
             agonists for prostate cancer, and mitotane for adrenal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy to target lesions within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed as described in Section 6.9 of this protocol.&#xD;
             Radiotherapy to the target lesions during study will be regarded as progressive&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of biological response modifiers, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor&#xD;
             (G-CSF), within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Granulocyte-colony&#xD;
             stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the&#xD;
             management of acute toxicity such as febrile neutropenia when clinically indicated or&#xD;
             at the discretion of the investigator, however, they may not be substituted for a&#xD;
             required dose reduction&#xD;
