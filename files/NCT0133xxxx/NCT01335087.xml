  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its association with&#xD;
      hypertension, stroke, heart attack and sudden death. The standard therapy for symptomatic OSA&#xD;
      is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP has been shown to effectively reduce&#xD;
      snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly reduce blood pressure&#xD;
      and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The overall aim of ISAACC is to determine&#xD;
      if CPAP can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure for people with OSA&#xD;
      admitted in a hospital for an acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its treatment on the clinical&#xD;
      evolution of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine if continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment will reduce the rate&#xD;
      of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal events (acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI), non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new&#xD;
      hospitalizations) for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)) in patients with&#xD;
      ACS and co-occurring sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the prevalence of OSA in patients who have suffered an episode of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other secondary objectives will include the effects of CPAP on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic&#xD;
                stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Components of primary composite endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Re-vascularization procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate all-cause death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate new onset, ECG-confirmed atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, according to standard definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate OSA symptoms (Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS))&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate quality of life in patients with ACS (Test EuroQol (EQ-5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish the relationship between the severity and phenotype of patients with OSA&#xD;
           and clinical outcomes of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish the relationship between CPAP compliance and CV events incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify biological risk markers that allow us to establish the most important&#xD;
           mechanisms involved in cardiovascular complications in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the diagnosis and CPAP treatment of patients&#xD;
           with ACS who have obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: multi-centre, open label, parallel, prospective, randomised, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: We will include consecutive patients with an ACS diagnosis evaluated in&#xD;
      participating Coronary Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites: IRB Lleida (Lleida), Hospital Son Dureta (Palma de Mallorca), Hospital Clínic&#xD;
      (Barcelona), Hospital Germans Tries i Pujol (Barcelona), Hospital de Bellvitge (Barcelona),&#xD;
      Hospital Sant Pau (Barcelona), Hospital Txagorritxu (Vitoria), Hospital de Cruces (Bilbao),&#xD;
      Hospital San Pedro de Alcántara (Cáceres), Hospital Parc Taulí (Barcelona) and Hospital de&#xD;
      Guadalajara (Guadalajara), Hospital de Vallecas (Madrid), Hospital de Yagüe (Burgos),&#xD;
      Hospital de Requena (Valencia), Hospital San Juan, (Alicante), Hospital Central de Asturias&#xD;
      (Oviedo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: 3 years. Methodology: During a hospital stay we will assess the degree&#xD;
      of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Scale) in patients treated at the Coronary Care Unit with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACS. The results of this evaluation will define the inclusion of the patient in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with and ESS score ≤ 10 will be included in the study and will undergo a&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory polygraphy. Patients with an AHI ≥ 15 h-1 will be randomized to CPAP&#xD;
      treatment or conservative. Patients with and AHÍ &lt; 15 h-1 will be followed as standard&#xD;
      management according to cardiovascular protocols and will be evaluated as a reference group.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study will have three groups, with a total of 1,864 patients, as follows:&#xD;
      patients with an AHI ≥ 15 h-1 will be randomized to CPAP treatment (Group 1) (n=632) or&#xD;
      conservative treatment (Group 2) (n=632). Patients with an AHI &lt; 15 h-1 that will be followed&#xD;
      as a reference group (Group 3) (n=600).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an ESS score higher than 10 will be excluded of the study and referred to the&#xD;
      sleep unit of each participating center for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be monitored and followed for a minimum of one year and a&#xD;
      maximum of three years. Patients will be examined at the time of inclusion (T0), after one&#xD;
      month (T1), three months (T2), six months (T3), 12 months (T4) and every six months&#xD;
      thereafter, if applicable, during the follow-up period. Evaluations will include; i)new&#xD;
      episodes of ACS, stroke, TIA, heart failure, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality, ii) biological risk markers involved in cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications, iii) an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and CPAP treatment&#xD;
      in patients with ACS who have obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
