  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronicle inflammatory disease with a non&#xD;
      reversible diminution of the airway flow. COPD is caused most commonly from tobacco smoking,&#xD;
      which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung. Worldwide, COPD ranked as the&#xD;
      sixth leading cause of death in 1990. It is projected to be the fourth leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide by 2030 due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in many&#xD;
      countries. COPD is responsible for 16000 deaths per year in France, 100 000 hospitalizations&#xD;
      per year and the health care expenditure of COPD in France is 3.5 billion of Euros. Classical&#xD;
      markers of the disease severity, the forced expiratory volume in one second, poorly&#xD;
      correlates with dyspnea and prognosis. Therefore, many studies focused on the control of&#xD;
      breathing in an attempt to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. Breathing control is enhanced in patients with COPD due to the&#xD;
      progressive failure of respiratory muscles (airflow obstruction, static and dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation, positive intrinsic end expiratory pressure), the ventilation/ perfusion ratio&#xD;
      abnormalities leading to the loss of the gaz exchange efficiency. Inspiratory command depends&#xD;
      on the medulla automatic pathway and the voluntary corticospinal command. Indirect method of&#xD;
      breathing control estimation suggested in COPD patients an increased excitability of neurons&#xD;
      involved in the voluntary diaphragm activation and a reduced cortical reserve. This may&#xD;
      represent an increase risk factor for acute respiratory failure. Until now, no study reported&#xD;
      the central breathing control with cerebral fMRI in COPD patients.&#xD;

      in estimating if the absence or diminution of the cortical reserve is a marker of disease&#xD;
      severity. In addition correlations will be performed between activated neuronal signals with&#xD;
      fMRI and ventilatory flow output recordings (chaotic analysis).&#xD;
