      African American women with breast cancer have decreased quality of life (and mood when&#xD;
      compared to European American. Research has not examined the effectiveness of therapeutic&#xD;
      group for African American women with breast cancer even though positive effects are well&#xD;
      established for Caucasians. The aims of the randomized clinical trial are to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TG by teleconference for African American women with breast cancer and what&#xD;
      factors may impact on the intervention. The primary hypothesis is that participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will have significantly greater cancer knowledge, less fear, less&#xD;
      isolation, better social connection, better mood, and better QOL when compared to a control&#xD;
      group receiving usual psychosocial care. Two hundred forty African American women with breast&#xD;
      cancer will be recruited. Intervention participants attend eight weekly 90 minute sessions by&#xD;
      teleconference and two follow-up boosters. Each culturally appropriate session contains the&#xD;
      story, information and group processes of connection, commonality and catharsis. Information&#xD;
      focuses on increasing self care and stress management knowledge while countering myths and&#xD;
      taboos. Story capitalizes on African American oral traditions by discussing coping parables.&#xD;
      Group processes provide an alternative source of social support and opportunities to express&#xD;
      feelings. Control group subjects receive standard psychosocial care (the use of any support&#xD;
      programs or services locally or nationally. Testing will occur at baseline, after 10 group&#xD;
      sessions and 16 weeks post baseline. The study findings are expected to inform about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of therapeutic groups in African American women with breast cancer and lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for exploring if reducing disparities in psychosocial care have a health benefit.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims Aim One The major aim of the proposed study is to compare the effects of a&#xD;
      TG by conference call for AAWBC with usual psychosocial care. We hypothesize that AAWBC who&#xD;
      receive the TG by teleconference will have significantly greater cancer knowledge, less fear,&#xD;
      less isolation, better social connection, better mood, and better QOL than a control group&#xD;
      receiving usual psychosocial care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim One A: Substantiate intervention integrity (purity, dosage, specificity and&#xD;
      interventionist competency) of first 14 waves of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim One B: Establish reliability and validity of measures (Profile of Mood States and&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Cancer Version, Social Support&#xD;
      Questionnaire) Aim Two To have a strong intervention, it is essential to identify the&#xD;
      processes of change that lead to beneficial outcomes.29, 30 Therefore, the second aim of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to identify the mediators of the intervention that predict successful&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Three Since it is particularly important to identify AA women's characteristics and&#xD;
      sociocultural factors which may affect their responses to the intervention,30, 31 the third&#xD;
      aim of the study is to identify the effects of demographic, health and socio-cultural&#xD;
      variables as moderators of treatment effects on social connection, and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Three A: Examine baseline moderators and concept of social connection to establish&#xD;
      associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN &amp; METHODS Design The proposed study will be conducted as a&#xD;
      multiple-group randomized trial to compare the TG intervention with a control group receiving&#xD;
      usual psychosocial care. A maximum of 10 subjects will be assigned randomly to each of two&#xD;
      groups during a common time period, with one group receiving the TG intervention and the&#xD;
      other receiving usual care. The randomization will be stratified by treatment type (chemo&#xD;
      therapy only or radiation therapy only or chemotherapy and radiation therapy combined).&#xD;
      Multiple time periods will be used to achieve the required number of subjects for the entire&#xD;
      trial. Subjects will be evaluated at three time points in a repeated measures fashion: (1) at&#xD;
      baseline before the intervention begins, (2) at the end of the intervention period, and (3)&#xD;
      16 weeks from baseline. Mediating, moderating and outcome variable data will be collected at&#xD;
      all three time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurement times have been chosen for several reasons. The intervention will be&#xD;
      delivered during the stressful time after diagnosis when the patient is facing fears, side&#xD;
      effects (especially body image changes), and negative community attitudes. During this time,&#xD;
      patients are challenged to learn about the disease and its treatment and are emotionally open&#xD;
      to using positive coping strategies.133-136 The T-2 measurement will provide information on&#xD;
      the immediate effects of the treatment and T-3 will provide information on the sustainability&#xD;
      of the intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting South Carolina is an ideal setting within which to test the proposed intervention, TG&#xD;
      by teleconference. AA represent about 31 % of the population. Unlike other parts of the US,&#xD;
      SC is mostly rural (and 46 % of its AA are rural) and the AA population has experienced very&#xD;
      little in-migration over the past several centuries.137 Furthermore, religious affiliation is&#xD;
      largely fundamentalist Christian (African Methodist Episcopal, Baptist and Pentecostal&#xD;
      Churches),138 and a spiritual focus permeates the community, which is known as the &quot;Buckle&quot;&#xD;
      of the Bible Belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major statewide initiatives to decrease health disparities are in progress and these efforts&#xD;
      have resulted in multiple networks for communication with key SC community leaders and health&#xD;
      providers. We will use the Cancer Research Network, SC Cancer Alliance, Women's Cancer&#xD;
      Coalition and the Best Chance Network to enhance recruitment efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palmetto Health and the University of South Carolina are exceptional bases from which to&#xD;
      conduct this research. Palmetto Health is South Carolina's most comprehensive health&#xD;
      resource, a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system with Palmetto Health Baptist&#xD;
      Easley in upstate SC and two Columbia hospitals, Palmetto Health Baptist and Palmetto Health&#xD;
      Richland. Palmetto Health's Comprehensive Breast Center (PHCBC) was established to improve&#xD;
      treatment using national guidelines and decrease mortality. Over the past several years,&#xD;
      major strides have been made in attaining these goals through detection of smaller tumors and&#xD;
      use of sentinel node biopsy. Two multi-disciplinary and multi-specialty breast cancer tumor&#xD;
      conferences are held weekly. Additionally, Palmetto Health has made a strong commitment to&#xD;
      decrease health disparities in the communities it serves through its Cancer Community Health&#xD;
      Initiative. The 6 year-old initiative has targeted AAs and is working to improve individual&#xD;
      and community health by providing services to underserved and uninsured populations&#xD;
      especially cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the oldest and most comprehensive public universities in the United States, USC has&#xD;
      been designated a research institution of &quot;very high research activity,&quot; the only university&#xD;
      in South Carolina to have this designation, granted to 62 public and 32 private research&#xD;
      institutions. University libraries in Columbia house over 7,000,000 processed items including&#xD;
      2,639,171 volumes and approximately 4,075,413 units in microform. Some 17,405 current&#xD;
      periodicals are received. Thomas Cooper Library. Included in the seating are more than 900&#xD;
      private locked facilities for faculty and graduate students involved in research. Special&#xD;
      areas in the library include the Student Computer Labs, the Science Library, Special&#xD;
      Collections, and the Map Library. Access to the collection is obtained through the&#xD;
      USCAN/NOTIS Online Card Catalog with terminals located throughout the building. CD ROM&#xD;
      stations are available for user searching of multiple databases. The Thomas Cooper Library&#xD;
      offers access to literature from international sources through the on-line computer-assisted&#xD;
      reference department. The computerized reference service provides bibliographic citations,&#xD;
      statistics, and international news from recent literature on a wide range of subjects. This&#xD;
      service is particularly strong in the natural and social sciences. Also included are&#xD;
      government activities, publications, and grant sources. Data bases in nursing include&#xD;
      Medline, Nursing and Allied Health, and Health Planning and Administration. Data bases&#xD;
      related to nursing include Psychological Abstracts and Mental Health Abstracts. New data&#xD;
      bases are added regularly, and information on them is available in the Reference Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of participants in the proposed study will be recruited from the two cancer&#xD;
      treatment sites within Palmetto Health, which treats about 600 breast cancer patients&#xD;
      annually. Of those, more than 225 are AAWBC. Other recruitment will be statewide.&#xD;
