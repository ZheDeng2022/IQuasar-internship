  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well vismodegib after stem cell transplant works in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-risk first remission or relapsed multiple myeloma. Vismodegib may slow the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells. Giving vismodegib after autologous stem cell transplant may kill more&#xD;
      multiple myeloma cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if GDC-0449 (vismodegib) is able to reduce myeloma cancer stem cells (CSC)&#xD;
      when given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM) following autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether GDC-0449 is inhibiting the hedgehog (Hh) pathway in patients with MM&#xD;
      following autologous transplantation by measuring downstream targets of Hh using quantitative&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on plasma cells and MM CSC obtained&#xD;
      from blood and bone marrow of patients undergoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether changes in MM CSC as measured by clonogenic assays on bone marrow&#xD;
      are seen in response to GDC-0449 and whether these changes predict recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether changes in MM CSC can be measured with similar or better accuracy&#xD;
      using peripheral blood flow cytometry as compared to bone marrow clonogenic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the safety and toxicity profile for treatment with GDC-0449 following&#xD;
      autologous transplantation in patients with high risk or relapsed MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GDC-0449 (total and unbound) at steady-state&#xD;
      and correlate this with pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the one year progression free survival for patients given GDC-0449 following&#xD;
      autologous transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
