      Development of a new mass spectrometry-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis&#xD;
      of Gaucher Disease from blood (plasma)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary lysosomal storage disorder.&#xD;
      Occurrence of the disease is due to a hereditary deficiency of the Glucocerebrosidase, a&#xD;
      lysosomal enzyme which divides Glucocerebroside into Glucose and Ceramides. The unmetabolised&#xD;
      Glucocerebrosides are stored throughout the whole reticulo-endothelial system. Accumulation&#xD;
      of Glycolipid-enriched macrophages establishes a pathoanatomical phenomenon, the so-called&#xD;
      Gaucher cells, which can be verified by light microscopy of affected tissues. Activation&#xD;
      markers of the macrophages, like the enzyme Chitotriosidase or CCL18, are parameters which&#xD;
      follow the course of GD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gaucher disease is the most frequently inherited Sphingolipidosis in the general population,&#xD;
      and in Ashkenazi Jews, in who the prevalence is much higher (1:450). The gene which codes the&#xD;
      Glucocerebrosidase is on the long arm of chromosome 1 and covers 11 exons. So far, more than&#xD;
      200 different mutations in Gaucher patients have been described, mostly missense mutations.&#xD;
      In addition, frame-shift- and splice-site-mutations have been detected, as well as insertions&#xD;
      and deletions. More frequent mutations are N370S, L444P, IVS2+1G&gt;A, c.84insG, R463C and&#xD;
      R496H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical appearance is heterogeneous. The classical phenotype is characterised by&#xD;
      visceral organ (Hepatosplenomegaly) and skeleton system (Bone marrow infiltrates up to bone&#xD;
      infarcts and pathological fractures) affection. Moreover, consecutive blood cell count&#xD;
      changes, Anemia and Thrombocytopenia are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious distinction lies in the appearance of neurological manifestations (myoclonus&#xD;
      epilepsy, hydrocephalus, ocular movement disturbances). There is discussion on whether the&#xD;
      classification into the typical three disease types (type1: non-neuronopathic progress form,&#xD;
      type2: acute neuronopathic progress form, type3: chronic neuronopathic progress form) is&#xD;
      still up-to-date, since it does not sufficiently reflect the reality of the clinical&#xD;
      presentation. A clear genotype-phenotype relationship does not exist. The same DNA mutations&#xD;
      are detected in patients with pronounced differences in disease progression. The exception is&#xD;
      the mutation N370S, which has so far been detected in connection with only visceral progress&#xD;
      forms (type1). At least the outcome of the non-neuronopathic disorder cases could be improved&#xD;
      by the introduction and general availability of enzyme therapy. Under this kind of therapy&#xD;
      there is a reduction of liver and spleen size as well as a normalization of the haemogram&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow to diagnose in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. In a pilot study&#xD;
      lyso-glycosylsphingosine has been determined as a sensitive and specific biomarker (see&#xD;
      attached manuscript). This is a metabolic product likely to be involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore it is the goal of the study to validate this new&#xD;
      biochemical marker from the blood of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients&#xD;
      by an early diagnose and there-by with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry, maximal&#xD;
      10 ml blood will be taken via using a dry blood spot filter card and will be ana-lysed.&#xD;
      (Optionally, also 10 ml urine will be taken via urine-collection tube). To proof the correct&#xD;
      Gaucher diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic&#xD;
      testing has been done, sequencing of Gaucher will be done.&#xD;
