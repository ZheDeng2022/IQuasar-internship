  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if armodafinil can reduce fatigue and&#xD;
      other common symptoms in patients that have received treatment for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Armodafinil is designed to stimulate the central nervous system, which may increase&#xD;
      wakefulness and reduce fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any&#xD;
      disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study&#xD;
      drug has any real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found eligible to take part in this study, participant will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take armodafinil. Group 2&#xD;
      will take a placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but has no&#xD;
      active ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither participant nor the study staff will know if participant is receiving the study drug&#xD;
      or the placebo. However, if needed for participant's safety, the study staff will be able to&#xD;
      find out what participant is receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take the study drug/placebo every day for 4 weeks starting the morning after&#xD;
      participant has enrolled in this study. Participant will take the study drug/placebo in the&#xD;
      morning with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. Participant may take the study drug/placebo&#xD;
      with or without food. If the dose causes an upset stomach, participant should take it with&#xD;
      food. If participant has trouble swallowing the dose of study drug/placebo, the study staff&#xD;
      will tell participant of different ways of taking it. Participant will be given a pamphlet&#xD;
      with more information about how to take the study drug/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before participant starts taking the study drug/placebo, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°Participant will complete 6 questionnaires about participant's fatigue, sleepiness, and&#xD;
      other symptoms as well as participant's quality of life and participant's ability to work.&#xD;
      These questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participant will complete 2 of the symptom questionnaires listed above&#xD;
      2 times every week while participant is on study, including during the Open-label Extension&#xD;
      Phase (described below). Participant may complete the questionnaires over the phone using the&#xD;
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or with a member of the study staff. Another option&#xD;
      is to complete the questionnaires during a routinely scheduled visit outside of this study.&#xD;
      If participant completes the questionnaires over the phone, the study staff or the IVR system&#xD;
      will call participant at a time that is convenient for participant. If the questionnaires are&#xD;
      completed through the IVR system, the study staff will give participant the information&#xD;
      participant needs to report participant's symptoms by using the system. If the questionnaires&#xD;
      are completed with the study staff, she/he will ask participant the questions and record&#xD;
      participant's answers on paper or enter them into a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participant completes the questionnaires for the second time each week, participant will&#xD;
      also be asked if participant is taking participant's study drug/placebo as instructed and&#xD;
      participant will be asked about any side effects participant may be having. If the&#xD;
      questionnaires were completed through the IVR system, the study staff will contact&#xD;
      participant and ask participant if participant is taking participant's study drug/placebo as&#xD;
      instructed and about any side effects participant may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 4, participant will complete the same set of 6 questionnaires that&#xD;
      participant completed at the beginning of the study. Participant will also complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about participant's thoughts on the study drug/placebo. Participant will also&#xD;
      be asked about any changes in drugs (both prescribed and over the counter) that participant&#xD;
      may be taking. This should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label Extension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 4, if participant was in Group 1 and participant did not have any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, participant will be able to continue taking armodafinil for an&#xD;
      additional 4 weeks. If participant was in Group 2 and participant did not have any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, participant will be given the option to begin receiving armodafinil&#xD;
      for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter what participant chooses, participant will not be told whether participant was&#xD;
      taking the study drug or the placebo during the first 4 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in the open-label extension phase, at the end of Week 8, participant will&#xD;
      complete the same set of 6 questionnaires that participant completed at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study. Participant will also complete a questionnaire about participant's thoughts on the&#xD;
      study drug/placebo. This should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive the study drug/placebo for either 4 or 8 weeks. Participant will be&#xD;
      taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or if the study doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      participant's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant's last dose of the study drug/placebo, participant will continue to&#xD;
      complete 2 symptom questionnaires for another 4 weeks. The last time participant completes&#xD;
      the 2 questionnaires, participant will complete an additional 3 questionnaires that&#xD;
      participant completed at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information about the side effects participant may have that are collected during this&#xD;
      study will not be reported to participant's regular doctor. Participant should tell&#xD;
      participant's regular doctor about all symptoms and/or side effects that participant had.&#xD;
      Participant will given a hot line phone number to call the study staff if participant has any&#xD;
      side effects from the study drug/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another option to complete the questionnaires at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 is to receive&#xD;
      questionnaire packets during the baseline assessment and to mail them back to the study&#xD;
      coordinator. The study staff will contact participant to remind participant when it is time&#xD;
      to complete them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Armodafinil is FDA-approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat narcolepsy (falling asleep at unexpected times), obstructive sleep apnea, and shift&#xD;
      work sleep disorder. It is also FDA-approved and commercially available to treat sleepiness&#xD;
      in patients with excessive sleepiness. Its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
