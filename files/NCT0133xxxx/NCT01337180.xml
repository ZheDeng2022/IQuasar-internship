    <textblock>
      Exposure to noxious gases and particles is associated with an increased prevalence of&#xD;
      respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, investigation of possible airway inflammation&#xD;
      and/or systemic inflammation in workers exposed to high levels of dust is important. Silicon&#xD;
      Carbide (SiC) Processing Inc. provides cutting fluid (slurry) for the production of solar&#xD;
      cells and is at present the largest provider of slurry to the solar industry worldwide. In&#xD;
      the production process, the recyclable materials (SiC), polyethylene glycol (PEG)) of the&#xD;
      used slurry are recovered. The airborne exposure consists mainly of SiC (dust particles) and&#xD;
      evaporation from the recycling of PEG. High levels of dust have been measured and, seventeen&#xD;
      per cent of the measurements in the processing hall were equal to or higher than the&#xD;
      Norwegian occupational exposure limit. Thus, assessment of possible systemic and airway&#xD;
      effects of this exposure is of interest. A prospective design will be applied and the effects&#xD;
      studied by means of registration of respiratory symptoms, spirometry, nitric oxide (NO) in&#xD;
      exhaled air, induced sputum and blood sampling over a 3 year period. Exposed subjects will&#xD;
      also be compare with non- or low exposed subjects (administrative/office workers). Efforts&#xD;
      will be made to include all eligible subjects and to avoid drop-outs. If early signs of&#xD;
      airway or systemic inflammation in workers or in cells are demonstrated in the study, it will&#xD;
      be necessary to implement measures to reduce the exposure levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study of workers exposed to Silicon Carbide dust in the&#xD;
      workplace is to determine whether this exposure is associated with inflammatory changes in&#xD;
      the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are: - to examine possible changes in systemic inflammatory markers and -&#xD;
      to examine changes in lung function among Silicon Carbide processing workers during a period&#xD;
      of 3 years. Possible changes in lung function will be monitored by spirometry and gas&#xD;
      diffusion measurements (study A). Airway inflammatory responses and changes in circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory markers will be assessed by examination of the induced sputum samples and blood&#xD;
      samples every 6th month in a subgroup of workers (study B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Does exposure to aerosols induce airway inflammation and/or a systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      in workers in the silicon carbide (SiC) processing industry?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As yet, no human studies describing the health effects from exposure during recycling of&#xD;
      slurry containing SiC and/or PEG have been reported. However, there are several studies that&#xD;
      may be relevant which assess the health effects of other particles. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that small particles penetrate further into the lungs than larger particles and thereby have&#xD;
      stronger irritating properties [2]. Results from 2 experimental studies where the effect&#xD;
      variables were lung function, organ weights and characteristics of broncho-alveolar lavage&#xD;
      (BAL) [3, 4] indicate that SiC dust and PEG itself are probably relatively inert. However, in&#xD;
      a third study it was demonstrated that SiC particles have the potential to stimulate test&#xD;
      cells (murine macrophage cell line and human osteoblast-like cell line) to produce&#xD;
      inflammatory signal substances (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alfa), indicating possible&#xD;
      inflammatory responses in the lungs [5]. Furthermore, it is thought that the total amount of&#xD;
      inhaled dust is important (&quot;overload&quot;) even if the substance itself is relatively inert [6].&#xD;
      Repeated high exposures (peaks) may act as a reinforcing factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there are few previous studies, and the available data are conflicting, there is a&#xD;
      need for more knowledge about the association between health effects and exposure to&#xD;
      particles in general and to exposure in the SiC processing industry in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that airway inflammation may be induced by exposure to SiC particles and&#xD;
      would probably be detectable as increased levels of inflammatory cells and soluble&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in the sputum and blood samples from non-smoking, asymptomatic workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study of workers exposed to SiC dust in the work-place is to&#xD;
      determine whether this exposure is associated with inflammatory changes in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine possible changes in systemic inflammatory markers, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine changes in lung function among SiC-processing workers over a period of 3&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible changes in lung function will be monitored by spirometry measurements (study A).&#xD;
      Airway inflammatory responses and changes in circulating inflammatory markers will be&#xD;
      assessed by examination of the induced sputum samples and blood samples in a subgroup of&#xD;
      workers (study B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General value An important goal of the study is to provide knowledge that can be important&#xD;
      for workers who are exposed to particles and aerosols in the SiC-processing industry or other&#xD;
      industries processing SiC and/or PEG. The study may also be relevant to workers in other&#xD;
      industries with dusty environments given the possible &quot;overload&quot; mechanisms. The study could&#xD;
      possibly also have the potential to provide additional knowledge about effects of exposure to&#xD;
      similar particles e.g from air pollution. Because few former studies have used induced sputum&#xD;
      in a prospective design, such studies are of particular interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If early signs of lung inflammation or a decrease in lung function are demonstrated in the&#xD;
      present study, it will be necessary to implement additional measures to reduce the dust&#xD;
      levels in this industry; e.g., through enclosure of processes. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      the results from this study together with the existing knowledge of inflammatory effects&#xD;
      associated with occupational exposure to particles may be relevant for the prevention of&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III - Study design and methods Study population In the present study, the effects of exposure&#xD;
      to aerosols on airway inflammation and systemic inflammation will be investigated by means of&#xD;
      spirometry, FeNO, induced sputum and blood sampling over a three-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: The whole group of workers will complete a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
      undergo spirometry at baseline, and again after 3 years. All former workers will be contacted&#xD;
      and asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the proportion of workers resigning because&#xD;
      of (or partly because of) health effects. These workers will also be invited to undergo an&#xD;
      examination of lung function (spirometry). This is to ensure that all workers ever employed&#xD;
      are included in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: A subgroup comprising non-smokers will in addition be followed with blood samples,&#xD;
      induced sputum tests and exposure measurements every 6 months over the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: Exposed subjects will be compared with non- or low-exposed subjects&#xD;
      (administrative/office workers). In addition to the prospective study, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare the baseline findings from the sputum and blood samples with those from already&#xD;
      established external control groups from previous studies on healthy non-exposed workers and&#xD;
      from cement production workers from the same geographic area [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure-response analyses: Workers will be divided into groups with different exposure&#xD;
      levels in order to study exposure-response trends of the measured agents in the exposed&#xD;
      population (this design is less vulnerable to selection effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline examinations will be repeated for all subjects and for the sputum subgroup.&#xD;
      Detailed, validated questionnaires will record the medical history, relevant illnesses, use&#xD;
      of medications, occupational history as well as present exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry will allow registration of lung function and FeNO measurements the monitoring of&#xD;
      possible airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group-based strategy will be applied for the collection of exposure measurements at&#xD;
      baseline and at follow-up (3 years) for the subjects not included in the sputum part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced sputum collection will be applied to detect possible changes in inflammatory cells&#xD;
      and soluble markers from the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analysis will be collected to examine possible changes in circulating inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and their association to exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the sputum subgroup will carry individual exposure measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The employees who leave the cohort will contribute with data while they are employed (defined&#xD;
      as time-at-risk) and a drop-out test will be performed to determine whether they experienced&#xD;
      work-related respiratory symptoms or diseases. New employees will be included during the&#xD;
      study period and assigned a time-at-risk equal to their time of exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure measurement and assessment The dust/aerosol samples will be collected with the use&#xD;
      of thoracic and inhaled respirable cyclones to estimate the doses for the deposition in the&#xD;
      bronchi and in the alveoli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity Factors that may affect lung function and inflammatory markers in sputum Age,&#xD;
      height, BMI and sex will be recorded for the study. Height in meters will be entered into the&#xD;
      computer program for calculating spirometry values. Weight (body mass index) affects lung&#xD;
      function and will be measured before the examination. The investigators will also record&#xD;
      possible acute respiratory infections during the preceding 12 months. An upper respiratory&#xD;
      infection during the preceding three weeks may affect the level of inflammatory cells and&#xD;
      markers in sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a possibility that very early inflammatory effects among these workers could be&#xD;
      succeeded by adaptation and thereby reduction of effects. In this case, the inflammatory&#xD;
      response at some time after employment could be smaller than observed initially. This may&#xD;
      lead to underestimation of effects. The investigators consider that a dynamic cohort design&#xD;
      including only subjects exposed for the first time in this industry is not feasible. However,&#xD;
      a follow-up of three years is considered sufficient to detect clinically relevant changes.&#xD;
      The cohort in this study will also have a relatively short prior employment in the industry&#xD;
      because the plants were opened in 2006 and 2009. Spirometry screening of all workers,&#xD;
      performed during the first days of employment at the local health services, is available.&#xD;
      These will be compared with the baseline recordings to evaluate possible effects prior to&#xD;
      inclusion in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and study power&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations to be studied are individual changes in the effect variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the trend over the study period (study A: baseline and 36 months for the whole group of&#xD;
           workers; study B for the sputum subgroup: baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  between exposed and controls (exposed and unexposed/administrative staff/office workers)&#xD;
           at baseline and differences in trend during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T tests will be used to compare cases and controls at baseline for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables, and a Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables. Where multiple&#xD;
      tests are to be conducted, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests will be applied prior to the&#xD;
      pairwise comparisons to determine the overall significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits and other relevant&#xD;
      factors for each analysis will be applied when adjusting for other factors at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyse the repeated measures, general linear models (GLM) and mixed models will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculations are based on clinically interesting differences in percentage of&#xD;
      neutrophils and spirometry values. The study is designed to include at least 20 participants&#xD;
      in each group based on a power estimate of 90%, which assumes a 95% significance level, to&#xD;
      detect a true difference in the percentage neutrophils between two tests of at least 16%.&#xD;
      Power calculation for FEV1 and FVC% of predicted: if the goal is to detect a difference of&#xD;
      1.5% in FEV1 and FVC% predicted, then given a standard deviation of 5% the sample must&#xD;
      consist of 117 persons in each group. This will ensure 90% power to detect a difference at&#xD;
      the 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the response rate among non-smokers will allow approximately 40 employees&#xD;
      and 20 unexposed workers to be included in the sputum part of the study (study B). Based on&#xD;
      the power calculations, prior experience and published studies, this will be enough to detect&#xD;
      a difference in development between the two groups of the expected magnitude. In total, 150&#xD;
      workers are employed at SiC I and II (to be included in study A). It is planned to include&#xD;
      the employees at Glomfjord (Nordland) SiC processing if the sample size from Porsgrunn is not&#xD;
      sufficient. To ensure sufficient unexposed workers, the neighbouring Renewable Energy&#xD;
      Corporation (REC) plant will be used to recruit controls if needed. The REC plant started&#xD;
      production at about the same time and has a similar work-force to the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI - Ethical aspects It is considered that the purpose of the study and the methods being&#xD;
      used do not violate generally accepted ethical values. Participation in the project is&#xD;
      voluntary. Collection of biological material and information will take place with the&#xD;
      participants' consent. All participants will sign consent forms after receiving written&#xD;
      information about the survey. Participants will at any time have the opportunity to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study without giving a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to an agreement with the SIC- processing, the research fellow and project group can&#xD;
      freely publish the results of the survey. The project is not financially dependent on grants&#xD;
      from the industry, and the industry (SIC) financing of the project is limited to the exposure&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
