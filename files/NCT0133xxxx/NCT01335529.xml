  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infected&#xD;
      patients are non responders after 48 weeks of the current standard-of-care with&#xD;
      Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. The results of re-treatment are disappointing. The addition of&#xD;
      Boceprevir to the current standard-of-care has been shown to increase the efficacy of therapy&#xD;
      in HCV mono-infected patients previously treated with a bi-therapy. Knowing that HIV/HCV&#xD;
      co-infected patients are subject to more rapid hepatic fibrosis as well as to increased risks&#xD;
      of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, it is important to&#xD;
      improve the response rate of the re-treatment of hepatitis C in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir in&#xD;
      combination with Peg-Interferon alfa 2b plus ribavirin, in patients co-infected with HIV and&#xD;
      chronic genotype 1 HCV, and previously treated with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. 80 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The primary endpoint will be the Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) defined&#xD;
      as undetectable HCV-RNA at Week 24 after the end of therapy.&#xD;

      The majority of HIV/HCV co-infected patients are non responders after 48 weeks of the current&#xD;
      standard-of-care with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin. The results of re-treatment are&#xD;
      disappointing. The addition of Boceprevir to the current standard-of-care has been shown to&#xD;
      increase the efficacy of therapy in HCV mono-infected patients previously treated with a&#xD;
      bi-therapy. Knowing that HIV/HCV co-infected patients are subject to more rapid hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis as well as to increased risks of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, it is important to improve the response rate of the re-treatment of&#xD;
      hepatitis C in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this trial will have many predictive factors of failure: HIV&#xD;
      co-infection, previous failure to Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin, HCV genotype 1 infection. One&#xD;
      study reported a SVR rate of 9% after re-treatment with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin in such&#xD;
      patients. Another trial has shown a substantial increase of the response rate with a&#xD;
      tri-therapy in HCV mono-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to carry out a multicentric, national, non-randomized phase II&#xD;
      trial in 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients with F4 cirrhosis will have to be inferior to 50% of enrolled&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of null responders to a previous treatment (HCV RNA drop &lt; 2 log10 at W12) and&#xD;
      without F4 cirrhosis will have to be lower or equal to 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate, in Genotype 1 - HCV/HIV co-infected&#xD;
      patients, non responders to a previous therapy with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin, the rate of SVR&#xD;
      after 48 or 72 weeks of a three-drug regimen containing Peg-Interferon, Ribavirin and&#xD;
      Boceprevir according to the Virologic Response and to compare the SVR rate to a threshold&#xD;
      rate 20%, lowest rate to consider a therapeutic benefit in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic sub-study including 30 patients will be performed to estimate&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of antiretroviral treatment (Atazanavir combined with Ritonavir,&#xD;
      Raltegravir, Tenofovir) in combination with anti HCV treatment at baseline and W8 and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of Boceprevir at W8.&#xD;
