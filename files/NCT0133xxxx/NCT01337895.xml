      -  Objectives Taking a 'whole foods' approach, we will investigate (i) whether consumption&#xD;
           of isocaloric diets containing ≥4 vs. ≤1 servings of dairy products per day for 16 weeks&#xD;
           results in greater body fat loss in energy-restricted overweight/obese premenopausal&#xD;
           women; (ii) the role of dairy product consumption in influencing physiological and&#xD;
           metabolic factors which may precede or accompany changes in body composition, including&#xD;
           in enzymes which synthesize and break down body fat; and (iii) factors, including&#xD;
           obesity phenotype, which may influence the response of body composition to dairy product&#xD;
           consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the obesity epidemic showing no signs of abating, there is ongoing interest, both at the&#xD;
      lay public and scientific levels, in manipulating the diet to promote weight, specifically&#xD;
      fat, loss. One such promising manipulation is an increase in, or perhaps more precisely, an&#xD;
      isocaloric substitution of, dairy product consumption. The inverse association between Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI) and dietary calcium - for which dairy products are the main source - was&#xD;
      first described in 1984 and has since been supported by various levels of evidence, but not&#xD;
      consistently. Heaney recently described this literature as &quot;confused,&quot; which he and Rafferty&#xD;
      attribute to important limitations in study design, including lack of low-calcium contrast&#xD;
      groups and the fact that body weight/body composition is often a secondary endpoint in&#xD;
      studies designed and powered for a different outcome, typically bone health or blood&#xD;
      pressure. Confusion has also arisen from the investigation of different interventions (dairy&#xD;
      products, dairy calcium, dietary calcium, supplemental calcium), making it difficult to&#xD;
      compare and interpret studies. This creates an opportunity for the proposed Dairy and Weight&#xD;
      Loss (DAWL) study, with its focus on whole dairy product consumption, to help clear up the&#xD;
      confusion surrounding this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight/obese, low habitual dairy consuming, premenopausal women randomized to an&#xD;
      energy-restricted weight loss diet containing ≥4 servings/day of dairy products (milk,&#xD;
      yogurt, cheese) for 16 weeks will lose more body fat than those randomized to an isocaloric&#xD;
      diet containing ≤1 servings/day of dairy products.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;Ground zero&quot; for the DAWL study will be the University of Guelph Body Composition and&#xD;
      Metabolism Lab (www.uoguelph.ca/bodycomp), under the direction of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size. The investigators plan to complete data collection on a total of 46 women. This&#xD;
      sample size is based on an anticipated total body fat mass (FM) loss over 16 weeks of 5.5 kg&#xD;
      in the high dairy group and 3.8 kg in the control group. These values are based on data&#xD;
      published from 4 studies (5; 20-22). To be conservative in our sample size calculation, we&#xD;
      used a higher-than-reported SD of 2.0 kg FM loss. Together, these values indicated that we&#xD;
      require 23 women in each group to detect a significant difference in total body FM, with 80%&#xD;
      power and 5% alpha. Attrition and non-adherence is anticipated to be approximately 20% to&#xD;
      25%, therefore 30 women in each group will be recruited. We anticipate screening&#xD;
      approximately 300+ women to collect 16 weeks of data on a total of 46 eligible and adherent&#xD;
      completers, as per Figure 1 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Inclusion criteria include non-smoking, non-pregnant and&#xD;
      non-lactating women 18 to 50 years; premenopausal (determined by cessation of menstruation&#xD;
      and recent menstrual history to exclude those who are perimenopausal or amennorheic); BMI&#xD;
      ≥25.0 kg/m2 (54); usual calcium consumption below the EAR of 800 mg/d (55) to be measured&#xD;
      using a validated calcium and vitamin D food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (56); no&#xD;
      sensitivity to dairy; normal liver and kidney function, serum calcium, and complete blood&#xD;
      count; 3 mo history of weight stability; and willingness to adhere to study protocol for 16&#xD;
      weeks regardless of treatment, and including no change in physical activity levels. Any&#xD;
      vitamin/mineral supplement users will be asked to discontinue supplementation for 4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to enrolling in the trial (i.e. &quot;wash out&quot;), as well as for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include violation of any of the above, or presence of a health condition&#xD;
      which might influence weight loss (such as diabetes, CVD, cancer, thyroid disease) or&#xD;
      regularly taking medication which may do the same (such as corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Screening/Background Data Collection Visit. Women who pass the initial screen&#xD;
      and attend the recruitment session will be invited back to the lab, after having fasted for&#xD;
      12 hours (no food or drink except water), where they will first be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form. Further screening/background data to be collected will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemistry including complete blood count, liver function tests (ALT, AST), blood urea&#xD;
           nitrogen, creatinine, and serum total calcium. Participants will undergo venipuncture by&#xD;
           a LifeLabs phlebotomist (letter of support attached). A 3 business day turnaround is&#xD;
           anticipated for results. Participants with values within normal limits will continue on&#xD;
           to enrollment. By this stage of recruitment, participants with any known health&#xD;
           conditions/medications suspected to interfere with study outcomes will have been&#xD;
           screened out, therefore it is anticipated that most will have values within normal&#xD;
           limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (57) to assess usual activity&#xD;
           habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting metabolic rate (kcal/d) to determine the energy levels of individualized meal&#xD;
           plans, which will be calculated as (RMR x PAL) - 500 kcal/d. RMR will be measured using&#xD;
           continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry using a MAX-IIa instrument (AEI&#xD;
           Technologies Inc.). RMR measurements will be conducted with participants lying awake but&#xD;
           at complete physical rest, with a ventilated hood placed over the head and neck.&#xD;
           Participants will undergo measurement for 30 to 40 minutes; the first 5 to 10 minutes of&#xD;
           data will be discarded to allow for acclimation to the testing environment. We will&#xD;
           provide a juice box and granola bar after this test so that participants are not hungry.&#xD;
           For consistency across study visits, we will measure participants in the follicular&#xD;
           phase of their menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.5 Lead-In Phase During the two weeks following the comprehensive screening visit,&#xD;
      participants will be asked maintain a 3-day food record, from which research personnel will&#xD;
      create 500 kcal-restricted individualized meal plans as described below. From this point on,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to maintain their usual physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.6 Study Diets Participants will be provided with individualized meal plans - high dairy or&#xD;
      control - every two weeks for the duration of the study. They will be counseled on their&#xD;
      assigned diets by research personnel during the baseline visit and throughout the study. The&#xD;
      energy levels of the meal plans (e.g. 1200 kcal, 1400 kcal, 1600 kcal, etc) will be&#xD;
      determined from RMR and PAL levels as follows: (RMR x PAL) - 500 kcal/d, where RMR is resting&#xD;
      metabolic rate (kcal/d, measured by indirect calorimetry), PAL is physical activity level&#xD;
      derived from the screening IPAQ and 500 kcal is the daily energy restriction. The energy&#xD;
      levels will be adjusted throughout the study as needed. Actual foods in the meal plans will&#xD;
      be based on Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide (EWCFG,&#xD;
      http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php) and the 3-day food records&#xD;
      completed during the lead-in phase. The diets for the two treatment groups will be matched&#xD;
      for energy and macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate) intake as per the sample 1400 kcal&#xD;
      meal plans attached, and using ESHA Food Processor SQL (version 10.8.0, ESHA Research, Salem&#xD;
      OR) updated with the 2010 Canadian Nutrient File.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dairy products for the high dairy group will be donated by Agropur Coopérative and Ultima&#xD;
      Foods (letter of support attached). Consistent with EWCFG recommendations, a variety of dairy&#xD;
      products (milk, yogurt, cheese) will be included. One serving will be considered 1 cup fluid&#xD;
      white cow's milk or chocolate milk; 1.5 ounces cheese; and 1 cup yogurt. Although EWCFG&#xD;
      considers 1 serving of yogurt to be 0.75 cups, we will increase to 1 cup to provide&#xD;
      equivalent calcium across all dairy products. Minimum dairy calcium intake of the high-dairy&#xD;
      group is anticipated to be 1200 mg/d; dietary calcium intake will be higher. Dietary calcium&#xD;
      of the control group is anticipated to be &lt;450 mg/d, therefore we anticipate a spread of&#xD;
      approximately 1000 mg dietary calcium per day between groups. If energy levels of meal plans&#xD;
      allow, we will incorporate regular fat (vs. low fat) dairy products to reflect Canadians'&#xD;
      actual dairy intake and maximize intake of CLA. Participants in the high-dairy group will be&#xD;
      provided with a 2 week supply of dairy products at a time, in insulated transport bags.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.7 Baseline Visit (week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following lead-in, participants will return to the lab for a baseline visit. At this time,&#xD;
      participants will first be informed to which treatment they were randomly assigned by the&#xD;
      biostatistician (using a random number generator) and to which they will be asked to adhere&#xD;
      for 16 weeks. We will divulge this prior to going any further, to provide an opportunity for&#xD;
      participants to withdraw. Willing participants will then undergo a series of measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist circumference will be measured twice on standing participants at the level of the&#xD;
           iliac crest (58) using a Gulick II non-elastic tape measure; if measures differ by &gt; 5%,&#xD;
           a third will be taken and the mean of the two closest values will be used. Hip&#xD;
           circumference will be measured twice on standing participants around the widest portion&#xD;
           of the buttocks (59); if measures differ by &gt;5%, a third will be taken and the mean of&#xD;
           the two closest values will be used. Predominantly android obesity will be defined as a&#xD;
           waist-to-hip ratio of &gt;0.85, predominantly gynoid obesity will be defined as a&#xD;
           waist-to-hip ratio of ≤0.85 (59, 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition. Whole body and regional fat mass and lean mass will be measured by&#xD;
           dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a fan beam Hologic Wi updated with APEX 3.2&#xD;
           software. See Figure 2. Participants will be asked to wear underpants and a hospital&#xD;
           gown only, and to remove all metal jewelry, for this test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venipuncture. A LifeLabs phlebotomist will draw fasting blood samples from each&#xD;
           participant. Biochemical analyses to be completed at LifeLabs include glucose, insulin,&#xD;
           25(OH)D, lipids (total cholesterol; HDL; LDL; triglycerides), high-sensitivity&#xD;
           C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Various CLA isomers (c9, t11;&#xD;
           t10, c12) in red blood cells (Dr. David Ma), and hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase and&#xD;
           mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (Dr. Marica Bakovic) will be analyzed in yearly&#xD;
           batches at the University of Guelph. Participants are required to fast for this visit;&#xD;
           we will provide a juice box and granola bar afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog scale (VAS) to assess desire to eat, hunger, fullness and prospective food&#xD;
           consumption (61). Scales are 100 mm in length and are anchored at either end with words&#xD;
           expressing the most positive and negative ratings. The VAS will be completed in the lab&#xD;
           conference room after venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting blood pressure using a digital blood pressure cuff (Physio Logic model 106-94,&#xD;
           Montréal PQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.8 Mid-Study Visit (week 8) Participants will repeat the following tests: weight, waist/hip&#xD;
      circumferences, DXA, resting metabolic rate, blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.9 Study Conclusion (week 16) Participants will repeat all of the same tests as during the&#xD;
      Baseline Visit. 14.10 Adherence and Interim Visits Throughout the trial, participants will&#xD;
      maintain a daily dairy product intake checklist and weekly food and activity diaries to&#xD;
      determine adherence to treatment group, energy intake and physical activity. Biweekly,&#xD;
      participants will visit the lab to turn in checklists; have meal plans reassessed; and have&#xD;
      weight, BMI and waist/hip circumferences measured. Those in the dairy group will pick up a 2&#xD;
      week supply of dairy products. Participants will complete a monthly calcium and vitamin D FFQ&#xD;
      (56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.11 Data Analysis Repeated measures ANOVA will be conducted for all measures collected at&#xD;
      more than two time points, to determine differences between treatment groups. These include:&#xD;
      body composition (DXA, weight, BMI, waist/hip circumferences), dietary data, physical&#xD;
      activity, resting metabolic rate, visual analog scale and blood pressure. Consistent with a&#xD;
      pre/post design, paired t-tests will determine differences in biochemical variables measured&#xD;
      at weeks 0 and 16. Regression analyses will be used to predict kilograms of fat mass lost,&#xD;
      with predictor variables including obesity phenotype (predominantly android vs. predominantly&#xD;
      gynoid adjusted for any differences in BMI), baseline 25(OH)D status, age, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.12 Knowledge Translation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community, provincial and national outreach to consumers, Registered Dietitians (RD), other&#xD;
      health care professionals, and scientists will be achieved through multiple means:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gwen Laughton and Janine Robertson, Guelph-based RD collaborators, will provide KT&#xD;
           assistance specifically tailored to the local context. This includes presentations and&#xD;
           discussion groups with other Guelph-based RDs to assist with health literacy for&#xD;
           consumers, and dissemination via the Waterloo Wellington Regional Nutrition Network. We&#xD;
           will also post the study on the web-based Ontario Nutrition Resource Centre, an&#xD;
           initiative of the Ontario Public Health Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DAWL study will be posted on the Canadian Inventory of Nutrition and Dietetic&#xD;
           Associated Research (CINDAR) and Canadian Obesity Network (CON) websites, and in the&#xD;
           &quot;Members in Action&quot; section of the Dietitians of Canada newsletter. The PI,&#xD;
           co-investigators and graduate students will collaborate on scientific publications and&#xD;
           presentations at nutrition meetings (e.g. Canadian Nutrition Society). The research team&#xD;
           will work with media specialists to reach and educate the public, and with the agri-food&#xD;
           chain (industry, not-for-profit trade association, marketing group) including Dairy&#xD;
           Farmers of Canada, Agropur Coopérative and Ultima Foods, Dairy Farmers of Ontario,&#xD;
           Ontario Dairy Council.&#xD;
