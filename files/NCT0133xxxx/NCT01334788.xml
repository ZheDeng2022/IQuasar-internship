      Chronic sleep deprivation may constitute an important and potentially correctable behavioral&#xD;
      factor in the alarming increase in obesity. There are no definitive experimental studies in&#xD;
      humans showing whether sleep deprivation indeed contributes to increased energy intake and/or&#xD;
      reduced energy expenditure. The investigators propose a series of novel studies to&#xD;
      investigate abnormalities in energy homeostasis imparted by sleep deprivation. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure food intake, energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, thermal&#xD;
      effect of food, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and neurohormone levels in 24&#xD;
      healthy subjects with normal BMI (20-25 kg/m2). Twelve subjects (6 men and 6 women) will be&#xD;
      randomized to sleep deprivation. Measurements will be compared to those obtained in 12&#xD;
      subjects who are randomized to a control group, and are not sleep deprived. The investigators&#xD;
      will test the following hypotheses: 1. That sleep deprivation results in positive energy&#xD;
      balance (increased caloric intake and decreased energy expenditure, as reflected by decreased&#xD;
      non-exercise activity thermogenesis). 2. That dysregulation of appetite and energy&#xD;
      expenditure is associated with changes in molecules controlling appetite and metabolism. 3.&#xD;
      That changes associated with 8 days of modest sleep deprivation resolve, at least in part,&#xD;
      over a 4 day recovery period.&#xD;

      The demands of present day living have placed a high premium on time. Voluntary sleep&#xD;
      curtailment is endemic and many adults typically sleep an average of six hours per night.&#xD;
      Observational data suggest that short sleep duration is associated with a greater likelihood&#xD;
      of being obese. Low grade chronic sleep deprivation may constitute an important and&#xD;
      potentially correctable behavioral factor in the alarming increase in obesity. There are no&#xD;
      definitive experimental studies in humans showing whether sleep deprivation indeed&#xD;
      contributes to increased energy intake and/or reduced energy expenditure. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a series of novel studies to investigate abnormalities in energy homeostasis imparted&#xD;
      by sleep deprivation. These studies combine state-of-the-art techniques for monitoring sleep,&#xD;
      food intake, energy expenditure and neuroendocrine energy regulation. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure food intake, energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, thermal effect of food, and&#xD;
      non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and neurohormone levels in 24 healthy subjects with&#xD;
      normal BMI (20-25 kg/m2). Twelve subjects (6 men and 6 women) will be randomized to sleep&#xD;
      deprivation. After a 3 day baseline evaluation, these subjects will undergo 8 days of modest&#xD;
      sleep deprivation followed by a 4 day recovery period. Measurements will be compared to those&#xD;
      obtained in 12 subjects who are randomized to a control group, and are not sleep deprived.&#xD;
      Sleep deprived and control subjects will be comparable for age and gender and will undergo&#xD;
      similar monitoring and measurements in the Clinical Research Unit over the same duration. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1. That sleep deprivation results in&#xD;
      positive energy balance (increased caloric intake and decreased energy expenditure, as&#xD;
      reflected by decreased non-exercise activity thermogenesis). 2. That dysregulation of&#xD;
      appetite and energy expenditure is associated with changes in molecules controlling appetite&#xD;
      and metabolism. 3. That changes associated with 8 days of modest sleep deprivation resolve,&#xD;
      at least in part, over a 4 day recovery period. This exploratory application builds on&#xD;
      established research programs addressing first, neuroendocrine mechanisms in sleep and&#xD;
      obesity, and second, the regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure in humans. These&#xD;
      studies will provide novel and important insights into whether sleep deprivation promotes&#xD;
      increased food intake and/or reduced activity levels, and into the potential role of&#xD;
      molecules that regulate appetite and metabolism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The investigators&#xD;
      propose to examine whether two weeks of modest sleep restriction results in increased food&#xD;
      intake and decreased energy expenditure, thus potentially predisposing to obesity. These&#xD;
      findings will help explain whether the reduced sleep duration in the general population may&#xD;
      be contributing to the current epidemic of obesity, and suggest novel strategies for weight&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
