    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a predictive antiretroviral pharmacokinetic model of&#xD;
      mucosal fluid and tissue distribution in genital tract fluid, rectal fluid and 3 mucosal&#xD;
      tissues. This will be accomplished by determining the pharmacokinetic disposition and dose&#xD;
      proportionality of four antiretrovirals (tenofovir, emtricitabine, maraviroc, and&#xD;
      raltegravir) in human rectal and cervicovaginal fluid and rectal, cervical, and vaginal&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
