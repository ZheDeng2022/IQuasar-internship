      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to verify and validate PAD1 as a qualitative serum test which will combine the&#xD;
      results of multiple assays into a single numeric result, to be determined by evaluation of&#xD;
      the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD1 is an automated software device (PADCalc) that incorporates specific and multiple&#xD;
      biomarker values found in human blood, and generates a score (PAD1 score) using a fixed&#xD;
      formula implemented within the PADCalc software. The PAD1 score is a result with a high or&#xD;
      low probability of PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD1 will be submitted to FDA as a 510(k) for in vitro diagnostic use in conjunction with&#xD;
      clinical assessment, based on factors such as age, diabetes, smoking, and vascular laboratory&#xD;
      tests (including the ABI), as an aid towards further evaluation of patients who meet the&#xD;
      enrollment eligilbility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility It is indicated for women and men considered at risk for PAD who meet the&#xD;
      following criteria: a history of smoking and/or diabetes and are age 50 years or older, or 70&#xD;
      years of age or older. PAD1 is an aid to further assess the likelihood of the presence of PAD&#xD;
      when used in conjunction with clinical assessment and vascular laboratory tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States and&#xD;
      is also prevalent in Europe and Asia. A regional pilot study of community screening for PAD&#xD;
      demonstrated that patient awareness of a PAD diagnosis was low, and was associated with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis risk factors, antiplatelet therapy, and claudication treatment intensity. PAD&#xD;
      has not emerged as a focus of public health efforts to improve quality of life, nor to&#xD;
      decrease the associated cardiovascular ischemic risk. Smoking, diabetes, and age are the&#xD;
      strongest risk factors for PAD. Smokers have a 2 to 6-fold increased likelihood of having&#xD;
      PAD, and the risk of PAD increases in a dose-dependent manner with the duration and amount of&#xD;
      smoking. Diabetes confers a 2 to 4-fold increased risk of having PAD. The prevalence of PAD&#xD;
      increases as a function of age. Criqui et al showed that the prevalence of PAD in individuals&#xD;
      under 60 years of age was about 2.5%, whereas the prevalence increased to over 20% in&#xD;
      individuals over 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in smokers and diabetics 50 years of age or older, and in all those 70 years of age&#xD;
      or older, identified in an outpatient, primary care clinic setting has shown that the&#xD;
      prevalence is 29%. About half of the cases found were newly-identified PAD patients. Further,&#xD;
      while 83% of those with a prior diagnosis of PAD were aware of their condition, only 49% of&#xD;
      the primary-care physicians were aware that their patients had a diagnosis of PAD. Another&#xD;
      study examined internal medicine physicians' approaches to PAD and found that only 37%&#xD;
      reported taking histories for claudication, and only 26% evaluated the foot for ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD is as prevalent in women as in men. When symptomatic, PAD causes limb discomfort,&#xD;
      tiredness, heaviness, cramping, or pain brought on by exertion and relieved by rest (i.e.,&#xD;
      intermittent claudication) and reduces functional capacity and quality of life. Classic&#xD;
      claudication is only noted by 10-30% of patients and atypical leg discomfort occurs in&#xD;
      20-40%. Up to 50% of patients are asymptomatic. PAD1 is an in vitro diagnostic that provides&#xD;
      a PAD1 score derived from multiple biomarkers in human plasma, serum, or whole blood, which&#xD;
      predicts a low or high probability of the presence of PAD in patients at risk for PAD. A&#xD;
      positive PAD1 score(above the cutoff), indicating a higher risk for PAD than expected in the&#xD;
      general population, would then guide the physician to more aggressively determine the&#xD;
      presence of PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary studies have shown an association of four proposed biomarkers with ABI, and&#xD;
      have demonstrated the construction of a PAD risk algorithm. This study is powered to test&#xD;
      each of the four biomarkers and their interactions and develop the PAD1 risk score in the&#xD;
      intended use population.&#xD;
