      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes in a&#xD;
                BC First Nation community&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to determine the utility of community based screening by examining how many&#xD;
                positively screened people follow up with the recommended subsequent testing and&#xD;
                family physician visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to determine if point-of-care HbA1c test (Ames/Bayer DCA 2000) correlates with the&#xD;
                confirmatory fasting and 2 hour post challenge blood glucose tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis The Point-of-Care test will correlate well with the gold standard diagnostic&#xD;
           tests and prove to be a useful tool for community-based screening. This test obviates&#xD;
           the need for fasting and repeat glucose tolerance testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a screening for prevalence study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Seabird Island Band's health department serves a large catchment area of approximately&#xD;
      3000 First Nation members. The team of physicians, nurses, and technicians will invite&#xD;
      communities to participate in diabetes screening events. In conjunction with the community&#xD;
      health workers, we will be facilitating diabetes awareness in the community through the&#xD;
      provision of large scale screening Two types of events will be held. An initial &quot;Open House&quot;&#xD;
      event and a second event in the form of an afternoon &quot;Diabetes Awareness&quot; event later in the&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the assistance of community leaders and the Seabird Island Health Unit staff, we will&#xD;
      utilize materials such as posters and flyers available from the Health unit both to increase&#xD;
      awareness of diabetes and to advise of the awareness/screening events. For the Community&#xD;
      Event there will be a community dinner served at the end of the afternoon for all who&#xD;
      attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community members of Seabird Island will be invited for screening through posters hung in&#xD;
      gathering spaces and high traffic areas. Notices will be put in the community newsletter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be given information about the screening study and will give informed consent by&#xD;
      way of a formal consent form. If younger than 18, consent will be obtained from parents or&#xD;
      guardians. Identity will be concealed by using study numbers for individuals; a master list&#xD;
      linking names and PHNs to the study numbers will be kept by the Seabird Island lead for the&#xD;
      study at Seabird Island in a locked cabinet in a locked office. Primary and Co-investigators&#xD;
      will receive only anonymized data. This is the wish of the community and is in keeping with&#xD;
      OCAP principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of care (finger poke) HbA1c using Ames/Bayer DCA 2000 POC analyzer system will be used&#xD;
      for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the A1c test result is &lt; 6%: Will be offered to have a fasting and 2 hour after&#xD;
           glucose drink test (OGTT) the next day. Otherwise will be counseled to follow up in one&#xD;
           year with their Primary Care Physician or attend another screening opportunity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If A1c result is 6-6.5: Given lab requisition for fasting blood sugar and HbA1c and 2&#xD;
           hour after glucose drink test (OGTT). Advised to get follow up blood work tomorrow (in&#xD;
           some cases this will be available in the community) and advised to see their family&#xD;
           physician. If the family physician is not a Seabird physician, a letter will be sent to&#xD;
           the physician informing him of the screening event and the screening results. Counseled&#xD;
           about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If A1c result is &gt;6.5: Counseled that they may have diabetes. Given requisition to&#xD;
           obtain a fasting and two hour post glucose drink test (OGTT) tomorrow and advised to see&#xD;
           their family physician. Counseled about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c&#xD;
           result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If history of gestational diabetes and not retested - given requisition for 75 g OGTT and&#xD;
      counseled to follow up with family physician. If the family physician is not a Seabird&#xD;
      physician, a letter will be sent to the physician informing him of the screening event and&#xD;
      the screening results. Counseled about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood pressure &gt; 140/90 - counseled to follow up with family physician. If the family&#xD;
      physician is not a Seabird physician, a letter will be sent to the physician informing him of&#xD;
      the screening event and the screening results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Seabird lead will be notified of the blood results and record them along with the&#xD;
      screening results. Anonymized data will be forwarded to the investigative team. We recognize&#xD;
      that a small proportion of the sample (approximately 15%) that have non-Seabird physicians&#xD;
      may not have follow-up data available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have received information regarding diet, lifestyle, and diabetes&#xD;
      prevention. They will also be given general counseling regarding the role of balance in&#xD;
      health, and the fact that the traditional medicine wheel identifies Physical, Spiritual,&#xD;
      Mental and Emotional aspects of health that affect blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates will be made (based on this sample of the population) about how many people have&#xD;
      undiagnosed diabetes in this community, that is the number not known to have self-reported&#xD;
      diabetes but who have an A1c test &gt;6.5%. Specifically, if the A1c test is greater than 6.5%&#xD;
      this is considered diagnostic of diabetes (by current American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      standards) This will be compared to the number who have diabetes based on a fasting glucose &gt;&#xD;
      7 mmol/L and/or 2 hour post glucose drink blood glucose test &gt; 11 mmol/L on follow up testing&#xD;
      (by current Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines) As well, comparison of the reverse will&#xD;
      be made, namely those with elevated fasting and/or post glucose drink values but who had&#xD;
      normal A1c values (&lt;6.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Did the clients who were counseled to do so actually obtain the follow-up blood tests?&#xD;
           (Historically, such patients often decline to obtain the tests requested).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Were all the follow-up blood tests performed? How many declined one or more of these&#xD;
           tests, specifically the 2 hour post glucose drink test which is often refused).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Did the formal tests correlate to the POC HbA1c test or was there significant&#xD;
           discrepancy? Thus is this test for diagnosing diabetes confirmed as a valid test for&#xD;
           screening in First Nation Communities in Canada?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. By one month post screening survey, how what percentage of family physicians found this&#xD;
           useful?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up information will be obtained and analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dr. Fox (main Seabird physician) will be contacted 1 month after the screening day to&#xD;
           follow up on patient visits and on outpatient blood work for which clients were given&#xD;
           requisitions. He will be asked if he noticed any benefits of this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After 3 months, Dr. Fox will be re-contacted to check for outstanding results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 4 months, if follow-up blood work has not been performed, clients will be contacted&#xD;
           individually by telephone by Seabird Health to be reminded and to find out why they did&#xD;
           not follow through with the blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: How many clients (all of whom claimed not to have known diabetes) had&#xD;
      HbA1c &gt; 6.5%? This number indicates the prevalence of unknown diabetes in this First Nation&#xD;
      community. And how many clients had a fasting glucose &gt;7% and 2 hour post glucose drink&#xD;
      glucose level &gt;11%? Comparison of these two groups of results will indicate the correlation&#xD;
      of the A1c test with the conventional glucose diagnostic tests in this First Nation&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How many clients had an HbA1c &gt; 6% but &lt;6.5% and therefore have pre-diabetes. How many&#xD;
      clients have hypertension with Blood pressure &gt; 140/90. How many clients with a history of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes and no follow up OGTT had diabetes (HbA1c &gt;6.5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: If n=320 and we observe a prevalence of diabetes of 10%, then the absolute&#xD;
      margin of error (the 95% confidence interval for the observed proportion) is +/- 3.3%, 19&#xD;
      times out of 20.&#xD;
