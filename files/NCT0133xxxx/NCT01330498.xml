  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis designed&#xD;
      to assess the longitudinal pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, immunological, and biochemical&#xD;
      sample collection with MRI and relapse analysis of a Tysabri patient cohort. The study hopes&#xD;
      to identify secondary and tertiary risk stratification markers that would aid in the clinical&#xD;
      management of patients who are JC antibody positive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been related to the utilization of&#xD;
      Tysabri as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The etiologic agent is&#xD;
      the human polyomavirus JC. PML can result from lytic infection of glial cells via a mutant JC&#xD;
      virus in multiple sclerosis patients being actively treated with Tysabri. The mutated JC&#xD;
      virus is a neurotrophic virus that infects only humans. &quot;The regulatory region sequence of&#xD;
      the JC virus is hypervariable and contains determinants for neurotropism and neurovirulence.&quot;&#xD;
      (Jensen and Major, 2001). In patients initially infected for the most part in childhood the&#xD;
      virus tends to remain quiescent in kidneys, bone marrow and lymphoid tissue. The true&#xD;
      incidence of JC virus seroprevalance is currently being assessed via two Biogen Idec clinical&#xD;
      trials (STRATIFY 1 101JC401 and STRATIFY 2 101JC402). Application has been made to the FDA&#xD;
      regarding a label change for Tysabri which will incorporate the use of the JC antibody assay.&#xD;
      Upon FDA approval of the label change, the JC assay will serve as a primary risk&#xD;
      stratification tool in the clinical use of Tysabri. Secondary and tertiary risk&#xD;
      stratification markers would greatly aid in the clinical management of patients who are JC&#xD;
      antibody positive.&#xD;
