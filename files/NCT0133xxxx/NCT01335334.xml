    <textblock>
      The proposed open-label one arm before-after clinical trial will assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      14-day quadruple therapy containing 420mg of bismuth subcitrate potassium, 375mg of&#xD;
      metronidazole, 375mg of tetracycline hydrochloride (Pylera® packs from Axcan Pharma) and 20mg&#xD;
      of omeprazole in eradicating H. pylori infection in 50 asymptomatic adults in El Paso, Texas.&#xD;
      As part of the study we will obtain specimens for culture of H. pylori in a reference&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether this FDA approved treatment taken for 14-days is at least 85%&#xD;
      effective in eradicating H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 18-65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to and who provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who meet the inclusion and inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females of Reproductive Potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a female subject becomes pregnant while on this study, the study drug will be discontinued&#xD;
      immediately and the subject followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. If a&#xD;
      pregnancy occurs, it will be reported as an unexpected AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature Subject Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative&#xD;
      reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occurrence of an AE, which in the judgment of the investigator suggests an unacceptable&#xD;
           risk to the subject (The investigator will follow the subject until satisfactory&#xD;
           resolution of the AE or the AE is determined to be stable.);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  development on-study of any condition fulfilling one of the exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy; and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subject request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however they may voluntarily withdraw at&#xD;
      any time. The investigator must provide written documentation of the reason for&#xD;
      discontinuation on the appropriate study form. Regardless of the reason for or source of&#xD;
      withdrawal, all subjects will be asked to undergo an end of therapy evaluation and a 45+-day&#xD;
      after completing the study medication. Additionally, subjects who discontinue study drug for&#xD;
      any reason, without meeting any of the criteria listed above, may continue in the study. Such&#xD;
      subjects will have no further efficacy evaluations following the last study drug dose, but&#xD;
      will continue all safety assessments through the 10 days of follow-up. Subjects who withdraw&#xD;
      or are withdrawn will not be replaced under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening for Helicobacter pylori infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a novel antibody immunoassay test to detect H. pylori antibodies&#xD;
      in urine specimens will be used. The urine sample (0.5 mL) for the RAPIRUN H. pylori antibody&#xD;
      test was transferred into a sample diluent tube and will be mixed with the aid of disposable&#xD;
      pipette. Approximately 0.2 mL of this mixture will be dropped onto the test device. The test&#xD;
      will be considered positive if a colored line is seen in both the test and control windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of Helicobacter pylori infection status&#xD;
&#xD;
      For UBT, breath samples will be collected at a visit scheduled 45+ after the end of the&#xD;
      eradication treatment, in disposable bags with a one-way valve designed for the use of the&#xD;
      UBit 300 (Meretek Diagnostics, LaFayette, CO). A baseline breath sample will be collected at&#xD;
      the start of the interview then the subject will be given 150 ml of a drink containing citric&#xD;
      acid and 75 mg of 13C-urea. After 20 minutes, a second breath bag will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Culture of Helicobacter pylori&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baylor brush cutoffs will be place in 1 ml of cysteine transport medium with 20% glycerol and&#xD;
      stored at -70 C until processed at the Laboratory of co-I Dr. Graham where will be cultured&#xD;
      in medium consisting of of a horse blood agar (HBA) plate (nonselective medium) or an HBA&#xD;
      plate containing 10 μg/ml nalidixic acid, 5 μg/ml trimethoprim, 3 μg/ml, vancomycin and 2&#xD;
      μg/ml amphotericin B (selective medium). MIC testing for clarithromycin, tinidazole and&#xD;
      amoxicillin will be conducted using agar dilution methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening for Eligibility, pregnancy testing and physical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who tested positive to a screening urine test, and subsequently to a urea breath&#xD;
      test, will be invited to a visit where the aims, procedures, risks, benefits, and issues of&#xD;
      confidentiality and subject's right will be revisited and a consent form will be given for&#xD;
      them to take home and review. Subjects will be asked questions to screen for eligibility&#xD;
      prior to a clinical evaluation by the Medical director, and will be asked about current&#xD;
      medical conditions, dyspepsia symptoms, if currently pregnant, medical personal and family&#xD;
      history, and their weight, height, 3' resting blood pressure, heart beat, and temperature&#xD;
      will be measured and recorded, a blood sample will be collected to screen for kidney and&#xD;
      liver conditions. If the research assistant deems the persons eligible, and willing to take&#xD;
      part s/he will schedule an appointment to be seen by Dr. Salazar and bring the signed&#xD;
      consent. Subjects will be asked to be fasting for at least eight hours. Once the results of&#xD;
      kidney and liver functions are available, the subjects will be seen by Dr. Salazar to assess&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. At that time, while subjects have been fasting for at least&#xD;
      3 hours, Dr. Salazar will collect samples for culture from gastric mucosa using the Baylor&#xD;
      oro-gastric brush as follows: after topical oral anesthesia, the brush assembly is swallowed,&#xD;
      the brush is extended in the stomach and to and fro for 3-4 cm, 3-4 times and then retracted&#xD;
      into the protective sleeve and withdrawn from the patient (total time after anesthesia ~1&#xD;
      min). The brush will be gently touched to a glass slide for Gram staining, then tip of the&#xD;
      brush will be cut off and the brush shaken in a dram vial containing approximately 1 mL of&#xD;
      cysteine transport media with 20% glycerol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study medication, dosing and dispensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given a 14-day quadruple [omeprazole (20 mg twice daily) + (420 mg of&#xD;
      bismuth subcitrate potassium four times a day)+metronidazole (375 mg four times a day)+&#xD;
      tetracycline hydrochloride (375 mg four times a day) for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be given 14 daily dosing packs containing 12 PYLERA™ capsules and 2&#xD;
      omeprazole tablets each along with oral and written instructions. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      repeat the instructions back.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone call or household visit will take place at day 7. Subjects will be asked &quot;Do you have&#xD;
      any new symptom since you started taking the study medication?&quot; Closed-ended question will&#xD;
      also ask for solicited adverse events. Also during this evaluation, the study subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to provide us with any unused drugs to count the number of tablets and capsules left&#xD;
      and record in the appropriate forms. Another visit will be scheduled at day 14 following the&#xD;
      same protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45+day Evaluation 3 At day 45+ during the sixth visit and will serve the purpose of&#xD;
           asking the same question (&quot;Do you have any new symptom since you started taking the&#xD;
           study medication?&quot;), collect specimens for a second urea breath test, and complete an&#xD;
           exit survey to assess subject's satisfaction with the research experience and obtain&#xD;
           their guess of the arm they were assigned to. The validated dyspepsia questionnaire will&#xD;
           be administered again to assess changes in symptoms as well.&#xD;
