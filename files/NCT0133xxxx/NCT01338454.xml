  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetrical hemorrhage accounts for nearly one quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide and&#xD;
      was the most common cause of maternal death in the Turkey [1,2]. Most of these deaths occur&#xD;
      within 4 h of delivery and are a result of problems during third and fourth stages of labor.&#xD;
      It also contributes significantly to serious maternal morbidity. Obstetric, surgical and&#xD;
      radiological interventions play central role in the management of obstetric hemorrhage;&#xD;
      however, pharmacologic management and in particular prohemostatic therapies also play an&#xD;
      important role in the final maternal outcome. Administration of tranexamic acid (TA),&#xD;
      intravenously in the third stage of labor may be one of these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TA a synthetic derivate of the amino acid lysine, is an antifibrinolytic that reversibly&#xD;
      inhibits the activation of plasminogen, thus inhibiting fibrinolysis and reducing bleeding.&#xD;
      TA may enhance the effectiveness of the patient's own hemostatic mechanism [3,4]. In&#xD;
      nonobstetric surgery, a systematic review of randomized controlled trails showed that&#xD;
      tranexamic acid reduced the risk of blood transfusion [ relative risk (RR) 0.61; 95% CI&#xD;
      0.54-0.69] and also reduced the need for re-operation as a result of bleeding (RR 0.67; 95%&#xD;
      CI 0.41-1.09). There was no evidence for an increased risk of thrombotic events [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In gynecology and obstetrics, TA is most commonly used to treat idiopathic menorrhagia, and&#xD;
      is an effective and well-tolerated treatment when administered orally [5,6,7]. Bleeding&#xD;
      associated with pregnancy (placental abruption, placenta previa) has also been treated with&#xD;
      TA [6]. Furthermore, four randomized controlled studies have shown that TA reduces postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage (PPH) following cesarean delivery [7-11]. Only one randomized trail is available&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of TA use to prevent bleeding in the postpartum period following&#xD;
      spontaneous vaginal delivery [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study was to estimate the effect of the addition of intravenous TA to a&#xD;
      standard active management of the third stage of labor (which includes prophylactic injection&#xD;
      of 10 IU of oxytocin within two minutes of birth, early clamping of the umbilical cord, and&#xD;
      controlled cord traction).&#xD;
