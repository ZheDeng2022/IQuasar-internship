  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression is a key intervention in patients with solid organ transplant and is&#xD;
      usually achieved by combination therapy with systemic CsA or tacrolimus with azathioprine,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or corticoids. However, the outcomes after lung transplantation&#xD;
      are poor when compared with those after heart, kidney, or liver transplantation, with a&#xD;
      survival rate of only 55% for recipients of lung transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional application of aerosolised L-CsA should suppress T-cell activation in the lung&#xD;
      tissue and subsequently BOS development. The overall purpose of this phase-II/III study is to&#xD;
      obtain efficacy and safety data of L-CsA in the prevention of BOS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventive therapeutic intervention by L-CsA is primarily aimed to suppress T-lymphocyte&#xD;
      suppression and inflammatory responses and secondly to prevent fibrotic effects making it&#xD;
      more likely to be effective in early stages of BOS. Early development of BOS, which mostly&#xD;
      will not be diagnosed, and acute organ rejections are strongly patho-physiological&#xD;
      associated. Prevention of the very early development of chronic rejection by L-CsA post LTX&#xD;
      may be the ideal starting point for IMP application.&#xD;
