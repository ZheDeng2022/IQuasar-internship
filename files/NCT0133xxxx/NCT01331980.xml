      Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 30,000 people in the United States and is caused by&#xD;
      a mutation in the gene encoding a protein called CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The&#xD;
      hallmarks of CF are recurrent pulmonary exacerbations and declining pulmonary function.&#xD;
      However, there are other problems in CF that affect both health and quality of life. These&#xD;
      include CF related diabetes, liver disease, and bone disease. The median age of survival for&#xD;
      patients with CF has been increasing steadily and is currently more than 37 years. With this&#xD;
      improvement in life expectancy, it has become increasingly important to address the long-term&#xD;
      complications of CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients with CF are evaluated annually for bone disease with dual X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA), and screening usually starts at age 12. However, this may not be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect early bone changes that may impact fracture risk. Furthermore, bone&#xD;
      disease in children may manifest earlier than adolescence, which would suggest that screening&#xD;
      should start at an earlier age in these vulnerable patients. The following study is therefore&#xD;
      proposed to examine the potential role of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)&#xD;
      as a screening approach for bone disease in children with CF. The investigators expect to&#xD;
      find bone problems by pQCT but not DXA.&#xD;

      This is a single-center study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Primary Objective Compare bone measurements (by pQCT of the radius and DXA scan of&#xD;
           the lumbar spine and total body) in children with CF 6-12 years of age to healthy&#xD;
           children. Measurements by pQCT to be compared will include cortex width, trabecular bone&#xD;
           mineral density (BMD), and volumetric BMD. Measurements by DXA to be compared will&#xD;
           include total body bone mineral density and lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Secondary Objectives Compare Z-scores of pQCT parameters to Z-scores of BMD as&#xD;
           measured by DXA in children with CF 6-12 years of age. The Z-scores for each CF subject&#xD;
           for pQCT measurements (cortex width, trabecular BMD, volumetric BMD) and DXA&#xD;
           measurements (total body BMD and lumbar spine BMD) will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compare correlation of pQCT parameters and BMD as measured by DXA to markers of bone&#xD;
           turnover and inflammation (serum propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), total serum&#xD;
           deoxypyridinoline, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor (TNF)-alpha) in children with CF 6-12 years of age and healthy controls. As an&#xD;
           exploratory specific aim, the correlation between these serum markers and the bone&#xD;
           measurements in Specific Aim 1 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 30,000 people in the United States1 and is caused&#xD;
      by a mutation in the gene encoding a protein called CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). This&#xD;
      protein functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells of multiple organ systems. The&#xD;
      mutation results in a dysfunctional or absent CFTR channel and a decrease in chloride&#xD;
      secretion, which ultimately results in increased viscosity of secretions. Children with CF&#xD;
      are less able to clear pulmonary secretions and become colonized with bacterial pathogens&#xD;
      that regularly cause exacerbation of lung disease. The hallmarks of CF are recurrent&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbations and declining pulmonary function. Respiratory failure is the cause of&#xD;
      death in more than 90% of people with CF. However, there are also extrapulmonary&#xD;
      manifestations of CF that affect both health and quality of life. These include CF related&#xD;
      diabetes, liver disease, and bone disease. The median age of survival for patients with CF&#xD;
      has been increasing steadily and is currently more than 37 years.1 With this improvement in&#xD;
      life expectancy, it has become increasingly important to address the long-term complications&#xD;
      of CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis among both adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients with CF and this steadily increases with age. There is also an associated increase&#xD;
      in fracture rate and kyphosis in adults. Studies evaluating fracture risk in children with CF&#xD;
      have generated mixed results. Henderson et al reported an increased rate of fracture in girls&#xD;
      with CF, but not boys, in comparison to healthy controls. A more recent study by Rovner et al&#xD;
      showed no increase in fracture risk among children with mild to moderate lung disease.&#xD;
      Bisphosphonates have been used to treat osteopenia and osteoporosis in adults with CF and&#xD;
      clinical trials have shown that there is an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) with&#xD;
      therapy. However, there is no published data demonstrating a reduced fracture rate with&#xD;
      bisphosphonate therapy. Furthermore, there is currently no consensus on how to treat&#xD;
      osteopenia or osteoporosis in children with CF other than to ensure adequate nutrition and&#xD;
      vitamin D levels. Although CF bone disease is considerably more prevalent in the adults than&#xD;
      in children, screening for bone disease must be addressed in childhood to maximize peak bone&#xD;
      mass and potentially minimize bone related disease in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers of bone turnover may be used to evaluate derangements in bone formation&#xD;
      and/or resorption. Studies conducted in CF patients have shown in general a decrease in&#xD;
      markers of bone formation and increase in markers of bone resorption. Conway et al reported&#xD;
      correlation between markers of bone turnover and both spinal and total body BMD; however, no&#xD;
      studies have evaluated whether bone turnover markers correlate with pQCT parameters. Serum&#xD;
      PICP is a peptide cleaved from the carboxy-terminal end of collagen type I and is a marker of&#xD;
      bone formation. Deoxypyridinoline is a cross-linking amino acid that is released from the&#xD;
      bone matrix by resorption, and thus is a marker of bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of bone disease in patients with CF is multifactorial and contributing factors&#xD;
      include poor nutrition, decreased activity levels, poor absorption of vitamin D, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, and therapy with corticosteroids. Multiple studies have correlated BMD with&#xD;
      clinical factors such as lung function, nutritional status, inflammation markers, clinical&#xD;
      score, and frequency of antibiotic courses. Studies evaluating the relationship between&#xD;
      inflammation markers and bone in CF patients have been somewhat mixed, although in general&#xD;
      have shown an inverse relationship between inflammation and BMD, and a direct correlation&#xD;
      between inflammation and increased bone resorption markers. Inflammation markers evaluated&#xD;
      have included both acute-phase cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and the general marker&#xD;
      CRP. There is some evidence that CFTR is expressed in bone cells such as osteoclasts,&#xD;
      osteoblasts, and osteocytes, suggesting the potential for a bone phenotype in patients with&#xD;
      CF. Most studies utilize DXA and demonstrate reduced BMD in patients with CF that is usually&#xD;
      detectable starting in adolescence. Low BMD is nearly universal among adults with CF;&#xD;
      however, results from studies evaluating BMD in children with CF have been variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted in adolescents and young adults with CF utilized pQCT to evaluate bone&#xD;
      geometry of the radius. Although BMD was normal for these subjects, pQCT data indicated that&#xD;
      the subjects had a reduced cortical thickness. Reduced cortical thickness has been shown in&#xD;
      cadaveric studies to be predictive of mechanical strength. Currently, patients with CF are&#xD;
      evaluated annually for bone disease with DXA, and screening usually starts at approximately&#xD;
      age. However, the above study suggests that this approach may not be sufficient to detect&#xD;
      early bone changes that may impact fracture risk. Furthermore, bone disease in children may&#xD;
      manifest earlier than adolescence, which would suggest that screening should start at an&#xD;
      earlier age in these vulnerable patients. The following study is therefore proposed as a&#xD;
      translational pilot study to examine the potential role of pQCT as a screening approach for&#xD;
      bone disease in children with CF. The investigators expect to find bone deficits by pQCT but&#xD;
      not DXA, and better correlation of inflammation and bone turnover markers with pQCT&#xD;
      measurements than with DXA measurements.&#xD;
