  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to gather safety and immunogenicity data with Purified Vero Rabies&#xD;
      Vaccine - Serum Free (VRVg), when given in a post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule,&#xD;
      using the Essen regimen, across different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab&#xD;
           vaccine, in terms of proportion of participants with a rabies virus neutralizing&#xD;
           antibody titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at Day 14, i.e., before the fourth vaccination, in&#xD;
           participants aged 10 to 17 years and in participants aged 18 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a&#xD;
           post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule in each respective age group and overall&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg before the fourth vaccination and 14&#xD;
           days after the last vaccination in each respective age groups and overall.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive five vaccinations (on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) and will be&#xD;
      assessed for immunogenic response on Days 0, 14, and 42. They will also be monitored for&#xD;
      safety from the day of the first vaccination and for up to 6 months after the final&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
