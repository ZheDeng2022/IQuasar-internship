  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exudative age-related macular degeneration (&quot;wet&quot; AMD) continues to be a leading cause of&#xD;
      central vision loss in the US for those over fifty years of age, despite the availability of&#xD;
      several effective interventions to contain damaging neovascularization (new, abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessel growth). The effectiveness of treatments is challenged by patients' lack of ability to&#xD;
      recognize the need for urgent care between regular office visits. The Amsler and Yanuzzi&#xD;
      tests, the only widely used self-tests for AMD, have proven largely ineffective at enabling&#xD;
      patients to recognize the signs that they should consult their retina specialist for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For optimal benefit, patients should be able to self-monitor their vision over time and&#xD;
      detect changes that may be indicative of an exudative event. To facilitate compliance these&#xD;
      observations should be part of a larger and more engaging program of AMD awareness and&#xD;
      self-monitoring. Among the principal shortcomings of the current &quot;gold-standard&quot; Amsler grid&#xD;
      are periodicity of the test pattern and lack of individual adjustment, and therefore the&#xD;
      reliability and accuracy of this test are less than optimal for the detection of exudative&#xD;
      retinal changes in AMD patients. In phase I of the current study, the investigatorsW&#xD;
      developed and evaluated several versions of improved grids, both on paper and on the&#xD;
      Internet. These patent-pending Visual and Memory Stimulating (VMS) grids proved at least&#xD;
      equivalent to the Amsler grid in facilitating a substantial degree of recall of prior&#xD;
      measurements, necessary for monitoring vision over time. Adjustment features were&#xD;
      incorporated in the on-line version to allow patients to customize their grid to their&#xD;
      particular visual field. In the phase II study the use of VMS grids will be supplemented by a&#xD;
      test booklet that contains educational materials and diary based survey questions in addition&#xD;
      to the printed VMS grids; the effectiveness of this booklet for self-monitoring will be&#xD;
      compared the standard of care (Amsler grid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of the study is to demonstrate that use of the test booklet leads to more rapid&#xD;
      identification of newly developing vision problems, earlier diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      incipient wet AMD that should result in fewer people losing their vision and less severe&#xD;
      losses of vision.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of AREDS grade 3 or 4 AMD in at least one eye will&#xD;
             be recruited for components 1 and 2 of the study. The participants will include&#xD;
             healthy adults who are willing and able to complete the study tests. We will recruit&#xD;
             AMD patients across a wide range of races and ages, but due to the prevalence of AMD,&#xD;
             most of the patients will be Caucasian and over age 55. We will verify ocular&#xD;
             diagnosis and visual function status of all subjects through records and communication&#xD;
             provided by their retinal specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with vision loss due to ocular pathology other than AMD or cataracts will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cataract extraction in the last 3 months or capsulotomy in the last 24&#xD;
             hours in either eye will also be excluded, as well as those who are unable to give&#xD;
             informed consent, non-English speaking or unable complete any other required study&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
