  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 60% of patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux symptoms such as heartburn and&#xD;
      regurgitation are considered to have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). Patients with NERD&#xD;
      show an overall poorer response to PPI treatment than patients with erosive reflux disease.&#xD;
      Sodium alginate oral suspension is a medication indicated for the relief of gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux symptoms. This multi-center, double blind, randomized trial aims to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50 mg/ml) 20 ml three times&#xD;
      daily with that of omeprazole (20 mg/capsule) 1 capsule once daily for the treatment of NERD&#xD;
      patients in Taiwan. Efficacy assessments include percentage of patients achieving adequate&#xD;
      relief of heartburn or regurgitation after 4 weeks treatment, improvement of reflux symptoms&#xD;
      as assessed by reflux disease questionnaire before and after treatment, and patients overall&#xD;
      satisfaction at the end of study. Safety assessments include incidence of adverse events and&#xD;
      change of the laboratory test results. The study hypothesis is that treatment with sodium&#xD;
      alginate is non-inferior to omeprazole in relieving heartburn or regurgitation symptoms of&#xD;
      the NERD patients.&#xD;

      This multi-center, double blind, randomized trial aims to compared the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profiles of sodium alginate oral suspension (50 mg/ml) 20 ml three times daily with that of&#xD;
      omeprazole (20 mg/capsule) 1 capsule once daily for the treatment of non-erosive reflux&#xD;
      disease (NERD) patients in Taiwan. Patients will be included into study if they are diagnosed&#xD;
      as NERD; with heartburn or regurgitation (either one) as main symptom at least 2 days a week&#xD;
      and had been present for ≧1 month before screening; with heartburn or regurgitation (either&#xD;
      one) during the 7 days screening period, either with frequency for ≧4 days of mild symptom,&#xD;
      or ≧ 2 days of moderate to severe symptom; and have signed the informed consent. Patients&#xD;
      will be excluded if they are diagnosed as erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus or esophageal stricture; with active or healing gastroduodenal ulcer&#xD;
      (except scars); with history of gastric, duodenal or esophageal surgery; with intrahepatic&#xD;
      stone, gallstone, gallbladder sludge, hepatic or pancreatic carcinoma as evidenced by&#xD;
      abdominal ultrasonography, with ischemic heart disease as evidenced by electrocardiogram;&#xD;
      taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 14 days before screening, or a H2-blocker,&#xD;
      prokinetic agent or antacid within 7 days before screening; or with clinically significant&#xD;
      liver or kidney disease. The primary efficacy endpoint is percentage of patients achieving&#xD;
      adequate heartburn (defined as a burning feeling or pain behind the breast bone) or&#xD;
      regurgitation (defined as an acid taste in the mouth or unpleasant movement of material&#xD;
      upwards from the stomach) relief at day 28 as assessed by patient diary. The secondary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints are percentage of patients achieving adequate heartburn or regurgitation&#xD;
      relief at day 14; change from baseline of the reflux disease questionnaire total score at day&#xD;
      14 &amp; 28; patients' overall satisfaction at the end of study; and number of antacid used&#xD;
      during the 4-week treatment period. The safety endpoints are incidence of adverse events, and&#xD;
      changes in laboratory test results (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis). The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that treatment with sodium alginate is non-inferior to omeprazole in relieving&#xD;
      heartburn or regurgitation symptoms of the NERD patients.&#xD;
