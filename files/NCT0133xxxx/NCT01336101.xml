  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical registry is to demonstrate the efficacy of the EPIC™ stent in&#xD;
      patients with superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesion will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      shall undergo 4 visits during the trial -a pre-procedure visit, procedure visit at which time&#xD;
      the stent will be placed, and follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent with Delivery System will&#xD;
      be efficacious in patients with Superficial Femoro/Popliteal Artery disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SUMMIT Registry addresses the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD represents a major challenge to physicians in treating the Superficial Femoral (SFA) and&#xD;
      Popliteal arteries. These vessels are exposed to enormous mechanical stress what represents a&#xD;
      harsh environment for any endovascular device. During flexing of the knee, the SFA/Popliteal&#xD;
      arteries can bend, rotate, elongate and compress dramatically. An ideal stent designed for&#xD;
      use in the SFA/Popliteal arteries would offer great ranges of movement while adequately&#xD;
      supporting the arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject of study is the EPIC™ Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System which provides a&#xD;
      great range of motions for a highly flexible femoral artery while adequately supporting the&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the device in treating lesions of the&#xD;
      SFA/Popliteal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a multi-centre open label study. Primary efficacy parameter will be assessed&#xD;
      by measuring the in-stent binary stenosis using duplex ultrasound at 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the stent placement. Binary restenosis is defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR)&#xD;
      ≥2.5:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated study duration is 18 months: 6 months recruiting and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
