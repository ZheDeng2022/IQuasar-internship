    <description>A group received BSS ® (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC.) and another group received glucose-bicarbonate-Ringer Lactate (GBRL) [500 cc. Ringer Lactate (GLICOLABOR, Pharmaceutical LTD.) enriched with 1.5 ml of glucose in water (25%) and 08 ml of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%)] as a solution for irrigation during surgery.&#xD;
All surgeries were performed by single surgeon (HON), using the standard surgical technique quick-chop. Immediately before surgery, solutions for irrigation [BSS ® (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC..) and glucose-bicarbonate-Ringer Lactate (GBRL)] were brought to the operating table in a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. The microcoaxial Phacoemulsification was performed under a phaco Legacy Series 20000 (ALCON LABORATORIES, INC..).</description>
