  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The small bowel biopsy is the cornerstone of for the diagnosis of celiac disease. In addition&#xD;
      to being the gold standard for the initial diagnosis of celiac disease, periodic biopsies are&#xD;
      also recommended on an ongoing basis for this life-long disease. However, biopsy evaluation&#xD;
      is invasive and expensive. Therefore, there is a need for simple, non-invasive tests that can&#xD;
      be performed on celiac patients with subclinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is based on the hypothesis that the expression and activity of cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 CYP3A4 in the small intestinal mucosa is a sensitive measure of enteropathy. Therefore&#xD;
      small intestinal CYP3A4 activity will be markedly different in celiac disease patients with&#xD;
      active disease as compared to patients in remission. Small intestinal CYP3A4 activity will be&#xD;
      measured in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Cmax of oral simvastatin, a widely used drug that is predominantly metabolized by small&#xD;
      intestinal CYP3A4; (ii) AUC of oral simvastatin; and (iii) Measurement of CYP3A4 activity in&#xD;
      two small bowel biopsies.&#xD;

      in two small bowel biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between villus height: crypt&#xD;
           depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the specific activity of CYP3A4 in small intestinal biopsy&#xD;
           samples derived from subjects with celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that an inverse correlation exists between small intestinal&#xD;
           villus height: crypt depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of&#xD;
           simvastatin (20 mg, orally dosed after fasting) in subjects with celiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that an inverse correlation exists between small intestinal&#xD;
           villus height: crypt depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the serum area-under-the-curve (AUC) of&#xD;
           simvastatin (20 mg, orally dosed after fasting) in subjects with celiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between small intestinal&#xD;
           villus height : crypt depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the relative expression level of CYP3A4&#xD;
           protein in subjects with celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that an inverse correlation exists between small intestinal&#xD;
           villus height : crypt depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the concentration of simvastatin (20 mg,&#xD;
           orally dosed after fasting) in a 6-hour urine collection from subjects with celiac&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between villus height : crypt&#xD;
           depth (Vh:Cd) ratio and the specific activity of CYP3A4 in small intestinal biopsy&#xD;
           samples derived from subjects with celiac disease who have followed a gluten-free diet&#xD;
           for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
