      This study will investigate the effects of gastric bypass surgery on type II diabetes. The&#xD;
      study will recruit patients with type II diabetes having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients&#xD;
      without type II diabetes having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and control subjects (patients&#xD;
      having gastroscopy, but no surgery). Targeted enrollment is 30 patients per group. Samples of&#xD;
      intestine are taken prior to surgery in gastroscopy, during surgery, and 6 months after&#xD;
      surgery during gastroscopy. Meal test with incretin measurements, and feces and blood&#xD;
      samplings are performed before and after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pathogenesis of type II diabetes is linked to changes in the expression of&#xD;
           intestinal endocrine cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The changes in the incretine excretion after the gastric bypass surgery partly explain&#xD;
           the amelioration of type II diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The oxidation of lipoprotein is diminished after the gastric bypass surgery slowing the&#xD;
           development of atherosclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunologic functions of the intestine are changed by the gastric bypass surgery&#xD;
           attenuating systemic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gastric bypass surgery changes cholesterol and bile acid metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gastric bypass surgery changes the fecal microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the amounts of endocrine cells in ventricle, duodenum and jejunum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the incretine secretion studied with liquid meal test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the oxidation of lipoproteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the immunologic markers in ventricle, duodenum and jejunum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the amounts of phytosterols, cholesterol metabolites and bile acids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in fecal microbiota&#xD;
