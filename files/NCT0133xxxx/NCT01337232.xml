  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine how much therapy is needed in order to make significant&#xD;
      gains in knowledge and use of complex sentences. Students will be randomly placed in&#xD;
      individual treatment sessions that take place either once or twice per week for nine weeks.&#xD;
      All will receive the same type of treatment, which consists of a focused series of oral and&#xD;
      written language activities. While it is anticipated that students in both groups will&#xD;
      benefit from treatment, we hypothesize that the twice-weekly session frequency will have a&#xD;
      significantly greater impact on level of performance and maintenance of skills after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      The objective of this project is to examine outcomes of a treatment intervention designed to&#xD;
      increase functional use of complex (multi-clausal) sentences in school-age students with&#xD;
      primary language impairments that impact literacy and academic achievement. The treatment&#xD;
      protocol includes: (1) three types of complex sentences (adverbial, relative, object&#xD;
      complement), (2) encounters with complex sentences in real texts and across all modalities&#xD;
      (speaking, listening, reading, writing, and (3) activities that engage metalinguistic&#xD;
      understanding of complex sentences. Specific objectives are to (1) document treatment effect&#xD;
      in terms of size and scope of impact in decontextualized as well as naturalistic language&#xD;
      contexts, (2) document the effect of treatment intensity (dosage), (3) explore effects of&#xD;
      sentence complexity subtype and treatment outcomes, and (4) explore relationships between&#xD;
      treatment outcomes and participant variables (pre-treatment knowledge of complex sentences,&#xD;
      verbal working memory, and non-verbal cognition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize two designs. Approximately 10 participants per year will complete the&#xD;
      treatment, randomly assigned to one of two treatment levels. As each participant finishes,&#xD;
      efficacy and effect size will be measured using a multiple-baseline single-subject design.&#xD;
      Once all 30 participants have completed the treatment, effect size and the impact of dosage&#xD;
      (treatment intensity) will be evaluated using a pretest-posttest group design, and&#xD;
      correlations between participant characteristics and individual patterns of performance will&#xD;
      be carefully described and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study targets school-age students with a Speech-Language Impairment and/or a Specific&#xD;
      Learning Disability between the ages of 10 and 14 who are receiving services from a&#xD;
      Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) for one or more higher-level language behaviors. It is&#xD;
      expected that participants will demonstrate higher levels of fluency with complex sentences&#xD;
      compared with pretreatment baseline levels and that treatment effects will be reflected in&#xD;
      several modalities and in naturalistic language contexts.&#xD;
