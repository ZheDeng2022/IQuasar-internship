  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated three million people are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) in the UK, giving it a prevalence of 1.5% of the population in 2007/08. COPD accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 30,000 deaths each year in the UK and is an important co-morbidity in those&#xD;
      dying from other smoking related diseases, most commonly ischaemic heart disease and lung&#xD;
      cancer. The National COPD audit showed a very high level of co-morbidity, the association&#xD;
      with cardiovascular disease being particularly strong with 51% of patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease having been admitted for COPD within the preceding 24 months. Patients&#xD;
      with COPD are at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to the general population.&#xD;
      Although this increase in cardiovascular risk exists, it is not clear is whether survival&#xD;
      after myocardial infarction is different in patients with and without COPD and what factors&#xD;
      contribute to this survival difference. Differences in survival may arise due to differences&#xD;
      in prescribing certain drugs such as beta-blockers, differences in prevalence of risk factors&#xD;
      (e.g. current smoking status) or increased COPD events such as exacerbations which themselves&#xD;
      are associated with increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary aim is to investigate whether survival after first myocardial&#xD;
      infarction is shorter in patients with COPD than those without COPD and to establish reasons&#xD;
      for these differences in survival.&#xD;

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke&#xD;
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia&#xD;
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching&#xD;
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary&#xD;
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a&#xD;
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref&#xD;
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate survival differences after first myocardial infarction in patients with&#xD;
           and without COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate if these survival differences exist due to a) differences in prevalence&#xD;
           of risk factors (e.g. smoking) b) differences in management after myocardial infarction&#xD;
           (e.g. uptake of cardiac rehabilitation, prescription of beta-blockers) and c) COPD&#xD;
           related events (e.g. exacerbations).&#xD;

        The study population is comprised of patients registered at those GPRD practices that&#xD;
        agreed to the linkage with the MINAP database, and whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot;&#xD;
        according to GPRD criteria. Practices taking part in the GPRD are chosen to be&#xD;
        representative of all UK practices, and 98% of people in the UK are registered with a GP.&#xD;
        Therefore the GPRD should be a representative sample of the UK population&#xD;
