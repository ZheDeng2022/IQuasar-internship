  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an impressive and growing body of data suggesting that massage therapy is effective&#xD;
      in decreasing some symptoms of pathological conditions as well as facilitating growth,&#xD;
      reducing pain, increasing alertness, diminishing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and&#xD;
      enhancing immune function. Preliminary studies suggest that massage therapy decreases&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lowers salivary cortisol levels in a wide array of&#xD;
      childhood and adult neuropsychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder,&#xD;
      attention-deficit-disorder hyperactivity, depression, bulimia and anorexia-nervosa.&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by the presence of a constellation of&#xD;
      signs and symptoms for at least 6 months in duration, with some type of functional disability&#xD;
      or decrease in quality of life. The signs and symptoms of GAD include a myriad of somatic&#xD;
      symptoms including muscle tension, headaches, backaches, fatigue, restlessness, insomnia, as&#xD;
      well as psychological feelings of worry, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. Both&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are effective in decreasing the signs and symptoms of GAD.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients with GAD never receive adequate pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      or psychotherapy. Therefore, the development of a complementary and alternative therapy that&#xD;
      has demonstrated efficacy for GAD might be well received by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's goals are to investigate the efficacy of Swedish massage therapy vs. light touch&#xD;
      therapy and better understand the biological effects of massage in patients with anxiety.&#xD;
      Qualified participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in which they will&#xD;
      receive Swedish massage therapy twice per week for 12 weeks or Light Touch therapy twice per&#xD;
      week for 6 weeks followed by Swedish massage therapy twice per week for the next 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      total length of the study is 13 weeks, which includes a screening visit that takes about 3&#xD;
      hours and two therapy visits per week for 12 weeks that last about 1 hour each. Blood and&#xD;
      urine will be collected at three of the visits. Compensation is up to $400 for completing the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
