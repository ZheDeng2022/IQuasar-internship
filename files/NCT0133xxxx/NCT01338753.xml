      The purpose of this study is to compare the association between image and certain molecular&#xD;
      markers with complete response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy composed of Bevacizumab, Docetaxel and Doxorubicin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacogenomic phase II, multicenter, prospective clinical trial whose main&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the association of molecular and imaging markers with the response&#xD;
      to bevacizumab administration in combination with docetaxel and doxorubicin as neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients diagnose with locally advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
