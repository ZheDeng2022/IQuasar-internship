      A Phase II trial of the addition of Ipilimumab to Carboplatin and Etoposide chemotherapy for&#xD;
      the first line treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ICE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive Stage Small cell lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the progression free survival at 1 year in patients with extensive stage small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer treated with ipilimumab, carboplatin and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response to and toxicity of the combination of ipilimumab with carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine whether ipilimumab stimulates a humoral immune response to onco-neuronal&#xD;
           self-antigens&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results from the above measurement of antibodies against onco-neuronal antigens will&#xD;
           be used to focus the cellular biomarker analysis and identify targets to assess cellular&#xD;
           responses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the effect of ipilimumab on CD8+ T-cells directed against onco-neuronal&#xD;
           antigens, presumed to be responsible for the desired cytotoxic activity against cancer&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the immune response to non-neuronal antigens in the presence of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer accounts for around 20% of all lung cancer presentation in the UK. Of&#xD;
      these approximately half present with extensive disease, overall representing 4000 new cases&#xD;
      annually. Although initial response to chemotherapy for this group of patients ranges from&#xD;
      50-60% 1, 2, subsequent relapse is inevitable and results in poor survival with only 5% of&#xD;
      patients alive at 2 years from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite attempts to improve on conventional chemotherapy with platinum and etoposide in&#xD;
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer, neither modification of conventional chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      drugs, nor the use of novel targeted therapy has shown an increased benefit. A conceptual&#xD;
      change in therapeutic strategy is therefore required, and immunotherapy is an attractive&#xD;
      avenue to pursue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-CTLA4 antibody may allow the development or induction of anti-tumour immunity even in&#xD;
      the absence of a known tumour antigen and without active anti-tumour vaccination.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy effectively kills tumour cells and releases tumour derived antigens and as such&#xD;
      administration of anti-CTL4 antibody may induce a clinically useful anti-tumour immune&#xD;
      response against these antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will therefore investigate the addition of the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab to&#xD;
      conventional carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy in extensive stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single stage non-randomised phase II trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited so that 40 patients are treated with chemo-immunotherapy. If 8 or&#xD;
      more patients are progression free at 1 year the treatment will be considered to be&#xD;
      successful and warrant further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients consented will form the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Patients who have received at least 1 dose of Ipilimumab will form the analysis population&#xD;
      (N=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage Regimen/Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy according to&#xD;
      response and toxicity. Carboplatin will be administered at a dose of AUC = 6 (calculated&#xD;
      according to the Calvert formula using a Cockcroft and Gault calculation of creatinine&#xD;
      clearance) IV, day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etoposide will be administered at 120mg/m2 IV day 1, 100mg BD PO days 2 and 3. Both&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs will be delivered as a 21 day cycle (q21) with up to a maximum of 6 cycles&#xD;
      delivered according to response unless progressive disease (RECIST) and or excessive&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will be administered at a dose of 10mg/kg IV on day 1 of cycles 3-6 of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of immune related progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity, subsequent&#xD;
      maintenance doses of ipilimumab will be delivered every 12 weeks starting at week 30 at a&#xD;
      dose of 10 mg/kg until unacceptable toxicity or immune related disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour assessments by CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and the following time points until progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 52 and then 12 weekly until progression by both RECIST&#xD;
      and immune related response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that with the current standard of care the trial will take 24 months to&#xD;
      recruit with completion of the trial anticipated in 3 years. The study may however continue&#xD;
      for longer if patients are continuing to receive maintenance ipilimumab, in which case the&#xD;
      study will finish 100 days after the last dose of ipilimumab (when it is clear the last dose&#xD;
      has been given) or when all patients have died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the different safety profile of ipilimumab and carboplatin / etoposide chemotherapy, no&#xD;
      overlapping toxicity is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, throughout the trial, there will be a close monitoring of the nature and the&#xD;
      severity of the adverse events reported on an on-going basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned interim safety monitoring assessment will be performed. Once 9 patients have been&#xD;
      treated with the combination for at least 6 weeks (subjects who discontinued treatment&#xD;
      earlier due to excessive toxicity of chemo-immunotherapy will also be considered), a first&#xD;
      clinical safety assessment will be performed to identify any early safety signals from&#xD;
      ipilimumab given in combination with carboplatin and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition a review of safety may be triggered throughout the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If greater than or equal to 40% of subjects treated develop a greater than or equal to Grade&#xD;
      3 toxicity thought to be related to the study drugs; or If greater than or equal to 10% of&#xD;
      subjects experience an unexpected ipilimumab-related greater than or equal to Grade 3&#xD;
      toxicity that cannot be alleviated or controlled by appropriate care and/or steroid and/or&#xD;
      infliximab therapy within 14 days of the initiation of such therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to any ipilimumab-related deaths unless attributed to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these circumstances the data will be carefully reviewed to determine the appropriate&#xD;
      course of action, which could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continue without modification; Continue with modifications of the study protocol.&#xD;
      Modifications may include, but are not limited to, changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      frequency of safety monitoring, change in ipilimumab dose, and alterations in study&#xD;
      procedures; Discontinue the study (with provisions for orderly discontinuation in accordance&#xD;
      with good medical practice) under extreme circumstances (eg, insufficient benefit-to-risk&#xD;
      effect of the experimental treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to put patient accrual on hold while reviewing safety data will be taken or not,&#xD;
      based on characteristics of the serious adverse events reported on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The review will take into account the known toxicity profile for ipilimumab and for&#xD;
      carboplatin/etoposide, and the potential association of immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs)&#xD;
      with clinical efficacy.&#xD;
