      The proposed research will evaluate new approaches to improving the ability of patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a breathing disorder during sleep, to use continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP), a medical device worn during sleep to treat OSA. 120 patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed OSA who are being initiated on CPAP treatment will be assigned to one of 3&#xD;
      groups: usual care, usual care with web-based access to daily CPAP adherence, and usual care&#xD;
      with web-based access to daily CPAP adherence and a financial incentive to use CPAP at least&#xD;
      4 hours/day in the first week of treatment. Measures of CPAP use, daytime sleepiness, and&#xD;
      quality of life will evaluate whether patients provided web-based access to their daily CPAP&#xD;
      adherence with and without financial incentive will have greater objectively measured average&#xD;
      daily hours of CPAP use and greater improvement in functional outcomes following 3 months of&#xD;
      treatment compared to patients receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will test the hypothesis that these behavioral interventions will improve patient&#xD;
      adherence to CPAP during the critically important first week of treatment when many patients&#xD;
      are deciding whether or not to use CPAP and that this initial level of adherence will be&#xD;
      maintained over the long term despite withdrawal of the financial incentive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a nested clinical study in the NIH funded research project RC2AG036592, &quot;Developing&#xD;
      Interactive Technology to Improve Research and Health Behavior&quot;. The purpose of the research&#xD;
      project is to create a web-based infrastructure to accelerate research in behavioral&#xD;
      economics to improve health. Failure to adhere to medical treatments is a major cause of poor&#xD;
      outcomes that increase health care spending. Changing unhealthful behaviors is difficult. One&#xD;
      barrier to behavioral change is the need to provide patients with immediate, timely&#xD;
      information about their behavior. Individual clinicians cannot maintain the frequent contact&#xD;
      that is required, but technology and automated feedback mechanisms can keep these issues&#xD;
      salient for patients. Internet technology is increasingly seen as an appealing tool to&#xD;
      overcome this barrier and promote patient self-management. Recent evidence indicates that&#xD;
      providing patients with web-based feedback of their health status may improve adherence to&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another barrier to behavioral change is that people need frequent reinforcement of positive&#xD;
      behavior and need that reinforcement often at the time they are making decisions (e.g., to&#xD;
      smoke, to overeat, to take medication). Recent studies report that the use of financial&#xD;
      incentives is an effective strategy to changing health behavior. Incentives in the form of&#xD;
      direct payments provide valuable positive reinforcement and have been shown to change health&#xD;
      behavior in a variety of contexts, including weight loss, medication adherence, and smoking&#xD;
      cessation. One criticism of this approach to changing health behaviors is whether the new&#xD;
      behavior is sustained once the financial incentive is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical study will use the web-based infrastructure that is developed by the&#xD;
      research project to evaluate the application of these emerging new approaches in behavioral&#xD;
      health intervention to improving CPAP adherence and consequent treatment outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with OSA. In the proposed research study, 120 patients with newly diagnosed OSA who are being&#xD;
      initiated on CPAP therapy will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) usual care, 2) usual&#xD;
      care with the ability of the participant to view reports of his/her daily CPAP use on a&#xD;
      password protected website, and 3) usual care with the ability of the participant to view&#xD;
      reports of his/her daily CPAP use on a password protected website combined with a daily&#xD;
      financial incentive in the first week based of hours per day of CPAP use. The proposed health&#xD;
      behavior interventions will 1) provide patients greater access to information about their&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing, and 2) allow patients to become active members of their&#xD;
      management team. Aim 1 will determine if the proposed health behavior interventions improve&#xD;
      average daily hours of CPAP use in the first week and following 3 months of treatment. The&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that these behavioral interventions will improve patient adherence to&#xD;
      CPAP during the critically important first week of treatment when many patients are deciding&#xD;
      whether or not to use CPAP and that this initial level of adherence will be maintained over&#xD;
      the long term despite withdrawal of the financial incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions designed to improve health-related behavior will only be justified if they lead&#xD;
      to greater improvements in clinically relevant outcomes. To determine the impact of the&#xD;
      proposed health behavior interventions to increase CPAP adherence on treatment outcomes, Aim&#xD;
      2 will compare measures of daytime function following 3 months of CPAP treatment across the&#xD;
      three groups. The results of Aim 2 will demonstrate whether improvements in CPAP adherence&#xD;
      due to web-based feedback with or without a financial incentive result in greater&#xD;
      improvements in clinical outcomes.&#xD;
