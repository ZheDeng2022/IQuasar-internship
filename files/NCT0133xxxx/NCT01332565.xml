      This study is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomized, single dose study to determine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of doultegravir (DTG) following 50 mg single oral&#xD;
      administration in healthy Japanese subjects. A total of 10 healthy Japanese subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study to receive a 50 mg single dose of DTG. Subjects will have a screening&#xD;
      visit within 30 days prior to the administration of study drug, a treatment visit, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit 7-14 days after the administration of study drug.&#xD;

             physician with no clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or&#xD;
             laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or&#xD;
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included&#xD;

             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
             or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, or&#xD;
             serum creatinine values greater than the upper limit of normal. A single repeat is&#xD;
             allowed for eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy and pancreatitis should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant renal or hepatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
