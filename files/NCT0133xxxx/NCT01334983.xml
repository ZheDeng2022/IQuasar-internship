      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a gentle physical conditioning program&#xD;
      comprised of isotonic resistive strengthening and pedometer-directed walking can improve the&#xD;
      physical functioning and fatigue of patients with late stage lung or colon cancer.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this prospective pilot cohort study will be used to power and inform the&#xD;
      design of a randomized controlled trial. Its specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the receptivity of patients with late stage lung or colon cancer to&#xD;
           perform an individualized fitness program to prevent deconditioning and functional&#xD;
           decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the adherence of patients with LSC (LSC) to an individualized fitness&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. To estimate the degree to which symptoms, e.g. fatigue and pain, associate with adherence&#xD;
      to an individualized fitness program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. To estimate improvements in functional status associated with performance of an&#xD;
      individualized fitness program among patients with LSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Most people with LSC function poorly at diagnosis, deteriorate&#xD;
      steadily over a period of months to years, and become dependent prior to death. Their&#xD;
      disablement exacts staggering costs in quality of life (QoL), caregiver burden, and health&#xD;
      care expenses. Oncologic clinicians, as a result of their training and focus on the treatment&#xD;
      of cancer, often neither systematically detect nor treat the function and symptom problems&#xD;
      that cause disablement. As a consequence rehabilitation therapies, even those with well&#xD;
      documented evidence of benefit, tend to be under-utilized and provided too late to be&#xD;
      maximally effective. The public health burden of this issue is likely to only worsen given&#xD;
      the improving survival of patients with LSC and the increasing age and medical complexity of&#xD;
      those being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Design A randomized controlled trial. Duration Following&#xD;
      enrollment, study participants will remain on the study for 2.5 months after instruction in&#xD;
      their individualized REST program. REST titration and tailoring for participant specific&#xD;
      barriers will occur over the telephone for the 2 week &quot;initiation phase&quot; after initial REST&#xD;
      instruction. Thereafter, patients will perform their REST independently at home during the 8&#xD;
      week &quot;training phase&quot; with &quot;as needed&quot; telephone-based guidance from a PT. We therefore&#xD;
      anticipate that the study will continue for a total of 6 months; 3 months to recruit 68&#xD;
      patients and an additional 2.5 months for all participants to complete initiation and&#xD;
      training phases of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Enrollment Identification of participants. A sample of 68 patients with Stage III or&#xD;
      IV NSCLC or Extensive stage SCLC, or Stage IV colon cancer will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Cheville will contact eligible patients by telephone after they receive a mailing&#xD;
      describing the study and permitting them to opt out by returning a postage-paid postcard. A&#xD;
      'fold over' postcard will be sent so as to maintain the patient's privacy regarding lung or&#xD;
      colon cancer diagnosis. Dr. Cheville's efforts to contact eligible patients will continue&#xD;
      until 5 attempts have been made on different week days and times of day. Eligibility and&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed. If the patient is eligible, the study will&#xD;
      be described in detail and verbal consent will be obtained from those desiring to&#xD;
      participate. An informed consent form will be mailed to each patient willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study to ensure that they have adequate opportunity to review the document. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by Dr. Cheville when the patient comes to the Mayo Clinic for study&#xD;
      enrollment. All questions will be answered prior obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility. Eligible subjects must have a diagnosis of Stage III or IV NSCLC or extensive&#xD;
      stage SCLC, or Stage IV colon cancer and be receiving a chemotherapeutic regimen that&#xD;
      requires visits to the Mayo Clinic Department of Medical Oncology &lt; every 4 weeks for the&#xD;
      first 6 weeks following enrollment or undergoing monitoring visits at comparable intervals.&#xD;
      Pathological confirmation is not required if the oncology provider specializing in lung&#xD;
      cancer has a high level of certainty regarding the diagnosis. Entry criteria will not&#xD;
      consider number or location of metastases or prior treatment. The participants will be&#xD;
      required to be fluent in the English language and have intact cognitive status (Folstein&#xD;
      mini-mental score &gt; 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Approximately 50 new lung cancer cases are diagnosed each month at the Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic. Of these, about 70% are initially diagnosed with Stage III or Stage IV NSCLC or&#xD;
      Extensive Stage SCLC and 60% elect to receive their cancer-related care at Mayo. Recruitment&#xD;
      rates in our previous work in this population have been high. The proposed intervention&#xD;
      entails greater patient commitment and we anticipate a recruitment rate of 50%. We will&#xD;
      target patients meeting the study criteria who are undergoing ongoing treatment at the MCCC&#xD;
      as well as those who are newly diagnosed. We anticipate a recruitment rate of 10 patients per&#xD;
      month and that recruitment will continue for 3 months. We have not previously recruited&#xD;
      patients with colon cancer, but anticipate recruitment of 10 patients per month based on the&#xD;
      experience of other researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Patients will be block randomized to the REST intervention or wait-list&#xD;
      control. Stratified randomization will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Overview. The intervention is provision of an individualized, 2-part, 3-tiered&#xD;
      REST program which will include the exercises listed in Table 1 to all participants randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention arm. In addition, participants will receive a step pedometer and&#xD;
      will be encouraged to remain as active as possible during the study period based on objective&#xD;
      feedback from their pedometer readings. A PT specialized in cancer rehabilitation will&#xD;
      instruct participants in REST and will adapt the program to accommodate for symptoms,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, or other issues that may impede a participant's ability to perform the REST&#xD;
      program. The PT will follow up with each participant by telephone at 1- and 2-weeks following&#xD;
      REST instruction to encourage participants and to problem solve regarding any barriers which&#xD;
      may be impeding their performance of REST. After the 2-week initiation phase, participants&#xD;
      will perform REST independently during an 8 week training phase but will be encouraged to&#xD;
      contact the PT with any questions or difficulty. Patient reported outcome (PROs) measures&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline prior to REST instruction and after completion of the 2-month&#xD;
      training phase, as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment and REST instruction. Patients will be examined and instructed in their&#xD;
      REST programs on a day when they will be visiting the Mayo clinic either for treatment or&#xD;
      evaluation. REST will not be feasible if it adds to patients' already significant travel&#xD;
      demands. The PI will obtain a functional history and perform a routine physical examination&#xD;
      on all patients to ensure that they may safely participate and to identify impairments or&#xD;
      physical vulnerabilities that will require individualizing their REST program. A tailored&#xD;
      REST fitness program will be developed for each patient by a PT specialized in cancer&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Patients will be provided with upper and lower extremity REST routines (each&#xD;
      requiring 7 minutes) designed to maintain core and appendicular strength with minimal burden.&#xD;
      The REST lower extremity routine will include 6 exercises and will target the hip flexors,&#xD;
      hip abductors, hip extensors, knee extensors, knee flexors, shoulder stabilizers, and back&#xD;
      extensors. The REST upper extremity routine will include 5 exercises and will target the&#xD;
      elbow extensors, elbow flexors, shoulder stabilizers, shoulder flexors, and abdominal&#xD;
      muscles. Each routine can be performed at 1 of 3 intensity levels depending on how&#xD;
      participants feel on a given day. Each of the routines is performed twice per week for a&#xD;
      maximum total of 28 minutes of resistive strengthening per week. The standard REST lower&#xD;
      extremity program is performed in a standing position; however the program can be adapted for&#xD;
      seated performance. Note that the REST program can also be individualized to accommodate&#xD;
      impairments such as degenerative arthritis, back pain and osseous instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be dispensed a pedometer and encouraged to wear it daily for the first 2&#xD;
      weeks of their study enrollment in order to establish an average baseline number of steps per&#xD;
      day. Thereafter they will be instructed to wear the pedometer 3 times per week and to chart&#xD;
      the number of steps taken between waking and retiring to bed and encouraged to 'make up' for&#xD;
      days/weeks when fewer steps are taken due to increased symptom burden, post-chemotherapy&#xD;
      fatigue, or other contingency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with laminated cards illustrating their REST program to encourage&#xD;
      their adherence. They will also receive a ring bound monthly calendar with their REST program&#xD;
      illustrated on the top and a calendar on the bottom with designated boxes for number of&#xD;
      pedometer recorded steps per day and to indicate which (if any) tier of the REST program they&#xD;
      completed on a given day. Calendars will be submitted for analysis at the end of the 2 month&#xD;
      study period. Modified laminated cards and calendar pages will be provided if changes in&#xD;
      their health status require alterations of their REST program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation phase. Participants will be encouraged to perform their upper extremity and lower&#xD;
      extremity REST programs twice per week. After the first week, they will follow up with the&#xD;
      study PT by telephone to address any questions they may have and to address any difficulties&#xD;
      with REST. The PT may adjust their REST program if it proves uncomfortable or overly&#xD;
      fatiguing. Participants will continue to perform the REST program with any modifications for&#xD;
      the second week after training. They will again follow up with the study PT by telephone at&#xD;
      the end of the second week to address any issues. Dr. Cheville will serve as resource for the&#xD;
      study PT during the initiation phase in case he/she has any questions regarding symptom&#xD;
      control or the safety of REST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training phase. Following the initiation phase the participants will continue to perform&#xD;
      their REST programs 4 times per week (2 upper and 2 lower extremity) for 8 weeks. While no&#xD;
      follow up telephone calls will be scheduled with the study PT, participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to contact the PT with any questions or difficulties. The PT will consult Dr.&#xD;
      Cheville on an as needed basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures. Baseline PROs will be collected&#xD;
      after subjects sign informed consent, following randomization and, for intervention group&#xD;
      members, before the PTs instruct them in the REST exercises. Week 10 PROs will be mailed to&#xD;
      the patients with a postage paid return envelope. Participants who do not respond in the&#xD;
      first week will be sent a second mailing. Subjects will receive $25.00 compensation for&#xD;
      completing each set of PROs, for a total of $50.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic Mobility and Daily Activity Short Forms FACIT-F Outcome&#xD;
      Expectations for Exercise Self Efficacy for Exercise North Central Cancer Trials Group&#xD;
      Patient Quality of Life-Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA) Scale. The LASA Scale is a&#xD;
      single item measurement of global quality of life rating on a numerical rating scale from 0&#xD;
      to 10 with well established validity data in cancer populations.38 Other Treatments.&#xD;
      Oncological care will be not affected by this study: subjects will continue to make their&#xD;
      routine clinic visits and receive oncological cares as usual. Analgesic medications will be&#xD;
      permitted (and assessed), to adjust for co-intervention differences between groups in the&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics will be calculated for participants' demographic&#xD;
      and lung cancer-related characteristics, as well as their function- and symptom-related PROs.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will also be calculated for the data collected by the study PT&#xD;
      regarding the frequency of specific problems (e.g. shoulder pain with REST) encountered&#xD;
      during the initiation phase, as well as the number of calls per participant during the&#xD;
      training phase, time per call, and reasons for these calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from patients' calendar records of REST adherence and steps per day will be&#xD;
      described in terms of proportions and means, respectively. An arbitrary threshold of 75% will&#xD;
      be used to distinguish participants who did and did not adhere to the recommended 4 sessions&#xD;
      per week. Participants who did not perform their REST program 4 times per week for at least 6&#xD;
      of the 8 weeks during the training phase will be considered non-adherent. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses of significant differences between participants that did and did not adhere will be&#xD;
      performed with nonparametric testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the PROs will be assessed by testing of skew and kurtosis. Nonparametric&#xD;
      statistical tests will be used to evaluate PROs that are not normally distributed. Student's&#xD;
      paired T-test will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention on primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Additionally, the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      degree of change in these scores between patients randomized to the intervention group who&#xD;
      did and did not comply with REST. The magnitude and directions of the relationships between&#xD;
      change in mean steps per day during the training interval (calculated as mean from week 10&#xD;
      minus mean from baseline) and changes in PRO scores will be assessed with Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficients. Given the pilot nature of this work, adjustments will not be made for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
