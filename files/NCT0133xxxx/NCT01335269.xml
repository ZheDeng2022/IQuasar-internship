  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of BI 853520&#xD;
      monotherapy by defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommending the dose for&#xD;
      further trials in the development of this compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exploratory pharmacodynamic analysis; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collection of preliminary data on anti-tumour efficacy.&#xD;
