  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about risk factors for autism by studying the&#xD;
      behavior and brain functioning of toddlers with early communication delays and typically&#xD;
      developing toddlers. Children 12 or 18 months of age with language delays (i.e., no words at&#xD;
      18 months, limited vocalizations at 12 months) and typically developing toddlers may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. This study will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda,&#xD;
      Maryland. There will be an initial screening evaluation that will include behavioral&#xD;
      assessment. Eligible participants will then complete a baseline visit that includes an&#xD;
      overnight sleep study that includes Electroencephalogram (EEG) test to measure brain&#xD;
      electrical activity, and an MRI scan. Follow-up visits that include behavioral assessment&#xD;
      will occur every 6-12 months, depending on age at study entry. The final study visit will&#xD;
      occur at 36 months of age and will include behavioral assessment, sleep/EEG study, and MRI.&#xD;
      There is no cost for participation. Compensation will be provided. To find out if your child&#xD;
      qualifies or for more information, please call 301-451-7822 (TTY: 1-866-411-1010) or e-mail&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will focus on two areas: 1) early communication impairments as predictors&#xD;
      of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and later developmental delays, and 2) the relationship&#xD;
      between communication and evidence of CNS function (sleep, EEG) and structure (MRI DTI and&#xD;
      volumetrics) in young children at risk for ASD. The objective is to delineate early&#xD;
      communicative impairments that predict ASD vs. other developmental delays and to examine how&#xD;
      these impairments correlate with brain abnormalities in both structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 64 children [n=32 at 12 months of age (plus or minus 2 months); n=32 at 18&#xD;
      months of age (plus or minus 2 months)] who are at-risk for ASD due to communication/language&#xD;
      delays (at-risk group). The at-risk children will be matched at initial on chronological age,&#xD;
      SES, and sex, to typically developing children (n=75) with no history of developmental&#xD;
      delays. These 139 participants will hereafter be referred to as the toddler sample. At the 36&#xD;
      month final visit, diagnostic status (e.g. ASD, non-ASD specific delays, catch up) will be&#xD;
      determined for children in the at-risk group. In addition, 10 healthy adults, aged 18-40 will&#xD;
      serve as control participants for the purpose of piloting the functional paradigms for the&#xD;
      MRI portion of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective, longitudinal study of toddlers at-risk for ASD compared&#xD;
      to typically developing toddlers. Children will complete behavioral testing and an overnight&#xD;
      Sleep/EEG as well as MRI at either a 12 or 18 month initial. Follow-up visits that include&#xD;
      behavioral assessment will occur at 24 and 36 months for all children (and at 18 months of&#xD;
      age for the 12-month cohort). The Sleep/EEG and MRI will be repeated at the 36 month final&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism symptoms, language status, and cognitive development at 36 months will serve as the&#xD;
      primary outcome measures.&#xD;
