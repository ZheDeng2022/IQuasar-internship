  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma which has&#xD;
      come back, or may come back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the standard&#xD;
      treatment known for these diseases. This a research study using special immune system cells&#xD;
      called tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a new experimental&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sort of therapy has been used previously to treat Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphomas that&#xD;
      show proof of infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus that causes infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis (&quot;mono&quot; or the &quot;kissing disease&quot;). EBV is found in cancer cells of up to half&#xD;
      of all patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests that it may play a&#xD;
      role in causing lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's&#xD;
      immune system and escape being killed. Investigators tested whether special white blood&#xD;
      cells, called T cells, that were trained to kill EBV-infected cells could affect these&#xD;
      tumors, and in many patients it was found that giving these trained T cells caused a complete&#xD;
      or partial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many patients do not have EBV in their lymphoma cells; therefore investigators now&#xD;
      want to test whether it is possible to direct these special T cells against other types of&#xD;
      proteins on the tumor cell surface with similar promising results. The proteins that will be&#xD;
      targeted in this study are called tumor associated antigens (TAAs) - these are cell proteins&#xD;
      that are specific to the cancer cell, so they either do not show or show up in low quantities&#xD;
      on normal human cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will target five TAAs which commonly show on lymphoma, called: NY-ESO-1,&#xD;
      MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. This will be done by using special types of T cells called&#xD;
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some adult patients will receive a drug called azacytidine before giving the T&#xD;
      cells. We hope that the combination helps the T cells work better.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will give blood to make TAA-specific cytotoxic T cells in the lab. These cells&#xD;
      will be grown and frozen. If the TAA-specific cytotoxic T cells can be made, the time from&#xD;
      collection of the blood to manufacture of T cells for administration to the patient is about&#xD;
      1 to 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 stages of this study: an antigen-escalation phase, a dose-escalation stage, aza&#xD;
      stage and pediatric patients stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antigen-escalation phase will be first. Patients will receive TAA-specific T cells&#xD;
      targeting first 1 and then 2 TAAs. Once this schedule proves safe, the next group of patients&#xD;
      will receive TAA-specific T cells targeting first 2 and then 3 TAAs. This process will&#xD;
      continue until all 4 levels are studied. This means that the final cohort of patients will&#xD;
      receive TAA-specific T cells targeting first 4 and then 5 TAAs. If the side-effects are too&#xD;
      severe, the number of TAAs being targeted will be lowered or the T cell injections will be&#xD;
      stopped. Each patient will receive 2 infusions at the same dose 28 days apart&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the antigen-escalation phase, the dose-escalation phase will begin. Patients will be&#xD;
      started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose schedule&#xD;
      proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will&#xD;
      continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose&#xD;
      will be lowered or the T cell injections will be stopped. Each patient will receive 2&#xD;
      infusions at the same dose 14 days apart&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the dose escalation stage, adult patients will be enrolled on the aza stage where they&#xD;
      will receive the drug aza followed by two infusions of T cells on dose level 2. Patients will&#xD;
      be given 3 cycles of aza (administered daily through a vein for 5 days, every 28 days)&#xD;
      followed by 2 doses of multiTAA-specific T cells administered 14 days apart. Before the&#xD;
      patient is given the aza they will be given a drug to help prevent nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the pediatric stage, pediatric patients will receive 2 infusions of T cells on dose level&#xD;
      2. The T cells will be given 14 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will be injected by IV over 10 minutes. The patients may be pre-treated with&#xD;
      acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and&#xD;
      diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction to the T cell&#xD;
      administration. If after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the&#xD;
      patient's lymphoma on CT or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up&#xD;
      to six (6) additional doses of the T cells at monthly intervals if they wish. All of the&#xD;
      treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist&#xD;
      Hospital or Texas Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the first and second T cell infusions and for 6 weeks after the last infusion, the&#xD;
      patient should not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as radiation therapy or&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If the patient does receive any other therapies in-between the first and second&#xD;
      infusion of T cells, they will be taken off treatment and will not be able to receive the&#xD;
      second infusion of T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of your tumor by routine imaging studies. We will use the imaging study&#xD;
           that was used before to follow your tumor: CT, MRI, or PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if you are a female who can have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL TESTS AFTER TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Imaging study 6 weeks after the 2nd TAA-CTL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 mL&#xD;
      (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each cycle of aza (if applicable), 2 weeks&#xD;
      after each cycle of aza (if applicable), before each T-cell infusion, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6. One additional blood sample might be drawn 3 to 4 days post the T-cell infusion; this&#xD;
      is optional. Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the last&#xD;
      infusion. The blood may be drawn from a central line at the time of the patient's regular&#xD;
      blood tests. Investigators will use this blood to see how long the T cells last,and to look&#xD;
      at the immune response to the patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Patients will be on active study participation for approximately one year.&#xD;
      Patients who receive additional doses of the T cells as described above will be actively&#xD;
      followed until 1 year after their last dose of T cells. Investigators will then remain in&#xD;
      contact with patients once a year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up)&#xD;
      in order to evaluate disease response long-term.&#xD;
