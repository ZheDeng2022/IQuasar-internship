  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to investigate how well a medicine (alemtuzumab)&#xD;
      works in treating MS-related cognitive problems (e.g., attention, memory, speed of thinking).&#xD;
      This study will include 30 subjects from six research sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab is approved and sold under the brand names Campath and MabCampath to treat some&#xD;
      types of leukemia. As a leukemia treatment, it is given more often and at much higher doses&#xD;
      than in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal is to conduct a study using a battery of neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      capable of detecting the broad range of cognitive difficulties associated with relapsing&#xD;
      remitting multiple sclerosis. This study will compare cognitive functioning over time of&#xD;
      patients receiving alemtuzumab. The study will also compare the change in cognitive&#xD;
      functioning over time to that of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients receiving&#xD;
      interferon beta-1a and normal controls enrolled in a parallel study conducted by Wilken et&#xD;
      al.To evaluate cognitive effects of alemtuzumab, the investigators will perform neurological&#xD;
      exams and brain scans and will administer questionnaires to measure the severity of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, how well subjects are functioning, how they are feeling, and to find out about&#xD;
      what other medical visits subjects may have had during the study. Neurological testing in&#xD;
      this study will require the subject to perform relatively simple tasks to evaluate their&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis. These tasks include a five hundred meter walk, a timed twenty five foot&#xD;
      walk, a nine hole peg test, an eye exam, and a test requiring you to add small numbers in&#xD;
      your head quickly. The brain scans will involve Magnetic Resonance Imaging and are painless,&#xD;
      except for injection of a contrast agent called gadolinium, which is necessary to detect&#xD;
      areas in the brain where their MS may be currently active. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is&#xD;
      widely used to diagnose and assess patients with multiple sclerosis. All patients will be&#xD;
      required to return to their study site every 3 months for assessments and testing. In&#xD;
      addition, safety-related blood tests will be performed at least monthly. If their blood test&#xD;
      results become abnormal, they may have to have blood tests taken more frequently, in some&#xD;
      cases weekly, until test results improve. Monthly blood tests should be performed at your&#xD;
      study site, but if subjects are unable to return to the study site for the blood testing,&#xD;
      they may be able to use a local laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study should last at least 4 years and possibly longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receiving alemtuzumab, will need to have blood tests every month for at least 3&#xD;
      years after your last dose of alemtuzumab. Therefore, you will need to undergo monthly blood&#xD;
      tests for a total of about 4 years. If your test results become abnormal, you may have to&#xD;
      have blood tests more frequently, in some cases weekly, until your test results improve.&#xD;
