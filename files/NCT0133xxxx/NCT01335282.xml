    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than two millenniums. It has been a&#xD;
      common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea and is becoming increasingly popular&#xD;
      worldwide in recent decades However, there is no general consensus for treatment of many&#xD;
      diseases among TCM practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough&#xD;
      well documented case reports for practitioners to make reference with. Different&#xD;
      practitioners may give different opinions according to their own experience and patients&#xD;
      often feel frustrated about that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western&#xD;
      medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested&#xD;
      accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can&#xD;
      help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.&#xD;

      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a history of more than two millenniums. It has been a&#xD;
      common practice in China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In recent decades, it is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly popular worldwide(Victor S. Sierpina 2005). Studies in Hong Kong, showed that&#xD;
      TCM is quite common among children in Hong Kong, with about a quarter of children consulting&#xD;
      a pediatrician are concurrently using Chinese Medicine.(Lee 2006; Li 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of standardized protocol for treatment of many diseases among TCM&#xD;
      practitioners. In some specialties, such as neurology, there is not enough well documented&#xD;
      case reports for TCM practitioners to make reference. Different TCM practitioners may give&#xD;
      different opinions according to their own experience and patients often feel frustrated about&#xD;
      that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is worth recording cases of neurological diseases, with accurate western&#xD;
      medicine diagnosis and TCM theory explained. Possible TCM treatments can be suggested&#xD;
      accordingly. Being an academic research supervised by western medicine doctor, this study can&#xD;
      help to suggest more objective opinion with least conflict of interest.&#xD;
