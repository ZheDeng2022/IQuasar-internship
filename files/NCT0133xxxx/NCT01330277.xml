      International, multicenter, observational, longitudinal study to establish Hunter Syndrom&#xD;
      biomarker/s and to explore the clinical robustness, specificity, and long-term variability of&#xD;
      these biomarker/s&#xD;

      Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar carbohydrates, found within the cells that help&#xD;
      build bone, cartilage, tendons, cornea, skin, and connective tissue. Glycosaminoglycans&#xD;
      (GAGs) are also found in the fluids that lubricate joints. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) are&#xD;
      part of the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD) family, a group of more than 40 genetic&#xD;
      diseases, and occur when a particular enzyme exists in a small quantity or is missing&#xD;
      altogether. The effect is the accumulation of GAGs in the cells, blood, and connective&#xD;
      tissues, resulting in permanent and progressive cellular damage which affects appearance,&#xD;
      physical abilities, organ and system functioning and, in most cases, mental development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPS2 (also called Hunter syndrome) is a hereditary, progressive, multisystemic disorder,&#xD;
      caused by mutations in the IDS gene coding for the enzyme iduronate sulfatase (Ids). It is&#xD;
      the only type of mucopolysaccharidosis that is X-linked, therefore, if mothers are carriers,&#xD;
      there is a 50 percent chance for males to be born with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPS2 has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity, which can be managed with enzyme&#xD;
      replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore it&#xD;
      addresses strictly extra-neurological manifestations. On this note, further efforts are being&#xD;
      made to develop novel therapies, in the attempt to stop the disease progression and to offer&#xD;
      a better quality of life to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As MPS2 is very rare and many medical professionals only see a few or no patients in their&#xD;
      lifelong practice, genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis. This study thrives to identify,&#xD;
      validate, and monitor potential biomarker/s for MPS2 in genetically confirmed samples.&#xD;
