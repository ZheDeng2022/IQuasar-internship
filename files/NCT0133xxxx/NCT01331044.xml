  <brief_summary>

      1. RUTF would be more effective (quicker catch-up growth by promoting more tissue accrue&#xD;
           resulting decrease stay in rehabilitation ward) in treating children with SAM during the&#xD;
           rehabilitation phase than khichuri /halwa;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RUTF would be acceptable to the children and their mothers/caregivers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Malnutrition is not caused solely by lack of food, but also by impaired utilization of&#xD;
           the food that is ingested. The ability of the gut to absorb nutrients from the diet is&#xD;
           associated with the host's 'human' genotype, the host's gut microbiota and its gene&#xD;
           content (the microbiome).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a research study to compare the acceptability and efficacy of RUTF with&#xD;
      that of the cereal-based diets in the management of hospitalised SAM children in Bangladesh.&#xD;
      After completion of the initial acute phase treatment (for diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection/pneumonia, severe anaemia, fever, sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and/or anorexia)&#xD;
      in the Longer Stay Ward/ Special Care Ward of the Dhaka Hospital, the children will be&#xD;
      transferred to the NRW according to the enrolment criteria. Once the children fulfil all the&#xD;
      criteria for entry into the study and written consent to their participation is obtained from&#xD;
      respective parents/guardian, they will be randomly allocated to: (i) the standard&#xD;
      cereal-based foods, namely khichuri and halwa, or (ii) RUTF. Randomization will be done&#xD;
      according to computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks with block lengths of&#xD;
      four and six. For understandable reasons, the dietary therapy can't be blinded. The assigned&#xD;
      treatment packages will be kept in closed opaque envelopes until the same serial number is&#xD;
      assigned to an enrolled child. Participating children will be discharged from NRW according&#xD;
      to the new WHO growth standard (WHO, 2009), which explicit , at least after seven days stay&#xD;
      completed there or until achieving a weight gain of 15% , for non-oedematous child. On the&#xD;
      other hand for oedematous child after oedema free if WHZ is â‰¥-3; however if oedema free WHZ&#xD;
      is &lt;- 3 then the child will be discharge after achieving 15% weight gain. In both the groups,&#xD;
      the acceptability of the allocated diet, both by the children and their respective&#xD;
      mothers/caregivers, the rate of weight gain and anthropometric measurements, and adverse&#xD;
      event will be systematically recorded for analyses. Khichuri/halwa group will be given diet&#xD;
      as per standardized management protocol of NRW of the Dhaka Hospital. On the other hand,&#xD;
      children allocated to RUTF will receive commercially available RUTF (Plumpy nut) in a total&#xD;
      of 200 kcal/kg.day in a sequential manner (Plumpy nut will be offered ~ 125 kcal/kg in 1st 24&#xD;
      hours, ~ 150 kcal/kg in 2nd 24 hours, then~200k cal/kg by the third day). We will also&#xD;
      examine if the weight gain of the children is associated with increase in the lean body mass&#xD;
      or in the body fat mass by assessing their body composition, Changes in body composition&#xD;
      after dietary intervention in SAM children will be assessed by non-invasive technique using&#xD;
      stable isotope tracer (deuterium oxide). For this, after collection of baseline urine and&#xD;
      saliva samples a known quantity (5 gm) of deuterium oxide labelled water will be given to all&#xD;
      study children. Enrichment of deuterium in body water will be measured to estimate total body&#xD;
      water (TBW). Enrichment reaches a plateau after 3-5 hours. According to the recommendation&#xD;
      from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) field manual, two post-dose saliva samples&#xD;
      will be collected at 3rd and 4th hours. The concentrations of deuterium in saliva samples&#xD;
      will be measured with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). The urine specimens&#xD;
      will be analyzed using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). From measured TBW we would&#xD;
      estimate the fat free mass (FFM). Body fat mass (FM) is the difference between body weight&#xD;
      and fat free mass. This procedure will be repeated in same sequence in all study children at&#xD;
      the end of dietary intervention when the study child achieve discharge criteria. In addition&#xD;
      to the above mentioned procedures, anthropometric measures such as mid-arm circumference,&#xD;
      triceps skin fold thickness, arm fat area and arm muscle area would also be routinely&#xD;
      recorded along with other morbidity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to leverage the ongoing scientific collaboration among University of Virginia, Center&#xD;
      for Genome Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine, USA and ICDDR,B to gain&#xD;
      insight into the influence of human genetic polymorphisms and gut microbiome on malnutrition,&#xD;
      in order to provide a foundation for new treatment and prevention programs on a&#xD;
      population-wide basis.&#xD;
