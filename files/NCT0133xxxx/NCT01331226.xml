    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine if a telephone-based intervention delivered to a support&#xD;
      person (i.e., friend, spouse of a smoker) increases the smoker's use of the Minnesota&#xD;
      helpline. In addition, the study will examine if the rate of smoker calls to the helpline is&#xD;
      greater if the support person receives 3 intervention calls, 1 intervention call, or no calls&#xD;
      (written materials only, control condition).&#xD;

      We will conduct a randomized clinical trial within the ongoing service of the QUITPLAN®&#xD;
      Helpline. Our primary aim is to examine the efficacy of two levels of telephone counseling&#xD;
      for support persons (1 or 3 sessions) compared with a control condition on the proportion of&#xD;
      smokers who call the Helpline over the 7 month follow-up period. We hypothesize a dose&#xD;
      response relationship between number of telephone sessions provided to the support persons&#xD;
      and smoker calls to the Helpline. Additional aims are to examine smoker quit attempts and&#xD;
      cessation, and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonsmoking adult support persons (N=1020) residing in Minnesota will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three study conditions: (1) control condition -written self-help&#xD;
      materials, (2) written materials plus one telephone session, or (3) written materials plus&#xD;
      three telephone sessions. Outcome assessments will be completed by support persons and&#xD;
      smokers at post-treatment (week 4) and at 7 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design will allow for evaluation of whether results from our previous trial (Patten et&#xD;
      al., in press, AJPM) can be replicated when the intervention is implemented within a&#xD;
      &quot;real-world&quot; setting. That is all support person intervention calls will be delivered by the&#xD;
      Helpline. Moreover, we will examine the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      streamlined version of the intervention (i.e., 1 call). Furthermore, the proposed study will&#xD;
      provide new data on quit attempts and cessation among the smokers. Ultimately, positive&#xD;
      findings from this line of research could serve as the basis for expanding the range of&#xD;
      helpline services to nonsmokers.&#xD;
