      The investigators propose to evaluate Suicide Assessment and Follow-up Engagement: Veteran&#xD;
      Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) which is currently being implemented in 4 VA ED/Urgent Care&#xD;
      Units across the United States (Portland VA Medical Center (VAMC), Denver VAMC, Manhattan&#xD;
      VAMC, and Philadelphia VAMC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In 2009, a novel clinical demonstration project entitled Suicide Assessment and&#xD;
      Follow-up Engagement: Veteran Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) was initiated as a potential&#xD;
      standard of care for suicidal Veterans who receive treatment at Veterans Affairs (VA)&#xD;
      emergency departments (ED). SAFE VET is designed to attenuate suicide risk by helping&#xD;
      Veterans manage suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and adhere to prescribed clinical care;&#xD;
      thereby promoting resiliency and increased capacity to cope with suicidal states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Using a quasi-experimental design, the aim of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the SAFE VET intervention versus enhanced usual care (E-CARE)on the&#xD;
      following: 1) the proportion of patients who attempt suicide within 6 months of index&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) visit; 2) the severity of suicide ideation within 6 months after&#xD;
      index ED visit; 3) the proportion of patients who attend &gt; 1 outpatient mental health or&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment appointments within 30 days following index ED visit; and 4) the&#xD;
      degree of suicide-related coping for attending treatment during the 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Six hundred Veterans, up to 300 per condition (SAFE VET or E-CARE), who meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. E-CARE sites are as follows: Long Beach VAMC,&#xD;
      Bronx VAMC, Milwaukee VAMC, and San Diego VAMC. All subjects will participate in an&#xD;
      approximately 1-hour long baseline assessment battery (index ED visit) by phone, and will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone at approximately 1, 3, and 6 months after the index ED visit to complete&#xD;
      follow-up measures. Medical records will also be reviewed to determine VA health service&#xD;
      usage in the six-month period after study enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>All SAFE VET EDs provide a standardized intervention that is specifically adapted for use in the ED to mitigate suicide risk. Given that the SAFE VET intervention was developed for use in a busy ED setting, the length of the intervention is approximately 45 minutes. The SAFE VET intervention is administered by a clinical provider who has been specifically trained and consists of:&#xD;
Risk Assessment&#xD;
Safety Planning Intervention: Developed by Stanley and Brown (2008), Safety Planning Intervention consists of a hierarchically-arranged list of coping strategies identified for use during a subsequent suicidal crisis.&#xD;
