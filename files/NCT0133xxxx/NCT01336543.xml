      This is a pilot phase II study of histology based consolidation chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) following concurrent&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy. Patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC would be treated with standard&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy and subsequently those with non-squamous histology would be&#xD;
      offered 4 cycles of consolidation pemetrexed and those with squamous histology 4 cycles of&#xD;
      consolidation with gemcitabine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in US&#xD;
      (1). About 22% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC have locally advanced or stage III disease at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis (2). 5 years survival for stage III lung cancer is 23% which is much&#xD;
      less than survival in similar stage breast and Colon Cancers (2). Current standard of care&#xD;
      for inoperable stage III NSCLC is concurrent chemo-radiotherapy as established by a study&#xD;
      (Southwestern Oncology Group) SWOG 9019 (3). Surgery following concurrent chemo-radiotherapy&#xD;
      has been evaluated in a large Phase III clinical trial in patients with Stage III (N2)&#xD;
      disease which did not show any improvement in overall survival from surgery as compared to&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy alone.(4). These two studies demonstrated that the most common&#xD;
      site of cancer relapse in patients with stage III disease was distant metastasis, 65% (3) and&#xD;
      57% (4) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations have led to the idea that perhaps giving additional chemotherapy following&#xD;
      definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy may prevent distant relapse in stage III NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This idea was evaluated in a Phase II study SWOG S9504 in which patients with stage III NSCLC&#xD;
      were treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel&#xD;
      consolidation (5). Four cycles of docetaxel consolidation showed an impressive improvement in&#xD;
      median Overall Survival (OS) to 26 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This idea of docetaxel consolidation was subsequently evaluated in a large phase III trial in&#xD;
      which patients inoperable stage III NSCLC after receiving concurrent chemo-radiotherapy were&#xD;
      randomized to docetaxel consolidation versus observation (6). However, this study showed no&#xD;
      improvement in OS between the docetaxel arm and the observation arm. Many patients in&#xD;
      docetaxel arm developed pneumonitis and febrile neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histology based selection of chemotherapy is now standard of for stage IV metastatic NSCLC. A&#xD;
      large randomized Phase III trial from Europe showed that a combination of Cisplatin and&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is more effective in patients with non-squamous histology and a combination of&#xD;
      Cisplatin and Gemcitabine showed efficacy in patients with squamous cell histology (7).&#xD;
      Recently maintenance Pemetrexed was evaluated in advanced NSCLC and showed improvement in PFS&#xD;
      and OS in patients with non-squamous histology (8). Similarly maintenance gemcitabine has&#xD;
      also been evaluated in large Phase III clinical trial after initial chemotherapy with&#xD;
      Cisplatin and Gemcitabine (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC develop distant metastasis following&#xD;
      definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy there clearly is a need to give addition treatment&#xD;
      for these patients. Docetaxel consolidation has not been shown to be successful as noted&#xD;
      above. Perhaps tailoring chemotherapy according to histology may result in improvement in PFS&#xD;
      and OS in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this hypothesis the investigators intend to do a pilot phase II study of histology&#xD;
      based consolidation chemotherapy in patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC following&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. Patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC would be treated with&#xD;
      standard concurrent chemo-radiotherapy and subsequently those with non-squamous histology&#xD;
      would be offered 4 cycles of consolidation pemetrexed and those with squamous histology 4&#xD;
      cycles of consolidation with gemcitabine.&#xD;
