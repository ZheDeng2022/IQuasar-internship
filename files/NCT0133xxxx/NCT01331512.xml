      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Older persons are often referred to physicians because of mobility difficulties that grow&#xD;
      worse as they age. To better understand the reasons for mobility difficulties in older&#xD;
      persons, researchers conducted a population-based study of individuals living in the Chianti&#xD;
      geographic area of Tuscany, Italy. Researchers are now interested in conducting a follow-up&#xD;
      study on the original participants to assess the effects of aging on their mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To conduct a follow-up study on the participants in the mobility study of older persons in&#xD;
      the Greve in Chianti and Bagno a Ripoli areas near Florence, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Original participants in the InChianti Mobility Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The InChianti Follow-up Study will repeat most elements of the baseline evaluation from&#xD;
           the original study. Participants will be seen on the 3-year anniversary of their&#xD;
           baseline study assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a home interview with questions about their physical and mental&#xD;
           health, family history, daily activities, and living conditions related to their&#xD;
           continued mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood and urine samples, and will have tests of heart and&#xD;
           motor nerve function and imaging studies of bones and the circulatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have a functional evaluation of their motor skills, including&#xD;
           walking tests, range of motion tests, and grip strength.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade epidemiologic and clinical studies have described the prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of disability and have elucidated demographic characteristics, health behaviors,&#xD;
      diseases, and physiologic impairments that are associated with increased risk of developing&#xD;
      disability in old age. Mobility disability has emerged as a critical aspect of functioning.&#xD;
      Mobility, defined as the ability to move independently from one point to another, is a&#xD;
      critical part of maintaining independence and an essential attribute of quality of life. In&#xD;
      those age 85 years and older, nearly 60 percent of women and 40 percent of men have&#xD;
      difficulty walking two to three blocks. Older people who are mobile are more likely to remain&#xD;
      in the community, have lower rates of subsequent morbidity and mortality, and have higher&#xD;
      quality of life. Recent work in biomechanics, clinical geriatrics, epidemiology, and clinical&#xD;
      trials has helped to improve our understanding of the decline in walking ability in old age&#xD;
      and the influence of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, a great deal is still&#xD;
      not understood about how older persons progressively lose the ability to ambulate. The&#xD;
      InChianti Study has the potential to make major new advances in our knowledge of progressive&#xD;
      decline in ambulation in older persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great deal of information is available from the baseline evaluation in this study and the&#xD;
      crosssectional analyses that can be done with these data will be very valuable. There are,&#xD;
      however, limitations in what we can learn from cross-sectional data. The baseline data&#xD;
      revealed many relationships between factors that were studied and disability, but there may&#xD;
      be circularity in these relationships that cannot be sorted out if we only have&#xD;
      cross-sectional data available. For example, abnormalities in certain biomarkers may be a&#xD;
      cause of disability or may be caused by disability. Only by doing longitudinal analyses that&#xD;
      begin with non-disabled persons can the temporal sequence be determined. Cross-sectional&#xD;
      analyses only permit the study of factors that are currently related to disability while&#xD;
      longitudinal analyses allow for the identification of subclinical markers of risk that&#xD;
      predict future disability onset. There is therefore much to be gained by performing a&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation of the cohort to obtain longitudinal data.&#xD;
