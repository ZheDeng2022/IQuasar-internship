      Patients admitted to hospital with chest pain due to reduced blood flow to heart muscle&#xD;
      (diagnosis Acute Coronary Syndrome) can be treated with medication and an angioplasty ± stent&#xD;
      procedure, which restores blood flow to the heart. Antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin and&#xD;
      Clopidogrel) are blood thinning treatments and research has reported they reduce heart&#xD;
      attacks, death and stroke. The investigators know some patients do not respond fully to&#xD;
      Clopidogrel but currently patients are not tested for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to perform a trial to identify those patients who do not respond fully&#xD;
      to Clopidogrel and randomise them to either Prasugrel (newer drug) or a higher dose of&#xD;
      Clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the hospitals (2 in the UK and 1 in Germany) will be asked for their&#xD;
      consent to participate. A blood sample is tested for platelet activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low platelet activity result means patient has responded well to Clopidogrel and will&#xD;
           continue on the routine dose. They will be entered into an observational registry. Data&#xD;
           will be collected of routine blood tests and investigations, medication and procedures.&#xD;
           Their GP will be contacted at about 30 days to see if they are alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High platelet activity results means patient has not responded fully to Clopidogrel.&#xD;
           These patients will be randomly allocated to a higher dose of Clopidogrel or new drug&#xD;
           Prasugrel. Data will be collected of routine blood tests and investigations, medication&#xD;
           and procedures. A hospital visit at 30±5 days is required to assess how patients are&#xD;
           doing, medications and occurrence of any events.&#xD;

      STUDY DESCRIPTION This is a multinational, randomised open label study comparing Prasugrel&#xD;
      versus Clopidogrel in ACS patients who have high platelet reactivity managed with an early&#xD;
      invasive strategy (PCI as early as possible and no later than 72 hours from admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified with low platelet reactivity indicating a good response to Clopidogrel&#xD;
      will be entered into an observational Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites There will be three participating hospitals, two in the UK and one in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening All patients admitted to the hospital with suspected ACS requiring early PCI&#xD;
      (within 3 days of admission) will be screened for entry into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and/or his/her designee will explain the study requirements and procedures&#xD;
      and obtain consent before any study procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate approximately 500 patients will be screened. From these a total of 140 patients&#xD;
      will be randomised, the remaining screened patients will be entered into the registry. There&#xD;
      will be competitive recruitment and each site is expected to randomise about 40 to 50&#xD;
      patients each. We estimate 7 to 8 patients randomised per month over a period of 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine blood tests and investigations will be carried out according to local management&#xD;
      strategies. The angiogram and PCI procedure are part of the routine management for this&#xD;
      patient and will be performed according to local policies and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research blood sample will be required to determine platelet activity which has to be taken&#xD;
      &gt; 2hours from the standard Clopidogrel pre-PCI loading. For most patients this will be taken&#xD;
      in the catheter laboratory around the PCI procedure. In a few patients who are loaded with&#xD;
      Clopidogrel close to the PCI procedure the blood samples may be taken in the ward or recovery&#xD;
      area. Depending on the platelet activity results patients will be either entered into the&#xD;
      registry or randomly allocated to either Clopidogrel or Prasugrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are good responders to Clopidogrel (platelet reactivity &lt;400 AUC min) will&#xD;
           be entered into the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who are poor responders to Clopidogrel (platelet reactivity &gt; 400AUC min) will&#xD;
           be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGISTRY PATIENTS Patients will continue on the standard treatment of Clopidogrel. Data will&#xD;
      be collected of routine blood tests and investigations, medication and procedures. Additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken (if patient consents) for the biomarker and genetic sub-studies.&#xD;
      Their GP will be contacted at 30±5 days to see if they are alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISED PATIENTS Randomisation Investigators will access an automated telephone or&#xD;
      automated web service. Investigators will have to confirm patient fulfils the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and that consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised Treatment Randomised patients will be allocated to receive either open label&#xD;
      Clopidogrel (Plavix) or Prasugrel (Efient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Clopidogrel (Plavix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 Loading 600mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2 to 7 day: 150mg o.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 8 to 30±5 days: 75mg o.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Prasugrel (Efient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 loading 60mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2 to 7 10mg o.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 8 to 30±5 days 10mg od&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Supply and Storage Prasugrel, a commercially available product, will be supplied by Eli&#xD;
      Lilly which holds the manufacturing license to produce Prasugrel. Clopidogrel (Plavix) will&#xD;
      be purchased by the hospital Pharmacy through normal purchasing arrangements. All study drugs&#xD;
      should be stored in an appropriate locked room, under the control of the Hospital Pharmacist&#xD;
      or the Investigator, in the conditions described in the package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Admission to Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed until they are discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples taken for platelet activity at 1, 4 and 24 hours, and pre-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample for the biomarker substudy will be taken pre-PCI procedure at 24 hours and&#xD;
           at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample for the genetic substudy will be taken at baseline or if not possible&#xD;
           pre-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will have instructions on how to contact the research team if they have any&#xD;
           questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Month Follow UP RCT Patients in the RCT will be required to attend the hospital for a&#xD;
      follow up visit at 30±5 days from date of randomisation. Patients will be assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator or his/her designee for heart rate and blood pressure, medication tolerance and&#xD;
      compliance, occurrence of adverse events and clinical endpoints, blood sample for platelet&#xD;
      activity. At this time the investigator will discuss with the patient their treatment options&#xD;
      after this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-studies There are two sub-studies proposed (i) biomarker and (ii) genetic. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken and stored locally before shipment to a core lab in Germany.&#xD;
