  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of pazopanib and vorinostat that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients needed for&#xD;
      tumor growth. This may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat is designed to cause chemical changes in different groups of proteins that are&#xD;
      attached to DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may slow the growth of cancer cells or&#xD;
      cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, up to 12 dose levels of pazopanib&#xD;
      and vorinostat will be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level of the combination of pazopanib and vorinostat. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level of pazopanib and vorinostat. Each new group(s) will receive a&#xD;
      higher combination dose of pazopanib and vorinostat than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. Participants may be enrolled on 1-3 similar dose levels&#xD;
      of pazopanib and vorinostat at the same time. You will be assigned to a dose level based on&#xD;
      when you joined this study. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose(s) of the&#xD;
      study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of pazopanib and vorinostat is found, this combination dose&#xD;
      will be given to an expansion group of 14 additional participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take pazopanib and vorinostat by mouth 1 time each day. Note that you will not take&#xD;
      the study drugs at the same time as each other. You should take pazopanib either 1 hour&#xD;
      before or 2 hours after eating a meal. You should take vorinostat with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you&#xD;
      may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are able to take your blood pressure at home, you will be asked to take your blood&#xD;
      pressure each day while you are participating on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before the first dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 2 and then every 2-3 cycles after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and/or x-ray to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 6, you are only required to visit MD Anderson every 2 cycles if you get your&#xD;
      blood draws at your local doctor at the beginning of each cycle. Talk to the study staff&#xD;
      about this option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, or you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
           PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 174 evaluable patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
