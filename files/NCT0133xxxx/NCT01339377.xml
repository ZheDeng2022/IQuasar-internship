  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the AO-1000 device to treat and relieve the pain&#xD;
      of symptomatic subjects with contained herniated discs. This single-arm pilot study will be&#xD;
      used as a go vs. no-go decision on performing a randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary effectiveness objective is to demonstrate that the patient's&#xD;
      functionality (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores) has improved from baseline at one&#xD;
      month. The study's primary safety objective is to demonstrate that serious device/procedure&#xD;
      related adverse events and subsequent surgical interventions are no greater than those in a&#xD;
      literature control of other percutaneous disc decompression procedures at discharge, 1 month,&#xD;
      6 months, and 12 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to demonstrate procedural success and improvement in the pain and&#xD;
      function of the subjects at 1, 6, and 12 months using the VAS and ODI scales as well as&#xD;
      tracking analgesic medication use. Pain and function scores for each follow-up time will be&#xD;
      compared to the baseline scores.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The AO-1000 device provides an oxygen-ozone treatment for contained herniated discs. An&#xD;
      oxygen-ozone treatment is a minimally invasive injection for treating disc herniations that&#xD;
      is widely practiced in Europe and Asia. This treatment involves the injection of an&#xD;
      oxygen-ozone mixture into the herniated disc and/or the paravertebral muscle surrounding the&#xD;
      disc. However, there are no medical ozone generators for this procedure that are currently&#xD;
      cleared by the FDA for use in the US. Many studies using a wide range of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, ozone concentrations, and procedures have been performed to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of oxygen-ozone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis of nearly 8,000 patients from published studies shows a mean improvement of&#xD;
      39 mm for VAS and 25.7 for ODI. The likelihood of complications was 0.064%. Furthermore, no&#xD;
      cases of discitis were reported after oxygen-ozone therapy, which is unlike all the other&#xD;
      methods of disc volume reduction. This is most likely due to the fact that ozone is a strong&#xD;
      oxidizer and an excellent disinfecting agent. The complications shown in the meta-analysis&#xD;
      were minor and transient, and easily avoidable by utilizing a device such as the AO-1000 that&#xD;
      is designed to eliminate these types of complications (ozone leakage into the treatment room&#xD;
      and high ozone concentrations) during this procedure. The estimated complication rate from&#xD;
      the meta-analysis is consistent with the Italian Oxygen-Ozone Therapy Federation (FIO)&#xD;
      results (no procedure-related adverse events in treatments on 15,000 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the direct injection of oxygen-ozone gas mixture into the nucleus pulposus was&#xD;
      well established in these studies. Therefore, the intent of this study is to obtain data to&#xD;
      confirm that a 2 weight percent (wt%) oxygen-ozone mixture delivered from the AO-1000 device&#xD;
      is safe and effective for the intended use. This clinical study is designed to bridge the&#xD;
      AO-1000 to the extensive prior oxygen-ozone treatment safety and effectiveness data between&#xD;
      studies such as those found in the Meta-analysis that did not use the AO-1000 as the delivery&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
