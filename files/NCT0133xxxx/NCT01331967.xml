  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone is used in the treatment of diabetic patients. Thiazolidinediones increase&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and show favorable effect on blood glucose levels and lipid profiles. The&#xD;
      effect of pioglitazone on atherosclerotic and inflammatory markers has not been compared in&#xD;
      prospective manner after everolimus-eluting stent implantation by OCT. The purpose of this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, open-label trial is to compare the effect of pioglitazone on&#xD;
      neointima volume and atherosclerosis progression in type 2 diabetic patients by using OCT.&#xD;
      Moreover, changes in neointima characteristics could be analyzed along with the changes in&#xD;
      miRNA-21, -126, -143, -145. Major adverse cardiovascular events such as non-fatal MI, death,&#xD;
      stroke, and TLR could be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes mellitus are more prone to coronary heart disease, stroke, and&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus has been regarded as an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for the progression of coronary artery disease. Several studies have been reported&#xD;
      that diabetes increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality in both men and women. With the&#xD;
      introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs), the angiographic rates of restenosis at later&#xD;
      months have reduced dramatically in several studies. However, even with DESs, diabetic&#xD;
      patients showed increased rates of restenosis and late loss index compared with nondiabetic&#xD;
      patients. Diabetes has been considered to be a predictor of poor prognosis after percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes&#xD;
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-metal stents (DESs) have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be worse in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients. In the era&#xD;
      of DESs, no study has demonstrated the clinical and angiographic outcomes in diabetic&#xD;
      patients after DES implantation by using optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various microRNAs such as miRNA-21, -126, -143, -145 are involved in the restenosis and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis progression (Figure 1). Changes in these miRNAs from baseline to 9 months&#xD;
      after randomization have never been studied, and the effects of pioglitazone in correlation&#xD;
      with the changes in various miRNAs could be utilized in clinical practices. Comparison of&#xD;
      pioglitazone and placebo on 9 months follow-up neointima volume and neointima characteristics&#xD;
      by optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be conducted.&#xD;
