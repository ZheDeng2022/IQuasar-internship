  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascites is a frequent complication of patients with portal hypertension. As portal&#xD;
      hypertension progresses, a percentage of these patients develop refractory ascites.&#xD;
      Management options at that point include either TIPS or intermittent large volume&#xD;
      paracentesis (LVP), with its attendant risks, Portal hypertension is accompanied by systemic&#xD;
      circulatory dysfunction (decreased systemic vascular resistance and systolic BP), which is&#xD;
      exacerbated by large volume paracentesis, with resultant renal and cardiac dysfunction. There&#xD;
      are limited options for managing patients with acute decompensation, such as hepatorenal&#xD;
      syndrome, although midodrine and other vasoconstrictors have been used in such patients.&#xD;
      Midodrine has not been used as a possible therapeutic for ascites. Midodrine however, has&#xD;
      been found to change the hemodynamics related to portal hypertension and ascites. There has&#xD;
      been also change in mediators related to renal and circulation in studies of short duration&#xD;
      (7 days) but not found in studies of 1 month duration, however the clinical effects of&#xD;
      midodrine is found for longer duration in other similar conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the utility of midodrine in patients with obvious&#xD;
      systemic circulatory dysfunction (hypotension) in improving the outcome of patients with&#xD;
      refractory ascites and change in hemodynamic parameters and its mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) an objective reduction of the volume/rate of accumulation of ascites and 2) a decrease in&#xD;
      the frequency of LVP.&#xD;

      The pathophysiology of ascites is complex and various mechanisms have been proposed.&#xD;
      Splanchnic and systemic vasodilation related to excess nitric oxide has been associated with&#xD;
      systemic hypotension and increased portal flow.(8-10) This is associated with hemodynamic&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms, including activation of the renin-angiotension aldosterone system&#xD;
      (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and non osmotic release of anti-diuretic hormones&#xD;
      (ADH).(11, 12) These ultimately result in renal dysfunction, associated with sodium and fluid&#xD;
      retention.(13) Several studies have shown reversal of HRS and decreased circulatory&#xD;
      dysfunction when vasoconstrictors are administered. Various vasoconstrictors (noradrenaline,&#xD;
      teleperessin, octreotide and midodrine) have been used in the management of hepato renal&#xD;
      syndrome (HRS). (14-17) Midodrine appears to have some advantages, including the benefit of&#xD;
      being an oral medication. (18) The beneficial effects have been noted as early as 6 hours&#xD;
      after the use of midodrine in patients with ascites with or without HRS (2) with decreased&#xD;
      plasma renin activity (PRA), antidiuretic hormone (ADH), nitrite and nitrate activity (NOx),&#xD;
      increased renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased urine sodium&#xD;
      concentration (UNa) and volume, increased mean atrial pressure (MAP), decreased heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) and cardiac output (CO). There was also decreased aldosterone in non-azotemic cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with or without ascites in patients studied for 7 days. (3) The renal function&#xD;
      improvement was not substantiated in other studies. In patients treated for a month along&#xD;
      with octreotide there was no significant improvement of renal function but marginal&#xD;
      reversible liver dysfunction with decreased body weight (paracentesis adjusted weight),(19) A&#xD;
      similar significant weight reduction was also noted in another study.(7) Midodrine has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe and effective in patients when used to prevent dialysis induced hypotension,&#xD;
      and has improved systolic pressure, without a significantly increased volume of fluid&#xD;
      filtered by dialysis and no change in body weight in patients studied.(20, 21) The beneficial&#xD;
      effects have been attributed to its modulating effects on autonomic function and increasing&#xD;
      peripheral vessel resistances.(22) The drug has been found to effective and safe in acute and&#xD;
      chronic use (21, 23) with minimal side effects.(24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasoconstrictors in patients with ascites and hydrothorax In non azotemic cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      with ascites, the addition of octreotide improved diuresis and decreased renin, increased&#xD;
      MAP, decreased CO and improved renal function by increasing GFR, increased urine sodium and&#xD;
      volume excretion.(25) In patient with massive hydrothorax with mild ascites and no azotemia,&#xD;
      addition of midodrine to octreotide improves MAP, increases GFR, RPF and urine sodium and&#xD;
      volume; and prevents recurrence of hydrothorax. Vasoconstrictors have been recommended as&#xD;
      treatment for hydrothorax (4-6)and has been found beneficial in refractory ascites.(26)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Vasoconstrictors like midodrine have been shown to be beneficial, with&#xD;
      improvement of circulatory dysfunction in various groups of patients including patients with&#xD;
      HRS type 1, type 2, non azotemic patients and in patients requiring hemodialysis. There are&#xD;
      suggestions of decreased body weight in some of these patients. In patients with hydrothorax,&#xD;
      addition of vasoconstrictors has helped in relieving the symptoms. The investigators suggest&#xD;
      that midodrine could also benefit patients with refractory ascites. By decreasing the rate of&#xD;
      ascitic fluid accumulation, it may be possible to decrease the volume of ascites drained or&#xD;
      lengthen the interval between paracentesis, giving comfort to the patients. The beneficial&#xD;
      effect on portal pressures and ascites could be due to other mechanisms (such as autonomic&#xD;
      function) rather than their effect on renal hemodynamics as they are not sustained. There are&#xD;
      no studies where this has been systematically analyzed.&#xD;
