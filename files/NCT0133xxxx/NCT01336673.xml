      This is a non-interventional, prospective study where no visits or additional interventions&#xD;
      to the daily practice of the physician will be performed. Glucophage XR® has recently been&#xD;
      available in Thailand for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. A prospective&#xD;
      observational study will be valuable to provide information on the day-to-day experience of&#xD;
      using Glucophage XR® in the management of this patient population. The data may provide an&#xD;
      insight into the use of Glucophage XR® in routine clinical practice in Thailand.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metformin (Glucophage) is the standard first line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The landmark UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group demonstrated significant reduction&#xD;
      in the risk of myocardial infarction and overall mortality in overweight patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes treated with metformin and metformin was more effective in controlling blood glucose&#xD;
      compared with lifestyle only diet-based policy. The observed improvement of blood glucose was&#xD;
      not associated with weight gain or hypoglycaemia in contrast to treatment with either a&#xD;
      sulphonylurea or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well accepted that patients' compliance with therapy tends to decrease as the dosage&#xD;
      frequency increases and that regimens should be simplified as far as possible to support good&#xD;
      compliance with therapy. The use of an extended-release formulation of metformin (Glucophage&#xD;
      XR®) may support the simplification of treatment for patients by allowing a once-daily&#xD;
      administration of metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients taking metformin had significantly lower fasting and postprandial plasma&#xD;
      glucose and hemoglobin A1C concentrations, they also had a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. The most commonly reported symptoms was diarrhea (53,2 %&#xD;
      compared to 11,7% on placebo). In a study employing self-administered questionnaires to&#xD;
      ascertain GI symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 20% of those taking&#xD;
      immediate-release metformin reported diarrhea as the most common symptoms. Although less than&#xD;
      5% of patients discontinue metformin treatment for this reason, such adverse events can be&#xD;
      troublesome, may limit the dosage of metformin and may impair compliance with therapy.&#xD;
      Glucophage XR may lead to improved tolerability, by smoothing the peaks and troughs in&#xD;
      metformin plasma concentrations and delaying the achievement of peak plasma concentration,&#xD;
      compared with an immediate-release formulation. Initial placebo-controlled clinical trials&#xD;
      with Glucophage XR indicate that 9,6% patients reported diarrhea (compare to 1,5% on&#xD;
      placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the use of Glucophage XR® may provide benefits in terms of improved patient management,&#xD;
      by enabling once-daily dosing and reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects for&#xD;
      some patients. A prospective observational study will be valuable to provide information on&#xD;
      the day-to-day experience of using Glucophage XR® in the management of this patient&#xD;
      population. The data may provide an insight into the use of Glucophage XR® in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice in Thailand.&#xD;
