  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have demonstrated a relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism and obstetrics&#xD;
      complications like preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption and stillbirth.&#xD;
      Subclinical hypothyroidism and positive thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) may increase the&#xD;
      risk of early spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation. But there is not a consensus&#xD;
      if the prevalence of TPOab should be treated before and during pregnancy when the level of&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormones are regulators of the mitochondrial activity and our research group has&#xD;
      previously shown that subclinical hypothyroidism affects mitochondrial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subclinical hypothyroidism causes early spontaneous abortion and or complications in&#xD;
      pregnancy like pre-eclampsia because of mitochondrial dysfunction&#xD;

      The aim is to estimate the relationship between SH and spontaneous abortion and/or obstetric&#xD;
      complications because of mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A prospective study where data from the General Suburban Population Study in Naestved&#xD;
           will be analyzed to measure the frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and TPOab.&#xD;
           SH is defined as raised serum concentrations of TSH &gt; 3,4 mU/l and normal levels of free&#xD;
           T4 and T3. A cut-off of 60 mU/l is used for TPOab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the relationship between SH or TPOab and early spontaneous abortion and&#xD;
           pregnancy outcome. Inclusion of women who have experienced a minimum of one early&#xD;
           spontaneous abortion and between 20 and 50 years old: 50 women who have SU and/or&#xD;
           TPOab-positive and 50 women who have normal levels of TSH and TPOab-negative. The basal&#xD;
           oxygen consumption will be measured and mitochondrial functions will be determined by&#xD;
           flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the prevalence of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia among pregnant&#xD;
           women with subclinical hypothyroidism and estimate the mitochondrial function. A minimum&#xD;
           of 100 pregnant women without any thyroid disease or diabetes will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early spontaneous abortion is defined as abortion before 12 weeks of gestation. Obstetrics&#xD;
      complications are defined as pre-eclampsia (proteinuria, oedema, hypertension),&#xD;
      pregnancy-induced hypertension, placental insufficience (IUGR) and abruption, preterm&#xD;
      delivery and stillbirth. Those complications will be analyzed from the data of the obstetric&#xD;
      journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of oxygen consumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory gas analysis and volume measurements were performed with a canopy connected by a&#xD;
      triple V (flow⁄gas sensor) to an Oxycon apparatus (Jaeger Oxycon Champion, Breda, the&#xD;
      Netherlands). The equipment was calibrated before each test to compensate for ambient&#xD;
      conditions such as air pressure, temperature and humidity. Basal VO2 was measured after at&#xD;
      least 6 hours fasting. Before the test the individual resting pulse was established and the&#xD;
      participants rested for about 30 min in a chair. The test room was quiet and the lighting was&#xD;
      subdued. The subjects were given sufficient time to become familiarized with the equipment&#xD;
      and the procedures and the test was initiated when the resting pulse was achieved. Oxygen&#xD;
      consumption was measured when the uptake per minute remained constant. Measurements were&#xD;
      performed for repeated periods of 30 seconds for 20 minutes. The method for recording oxygen&#xD;
      uptake had a within-day variation of 0.8 % and a day-to-day variation of 5.8 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of mitochondrial mass (MM) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by flow&#xD;
      cytometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood was drawn from the patient in EDTA Vacutainer tubes. From each patient 2 samples&#xD;
      of 100 µl of blood were processed. One unstained control tube and one stained were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples to be stained were added 1 µl Pacific Blue Mouse Anti-Human anti-CD14 (BD&#xD;
      Biosciences, Denmark) and mixed. The tubes were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature&#xD;
      protected from direct light and subsequently washed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stained cells were resuspended in 890 µl PBS and added 10 µl 1 µM MTG (MitoTracker Green&#xD;
      FM, Invitrogen A/S, Denmark) and 100 µl 1 µM TMRM (Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester,&#xD;
      Invitrogen A/S, Denmark). All stock solutions were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and&#xD;
      working solutions were diluted in PBS. After mixing samples were incubated for 30 minutes at&#xD;
      room temperature in the dark.&#xD;
