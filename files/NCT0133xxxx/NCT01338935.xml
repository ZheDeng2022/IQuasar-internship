  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an investigational&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agent called CW002 and to document its effects on healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. A neuromuscular blocking agent is a drug that temporarily prevents muscles from&#xD;
      moving. CW002 has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, neuromuscular blocking agents are used together with other drugs that put people&#xD;
      completely &quot;asleep&quot;. These drugs allow doctors to place a breathing tube in the airway, stop&#xD;
      muscles from moving during surgical operations, and allow ventilation (movement of air).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done because CW002 is expected to act quickly and to provide a muscle&#xD;
      block of intermediate (not too long, not too short) duration. The researchers would like to&#xD;
      test increasing doses of CW002 that can be given without causing severe side effects. If&#xD;
      shown to be both safe and effective, such a compound would be useful in surgical procedures&#xD;
      and could improve future anesthetic care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents are especially important in intubation (insertion of breathing&#xD;
      tube into the windpipe) because a quick and effective muscle block is needed to promptly&#xD;
      complete the process and secure the airway. In addition, being able to rapidly reverse a&#xD;
      blocking agent is desirable so that the patient can breathe on his/her own as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects receive an initial ascending bolus dose of CW 002 injection, and a second bolus followed by a continuous infusion initiated at the point of 25% recovery of twitch response. Infusion rate will be adjusted to maintain 97%- 99% suppression of twitch, but to avoid complete neuromuscular block. For the first 3 subjects of each cohort, CW 002 will be allowed to recover spontaneously. For the second 3 subjects, reversal will be performed at the appearance of 1st twitch using 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.01 mg/kg glycopyrrolate.&#xD;
Cohort 5- subject receives 2.0x ED95 dose of CW 002, followed by 1.5x ED95 dose and 30 min infusion of 2-10 mcg/kg/min of CW 002&#xD;
Cohort 6 - subject receives 3.0x ED95 dose of CW 002, followed by 1.5x ED95 dose and 60 min infusion of 2-10 mcg/kg/min of CW 002&#xD;
Cohort 7 - subject receives 4.0x ED95 dose of CW 002, followed by 1.5x ED95 dose and 90 min infusion of 2-10 mcg/kg/min of CW 002&#xD;
Bolus doses of ED95 are determined in Part I of the study.</description>

    <description>In Part III, safety, intubation efficacy, and PK will be evaluated in 2 cohorts (Cohorts 8 and 9) of 6 subjects each, who will undergo endotracheal intubation at 60 or 90 seconds after a bolus dose of CW002 injection at 3 to 4 times the ED95. For the first 3 subjects of each cohort, CW 002 will be allowed to recover spontaneously. For the second 3 subjects, reversal will be performed at the appearance of 1st twitch using 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.01 mg/kg glycopyrrolate.&#xD;
Cohort 8 - subject receives 3.0x ED95 dose of CW 002, and intubation attempt is made 90 seconds post-bolus.&#xD;
Cohort 9 - subject receives 4.0x ED95 dose of CW 002, and intubation attempt is made 60 seconds post-bolus.</description>
