  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an experimental drug called EZN-4176 to determine the anticancer&#xD;
      effects when it is given to patients with an advanced form of prostate cancer called&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Goals of this phase I study include finding out&#xD;
      the dose of EZN-4176 that can be safely given without serious side effects and to determine&#xD;
      the amount of EZN-4176 that should be given in future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1a will involve dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The&#xD;
           MTD will be determined on the basis of the results from the safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1b will involve cohort expansion at one or more dose levels to determine the&#xD;
           recommended Phase 2 dose. The recommended Phase 2 dose, which may differ from the MTD,&#xD;
           will be determined on the basis of results from safety, activity, and pharmacologic and&#xD;
           correlative studies.&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing gonadal androgen-deprivation therapy with LHRH analogs or orchiectomy.&#xD;
             Patients without orchiectomy must receive effective LHRH analog therapy during the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation - with all 3 of the following&#xD;
             criteria:PSA evidence of progressive prostate cancer; PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL increasing on at&#xD;
             least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If confirmatory PSA &lt; screening&#xD;
             PSA, additional test for increasing PSA is needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients receiving anti-androgen agent as part of primary androgen ablation: disease&#xD;
             progression after stopping the anti-androgen agent. This disease progression is&#xD;
             defined: 2 consecutive increasing PSAs ≥ 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft&#xD;
             tissue progression. Flutamide patients: at least one of the PSAs ≥ 4 weeks after&#xD;
             stopping flutamide. Bicalutamide or nilutamide patients: at least one PSA ≥ 6 weeks&#xD;
             after stopping the anti-androgen agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who failed standard therapy or who, after physician discussion, wish to delay&#xD;
