  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This comparative pilot study is designed to compare the rates of gastric emptying and by&#xD;
      inference rates of digestion of two food emulsions. Two types of milk protein stabilised food&#xD;
      emulsion will be compared, one standard emulsion preparation and one emulsion preparation&#xD;
      cross-linked with microbial transglutaminase. The information from this study will then be&#xD;
      compared to data on satiety and endocrine hormones from a parallel study undertaken in&#xD;
      Finland using the same two meal formulations. The drinks will be labeled with a stable&#xD;
      isotope of carbon and samples of breath collected every 20 minutes after consumption of the&#xD;
      drink. This will allow gastric residence time to be calculated. The pilot will also fulfill&#xD;
      two secondary objectives. At the same time as the breath samples are collected MRI scans of&#xD;
      the upper abdomen will be made so that gastric volumes can be measured in order to compare&#xD;
      the two methods of measuring gastric emptying rates. Additionally, samples of saliva will&#xD;
      also be collected after every MRI scan for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. These are&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of mass spectrometry analysis for detection of the presence of&#xD;
      specific digestion related hormones such as ghrelin.&#xD;
