      Intend of use: A blood test for Cancer Associated Antibodies (CAAA) is an aid in initial&#xD;
      diagnosis of ovarian cancer in women with suspected ovarian pathology as detected by primary&#xD;
      diagnostic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Description: Blood is collected from patients and serum/plasma is tested for the&#xD;
      presence of CAAA on experimental test kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the CAAA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include women that have been diagnosed with suspected ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (OC), verified by pathology/cytology as patients, women with suspected ovarian cancer&#xD;
      but verified by pathology/cytology as non-cancers and a control set of blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected from age matched women with no history of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure: Women that will be enrolled for the study will be checked for the presence of&#xD;
      CAAAb, and the results of the CAAAb test will be compared to the pathology submitted by the&#xD;
      physicians in the participating centers for the patient population and to the clinical&#xD;
      history for the control population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The investigators will collect at least 50 patients verified by&#xD;
      pathology/cytology and for each patient at least two aged matched healthy controls and two&#xD;
      aged matched suspected but verified as non-cancers. Total amount at least 250 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Multi center study, statistical rationale provided below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Variables: The effectiveness of the test will be defined by the&#xD;
      specificity of the test conditionally that the sensitivity is not lower than a pre-defined&#xD;
      level of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: The endpoint of this study is to show that the effectiveness is higher than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Monitor: For each site a dedicated CRO will be appointed to monitor the clinical&#xD;
      trials. All data will be stored in a protected internet-based database, and any changes of&#xD;
      the data will be traced and recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since the mutations of a normal cell that lead to a malignancy, involves changes in the&#xD;
      structure and function of the cells, it could be assumed that the immune system has&#xD;
      recognized some of these changes as antigenic determinates that should be responded against.&#xD;
      For many years, investigators tried to distinguish between cancer patients and healthy&#xD;
      population by the difference in specific autoantibodies level. In the healthy population, a&#xD;
      baseline of the amount of autoantibodies was determined, and the patient population had to&#xD;
      have a statistically significant higher level of autoantibodies. The presence of&#xD;
      autoantibodies in all population in different levels made it very difficult to find these&#xD;
      specifically discriminating antibodies. To date, no specific autoantibody is distinguishing&#xD;
      solely between healthy and cancer patients (as opposed to autoimmune diseases, where specific&#xD;
      autoantibodies can be found in very high levels in patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our work assumes that specific Autoantibodies expression level should be altered in cancer,&#xD;
      and thus these changes can indicate the presence / absence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment protocol, we are checking for changes in expression levels of specific&#xD;
      autoantibodies of women with ovarian pathology compared to women without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAAA test is comprised of a blood collection and processing step followed by detection of&#xD;
      specific auto antibodies with an ELISA based assay and a mathematical processing, with a&#xD;
      subsequent classification of the results as &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; for ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes those women that are scheduled for a pathological or&#xD;
      cytological confirmation either by a surgical procedure (laparoscopy/laparotomy) or any kind&#xD;
      of biopsy or cytology, prior to any anti-cancer treatment and aged matched controls. The&#xD;
      clinical suspicion includes one of the following: Pelvic mass/cyst (by pelvic examination&#xD;
      and/or imaging techniques), and/or high CA-125 levels, and/or ascites, and/or due to&#xD;
      incidental finding of distant metastasis. Final verification (&quot;true positive&quot; or &quot;true&#xD;
      negative&quot;) will be done in relation to pathology/cytology results only or for healthy women&#xD;
      in relation to clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection Suspected ovarian cancer women(patients and non-cancers women) - Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria - all of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years or over.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients suspected of ovarian pathology. The clinical suspicion will include one of the&#xD;
           following: Pelvic mass/cyst (by pelvic examination and/or other imaging techniques),&#xD;
           and/or high CA-125 levels, and/or ascites, and/or due to incidental finding of distant&#xD;
           metastasis. Final analysis will be done in relation to pathology/cytology results only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients scheduled laparotomy/laparoscopy/surgery, ideally before any of the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected ovarian cancer women(patients and non-cancers women) - Exclusion criteria: any of&#xD;
      the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematological malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autoimmune disorders diagnosed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous or current tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under active chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected ovarian cancer patients - final classification&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The &quot;true positive&quot; group consists of all sequential patients that satisfy inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and are positive for ovarian cancer by pathology results. The &quot;true negative&quot; group&#xD;
      consists of sequential patients that satisfy inclusion criteria and are negative for ovarian&#xD;
      cancer by pathology results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be based on multi-centers participation. The minimum number of sites for the&#xD;
      study is 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a single blind prospective validation study, involving all consecutive&#xD;
      suspected ovarian pathology women being scheduled for biopsy/surgery during the study&#xD;
      duration, having pathology/cytology ovarian cancer (true positive) and XXX number of women&#xD;
      having negative ovarian pathology/cytology results (true negative)and healthy women. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAAA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the study is defined as the specificity of the CAAA test for a pre&#xD;
      defined sensitivity of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the sensitivity of CAAA test to show that it is not below the&#xD;
      declared level of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current medical publications, we assume that the study population will include&#xD;
      about 10-20% of true positive cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today, large proportion of the suspected patients was only diagnosed by final pathology&#xD;
      of the laparoscopy/surgery. In this study, the true positive and true negative cases (as&#xD;
      verified by pathology) will be compared to the CAAA test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Subjects clinical information acquired from the patient's medical file,&#xD;
      including age, medical history and results of tests done leading to the diagnostic evaluation&#xD;
      of ovarian cancer will be recorded on the appropriate, bar-coded, pre-study case report forms&#xD;
      .The reports will be electronic via a dedicated and secured internet site, any changes in the&#xD;
      database will be recorded and will be traceable. The study is anonymous and the Department&#xD;
      will keep the name of the patient without reveling it to investigators and to the study&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor/ nurse/ phlebotomist will collect a heparin vacuum/serological tube (about 8ml),&#xD;
      label (bar-code) them. The blood handling laboratory will collect serum/plasma and the serum&#xD;
      will be kept frozen at -80C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA based tests for the detection of Auto Antibodies relative expression ratios, will be&#xD;
      conducted on each sample according to the lab protocol . The samples will be tested for&#xD;
      response to the antigens that have been identified on a previous training set. All the data&#xD;
      will be permanently recorded directly into a dedicated computer. For each sample all antibody&#xD;
      results will be put into the coded patient file. A mathematical algorithm will determine if&#xD;
      the sample is positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final pathology will be compared with the CAAA test results. The results will be analyzed&#xD;
      by a statistician with expertise in cancer population studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a blind prospective validation study, involving all consecutive&#xD;
      suspected ovarian pathology subjects being scheduled for biopsy/surgery/cytology during the&#xD;
      study duration. The purpose of the study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      CAAA test for detection ovarian cancer in women scheduled for biopsy/surgery/cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for potential participation in the study, according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will include parameters of the clinical and pathological/cytological state of the&#xD;
      subjects and results of CAAA ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two goals of the study. To test that the sensitivity of CAAA is not below the&#xD;
      pre-defined level. To evaluate the specificity of CAAA test. Statistical Hypothesis The main&#xD;
      condition determining the sample size is to validate that the sensitivity of the test is not&#xD;
      lower than the predefined level. The classification rule was established in such a way that&#xD;
      the sensitivity in the teaching sample was 100%. We assume that the real sensitivity is not&#xD;
      lower that 99%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: The sensitivity of the test is not higher than 95%. A database management&#xD;
      system shall be designed and maintained, including screen preparation, and edit check&#xD;
      programming. Pre-entry and post-entry quality control of the clinical data shall be performed&#xD;
      at each data entry center. All ELISA test results will be uploaded to the database via an&#xD;
      internet based interface, and will be locked against further changes. In order to change&#xD;
      ELISA test results, unlocking of the database requires consent from the local CRO, the&#xD;
      sponsor and the site physician. Unlocking will be done only by the webmaster, and will be&#xD;
      recorder in the tracing system component, and in a hard copy held both by the sponsor and the&#xD;
      CRO in the site.&#xD;
