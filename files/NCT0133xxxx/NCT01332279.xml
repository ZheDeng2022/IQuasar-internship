  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving everolimus (RAD001) and&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride together with radiation therapy in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      head and neck cancer previously treated with radiation therapy. RAD001 and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving RAD001 and&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of RAD001 given concurrently with&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in the re-irradiation setting for head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary data on response rate. II. Determine progression-free survival at 6 and&#xD;
      12 months and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Perform correlative studies to evaluate and characterize biological features of&#xD;
      recurrent or second primary tumors, as well as to follow surrogates of mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hypoxia-inducible factor&#xD;
      1-alpha (HIF-1α) inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus and erlotinib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive RAD001 orally (PO) and erlotinib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD). Treatment&#xD;
      continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo EBRT twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;

Biological endpoints (protein expression of EGFR, pEGFR, EGFR amplification, Akt/pAkt, PS6Kinase, HIF-1 α and its associated hypoxia induced angiogenesis-associated genes) will use linear or nonlinear mixed models, as appropriate.
