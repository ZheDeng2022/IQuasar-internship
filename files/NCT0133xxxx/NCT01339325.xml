      The aim of this study is to assess possible differences between the LESS approach and the&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy. In particular, the Postoperative Quality&#xD;
      of Life (QoL) will be investigated by analyzing the followings: length of hospital stay&#xD;
      (LoS), postoperative pain, cosmetics and the results of SF 36 questionnaire. Furthermore,&#xD;
      operative time, conversion to standard LC rate, difficulty of exposure, difficulty of&#xD;
      dissection, and complication rate will be compared.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to assess possible differences between the LESS approach and the&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic approach to cholecystectomy. In particular, the Postoperative Quality&#xD;
      of Life (QoL) will be investigated by analyzing the followings: length of hospital stay&#xD;
      (LoS), postoperative pain, cosmetics and the results of SF 36 questionnaire. Furthermore,&#xD;
      operative time, conversion to standard LC rate, difficulty of exposure, difficulty of&#xD;
      dissection, and complication rate will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altman nomograms were used to calculate the presumed sample size of an actual RCT,&#xD;
      arbitrarily assuming a most likely small standardized difference (0.3). With a significant&#xD;
      criterion set at 0.05, using a two-tailed test, the number of patients per group, required to&#xD;
      have a 90% power is ~500. Therefore, it was decided to carry on a pilot trial, enrolling 40&#xD;
      patients (20 each group), to assess differences in any of the end-points and tailoring the&#xD;
      sample size of the larger multicenter RCT accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dual-institutional prospective, randomized pilot trial was conducted during 2009&#xD;
      obtaining information on the power and sample size needed for a planned multicenter&#xD;
      randomized control trial. Our results showed that Quality of life data concerning LESS&#xD;
      cholecystectomy are somewhat controversial: cosmetics and SF36 role emotional parameter&#xD;
      significantly improved, no differences were found in length of hospital stay, early&#xD;
      postoperative pain (same day of surgery) was higher but no impact on need for pain-relieving&#xD;
      medications was found. Altman nomograms were used again to calculate the presumed sample size&#xD;
      of an actual RCT based on the differences found on our initial results. With a significant&#xD;
      criterion set at 0.05, using a two-tailed test, the number of patients per group, required to&#xD;
      have a 90% power in this multicenter RCT is ~180 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Randomization is performed preoperatively and stratification is performed&#xD;
      intraoperatively, after visualization of the operative field. Patients are randomized to one&#xD;
      of three groups: LESS cholecystectomy blind, standard LC, LESS cholecystectomy not blind.&#xD;
      Patients are stratified into 3 groups: Nassar grade I, II, III, according to the grade of&#xD;
      difficulty of cholecystectomy (Nassar score) assessed at the initial inspection of the&#xD;
      operating field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the first two groups do not know the treatment received until their discharge. A&#xD;
      large drape is used to cover the abdomen after surgery, thus hiding the surgical wounds.&#xD;
      Patients of the LESS cholecystectomy not blind group are aware of the procedure they undergo.&#xD;
      The third arm is intended to better evaluate the influence of psychological factors on&#xD;
      postoperative pain, cosmetics and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations are performed by high-skilled laparoscopic surgeons (one each institution)&#xD;
      with over 15-year experience in advanced laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulty (impaired) of exposure and difficulty of dissection are assessed subjectively by&#xD;
      the operating surgeon and scored 1 to 4, being 1 &quot;no difficulties&quot;, 4 &quot;the most difficult&quot;&#xD;
      with need for conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative care is similar in all patients and in all institutions. An independent&#xD;
      physician will assess the patient postoperatively in each institution. Postoperative pain is&#xD;
      evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 1 to 10, with 1 being &quot;the least&quot; pain, 10&#xD;
      &quot;the most&quot; pain, on the day of surgery, on postoperative day 1, 2 (discharge) and at 1-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Pain is also deduced from the assumption of pain relieving medications. Patients&#xD;
      will receive pain medications only on demand and these will be given in incremental strength&#xD;
      beginning with peripheral analgesics as Non-Steroidal Anti-Rheumatic agents (NSAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual satisfaction for the cosmetic result is evaluated with a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) from 0 to 100% with 0 being &quot;the worse&quot; result, 100 &quot;the best&quot; one. Cosmetics is also&#xD;
      evaluated by measuring the length of umbilical incision at the end of the operation in all&#xD;
      study groups. The incision length is measured after gallbladder removal (during standard LC&#xD;
      the incision may be enlarged to allow the passage of thick gallbladder or bigger stones).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL is assessed at the time of surgery and further assessed at postoperative month 1 by the&#xD;
      SF36 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization is performed preparing three sets of 30 numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes, the envelops of each set containing indications for 10 LESS cholecystectomies, 10&#xD;
      standard LC and 10 LESS cholecystectomies not blind. One set of envelopes is kept at each&#xD;
      involved Institution. The envelopes are opened in numeric order for each patient by an&#xD;
      assistant not involved in the surgical operations, right before surgery. The surgeons perform&#xD;
      a standard LC or a LESS cholecystectomy (blind or not blind) as indicated on the sheet inside&#xD;
      the envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses Data are analysed using the software XLSTAT Version 2009.5.01 (Addinsoft). An&#xD;
      &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demographics across the treatment groups are compared by chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical measures, and by t-test for continuous data. Mann-Whitney U test is used to&#xD;
      compare LoS, postoperative pain VAS, cosmetics VAS, length of skin incision, 8 parameters of&#xD;
      SF36, operating time, difficulty of exposure, difficulty of dissection in the two arms.&#xD;
      Chi-square test is used to compare conversion rate and administration of pain medication,&#xD;
      which is dichotomized as yes or no, in the three arms. All variables are significant at p&lt;&#xD;
      0.05. Logistic model results are reported as odds ratios, two-sided 95% confidence intervals,&#xD;
      and p values.&#xD;

    <description>Standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy The first cannula is inserted with an &quot;open laparoscopy&quot; technique. LCs are performed with either HF or US energized dissection, standard or fundus-first gallbladder dissection, closure of the artery by ligature/clip or US, closure of cystic duct by ligature/clip.&#xD;
Laparo-endoscopic single site cholecystectomy&#xD;
The TriPort device is inserted at the navel site through a 15 to 25 mm incision with an &quot;open laparoscopy&quot; technique. Two working instruments are inserted (one grasper and one energised device) through the TriPort. A further 1.8 or 3 mm instrument inserted through the larger gel valve, parallel to a 5 mm dissecting instrument, is used in some cases to enhance exposure. Gallbladder dissection is accomplished either after preparation of the cystic duct and artery or with a fundus-first technique, by means of HF electrosurgery or US shears.The cystic artery is divided between clips or by US scissors. The duct is divided between clips.</description>
