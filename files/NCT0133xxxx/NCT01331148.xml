  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is very common among African American adolescents and adults in&#xD;
      the US, ten times higher than is seen in Caucasians. VDD is also quite common in sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD). Both VDD and SCD can cause chronic pain, compression fractures, and muscle&#xD;
      weakness. The investigators believe VDD may contribute to poor musculoskeletal health and&#xD;
      chronic pain seen in pediatric SCD. In this study, the investigators aim to show that&#xD;
      children and adolescents with SCD and chronic pain have lower levels of vitamin D compared to&#xD;
      those without chronic pain. The investigators also aim to determine the clinical&#xD;
      characteristics in SCD patients related to their vitamin D status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 60 subjects (7 to 21 years old) will be enrolled on this study, 30 with chronic pain&#xD;
      and 30 without chronic pain. The investigators will assess baseline characteristics including&#xD;
      vitamin D levels, bone turnover rates (measured by C telopeptide blood levels [CTx]), markers&#xD;
      of inflammation and oxidative stress levels in blood, baseline hemoglobin and other&#xD;
      laboratory parameters, presence of abnormal bones on chest x-ray, pulmonary function, opioid&#xD;
      analgesic use, overall muscle strength, quality of life and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of vitamin D replacement on these baseline characteristics, the&#xD;
      investigators will randomize subjects to receive either placebo or high dose vitamin D for 6&#xD;
      weeks after which time the investigators will evaluate overall vitamin D status, muscle and&#xD;
      bone health, depression, quality of life, pain status and use of opioid pain medications,&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative status comparing before and after treatment with high dose vitamin&#xD;
      D. The investigators will give-at no cost to subjects-a daily supplement that will provide&#xD;
      the recommended daily allowance of calcium and vitamin D that contains 500mg Calcium and&#xD;
      200IU vitamin D to subjects throughout the study period. Subjects will be in the study for 7&#xD;
      months and have five to six study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 43% of African American adults and 53-70% of African American adolescents in the US&#xD;
      have vitamin D deficiency (VDD), ten times more than is seen in Caucasians. VDD is also quite&#xD;
      common in sickle cell disease (SCD) with prevalence rates of 65-100%. Pain is a hallmark&#xD;
      symptoms of SCD accounting for the majority of SCD morbidity. Some patients with SCD develop&#xD;
      debilitating chronic pain with an unclear etiology and unsatisfactory response to treatment.&#xD;
      Both VDD and SCD can cause chronic pain, compression fractures and myopathy. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that VDD is implicated in the poor musculoskeletal health and chronic pain of SCD. Therefore&#xD;
      we aim [1] to demonstrate that pediatric sickle cell patients have high rates of VDD and&#xD;
      those with chronic pain have lower levels of vitamin D compared to those without chronic pain&#xD;
      [2] to evaluate the musculoskeletal health, pain status, opioid analgesic use, depression and&#xD;
      quality of life in SCD patients with and without chronic pain and determine if the presence&#xD;
      or severity of VDD is associated with a more severe clinical phenotype and [3] to demonstrate&#xD;
      that administration of replacement doses of vitamin D will correct VDD, improve&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health and ameliorate chronic pain. An additional aim of this project is to&#xD;
      [4] evaluate and describe any correlates between vitamin D status and serum levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, markers of oxidative stress and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms in&#xD;
      SCD patients with and without chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate 60 SCD subjects aged 7-21 years (30 with chronic pain and 30 without chronic&#xD;
      pain) for VDD and to determine specific baseline characteristics including 25(OH)D levels,&#xD;
      bone turnover rates measured by C telopeptide serum levels (CTx), opioid analgesic use,&#xD;
      neuromuscular strength, evidence of skeletal complications on chest radiograph, depression&#xD;
      and quality of life, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative status and&#xD;
      characteristics of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). These characteristics will be compared&#xD;
      between those with chronic pain and those without chronic pain. We will have a 30 day run in&#xD;
      observation period during which baseline pain status will be determined by daily pain diary&#xD;
      report. All subjects with then be randomly assigned to receive vitamin D replacement therapy&#xD;
      or placebo for six weeks and prospectively followed for six months. All subjects will be&#xD;
      given daily recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calcium and vitamin D in the form of a soft&#xD;
      chew containing 500 mg calcium and 200 IU vitamin D throughout the study period. The primary&#xD;
      endpoints are changes in serum 25(OH)D and CTx levels and opioid analgesic use (mg/kg&#xD;
      morphine equivalent). Secondary endpoints include changes in pain status as documented by&#xD;
      diary, depression scores, quality of life scores, neuromuscular strength and changes in serum&#xD;
      cytokine levels and markers of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we hypothesize that VDD either contributes to or exacerbates sickle cell&#xD;
      chronic pain and that correcting VDD in SCD will result in decreased pain, depression and&#xD;
      opioid analgesic use; an improvement in musculoskeletal health; as well as a reduction in&#xD;
      degree of inflammation and oxidative stress. This is a pilot study in preparation for a&#xD;
      larger prospective trial evaluating the role of VDD in the pathobiology of SCD pain and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health.&#xD;
