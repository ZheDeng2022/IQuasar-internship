      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation technique on&#xD;
      post-operative pain of spine surgery subjects. Subjects will participate in a 6-week&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation program, beginning two weeks prior to spine surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      are interested in determining if this intervention improves the ability to tolerate pain and&#xD;
      reduces anxiety, thus reducing the need for prescribed analgesics and narcotics. The&#xD;
      meditation intervention will be compared against a control group consisting of subjects that&#xD;
      will undergo music therapy during the same period of time.&#xD;

      Mind body therapies which induce relaxation through the use of imagery and meditation, are&#xD;
      being increasingly sought as treatments to assist individuals cope with stress and chronic&#xD;
      illness. These holistic therapies have become accepted by both physicians and patients&#xD;
      because of the recent emerging body of evidence supporting their effectiveness for a variety&#xD;
      of physical and psychological conditions. In the case of holistic (or integrative) practices&#xD;
      used to alleviate pain, the infrequency of adverse effects makes them particularly attractive&#xD;
      to physicians who have become wary of the risks of prescription narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain medications, though they provide immediate relief, have many noted adverse side effects.&#xD;
      These include respiratory depression, decreased heart rate and in extreme cases of misuse,&#xD;
      death. These medications are especially prone to abuse by patients, even after their initial&#xD;
      pain subsides. Overdosing from prescription pain killers has become a significant cause of&#xD;
      accidental death, and providers are seeking alternative treatments for pain for their&#xD;
      patients that do not carry this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant body of research has investigated the benefits of meditation for a wide variety&#xD;
      of physical and psychological conditions . However, clinical evidence for the efficacy of&#xD;
      meditation for reducing pain is sparse, although some research suggests the mechanisms of&#xD;
      this possible benefit , Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention which is currently used in over 500 clinical sites around the world for patients&#xD;
      with a wide variety of clinical problems, including pain. MBSR was developed by Jon Kabat&#xD;
      Zinn at the University of Massachusetts in the 1970s. It is derived from the Oriental&#xD;
      traditions of Zen Buddhism, yet free from its religious roots. It is supported by over 30&#xD;
      years of research that substantiate its positive effects on numerous ailments, including&#xD;
      stress , chronic pain , anxiety and depression .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key concept in mindfulness meditation involves learning how to observe the thoughts that&#xD;
      enter one's mind without the passing of judgment and by keeping the focus on breathing or&#xD;
      another constant. This is called &quot;detached observation&quot;. The mechanisms at work are unknown&#xD;
      but are thought to be the meditation facilitating the tuning out of distractions by learning&#xD;
      to maintain and control attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of mindfulness meditation entails sitting in a quiet location and comfortable&#xD;
      position with one's eyes closed. Individuals are instructed to relax and focus on their&#xD;
      breathing, or another chosen object of attention, such as parts of the body in the body scan,&#xD;
      body movements in mindful movement, or the act of walking in walking meditation. While the&#xD;
      mind may wander and numerous thoughts, worries or concerns may arise, the individual learns&#xD;
      to non-self-critically acknowledge the shift in attention, and return to the chosen object of&#xD;
      attention. Over time, increased attentional control and awareness of mental events leads to&#xD;
      the ability to respond more positively and less reactively to stressful events, including&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early study of MBSR for chronic pain patients found that, after a 10-week training&#xD;
      program, participants demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain, negative&#xD;
      body image, pain-related reductions in activity, anxiety, and depression, compared with a&#xD;
      control group5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the benefit of MBSR for pain has been suggested by existent research, the fact that&#xD;
      it is an 8-week course requiring participation on a weekly basis in 2 Â½ hour classes, with&#xD;
      daily practice at home of 30-45 minutes, may limit its accessibility to some patients. This&#xD;
      study seeks to identify an intervention that may be widely used by participants with both&#xD;
      acute and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Focus technique is a specific mindfulness-based practice developed by Les Fehmi, PhD, of&#xD;
      Princeton, NJ. It guides practitioners to modify their attention in ways that have been shown&#xD;
      to promote relaxation and pain reduction, as measured by brain wave activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, recent research has reported actual physical and structural changes in the&#xD;
      brain with long term practice of meditation. Benefits of mindfulness meditation appear to&#xD;
      have a neuroplastic effect on the brain. Studies among those practicing meditation have&#xD;
      demonstrated a change in the mass of grey matter as well as an increase in brain connectivity&#xD;
      . The structural changes in the brain include an increased density of grey matter in the&#xD;
      hippocampus, which is a region involved in the process of learning and memory. In addition, a&#xD;
      decrease in density in the amygdala was noted; this region plays a role in stress and&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
