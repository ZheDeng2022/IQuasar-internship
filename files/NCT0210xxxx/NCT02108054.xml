      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Scientists know that alcohol use disorders affect brain structure. They want to know more&#xD;
      about the effects of alcohol use disorders on a person s behavior. They want to develop tasks&#xD;
      that can be done inside a scanner that can help them better understand these effects in later&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop tasks that investigate a person s behavior that can be used in later studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient participants of another study. They must be physically healthy right-handed&#xD;
           adults 18 60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers 18-65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have an&#xD;
           EKG to record heart activity. They will give blood and urine samples and have a&#xD;
           psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have between one and three visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking to see if they have an alcohol&#xD;
           use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete one of three simple computerized tasks either inside the&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scanner or outside of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI scanner takes pictures of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder.&#xD;
           Participants lie on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. They will be in&#xD;
           the scanner for about 60 minutes. They may have to lie still for up to 20 minutes. The&#xD;
           scanner makes loud knocking noises, but they will get earplugs.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is three-fold: 1) to develop tasks examining various cognitive,&#xD;
      motivational, and decision-making behaviors outside the scanner; 2) to modify, refine, and&#xD;
      verify the feasibility and applicability of tasks for functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) to measure intended concomitant brain activation; and 3) to examine equivalent or&#xD;
      surrogate signals using other devices such as electroencephalograph (EEG) and near infrared&#xD;
      spectrometer (NIRS) when the MR contraindication(s) are present in the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers without an alcohol use disorder, and inpatient participants with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence as determined by the DSM-IV-TR or at least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder as&#xD;
      determined by DSM-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will pilot one or both aspects of this study depending on whether the task&#xD;
      is de novo or a modification to previously verified or published task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome is to develop and examine tasks that reliably measure specific cognitive,&#xD;
      motivational and decision-making behaviors and invoke associated brain systems and functions&#xD;
      in our targeted subject populations.&#xD;
