    <textblock>
      Although the clinical outcome in patients with Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is largely&#xD;
      dependent on early initiation of effective treatment with antifungal drugs, diagnosing IA is&#xD;
      still a critical problem. Symptoms are non-specific and available diagnostic tools are either&#xD;
      invasive or have low sensitivity and specificity. This often results in a diagnostic delay,&#xD;
      with patients developing more extensive disease. Furthermore, as long as IA is present,&#xD;
      oncological follow-up treatment is not feasible. Inaccuracy in diagnosing IA can cause&#xD;
      serious treatment delay and increased mortality. However, an empirical strategy with&#xD;
      prophylactic anti-mould therapy is not feasible considering both possible side effects and&#xD;
      costs. In order to safely continue the use of a pre-empirical strategy, improved&#xD;
      (non-invasive) diagnostic tools are desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study de Heer et al. showed that it is possible to discriminate between patients&#xD;
      with IA and their neutropenic controls by exhaled breath analysis using an electronic nose&#xD;
      (eNose). In this study the investigators aim to test whether an eNose could be useful as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool in a prospective setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard in exhaled breath analysis is Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (GC-MS). This technique enables identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath&#xD;
      of patients. It is possible that there are Aspergillus specific VOCs in the breath of&#xD;
      patients with IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the lung microbiome seems to be an important factor in both health and&#xD;
      disease. It is likely that the microbiome of the lung changes in prolonged neutropenia,&#xD;
      therefore possibly creating a niche for molds and yeasts. Comparing the microbiome of&#xD;
      patients with prolonged neutropenia who develop IA with those who do not, can learn us more&#xD;
      about the pathogenesis of this disease. This knowledge could be used to investigate new&#xD;
      treatment options for Invasive Aspergillosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that airway microbial (viral, bacterial) presence&#xD;
      and exhaled molecular profiles as obtained from patients with prolonged neutropenia due to&#xD;
      treatment of hematological malignancies, are different between patients who develop IA and&#xD;
      patients who do not.&#xD;

      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the exhaled molecular profiles (GC-MS and eNose) between neutropenic patients&#xD;
           who develop IA and neutropenic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether exhaled molecular profiles can serve as surrogate to predict IA&#xD;
           at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the alterations in the viral/bacterial microbial profiles during the&#xD;
           neutropenic episode between patients who develop IA and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the relationship between microbial and molecular profiles in order to&#xD;
           generate mechanistic hypotheses.&#xD;
