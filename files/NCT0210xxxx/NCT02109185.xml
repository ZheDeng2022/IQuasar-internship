  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the safety and efficacy of a generic mometasone nasal spray to the&#xD;
      reference listed drugs in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Additionally both the&#xD;
      test and the reference formulations will be tested for superiority against a placebo nasal&#xD;
      spray.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and superiority of generic mometasone nasal&#xD;
      spray to reference products and to placebo in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
      This protocol describes randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4- treatment group&#xD;
      parallel study of 14 days duration preceded by a single blind 7-day placebo run-in period to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical equivalence of Mylan's Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate Nasal Spray,&#xD;
      50 ug per actuation to Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme's (MSD) Nasonex® Nasal Spray, 50 ug per actuation&#xD;
      or MSD EU's Nasonex® Nasal Spray Suspension, 50 ug per actuation. In addition, the&#xD;
      superiority of the test and reference products to placebo will be assessed. Prior to&#xD;
      randomization to one of 4 study groups, each subject will have a 7-day placebo run-in period.&#xD;
      Each subject will then receive one of the following treatments: Mylan's Mometasone Furoate&#xD;
      Nasal Spray 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-US Nasonex® Nasal Spray&#xD;
      50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); Merck-EU's Nasonex® and Nasal Spray&#xD;
      Suspension 50 μg/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day); or Mylan's Placebo Nasal Spray&#xD;
      50 μL/actuation (2 actuations per nostril per day). Active treatment is for 14 days duration.&#xD;
      Reflective total nasal scores (rTNSS) will be collected every 12 hours for 21 days.&#xD;
