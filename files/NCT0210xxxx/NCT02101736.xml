      This study, &quot;A Phase II Study of Cabozantinib (XL l84) for Plexiform Neurofibromas in&#xD;
      Subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type I in Children and Adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and have a type of tumor called a plexiform neurofibroma (PN).&#xD;
      Neurofibromas are tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover the nerves.&#xD;
      Plexiform neurofibromas can be disfiguring, painful, and life-threatening. These types of&#xD;
      tumors typically do not respond well to most treatment approaches such as chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiation, and surgery because of their slow growth and location near vital structures of the&#xD;
      body such as nerves, blood vessels, and the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the response rate of NFI patients with plexiform&#xD;
      neurofibromas treated with Cabozantinib therapy using MRI scans. The objective response rate&#xD;
      to cabozantinib is defined as ≥ 20% reduction in tumor volume at the end of 12 cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two cohorts: Cohort A is for patients ≥ 16 years of age and Cohort B is for&#xD;
      patients 3 - 15 years of age. Cohort A is closed to enrollment but this study will open to&#xD;
      Cohort B patients. This phase II open label study will evaluate adults and children with&#xD;
      NF1and plexiform neurofibromas treated with cabozantinib (XL184). This study will enroll&#xD;
      subjects who either meet clinical diagnostic criteria or have an identified pathogenetic NF1&#xD;
      mutation. Subjects on study must have clinically significant plexiform neurofibroma defined&#xD;
      as potentially life-threatening, impinging on vital structures or significantly impairing the&#xD;
      quality of life from pain or other symptoms. Patients must not have lesions suspicious for&#xD;
      malignant tumors such as MPNSTs (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors) and suspicious&#xD;
      tumors must be proven negative by histopathology prior to enrollment on study. Since Cohort A&#xD;
      is closed to accrual, this study will be open to Cohort B, patients 3 - 15 years of age that&#xD;
      meet eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort A, the study will be a Simon two-stage study design. It will be a single-arm&#xD;
      open-label study of cabozantinib and the primary endpoint is the ORR to cabozantinib at 1&#xD;
      year. In the first stage, 9 evaluable subjects will be accrued. If there is at least 1&#xD;
      response, accrual will continue to the second stage and an additional 8 evaluable subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. To allow for 25% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 24 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Radiographic response will be evaluated as the primary endpoint with 20% volumetric&#xD;
      MRI response of the target lesion being the threshold criteria for tumor response. A target&#xD;
      lesion will be selected at time of enrollment and tumor evaluations will occur serially while&#xD;
      on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort B, a minimum of 17 evaluable subjects will be enrolled. To allow for up to 25%&#xD;
      unevaluable subjects, a minimum of 24 subjects will be enrolled. Based on preliminary&#xD;
      response data and minimal toxicity in Cohort A, a 2-stage design is not felt to be necessary&#xD;
      for Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort A, all subjects will start cabozantinib at 40 mg. The published MTD for&#xD;
      Cabozantinib is 140 mg and the current recommended dose in Phase 3 clinical trials for&#xD;
      subjects with medullary thyroid cancer is 100 mg. Doses of 40 mg and 60 mg continue to show&#xD;
      efficacy in on-going phase 2 and phase 3 trials with reduced toxicity. Subjects who tolerate&#xD;
      40 mg for 2 cycles will escalate to 60 mg. The rationale for this is that the majority of&#xD;
      subjects who develop toxicity do so after &gt;2 weeks on drug as cabozantinib has a long&#xD;
      half-life. Subjects who experience dose-limiting toxicity at 40 mg will dose reduce to 20 mg&#xD;
      when their toxicities resolve. Subjects without toxicity at 40mg will increase to 60mg.&#xD;
      Subjects who experience toxicity at 60 mg will dose reduce to 40 mg. This dosing schema is&#xD;
      designed to maximize safety and tolerability in this new population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort B, subjects will start at 30 mg/m2/day dosing. Dose will be escalated at cycle 3 if&#xD;
      tolerated to 40 mg/m2. Subjects who experience DLT at 40 mg/m2/day will dose reduce to 30&#xD;
      mg/m2/day. Subjects who experience DLT at 30 mg/m2/day will dose reduce to 23 mg/m2day.&#xD;
      Actual dosing will be based on the dosing nomogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will be continuous, with 28 days defined as a cycle and each cycle reporting period is&#xD;
      day 1 to day 28. In the absence of progressive disease or dose limiting toxicity (DLT),&#xD;
      subjects may continue on therapy for a total of 12 total cycles. Subjects who have a&#xD;
      radiographic response (20% or greater reduction in tumor volume) on therapy at the end of 12&#xD;
      cycles can continue on therapy for up to an additional year. The maximum duration for&#xD;
      treatment under this study design is 24 cycles. However, subjects who do not achieve at least&#xD;
      15% reduction in index tumor volume after 8 cycles (~8 months) will be considered treatment&#xD;
      failures and taken off study. Subjects entered on the trial will be carefully monitored for&#xD;
      the development of cabozantinib associated toxicities, and target modifications and&#xD;
      interruptions will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedures and treatment&#xD;
      involved, the risks, discomforts, and benefits, and potential alternatives therapies will be&#xD;
      carefully explained to the subject and/or subject's parent(s) or guardian, if subject is a&#xD;
      child,by the site Principal Investigator or designated associate investigator. When&#xD;
      appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions. A signed informed&#xD;
      consent document will be obtained prior to determining eligibility and entry criteria to this&#xD;
      trial. Subjects entered on this trial will be treated with therapeutic intent and response to&#xD;
      therapy will be closely monitored. This protocol involves greater than minimal risk but&#xD;
      presents the potential for direct benefit to individual subjects&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Completion of health-related questionnaires on quality of life, pain assessment, and PN&#xD;
           symptom checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood draws ( 2 tablespoons) to evaluate the tumor's response to treatment and&#xD;
           the action of cabozantinib in the body over a period of time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Calls will be made at the end of cycles 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23 to assess drug&#xD;
      compliance and toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol PI and clinical coordinator will review the subject eligibility, study progress,&#xD;
      safety issues, protocol deviations and adverse events. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
      and a medical monitor has been established for the purpose of ensuring data compliance and&#xD;
      regular monitoring of this trial. The medical monitor is a qualified physician and is not&#xD;
      associated with this particular protocol. The medical monitor is specifically required to&#xD;
      review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse&#xD;
      events and deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early stopping rule will be invoked for both cohorts to potentially prevent accrual of&#xD;
      subjects onto the study in the event that Cabozantinib is associated with a higher than&#xD;
      acceptable rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) requiring removal from study (set at 10% or&#xD;
      higher) during the first 2 cycles. Toxicity will be continuously monitored. If at any time &gt;2&#xD;
      of the first 10 subjects or 4 or more of the first 15 total subjects are removed for DLT,&#xD;
      then accrual will be stopped until the DSMB reviews safety and efficacy data for the study&#xD;
      and recommends termination or despite the DLT (because of the benefit:risk assessment or&#xD;
      other reasoning) recommends reopening recruitment. Boundaries for DSMB for consideration of&#xD;
      terminating each cohort (both cohort A and B) would be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this trial is based on the safety and feasibility factors. The data&#xD;
      needed is based on risk versus benefit. For feasibility, we expect at least efficacy of a 25%&#xD;
      response rate. For safety reasons, subjects who do not achieve at least a 15% reduction in&#xD;
      tumor volume will not be continued beyond 8 courses, as the likelihood of achieving a&#xD;
      response (20% reduction in tumor volume) by 12 months is minimal. These subjects will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the trial and counted in an &quot;Intent to Treat&quot; analysis as evaluable and as&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses for outcome results will be based on evaluable subjects. Definitions of&#xD;
      evaluable include: 1.) Evaluation for toxicity (subject who received at least one dose of&#xD;
      study drug and removed from treatment for toxicity are evaluable. Any subject who completed&#xD;
      one full cycle of therapy is evaluable for toxicity); 2.)Evaluation for response (subjects&#xD;
      who have completed at least two cycles of therapy and have had their first follow-up MRI&#xD;
      evaluation. Subjects who did not respond and are later found to have a target tumor other&#xD;
      than a plexiform neurofibroma (e.g. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) are not&#xD;
      evaluable for response).&#xD;
