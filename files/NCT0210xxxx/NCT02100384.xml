    <textblock>
      Nowadays, dental implants are a very attractive and affordable treatment option for patients.&#xD;
      According to the American Society of Implant Dentistry the dental implant market in the U.S&#xD;
      is projected to reach $1.3 billion by 20101. Despite the high success rates of dental&#xD;
      implants, it is clear that osseointegrated implants are susceptible to diseases. The&#xD;
      prevalence of dental implant complications are rising as the number of individuals that are&#xD;
      receiving implant treatment is also increasing. One of these peri-implant complications is an&#xD;
      inflammatory condition known as peri-implant mucositis that occurs in 64.6% to 80% of the&#xD;
      implant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of preventive maintenance therapy in subjects with peri-implant mucositis is&#xD;
      associated with a high incidence of peri-implantitis, which eventually may lead to implant&#xD;
      loss. One important method in the prevention of peri-implant mucositis is the reduction in&#xD;
      plaque accumulation, through individual oral hygiene procedures and regular peri-implant&#xD;
      professional maintenance. It is highly important that patients be educated about the&#xD;
      importance of developing good oral hygiene habits and to attend regular periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance appointments. The clinicians have to recognize the significance of monitoring and&#xD;
      maintaining peri-implant health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is unclear which of the different maintenance regimens and treatments&#xD;
      strategies for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are more effective. There is lack&#xD;
      of information about which peri-implant maintenance protocol offers the best outcome in terms&#xD;
      of reduction of inflammation and improved patient comfort. According to Grusovin et al,&#xD;
      &quot;there is only low quality evidence for which are the most effective interventions for&#xD;
      maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues and there is no reliable&#xD;
      evidence as to which regimens are most effective for long term maintenance&quot;. Moreover,&#xD;
      current approaches to implant maintenance are somewhat haphazard and not standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that what is appropriate for teeth is also beneficial for implants; as stated&#xD;
      by Persson et al, 2010 &quot;therapies proposed for the management of peri-implant diseases are&#xD;
      currently based on the evidence available from the treatment of periodontitis&quot;. Two&#xD;
      conventionally used methods of biofilm and calculus removal from teeth in North America are&#xD;
      hand instruments (curettes and scalers) and ultrasonics. In teeth these two modalities of&#xD;
      treatment have been studied extensively; conversely, there are fewer studies on dental&#xD;
      implants. Renvert et al, 2008 concluded that mechanical non-surgical treatment might be&#xD;
      effective to treat peri-implant mucositis but not peri-implantitis; however, the data&#xD;
      supporting this literature review was scarce. The same research group compared ultrasonic&#xD;
      instrumentation with specific-implant tips to titanium curettes in the treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis founding no group differences in the treatment outcomes with improvements in&#xD;
      plaque and bleeding scores but no effects on probing depths. In addition, both methods failed&#xD;
      to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts and no group differences were found in the ability to&#xD;
      reduce the microbiota in a six months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main concerns for dental implants is that metal scalers and ultrasonics generate a&#xD;
      roughened surface on the implant, which in turn facilitates plaque accumulation and therefore&#xD;
      makes maintenance of plaque free surfaces more difficult. It was observed in a recent study&#xD;
      that special coated scalers and ultrasonic tips have been shown in vitro to be compatible&#xD;
      with implant surfaces, however this has not been confirmed in vivo. The previous finding is&#xD;
      in agreement with a current study, which demonstrated that the roughness values of the&#xD;
      titanium surface of implants treated with piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers with a newly&#xD;
      developed metallic tip and plastic hand curettes, are equal to the surface's roughness of&#xD;
      untreated implants. Mann et al, 2012 showed in an in vitro study that plastic-coated scalers&#xD;
      cause minimal damage to the implant surface but leave plastic deposits behind on the implant&#xD;
      surface, suggesting further research is needed to evaluate the use of such plastic tips in&#xD;
      the debridement of implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional factor, in evaluating the efficacy of different instrumentation in peri-implant&#xD;
      maintenance, which needs to be taken into consideration, is patient perception. There is&#xD;
      currently no data evaluating patient perception of comfort in regards to hand vs. ultrasonic&#xD;
      instrumentation. This information is very important because should both methods of&#xD;
      debridement be considered of equal efficacy, patient preference may play a role in the&#xD;
      practitioner's selection of instrumentation. Knowing that patient comfort will increase the&#xD;
      patient's compliance to the maintenance therapy, further evaluation of this factor is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;

      Long term comparison of ultrasonic and hand instrumentation in the maintenance of&#xD;
      peri-implant tissues: A randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the clinical effects, presence of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, and the patients' perceived discomfort by comparing titanium scalers to ultrasonic&#xD;
      instrumentation using implant inserts in a patient population with healthy peri-implant&#xD;
      tissues and implants with peri-implant mucositis during a one-year period of peri-implant&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are insufficient studies in the literature to guide the clinician which technique will&#xD;
      offer better results in maintaining health or in decreasing inflammation long term around&#xD;
      dental implants during peri-implant maintenance. It is postulated in this study that (1)&#xD;
      peri-implant therapy will have a beneficial clinical effect, will decrease the presence of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines and will be well tolerated by the patient population and that (2)&#xD;
      there will be no differences in the outcomes between the two peri-implant maintenance&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous approval by the Biomedical Research Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial will be conducted between May, 2014 and May, 2015 at the&#xD;
      Periodontics Clinic of the University of Manitoba. The Oral Biology Laboratory of the&#xD;
      University of Manitoba will perform the analysis of samples of the peri-implant crevicular&#xD;
      fluid. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, CONSORT Statement will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      66 participants with at least one single dental implant will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two peri-implant maintenance groups. Subjects enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be regular patients of the Periodontics Graduated Clinic at the University of Manitoba,&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry. Each participant will sign a written informed consent. The&#xD;
      randomization will be computer-generated by a second person not involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 352 sites (6sites/implant) will be studied. Cohen effect size has been used to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size. Small to medium effect size ranges by Cohen: 0.2mm to 0.5mm. In&#xD;
      addition, independent t-test with alpha=0.05, power (1-beta) =80%, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      and two tailed test. Allocation ratio, n1/n2=1. G*Power 3.1.7 software was used in sample&#xD;
      size calculation. An attrition rate of 6 participants was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A code will be assigned to each participant. Only the research coordinator will have access&#xD;
      to the patients/codes matching list and its corresponding therapy. The peri-implant&#xD;
      maintenance will be performed by two experienced Dental Hygienists previous intra and&#xD;
      inter-examiner calibration. A single blinded calibrated examiner (MC) will do the recording&#xD;
      of clinical findings and sampling at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the inclusion criteria: (1) subjects having at least one single unit dental&#xD;
      implant (2) probing depths no more than 5mm in 6 aspects around each implant (MB, B, DB, ML,&#xD;
      L and DL), (3) no bone loss beyond 2mm/implant at baseline confirmed with periapical&#xD;
      radiographs with a cone paralleling technique. The next criteria will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study: (1) implant supported removable prostheses, (2) use of antibiotics within the&#xD;
      preceding 3 months (3) smokers (4) missing exam at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to be assessed at 6 sites/implant are the following: (1) Modified plaque index&#xD;
      by Mombelli (2) Modified gingival index by Mombelli, (3) probing depths (PD), (4) presence of&#xD;
      keratinized gingiva (0, 0.5-1.5mm, 2 or greater), (5) recession (REC) distance between&#xD;
      gingival margin and most occlusal point of restoration, (6) Cytokine levels in peri-implant&#xD;
      crevicular fluid, 1 sample from the deepest site of implant(s) will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, patients will also be asked to fill in a pain questionnaire&#xD;
      at the end of the study period (Visual analogue scale, VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect the peri-implant crevicular fluid, the site will be isolated from saliva using&#xD;
      cotton rolls and drying before the sampling. Periopaper strips (Oraflow) will be introduced&#xD;
      at the deepest site of the implant sulcus for 30 sec. The volume of peri-implant crevicular&#xD;
      fluid will be measured using a Periotron. Until further analysis strips will be store at -80C&#xD;
      in sealed plastic tubes previously identified with a code corresponding to the name of the&#xD;
      patient. Pro-inflammatory/pleiotropic cytokines, which are found during inflammatory&#xD;
      processes at cellular level will be assess. The fluorescence based multiplex protein&#xD;
      quantification system (BioPlex, BioRad, Hercules CA, USA) will be used to measure the&#xD;
      following eight cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to review and sign a written consent form. Only individuals&#xD;
      involved in this study will have access to the data collected during the study. The records&#xD;
      for each patient will be assigned with a unique number and will be stored by the principal&#xD;
      investigator at her desk within the clinic premises. The master sheet linking the patient&#xD;
      identifiers to the unique number will be stored in a safe in the clinic administrative&#xD;
      office. In case of possible continuation of line of investigation, the data could be compared&#xD;
      with new data (introduction of air abrasive). The master sheet and patient records will be&#xD;
      shredded at the end of 4-5 years. To thank them for their participation in the study they&#xD;
      will receive a free maintenance appointment at the end of the study (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is relevant because there is currently no long term in vivo studies that determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of peri-implant maintenance and also the possible differences and/or&#xD;
      similar outcomes between curettes and ultrasonics in the peri-implant maintenance protocol.&#xD;
