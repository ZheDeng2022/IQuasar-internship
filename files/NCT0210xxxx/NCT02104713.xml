  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety of allogeneic stem cell therapy from healthy donors, for&#xD;
      2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), at four different&#xD;
      dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will take place every 1 to 4 weeks intervals until wound closure, and&#xD;
      then monthly for 6 months following the last administration of MSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the safety and dose-response analysis in Phase 1 is completed, an expanded trial will be&#xD;
      initiated to better examine the efficacy of MSC therapy in 2nd degree burn wounds. Phase 1&#xD;
      will establish the maximum safe dose that will be used in the Phase II trial.&#xD;
