      This study's objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively examine changes in brain network activation (BNA™) from baseline to&#xD;
           recovery (i.e., return to activity) in youth and adolescent athletes with concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical utility of changes in BNA to assist in clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate normative BNA data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing&#xD;
      changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which&#xD;
      are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions&#xD;
      of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both&#xD;
      a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal&#xD;
      information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by&#xD;
      using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is&#xD;
      improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological&#xD;
      knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA™) to&#xD;
      temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the&#xD;
      BNA™ test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain&#xD;
      functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.&#xD;
