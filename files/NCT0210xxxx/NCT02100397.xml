  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteric fever is responsible for over 20 million illnesses and 200,000 deaths each year. S.&#xD;
      Paratyphi A accounts for a substantial and increasing proportion of these cases, as high as&#xD;
      90% in some regions of Asia. There are currently no vaccines directed against S. Paratyphi A,&#xD;
      although there some candidates in preclinical and phase 1 trials. This study is funded by the&#xD;
      European Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Paratyphoid is a&#xD;
      human-restricted infection, for which there are currently no small animal models available.&#xD;
      In order to further our understanding of the host-pathogen interactions, this study will&#xD;
      develop a novel human challenge model in which to investigate this infection, using a recent&#xD;
      successful typhoid challenge model as its template.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects to ingest a dose of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, strain NVGH308,&#xD;
      after drinking a bicarbonate buffer. Intensive follow up over 14 days will establish whether&#xD;
      each participant meets clearly defined criteria for diagnosis of paratyphoid infection.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed on this outcome will determine if it consistently&#xD;
      gives an attack rate of 60 to 75%. If this is not reached with the first cohort of 20&#xD;
      participants, the dose will be escalated and the process repeated. A maximum of 80&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. Total follow up will be over the course of one year.&#xD;
      Descriptive clinical and laboratory data collected from participant observations, samples of&#xD;
      blood, faeces, urine and saliva will allow insights into the disease and the host response.&#xD;
      These insights will forward our knowledge of paratyphoid disease and may help discover or&#xD;
      develop diagnostic methods.&#xD;

      These insights will forward our knowledge of paratyphoid disease and may help discover or&#xD;
      develop diagnostic methods. Anticipating the development of a successful live challenge model&#xD;
      through this study, there will be the possibility of evaluating novel paratyphoid vaccines&#xD;
      that are currently in early clinical phase testing. This serves an important function because&#xD;
      field trials in endemic areas are expensive and time consuming. Speeding up this process&#xD;
      using our model will be of great benefit to endemic areas.&#xD;
