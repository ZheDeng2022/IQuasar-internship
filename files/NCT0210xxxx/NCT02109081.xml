  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is commonly observed in elderly patients in the postanesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU) and during the first 2-3 days following surgical procedures. This is an important&#xD;
      clinical problem in the geriatric surgical patient; morbidity and mortality rates are&#xD;
      significantly higher in patients who develop delirium. At the present time, the etiology of&#xD;
      delirium has not been precisely defined. However, studies suggest that inflammation related&#xD;
      to the surgical stress response is an important contributing factor in inducing&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and subsequent cognitive dysfunction and delirium. Therefore it is possible&#xD;
      that agents which attenuate perioperative inflammation may reduce the risk of the development&#xD;
      of delirium following surgery. Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that is used by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists primarily as an antiemetic agent. Small doses of dexamethasone have also&#xD;
      been demonstrated to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory markers after surgery.&#xD;
      The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids have the potential to beneficially impact&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and the risk of developing postoperative delirium. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, double-blinded investigation is to determine if dexamethasone,&#xD;
      administered at induction of anesthesia, can decrease the incidence of delirium at the time&#xD;
      of discharge from the PACU and during the first 2 days following surgery.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical investigation.&#xD;
      Four hundred patients scheduled for surgical procedures under general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be randomized via a computerized randomization table to one of two&#xD;
      groups; a dexamethasone group (10 mg of dexamethasone in a 5 cc syringe) or a control group&#xD;
      (an equal volume of saline in a 5 cc syringe)). A dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone was&#xD;
      selected, as this reflects a dose that has been demonstrated to attenuate the inflammatory&#xD;
      response to surgery, decrease pain, and improve clinical recovery. This is also within the&#xD;
      dose range commonly used at NorthShore University HealthSystem. The drug/placebo solution&#xD;
      will be prepared by the pharmacy into the syringes. Both solutions are clear and appear&#xD;
      identical. Study syringes will be prepared by the pharmacy, and all clinicians will be&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment. At the induction of anesthesia, the syringe containing either&#xD;
      dexamethasone or saline will be administered. The administration of all other anesthetic&#xD;
      agents will be standardized and reflect the usual practices of anesthesiologists at&#xD;
      NorthShore University HealthSystem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will consist of standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors, which&#xD;
      include manual blood pressure measurements, continuous EKG monitoring, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      capnography and infrared gas analysis. Additional monitoring, such as direct radial artery&#xD;
      pressure measurements, will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
      Anesthetic induction will consist of propofol 0.5-2.0 mg/kg, fentanyl 50-100 μg, and&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 0.5-3.0%, with the&#xD;
      concentration of inhalational agent adjusted to maintain blood pressure within 20-30% of&#xD;
      baseline values and depth of anesthesia standardized using a BIS monitor (BIS values 40-60).&#xD;
      Additional doses of fentanyl, up to 1-2 µg/kg/hour, can be administered at the discretion of&#xD;
      the anesthesia care provider. Hydromorphone may be provided for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
      Hypotension (any decrease in mean arterial pressure ≥ 20%) will be treated with a fluid&#xD;
      bolus, phenylephrine, or ephedrine, as clinically indicated. Thirty minutes before the&#xD;
      anticipated conclusion of the surgical procedure, patients will receive ondansetron 4 mg.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be managed according to standard PACU protocols. Nausea and vomiting will be&#xD;
      treated per standard protocols. Any episodes of nausea and vomiting in the PACU will be noted&#xD;
      on a data collection sheet. Pain will be treated with hydromorphone. Pain scores in the PACU,&#xD;
      as well as total doses of hydromorphone will be recorded. Patients will be discharged from&#xD;
      the PACU when standard criteria are met. Study subjects will be discharged either to the&#xD;
      surgical floor or the intensive care unit (ICU). The times to meet discharge criteria and&#xD;
      actually achieve discharge will be recorded. For patients transferred directly to the ICU&#xD;
      from the operating room, nausea, vomiting, pain scores, and analgesic requirements will be&#xD;
      collected over the first 3 hours of recovery. Postoperatively, pain will be controlled with&#xD;
      intravenous doses of hydromorphone. Intravenous analgesia will be provided until patients are&#xD;
      able to resume oral intake, which usually occurs on the first or second postoperative day. At&#xD;
      this time, analgesic management will be transitioned to oral pain medication (typically&#xD;
      hydrocodone 5 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg). Total doses of intravenous and oral pain&#xD;
      medications will be recorded during the hospitalization. Postoperative pain scores will be&#xD;
      assessed at the same time testing for delirium is performed during the postoperative period.&#xD;
      A planned interim analysis will be performed when 200 patients are enrolled&#xD;
