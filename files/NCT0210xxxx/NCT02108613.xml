  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of men treated for prostate cancer will be offered hormone deprivation&#xD;
      therapy during their cancer experience. The secondary effects of this treatment can result in&#xD;
      osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and diminished sexual health. To&#xD;
      promote healthy lifestyle choices for couples and maintain their intimacy and emotional&#xD;
      health we propose the Living Well, an innovative program that combines nutrition, physical&#xD;
      activity, and sexual health initiatives in one integrated service. This project will be&#xD;
      piloted at the Vancouver Island Centre with an expected 100 patients over 1 year. Over a six&#xD;
      month period both the experimental and control groups will have access to a workbook&#xD;
      (designed for men with prostate cancer and on hormone deprivation therapy) and sexual health&#xD;
      counseling. The experimental group will also have access to an exercise and a nutritional&#xD;
      program and support by volunteers to keep motivated. Assessment will look at quality of life,&#xD;
      physical factors, and biomarkers associated with secondary disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The overarching goal of the Living Well project is to maintain or improve quality of&#xD;
           life for people with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and their&#xD;
           partners by providing the couples with the tools to promote confidence and motivation to&#xD;
           remain both physically and psychosocially healthy and intimate. The primary objective is&#xD;
           to determine the effect of our comprehensive community-based survivorship program on&#xD;
           psychosocial health of people with PCa on ADT and their partners. Secondarily we intend&#xD;
           to explore the impact of the program on biomarkers associated with the metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome often observed in men on ADT, the program's operational and perceived (by&#xD;
           patients and partners) impact of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The intervention group will show a larger magnitude of improvement on measures of&#xD;
                QOL, fatigue, and intimacy, ultimately leading to increased benefit when compared&#xD;
                to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. We believe through the engagement of peer volunteers that compliance and adherence&#xD;
                to positive lifestyle changes will be higher on the intervention group when&#xD;
                compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADT has offered people with prostate cancer (PCa) improved curative outcomes when&#xD;
           combined with local radiation therapy and has been fundamental in controlling disease&#xD;
           for those with a biochemical recurrence or metastatic disease. Due to its effectiveness,&#xD;
           ADT is offered to up to 50% of people with PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ADT reduces the occurrence of metastases by lowering testosterone levels. Unfortunately,&#xD;
           decreased testosterone can lead to hot flashes, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction,&#xD;
           depression, diminished muscle strength, reduced bone mineral density, increased fat&#xD;
           mass, and increased cholesterol levels. This conglomerate of secondary effects can lead&#xD;
           to osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. Poor lifestyle habits can&#xD;
           further aggravate these secondary effects of ADT therapy. Being overweight may increase&#xD;
           the risk of mortality from PCa. However, the increase in vascular disease and diabetes&#xD;
           seems to be more strongly correlated with death than the cancer itself. Those with&#xD;
           pre-existing cardiac problems and receiving ADT, have a 75% chance of dying from&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease rather than PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is growing evidence that healthy lifestyle practices that include a healthy diet&#xD;
           and regular physical activity can improve the overall prognosis of PCa patients and&#xD;
           diminish the negative effects of ADT. Many cancer survivors are motivated to seek&#xD;
           information about food choices and physical activity to improve their response to&#xD;
           treatment and quality of life. Recent research has shown that a preemptive educational&#xD;
           program built around a book, the &quot;Androgen Deprivation Therapy: An Essential Guide for&#xD;
           Prostate Cancer Patients and Their Loved Ones&quot;, or the &quot;Workbook&quot; for short, which&#xD;
           addresses all issues of life style management, can be effective in helping patients and&#xD;
           their families in overcoming the challenges of ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Workbook was created by a national team of PCa experts (the ADT Working Group) and&#xD;
           is endorsed by the Canadian Urological Association. The Workbook addresses the&#xD;
           well-established, physical and emotional adverse effects of ADT. Although not all ADT&#xD;
           side effects directly reduce a patient's survival, they may greatly impact a patient and&#xD;
           his partner's QoL. Important aspects explored in the Workbook include the psychosocial&#xD;
           effects of ADT, exercise needs, and the nutritional recommendations for men on ADT.&#xD;
           Previous research indicates that the effectiveness of the Workbook is enhanced when&#xD;
           distributed to patients prior to the start of ADT, before side effects manifest. The&#xD;
           Workbook's effectiveness is also enhanced when combined with motivational sessions led&#xD;
           by trained educators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given that people with PCa on ADT and their partners generally struggle with aspects of&#xD;
           their sexual health, nutrition, and physical activity concurrently, we propose for the&#xD;
           first time to test a comprehensive PCa survivorship approach, the Living Well program,&#xD;
           which addresses concerns related to all three components. This is a community-based&#xD;
           program designed for PCa patients prior to starting on ADT and will also be extended to&#xD;
           their partners. The program will make extensive use of the ADT Workbook and will be&#xD;
           primarily delivered using existing resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome is&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Intimacy&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will also explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effects on biomarkers associated with the metabolic syndrome secondary to ADT *&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effects on erectile dysfunction, PSA and testosterone levels*&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The perceptions of patients and partners about the impact of the program on their&#xD;
                psychosocial health&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Operational impact&#xD;
&#xD;
           Note: *Patient's health records will be checked to obtain annual blood measures of&#xD;
           cholesterol, glucose, lipoprotein, PSA, testosterone levels and for responses to the&#xD;
           Sexual Health Inventory for Men - SHIM, all part of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We propose a prospective randomized control trial. Over twelve months, a sample of 100&#xD;
           English-speaking people, who are scheduled to start androgen deprivation therapy or have&#xD;
           started within the last 7 days for prostate cancer at will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
           Every two consented participants (and their partners if available) will be randomized.&#xD;
           Therefore, one patient/partner will receive the intervention and one is placed in the&#xD;
           control group. Both arms will receive the workbook and sexual counseling. The&#xD;
           experimental group will also have access to an exercise and a nutrition program, with&#xD;
           all three components supported by peer volunteers. Over the course of one month we&#xD;
           predict eight patient/partners will be consented (four control, four intervention).&#xD;
           Every four participants (and their partners if available) randomized to the intervention&#xD;
           will form a group that will proceed through the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential participants will be identified and invited by physicians. The Research Intern&#xD;
           will consent participants. After consenting the participant will be instructed to bring&#xD;
           their signed PAR-Q+ (24, 25) and consent form to the Introductory Meeting at the&#xD;
           Prostate Centre. The research intern will also access participant's medical records to&#xD;
           collect demographic information (cancer stage and treatment, co-morbidities, age) before&#xD;
           they start the program.Participant's partners will also be invited to participate in the&#xD;
           program The control group will attend the Introductory meeting and two sexual health&#xD;
           counseling sessions .The intervention group will attend the Introductory meeting, the&#xD;
           two sexual health meetings plus the exercise component (eight weekly exercise sessions)&#xD;
           and the nutrition component (four monthly nutrition sessions) over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
           A peer volunteer will be assigned to each intervention couple and will provide support&#xD;
           during the intervention to help maintain participant's adherence to physical activity&#xD;
           and healthy eating goals.Both intervention and control groups will provide measurements&#xD;
           at each sexual health session (body-mass index -BMI, waist circumference, grip strength,&#xD;
           blood pressure and heart rate) , describe their medical history and current medications.&#xD;
           Both groups will attend follow-up measurement sessions at 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
           baseline. Participants and their partners will fill out separate questionnaires at&#xD;
           baseline, 6 months and at the two follow-up measurement sessions Participants and their&#xD;
           partners will be interviewed at baseline, six, twelve, and twenty-four months.&#xD;
           Interviews will be conducted until saturation at baseline (expected n=10) and the same&#xD;
           couples will be interviewed again at the other time points. During these interviews&#xD;
           qualitative data will be collected and transcribed for analysis. Questions related to&#xD;
           their current physical activity experience, nutritional habits and barriers to&#xD;
           maintaining a healthy diet and regular physical activity routine will be asked. In&#xD;
           addition interviews with intervention participants will ask questions related to&#xD;
           participants' satisfaction with the timing, quality, relevance &amp; usefulness of topics&#xD;
           discussed during the physical activity and nutrition sessions, motivation provided by&#xD;
           instructors and peer volunteers and overall feedback about the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL)&#xD;
      will be used for the statistical analysis. Significance will be set at P = 0.05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] will be calculated for all&#xD;
      characteristics. Differences between groups will be examined using Mann-Whitney U-test or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test. A sample size calculation was based on the Quality of Life primary&#xD;
      outcome measured by the FACT-P questionnaire (36). Change in quality of life will be&#xD;
      determined by calculating change scores between different time-points. Considering mean score&#xD;
      difference of 5, at the 5% level (2-tailed) and 80% power, a sample size of 41 should yield&#xD;
      significant statistical differences. Based on our clinical and research experience with this&#xD;
      population, we estimate recruiting about 50 patients per group in 12 months. Qualitative data&#xD;
      will be systematically organized and sorted using ATLAS.ti 6.2 and analyzed through thematic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must be deemed ready to become more physically active, as determined by the PAR-Q+&#xD;
             and, if required, screened by a Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology Certified&#xD;
             Exercise Physiologist® (CSEP-CEP) or medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to attend the introductory meeting with the Prostate Centre&#xD;
             nurse (baseline measurement recordings), 8 weeks of supervised exercise, 4 monthly&#xD;
             nutrition meetings, two sexual health meetings (which includes measurement recording&#xD;
             sessions at 6 months), and follow up at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have access to a telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to commit to the full 6 month intervention period of the study (i.e. no&#xD;
             scheduled, extended absences) and follow up at 12 and 24 months. This does not&#xD;
             preclude any participants from withdrawing from the study at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have greater than 12 months life expectancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) or superficial bladder&#xD;
             cancer unless disease free for a minimum of 5 years [for example, carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the oral cavity is permissible]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous hormone therapy within the past 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who do not meet the following PAR-Q+(26, 27) criteria will be excluded&#xD;
             from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have a YES response to Q2 on pg1: Do you feel pain in your chest at rest,&#xD;

             clearance is provided by a CSEP-CEP . A CSEP-CEP will only provide clearance to a&#xD;
             positive response if upon further query it is determined that the participant is&#xD;
             asymptomatic and the benefits of light to moderate intensity exercise outweigh any&#xD;
             foreseeable health and injury risks. In such cases where the CSEP-CEP makes a&#xD;
             professional determination that the foreseeable risks may outweigh the benefits of&#xD;
             exercise or the participant does not know the necessary details of his or her own&#xD;
             medical condition, then the participant will need to obtain clearance via the&#xD;
