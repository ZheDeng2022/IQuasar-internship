  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cerebellum has been linked to cognitive and emotional functions and there is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that damage to posterior portions of the cerebellum can result in frontal-executive,&#xD;
      visuospatial, and verbal deficits, including dysprosodia, and affective changes including&#xD;
      blunting of affect or disinhibited and inappropriate behavior. Based on preliminary clinical&#xD;
      observations and tests performed in the investigator's clinic, disorders of emotional&#xD;
      communication may also be associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Emotional communication&#xD;
      includes the production and comprehension of facial and prosodic expressions and is critical&#xD;
      to maintaining positive and supportive relationships. Deficits in emotional communication can&#xD;
      have devastating effects on relationships and on quality of life for those affected. Although&#xD;
      deficits in affect and prosody have been reported in association with posterior cerebellar&#xD;
      disorders, there are currently no studies systematically investigating emotional&#xD;
      communication in individuals with cerebellar dysfunction. It is known that the cerebellum has&#xD;
      strong connections with the cerebral cortex, especially the frontal lobes, and that cortical&#xD;
      damage from stroke or neurodegenerative disease can result in disorders of emotional&#xD;
      communication. Impairments in the integrity of cerebellar-cerebral networks from cerebellar&#xD;
      disease may produce similar deficits in emotional communication. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to systematically investigate and describe deficits in emotional communication in a series of&#xD;
      patients with cerebellar disease. Participants will be individuals diagnosed with posterior&#xD;
      cerebellar degeneration or damage from a non-hemorrhagic infarction, and age-matched&#xD;
      neurologically healthy controls. Assessment will include a battery of tests of&#xD;
      neuropsychological function as well as tests of emotional communication. Comprehension of&#xD;
      emotional facial and prosodic expressions will be assessed as well as production of emotional&#xD;
      communication. The expected outcomes will be to identify and describe deficits in production&#xD;
      and comprehension of emotional prosodic and facial expressions and to describe the&#xD;
      relationship between deficits in emotional communication and cerebellar atrophy with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging imaging (MRI) using voxel based morphometry (VBM).&#xD;

      The specific aims of this proposal will investigate the hypothesis that cerebellar damage is&#xD;
      associated with emotional communication deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether posterior cerebellar damage results in deficits in the production or&#xD;
           comprehension of emotional facial expressions and/or vocal prosodic expressions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether posterior cerebellar damage results in alterations in intensity of&#xD;
           reaction to emotionally evocative pictures or emotionally evocative words&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the relationship between performance on tests of emotional communication and&#xD;
           left versus right cerebellar atrophy with magnetic resonance imaging imaging (MRI) using&#xD;
           voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects (cerebellar and control) will be given the following testing in a single session&#xD;
      of lasting 3 to 3 and a half hours. Included will be tests to assess reading ability, naming&#xD;
      ability, several tests of memory, a test of ability to discriminate between faces, tests of&#xD;
      mental flexibility, and standardized questionnaires for depression, anxiety and emotional&#xD;
      empathy. The tests include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wechsler Test of Adult Reading&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Beck Depression Inventory - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Wisconsin Card Sorting test&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Toronto Alexithymia Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will also be given tests assessing emotional communication ability. Tests of&#xD;
      recognition and expression of emotional tones of voice and facial expression will be&#xD;
      performed. Expression of facial expressions and tones of voice will be video recorded so that&#xD;
      blinded raters can compare the accuracy and intensity of facial expressions and tones of&#xD;
      voice between the participants. Training for the raters will include familiarization with the&#xD;
      descriptions of features for each emotion with respect to changes in pitch, loudness, and&#xD;
      rate for prosody and changes in facial features for facial expression. Both intra- and&#xD;
      inter-judge reliability will be calculated for these blinded judges. To supplement this&#xD;
      perceptual analysis, the participant's responses will be recorded using VisiPitch IV&#xD;
      software, a clinical instrument that performs sound analyses and calculates the variation in&#xD;
      the range of fundamental frequency (i.e., pitch variation) across each sentence. The ability&#xD;
      to manipulate pitch to produce varying prosodic contours is the most salient acoustical&#xD;
      feature of affective prosody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also assess intensity ratings and descriptions of emotional pictures and words using&#xD;
      materials that have established rating norms. Participants will be shown a series of pictures&#xD;
      and asked to rate the emotional intensity of the picture. They will also be asked to give a&#xD;
      brief description of the picture. They will then be given a list of words, one at a time, and&#xD;
      asked to rate the emotional intensity of these words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the cerebellar participants will also be asked to participate in a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scan of the brain if the testing listed above shows deficits in understanding&#xD;
      or producing emotional facial expressions or tones of voice and if there are no reasons that&#xD;
      would prevent them from being able to enter a scanner (determined by a standard MRI screen&#xD;
      form). Healthy control participants may also be asked to participate in a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and if there are no reasons that would prevent them from&#xD;
      being able to enter a scanner. The imaging data will be used to investigate if there is a&#xD;
      relationship between our experimental subjects' performance on tests of emotional expression&#xD;
      and left versus right cerebellar atrophy-injury in the cerebellar lobules with MRI imaging&#xD;
      using a voxel based morphometry (VBM) approach. The same data from controls will be used for&#xD;
      comparison. Neuroimaging data collection will be done using a Philips Achieva 3T scanner&#xD;
      (Amsterdam, Netherlands) and a 32-channel SENSE head coil. Imaging collected will include&#xD;
      anatomical T1-weighted imaging scans. Structural MP-RAGE T1-weighted scans will be acquired&#xD;
      with 130-1.0 mm sagittal slices, FOV=240 mm (AP)-180 mm (FH), matrix= 256-192, TR= 9.90 ms,&#xD;
      TE= 4.60 ms, Flip Angle= 8, voxel size= 1.0x 0.94x 0.94 mm. Structural data will be analyzed&#xD;
      with FSL-VBM, an optimized VBM protocol carried out with FSL tools. First, structural images&#xD;
      will be brain-extracted and grey matter-segmented before being registered to the MNI 152&#xD;
      standard space using non-linear registration The resulting images will be averaged and&#xD;
      flipped along the x-axis to create a left-right symmetric, study-specific grey matter&#xD;
      template. Second, all native grey matter images will be non-linearly registered to this&#xD;
      study-specific template and &quot;modulated&quot; to correct for local expansion (or contraction) due&#xD;
      to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation. The modulated grey matter images&#xD;
      were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 6 mm. Finally, voxelwise&#xD;
      GLM will be applied using permutation-based non-parametric testing, correcting for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons across space.&#xD;
