    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      western countries. It has been shown that CVD events are known to be higher in the winter&#xD;
      than in the summer. Low environmental temperatures may induce increased cardiovascular stress&#xD;
      resulting in cold-induced hypertension (CIH), the leading risk factor for CVD events. Similar&#xD;
      to whole-body cold exposure, the cold pressor test (CPT), an external local cold stimulus,&#xD;
      has been used for evaluation of cardiovascular and hemodynamic reactivity to sympathetic&#xD;
      stimulation. It has been shown that brachial blood pressure (BP), pressure pulse wave&#xD;
      reflection, aortic BP, heart rate (HR), and arterial stiffness are increased during CPT.&#xD;
      However, the physiologic mechanisms for the cardiovascular complications related to low&#xD;
      temperatures are not completely clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric-handgrip (IHG) exercise has been used as a tool for assessing cardiovascular&#xD;
      autonomic control by a maneuver defined as post-exercise muscle ischemia (PEMI). PEMI induces&#xD;
      exercise pressor reflex (metaboreflex) by trapping metabolites in the previous active muscle&#xD;
      at the cessation of exercise. During PEMI, the accumulation of contraction-derived&#xD;
      metabolites induces sympathetic mediated vascular stimulation and an increased BP, whereas&#xD;
      the HR fully recovers. This suggests that the fall in HR is evoked by an increase in&#xD;
      parasympathetic activity which overpowers the sympathetic activation. Implication of IHG&#xD;
      exercise followed by PEMI provides important clinical information because impaired autonomic&#xD;
      and cardiovascular functions are associated with cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, oral supplementation with the amino acid L-citrulline (L-cit) has been proposed as&#xD;
      a possible adjunct treatment for hypertension and arterial stiffness. L-cit is known to&#xD;
      enhance the bioavailability of L-arginine (L-arg), the endothelial substrate for nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) production. Cold exposure might include a temperature-dependent inhibition of&#xD;
      endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), the enzyme that produces NO from the amino acid L-arg and may&#xD;
      trigger various types of CVD. It has been shown that L-cit supplementation has effectively&#xD;
      attenuated the CIH response during cold pressor test. Thus, L-cit supplementation may be&#xD;
      effective to reduce the cardiovascular responses associated with cold exposure and the&#xD;
      exercise pressor reflex imposed by PEMI. Therefore, the proposed study is important for the&#xD;
      following reasons: (1) the results of his study will add to our understanding regarding the&#xD;
      cardiovascular and autonomic mechanisms associated with exercise and cold exposure; (2) the&#xD;
      results of this study will contribute to the development of an adjunct therapy for the&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular adverse events that are particularly increased during stress&#xD;
      such as cold exposure and exercise.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To determine the acute effects of the exercise pressor response imposed by PEMI with&#xD;
      and without CPT on hemodynamics and cardiac autonomic regulation in health overweight/obese&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To examine the effects of a 14-day course of L-cit supplementation on arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, aortic hemodynamics, and autonomic regulation at rest and during conditions&#xD;
      characterized by increased sympathetic activity (IHG, PEMI, and PEMI concurrent with CPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: There will be greater increases in peripheral and central BP, arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, wave reflection, and cardiac sympathetic activity during PEMI concurrent with CPT&#xD;
      than during PEMI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: 14 days of L-cit supplementation will attenuate peripheral and central BP, wave&#xD;
      reflection, arterial stiffness, and cardiac sympathetic activity responses during IHG&#xD;
      exercise, PEMI, and PEMI concurrent with CPT compared with placebo (PL) supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of twenty male young adults (18-35 years) with overweight or obesity [body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) &gt;25 and &lt;40 kg/m2] will be enrolled in this study. All of the subjects will be&#xD;
      nonsmokers, no L-cit or L-arg users or regular exercisers (defined as more than 120 min per&#xD;
      week) at least 6 months before the study begins. Subjects will be asked to maintain their&#xD;
      diet and exercise habits during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of initial screening, cardiovascular and autonomic function of eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated in a quiet temperature-controlled room (22-24Â°C). After baseline&#xD;
      measurement, in a cross-over design fashion, subjects will be randomized to either Placebo&#xD;
      group (Maltodextrin) or L-citrulline group for the first 14 days of the study that will be&#xD;
      followed by a 14 day washout period and then will be crossed over to their next treatment.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular function will be evaluated at baseline and after 14 days of the first and the&#xD;
      second treatment. Measurements will be conducted in the morning after at least 8 hours of an&#xD;
      overnight fast in order to avoid potential diurnal variations in BP and vascular reactivity.&#xD;
