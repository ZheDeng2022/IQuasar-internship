      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare gene disease. People with VHL often have a brain&#xD;
      tumor called hemangioblastoma. Standard treatment for these tumors is risky surgery.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find new ways to treat people who have the tumors. They want to see if a&#xD;
      drug that fights other cancers might slow the growth of hemangioblastomas in some people with&#xD;
      VHL. Some people with VHL have mutations that make abnormal proteins. Tumors form in such&#xD;
      people because the abnormal protein is broken down quickly. The cancer drug may work in these&#xD;
      tumors by preventing breakdown of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the drug vorinostat affects hemangioblastomas in people with VHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 old with hemangioblastomas from VHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must already be in study 03-N-0164. They must have tumor surgery scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must stop taking most medications 14 days before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week before surgery, participants will enter the hospital. They will be screened&#xD;
           with medical history and physical and neurological exams. They will give blood and urine&#xD;
           samples. Participants will have an electrocardiogram. For this test, small sticky&#xD;
           patches are put on the arms, legs, and chest. Participants will lie still for a few&#xD;
           minutes while a machine records heart rate and rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take one vorinostat by mouth each day for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have blood drawn during the week to check for any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have their tumor removed in surgery. Researchers will study the tumor&#xD;
           tissue for the effects of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A nurse will call participants 1 month after surgery to check for side effects.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Nervous System (CNS) hemangioblastomas are the most common tumor found in the&#xD;
      familial neoplasia syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemangioblastomas cause significant morbidity and mortality. While surgical resection is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice for CNS hemangioblastomas, it is associated with morbidity and death.&#xD;
      There is a critical need for new non-invasive treatments of VHL-associated CNS&#xD;
      hemangioblastomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that is FDA-approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Vorinostat has been tested in other&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Recent data suggests that vorinostat may have a&#xD;
      potent therapeutic effect in the treatment of VHL-associated hemangioblastomas in patients&#xD;
      with missense germline mutations of the VHL gene. In most VHL mutation types, the abnormal&#xD;
      VHL protein content is not active, which leads to tumor formation and growth. In missense&#xD;
      mutation VHL disease, tumor cells contain a malformed VHL protein that is partially active.&#xD;
      However, the protein is degraded quickly by normal cellular mechanisms. Vorinostat prevents&#xD;
      degradation of a malformed protein within the tumors. Increased protein leads to slower&#xD;
      growth in these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether vorinostat reduces degradation of mutant VHL protein in VHL patients&#xD;
      with germline missense mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (age greater than or equal to 18 years) with a known germline missense VHL&#xD;
      gene mutation that require surgical resection of a hemangioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to conduct a pilot study with vorinostat in six patients with hemangioblastomas&#xD;
      causing significant symptoms from tumor growth. Vorinostat will be administered if the&#xD;
      patients are deemed surgical candidates. Patients will receive one (1) dose of 400 mg of&#xD;
      vorinostat daily for seven (7) days prior to surgery. On the day of surgery, the patients&#xD;
      will not receive vorinostat. Patients will undergo surgery as usual, with no change in&#xD;
      planning or technique of the procedure. The tumor specimens from surgery will be examined for&#xD;
      presence and quantity of mutant VHL protein. Comparisons for levels of mutant VHL protein&#xD;
      will be made with tissue banked from previous surgical resections under 03-N-0164.&#xD;
      Measurements of genetic expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and&#xD;
      erythropoietin (EPO) will also be performed on these specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The presence and quantity of mutant VHL protein in resected hemangioblastoma specimens,&#xD;
           including comparison of specimens without vorinostat treatment and those with&#xD;
           presurgical vorinostat treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of VEGF and EPO results from resected hemangioblastoma specimens, including&#xD;
           comparison of specimens without vorinostat treatment and those with presurgical&#xD;
           vorinostat treatment.&#xD;
