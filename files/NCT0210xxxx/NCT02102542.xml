      This observational study was designed to prove clinical efficacy of the well known&#xD;
      &quot;glycopyrrolate&quot; which is considered an orphan drug in Thailand. Since the medication has&#xD;
      never been officially used in Thai people and this particular brand &quot;Glyco-P&quot; which was made&#xD;
      in India has never been officially proven of its efficacy in Thai people. The study was aimed&#xD;
      to prove if this Glyco-P can modestly increase patient's heart rate, decrease secretion and&#xD;
      safely used in combination with neostigmine for reversal of non-depo muscle relaxant drugs.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Glycopyrrolate has been long used since it's first discovery in&#xD;
      19602. The medication is generally available in both oral and injectable form. The uses of&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate in anesthesia are mainly for reduction of salivation and secretion3, which&#xD;
      plays significant role when airway instrumentation required. The widespread uses of&#xD;
      neostigmine for reversal of muscle relaxant effects caused by non-depolarizing muscle&#xD;
      relaxant also mandate the co-administration of anti-muscarinic4,5,6. Without availability of&#xD;
      glycopyrrolate, atropine was used in Thailand, which results in excessive tachycardia and&#xD;
      salivation7,8,9. Glycopyrrolate can also be used when mild bradycardia is encountered but the&#xD;
      effects on heart rate is less dominant than atropine10,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycopyrrolate is considered an orphan drugs in Thailand. There was simply no availability&#xD;
      until recently. The local company named &quot;Masu&quot; has decided to market and import the drug from&#xD;
      India (Glyco-P®). The formulary has been approved by Thai Food and Drug Administration1. The&#xD;
      preparation has also been tested in laboratory by third party well-known pharmacy institute,&#xD;
      which proved the existence of an active ingredient. However, the uses of this medication&#xD;
      officially have not been made and the appropriate action is to obtain IRB approval at local&#xD;
      institution and consent the patients prior to drug administration. The appropriate record of&#xD;
      clinical effect should also been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the clinical efficacy of glycopyrrolate on heart rate, anti-sialagogue effects&#xD;
           and when used in conjunction with neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the timing, onset and duration of glycopyrrolate injection at different dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials, participants and study method The study requires&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 100 patients who scheduled to undergo procedure or operation that require anesthesia&#xD;
           service who meet criteria for the uses of glycopyrrolate which includes - requirement of&#xD;
           anti-sialogogue, mild bradycardia and in whom receiving neostigmine for reversal of&#xD;
           neuromuscular blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glyco-P injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitorings that capable of HR, BP measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Suctioning equipment with volumetric measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinician evaluating the effects of medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Timer Participants:- 100 adult male or female patients, over 18 year old who consent to&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria : Children &lt; 18 yo, pregnant or parturient of breast feeding patients,&#xD;
      patients who refused or unable to give consent, patients who has co-existing problems with&#xD;
      dry secretion i.e. Sjögren's syndrome, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, patient whom baseline&#xD;
      heart rate is &gt; 100 bpm Study method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient who meet inclusion criteria will be consent to receive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The medications will be administered only 1 of these criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To increase heart rate modestly&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For reduction of secretion or salivation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To co-administration with neostigmine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The medications will be given in the following fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Glyco-P 4 mcg/kg IV, repeatedly if no effects. Halt if HR &gt; 100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Glyco-P 0.2 mg per each mg of neostigmine used&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The clinical effects i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, amount of secretion removed will&#xD;
           be recorded along with timing of onset and offset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collected data will be analyzed by statistician with appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data or each participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose and indication of treatment of studied drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Timing of clinical effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Efficacy of reduction of saliva and secretion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study 3 months Benefit of the study Confirmation of clinical efficacy of this&#xD;
      Indian made glycopyrrolate - Glyco-P® in Thai patients.&#xD;
