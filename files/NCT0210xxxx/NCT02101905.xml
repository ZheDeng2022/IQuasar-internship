    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I clinical trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate before surgery works&#xD;
      in treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back after a period of time during&#xD;
      which the tumor could not be detected. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To achieve an intratumoral lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) concentration of at least 1.5&#xD;
      uM in at least 70% of patients 3 hours after the last dose of pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A)&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of pulsatile lapatinib (at pulsatile maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose [MTD]) on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation (using&#xD;
      Mesoscale Discovery enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] assay for total and&#xD;
      phospho-EGFR). (Group A and Reference Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To evaluate the safety profile of pulsatile lapatinib in pre-operative patients with EGFR&#xD;
      amplified recurrent high-grade glioma. (Group A and Reference Group) Ib. To evaluate acute&#xD;
      and late toxicities associated with pulsatile lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) II. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of lapatinib on tumor cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67&#xD;
      [KI-67] staining). (Group A compared to Reference Group) III. To determine the ex-vivo&#xD;
      sensitivity of tumor sphere cultures to lapatinib. (Group A and Reference Group) IV. To&#xD;
      assess tumor objective response rate (ORR). (Group A and Reference Group) V. To estimate&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). (Group A and Reference Group) VI. To estimate progression-free&#xD;
      survival. (Group A and Reference Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -2 to 0.&#xD;
      Within 3-5 hours after last dose of lapatinib ditosylate, patients undergo surgical resection&#xD;
      of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib&#xD;
      ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7 days. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REFERENCE GROUP: Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor on day 0. Within 30 days of&#xD;
      surgical resection of tumor, patients receive lapatinib ditosylate BID for 2 days every 7&#xD;
      days. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at 30 days, every 2 months&#xD;
      for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             chemical or biologic composition to lapatinib are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior therapy with EGFR inhibitors are ineligible because treatment with&#xD;
             EGFR kinase inhibitors or other EGFR-targeted agents has the potential to deplete the&#xD;
             tumor of EGFR-amplified or EGFR mutant cell populations and confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             lapatinib effects on EGFR phosphorylation; patients with prior EGFRvIII vaccine are&#xD;
             eligible if recurrent tumor is positive for EGFR gene amplification&#xD;

             that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lapatinib has potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacients effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             lapatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             lapatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on strong cytochrome P450, family&#xD;

          -  Patients who have acute or currently active/requiring anti-viral therapy hepatic or&#xD;
             biliary disease are ineligible (with the exception of patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases from the primary brain tumor, or&#xD;
             stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation if QTc is &gt;= 460&#xD;
