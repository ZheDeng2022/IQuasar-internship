      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of wild-type reovirus when combined&#xD;
      with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come&#xD;
      back following treatment (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as dexamethasone and carfilzomib, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. A virus called wild-type reovirus may be able to kill cancer&#xD;
      cells without damaging normal cells and seems to work best when given with chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Giving wild-type reovirus with chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment than&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety and tolerability, and define the maximum tolerated dose of pelareorep&#xD;
      (Reolysin), carfilzomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain evidence of reovirus entry into myeloma cells via localization of reoviral&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) in multiple myeloma (MM) cells (in situ hybridization [ISH]), and&#xD;
      active viral proliferation/replication via localization of reoviral capsid protein&#xD;
      (immunohistochemistry [IHC]) in MM cells in cycle 1 day 9 bone marrow biopsies in all&#xD;
      patients enrolled in dose escalation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary data on response as determined by International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
      criteria after protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain overall and progression free survival data for all treated patients. III. Assess&#xD;
      cytokine arrays of peripheral blood obtained on days 1, 2, 9, 15 and once during days 22-28&#xD;
      of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycle 2 and each successive cycle to obtain exploratory data&#xD;
      regarding inflammatory cytokine concentrations and their correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Investigate pretreatment cycle 1 days 1 and 9 bone marrow aspirate interferon (IFN)-beta&#xD;
      in MM cells as a potential marker of Reolysin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy markers to&#xD;
      explore their respective roles in MM cell death following combination Reolysin and&#xD;
      carfilzomib in patients treated in all dose escalation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate pretreatment cycle 1 days 1 and 9 peripheral blood to explore the antiviral&#xD;
      humoral response by measuring the production of neutralizing reoviral antibody (NARA) using a&#xD;
      functional killing assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Obtain cycle 1 day 1 pretreatment and 1 and 4 hours after treatment, and pretreatment&#xD;
      cycle 1 days 2 and 9 peripheral blood, and pretreatment cycle 1 days 1 and 9 bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate samples to investigate the role of carfilzomib in modulating the antiviral immune&#xD;
      mediated response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of Reolysin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV), carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes, and&#xD;
      Reolysin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
