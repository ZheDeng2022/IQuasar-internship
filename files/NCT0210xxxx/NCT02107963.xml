      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on&#xD;
      osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients&#xD;
      with refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise&#xD;
      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical&#xD;
      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase&#xD;
      dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the&#xD;
      genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established&#xD;
      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR&#xD;
      engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including&#xD;
      neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in&#xD;
           children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this&#xD;
           with antitumor effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in&#xD;
           non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to&#xD;
           anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate&#xD;
           clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor&#xD;
      (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and is&#xD;
      deemed incurable by standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used&#xD;
      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 10(6)&#xD;
      transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3 dose&#xD;
      escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the highest&#xD;
      dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60&#xD;
      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that&#xD;
      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36&#xD;
      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this&#xD;
      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
                  (a) Osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and melanoma that have been treated with standard&#xD;
                  frontline therapy and are judged to be incurable with standard therapy, based&#xD;
                  upon the fact that they are unresectable, metastatic, progressive/persistent or&#xD;
                  recurrent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Evaluable disease must be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i) For all histologies except osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma, pathologic review&#xD;
                  of frozen tissue must document GD2+ expression. Positive expression is defined as&#xD;
                  at least 2+ expression (0-4+ scale) in &gt;50 percent of the tumor cells using&#xD;
                  anti-GD2 mAb 14G2a. If adequate archived frozen tissue is available, this may be&#xD;
                  utilized, or if not, patients may undergo biopsy following enrollment to obtain&#xD;
                  tissue to assess GD2 expression, with the following restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ii) Patients with histologies other than osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma must have&#xD;
                  adequate accessible tumor for biopsy (at least 1 cm diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iii) Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates will be limited to&#xD;
                  percutaneous needle or core biopsies, thoracoscopic excision or open biopsies of&#xD;
                  readily accessible lesions. Pulmonary lesions may be biopsied but extensive&#xD;
                  surgery such as thoracotomy or laparotomy should not be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  iv) Patients who will require biopsy should not be enrolled if in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the principal investigator, the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk&#xD;
                  from the biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Weight greater than or equal to 15 kg&#xD;

&#xD;
                    2. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens. However,&#xD;
                       patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of prior&#xD;
                       chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to study enrollment. Any&#xD;
                       grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any previous therapy must have&#xD;
                       resolved to grade 2 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must not have received&#xD;
                       myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment (6 weeks if prior&#xD;

                  upper limit of normal. Patients with Gilbert s syndrome are excluded from the&#xD;
                  requirement of a normal bilirubin and patients will not be excluded if liver&#xD;
                  enzyme elevation is due to tumor involvement. (Gilbert s syndrome is found in&#xD;
                  3-10% of the general population, and is characterized by mild, chronic&#xD;
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or overt&#xD;
                  hemolysis). NOTE: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and&#xD;

        Female and male patients (and when relevant their partners) must be willing to practice&#xD;
        birth control (including abstinence) during and for two months after treatment, if of&#xD;
        childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent Illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
             Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or significant&#xD;
             cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             PI would compromise the patient s ability to tolerate protocol therapy or&#xD;
             significantly increase the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Peripheral nerve symptoms from prior therapies or from tumor compression &gt; grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Untreated CNS metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
             Extradural masses that have not invaded the brain parenchyma or parameningeal tumors&#xD;
             without evidence for leptomeningeal spread will not render the patient ineligible.&#xD;
             Patients with previous CNS tumor involvement that has been treated and is stable for&#xD;
             at least 6 weeks following completion of therapy are eligible.&#xD;
