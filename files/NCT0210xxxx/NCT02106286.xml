  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major determinant of perioperative mortality is the inability of the heart to increase its&#xD;
      output in response to surgical stress. This is termed perioperative cardiac failure (PCF),&#xD;
      and may only be apparent postoperatively when oxygen demand is increased. The risk of&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac complications is the summation of the individual patient's risk and&#xD;
      cardiac stress related to the surgical procedure1. The functional capacity of the patient&#xD;
      determines their ability to support the postoperative demand of increased oxygen consumption,&#xD;
      and therefore of cardiac output. Exercise capacity is one of the most powerful predictors of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and all cause mortality2. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is an&#xD;
      established investigation used, among other applications, in the preoperative assessment of&#xD;
      patient fitness for surgery3. CPET involves monitoring the electrocardiographic trace and the&#xD;
      exhaled gas mixture (particularly CO2, whose production depends on aerobic metabolism),&#xD;
      during incremental exercise (usually on an exercise bike), on room air. Several parameters&#xD;
      can be measured during CPET, including maximal systemic oxygen delivery, the anaerobic&#xD;
      threshold (the oxygen delivery value at which anaerobic metabolism begins), maximum workload,&#xD;
      and ST segment depression/elevation (as in a standard exercise tolerance test). The&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary &quot;performance&quot; during CPET has been correlated with postoperative outcome3.&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests will be performed in order to assess lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that therapy with beta-blockers in patients with ischaemic heart disease and&#xD;
      cardiac failure reduces perioperative morbidity and mortality4-7. However, beta blockers&#xD;
      reduce myocardial contractility and the heart rate response to adrenergic stimulation, thus&#xD;
      blunting the physiological response to stress/surgery/exercise. Whilst this mechanism may&#xD;
      protect the heart perioperatively, it may decrease the ability of some patients to withstand&#xD;
      other complications. This potential decrease in &quot;performance&quot; has never been quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no agreement on whether preoperative CPET should be performed on or off&#xD;
      beta-blockers and, at Aintree in particular, it is standard procedure to take patients off&#xD;
      beta-blockers prior to their CPET. Some argue that, as beta-blockade should be maintained in&#xD;
      the perioperative period, CPET should be performed on medications, even if these could mask&#xD;
      the presence significant ischaemic heart disease (a significant, modifiable, risk factor for&#xD;
      surgery by beta blockade), and even if it is not always possible to maintain beta-blockade&#xD;
      throughout the whole postoperative period. For these reasons, other clinicians prefer to&#xD;
      perform CPET off beta-blockers, thus, potentially, overestimating the perioperative&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory &quot;performance&quot;, which may be diminished once the medications are resumed.&#xD;
      Patients on long-term beta blockade may develop some tolerance to the medications, so the&#xD;
      effect of acute and chronic beta blockade on cardiorespiratory performance may also be&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To compare cardiopulmonary performances on and off beta blockers as objectively assessed&#xD;
      by cardiopulmonary exercise testing.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an interventional study investigating the effects of acute and chronic&#xD;
      beta-blockade on cardiorespiratory performance prior to elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 64 abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients under surveillance who will&#xD;
      undergo 2 cardiopulmonary exercise tests to investigate the effect of beta blockade on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary performance. This sample size is calculated by using a 2-tailed sample&#xD;
      t-test, with 90% power to detect an estimated increase of 10% in oxygen delivery (VO2) at&#xD;
      anaerobic threshold. We also estimated a drop-out rate of about 25% which is built into our&#xD;
      power calculation estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on long term beta blockade will be studied to investigate the effect of chronic beta&#xD;
      blocker use. They will undergo two CPETs, the first on beta blockers, the second after&#xD;
      discontinuing their beta blocker for at least 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not on beta blockers will be studied to investigate the effect of acute beta&#xD;
      blockade. They will undergo two CPETs, the first off medication, the second after&#xD;
      commencement of beta blockade (weight adjusted, started 48 hours prior to CPET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be provided with the patient information sheet in clinic, 1-2 weeks&#xD;
      prior to their initial CPET. They will be given at least 1 week to consider the study in&#xD;
      which the investigators will follow them up via a telephone call. Informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be obtained at their initial (standard care) CPET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting subjects will perform exercise using electro-magnetically braked equipment&#xD;
      during a ramped-incremental protocol in two different occasions. Prior to the tests full lung&#xD;
      function tests will be performed by body plethysmography. The exercise tests will be&#xD;
      performed with subjects wearing nose clips and breathing through a mouthpiece throughout the&#xD;
      test. The initial cycling workload will be zero but will progressively increase at a rate of&#xD;
      10-15 Watts/min. After a resting period of 30 seconds and 2 minutes warm up subjects will&#xD;
      stop when they can cycle no further. All gas exchange parameters will be measured and a&#xD;
      metabolic cart, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored at pre and post testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to score their perceived breathlessness and leg fatigue using&#xD;
      modified Borg scores every minute during exercise, and inspiratory capacity will be measured&#xD;
      every minute during the exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this test, they will be given a date for the 2nd CPET and a prescription for&#xD;
      oral bisoprolol once daily (dose adjusted to patients body weight), to be started 48 hours&#xD;
      prior to the test (two doses in total). Patients will be informed of potential side effects&#xD;
      of the medications at this visit. This will be weight adjusted with a specific dose as&#xD;
      follows: 1.25 mg if patent weighs 50-75 kg, 2.5 mg if 75-100 kg and 3.75 mg if &gt;100 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then attend for the 2nd CPET, following which bisoprolol will be discontinued&#xD;
      or continued based on clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are already chronically on a beta blocker, they will have their first CPET while&#xD;
      on medication, and then will be asked to stop the medication for a period of 48 hours before&#xD;
      the second CPET. It is standard procedure to take the patient off beta blockers prior to&#xD;
      their CPET at Aintree University Hospital. Patients will be informed of potential risks of&#xD;
      stopping their beta blocker at their first visit. The beta blocker will be restarted or&#xD;
      discontinued based on clinical indication after the second CPET.&#xD;
