      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia can be cured with transplant. Researchers want&#xD;
      to test a variation of transplant that uses low dose radiation and a combination of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs. They want to know if it helps a body to better accept donor stem&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if low dose radiation (300 rads), oral cyclophosphamide, pentostatin, and sirolimus&#xD;
      help a body to better accept donor stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People 4 and older with beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease that can be cured with&#xD;
      transplant, and their donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants and donors will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood&#xD;
           test, tissue and blood typing, and bone marrow sampling. They will visit a social&#xD;
           worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  may receive an intravenous (IV) tube in their groin vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will receive a drug injection daily for 5 or 6 days to move the blood stem cells from&#xD;
           the bone marrow into general blood circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will undergo apheresis: an IV is put into a vein in each arm. Blood is taken from one&#xD;
           arm, a machine removes the white blood cells that contain blood stem cells, and the rest&#xD;
           is returned through the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  may undergo red cell exchange procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will remain in the hospital for about 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will receive a large IV line that can stay in their body from transplant through&#xD;
           recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will receive a dose of radiation, and transplant related drugs by mouth or IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will receive blood stem cells over 8 hours by IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will take neuropsychological tests and may complete questionnaires throughout the&#xD;
           transplant process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  must stay near NIH for 4 months. They will visit the outpatient clinic weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will have 5 follow-up visits for 3 years after transplant, then annually.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our ongoing nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant protocol&#xD;
      (03-H-0170) for patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and B-thalassemia from&#xD;
      HLA-matched family donors has excellent results thus far. Our long term leukocyte engraftment&#xD;
      rate is 85-90% with the same disease-free survival. None of the engrafted patients had acute&#xD;
      sickle-related events, significant toxicity associated with the conditioning regimen, or any&#xD;
      evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these results rival the transplant outcomes from low risk transplant patients with&#xD;
      B-thalassemia, there are areas for improvement. The first is the 10-15% graft rejection rate,&#xD;
      where a majority of these individuals were male donor and female recipient pairs. Another&#xD;
      limitation is the significant delay in donor red cell engraftment in one recipient who had&#xD;
      pre-existing allo-antibody to donor red cells from previous transfusions. Also we have&#xD;
      excluded another group of individuals with preformed antibodies, recipients having major ABO&#xD;
      incompatibility to the donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations (and reduce the transplant failure rate) in this new protocol,&#xD;
      we will continue our nonmyeloablative approach in the patients with SCD and B-thalassemia&#xD;
      with HLA-matched family donors, but using an increased intensity regimen in a subset&#xD;
      considered at high risk for transplant failure. This modified regimen consists of pentostatin&#xD;
      and oral cyclophosphamide, which we hypothesize will reduce both the T cells that mediate&#xD;
      leukocyte rejection and the B/plasma cells that produce anti-donor erythrocyte antibodies.&#xD;
      The main transplant backbone will remain as alemtuzumab, low dose total body irradiation of&#xD;
      300 cGy, and sirolimus; the transplant graft will remain as unmanipulated G-CSF mobilized,&#xD;
      T-cell replete, PBSC product for hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the percentage/number of patients who have sustained&#xD;
      donor type hemoglobin at 1 year post transplant for male donors - female recipients. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint for those with pre-existing antibodies is the presence of donor red cells&#xD;
      with reticulocytes greater than or equal to 30 k/uL at 2 years post-transplant. Other&#xD;
      endpoints include the toxicity of the pentostatin-cyclophosphamide regimen, the degree of&#xD;
      donor-host chimerism necessary for long-term graft survival and disease amelioration,&#xD;
      incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, incidence of graft rejection, transplant-related&#xD;
      morbidity, as well as disease-free and overall survival. Since SCD and B-thalassemia are&#xD;
      non-malignant disorders of red cells, severe GVHD, lack of donor erythrocyte (prolonged donor&#xD;
      red cell aplasia), or graft rejection is collectively considered transplant failure.&#xD;

    <description>patients with preexisting antibodies (major ABO mismatch or otheranti-donor red cell antibody). The primary endpoint forthis group will be different than the first cohort. It is very likely that red cell aplasia (6 months to 2 years posttransplant) and prolonged duration of red cell transfusion are expected in this second group, thus a later time point to determine treatment success is justified.</description>
