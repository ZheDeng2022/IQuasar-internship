      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Eosinophils are white blood cells that fight infections. In people with hypereosinophilic&#xD;
      syndrome (HES), eosinophil levels are too high and can damage their organs. HES is usually&#xD;
      treated with steroids, but steroids can cause side effects and stop working over time.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if a drug called dexpramipexole, being developed by Knopp&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, can help people with HES to reduce their steroid dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether dexpramipexole can reduce the steroid dose needed to control eosinophilia&#xD;
      and HES symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 and older with HES who respond to steroids, but need more than 10 mg daily to&#xD;
      control eosinophilia and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 9 months with 6 visits to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and urine and blood&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants steroids will be tapered to the lowest effective dose. During this time,&#xD;
           blood will be drawn weekly. Participants will take this dose for 2 weeks before starting&#xD;
           the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study drug twice daily by mouth for 12 weeks along with&#xD;
           steroids. The steroid dose will not be decreased during this time and participants will&#xD;
           be seen monthly for a medical history, physical examination and blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Just before and 12 weeks after starting the study drug, the following tests will be&#xD;
           performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiogram (measures heart electrical activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  echocardiogram (takes pictures of the heart using sound waves)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bone marrow biopsy (a needle inserted into the hip bone that removes bone marrow cells&#xD;
           for study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 12 weeks, the participants steroid dose will be tapered again to the lowest&#xD;
           effective dose while on study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two weeks after the lowest effective dose is reached, participants will return for a&#xD;
           medical history, physical examination, blood work, lung and heart tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who respond to the study drug may be able to continue to receive the drug&#xD;
           on a planned separate study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four weeks after stopping the study drug, participants will have medical history,&#xD;
           physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by&#xD;
      peripheral eosinophilia and evidence of eosinophil-related end organ damage. Although a high&#xD;
      proportion of patients respond initially to corticosteroid therapy, high doses are often&#xD;
      necessary to control the eosinophilia and clinical symptoms, and many patients become&#xD;
      relatively refractory to therapy and/or develop serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexpramipexole (KNS 760704) is a synthetic aminobenzothiazole shown to safely reduce blood&#xD;
      eosinophils counts in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in several&#xD;
      clinical trials. The purpose of this proof-of- concept study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      dexpramipexole, an orally bioavailable small molecule, on circulating and tissue eosinophils&#xD;
      in 10 subjects with HES. Following completion of eligibility assessments, subjects with&#xD;
      absolute eosinophil count (AEC) &lt; 1000/uL will enter a lead-in period, during which a&#xD;
      standardized weekly corticosteroid taper will be undertaken to establish a &quot;minimally&#xD;
      effective corticosteroid dose&quot; in each study subject. For subjects whose symptoms are stable&#xD;
      but AEC &gt; 1000/uL at the time of enrollment, the steroid dose at the time of enrollment will&#xD;
      be defined as the minimally effective corticosteroid dose and no taper will be performed.&#xD;
      Once the minimally effective corticosteroid dose is established, treatment with&#xD;
      dexpramipexole 150 mg twice daily will begin. A standardized corticosteroid taper will begin&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of treatment with dexpramipexole to determine the &quot;minimally effective&#xD;
      corticosteroid dose on dexpramipexole&quot;. Eosinophil counts and routine chemistries will be&#xD;
      monitored weekly during corticosteroid tapering. End organ assessment, including&#xD;
      echocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, and other studies as appropriate will be&#xD;
      performed at study baseline, initiation of dexpramipexole therapy, 3 months after initial&#xD;
      dosing with dexpramipexole, and the end of study visit. Bone marrow assessment will be&#xD;
      performed prior to and after 12 weeks of dexpramipexole. Drug levels will be assessed prior&#xD;
      to dexpramipexole and at week 12 and week 24 of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the number of subjects with a greater than or equal to&#xD;
      50 % change in prednisone (or equivalent) dose to maintain absolute eosinophil count (AEC) at&#xD;
      or below baseline (pre-enrollment) levels and control clinical symptoms (responder analysis).&#xD;
      Assuming that 10 patients received study drug per protocol, at least 4 of them will need to&#xD;
      meet this endpoint to significantly show (at the usual two-sided 5% level, equivalent to the&#xD;
      onesided 2.5% level) that at least 10% of patients respond to dexpramipexole (exact binomial&#xD;
      test). Safety will be assessed as the incidence of adverse events (AEs) (including serious&#xD;
      adverse events [SAEs]), vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) tests, and body weight. Exploratory endpoints will include&#xD;
      determination of the effect of dexpramipexole on measures of eosinophil activation,&#xD;
      cytokine/chemokine profile and other immunologic parameters, and reduction of tissue&#xD;
      eosinophils.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for participation in the study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is male or female, age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a documented history of HES requiring greater than or equal to 10 mg&#xD;
             prednisone (or equivalent) to maintain disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             HES is defined as 1) peripheral blood eosinophilia (&gt;1500 eosinophils/microL) on at&#xD;
             least two occasions, 2) signs and symptoms of organ system involvement attributable to&#xD;
             the eosinophilia, and 3) exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, such as&#xD;
             parasitic helminth infection, drug hypersensitivity and neoplasms, for which&#xD;
             appropriate therapy is directed at the underlying cause&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HES symptoms are stable on the current corticosteroid dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject agrees to storage of samples for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females are eligible for this study if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (1) of non-childbearing potential (i.e., women who have had a hysterectomy or tubal&#xD;
        ligation or are postmenopausal as defined by no menses in 1 year); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        (2) of childbearing potential but willing to practice effective contraception or abstinence&#xD;
        during administration of the study drug and for 3 months after administration of the&#xD;
        investigational study drug (dexpramipexole).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception: Pre-clinical animal data demonstrated some fetal risk, suggesting there may&#xD;
        a human reproductive risk. Subjects must agree not to become pregnant. Females of&#xD;
        childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test before the first dose of dexpramipexole.&#xD;
        Because of the risk involved, subjects and their partners must use two methods of birth&#xD;
        control. They must continue to use both methods for 3 months after stopping the study drug.&#xD;
        Two methods of birth control may be selected from the list included below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female condoms with or without a spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with a spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        If pregnancy is suspected or should occur, subjects must notify the study staff&#xD;
        immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
