  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this research is to investigate whether the use of cognitive event-related&#xD;
      potentials is an interesting way to identify subgroups of alcoholic patients displaying&#xD;
      specific clinical symptoms and cognitive disturbances in order to help clinicians to adapt&#xD;
      the pharmaceutical approach to the specific needs of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, a fundamental question remains: How can investigators identify among alcoholic&#xD;
      patients who are likely to benefit from the use of naltrexone, acamprosate or baclofen, and&#xD;
      those who are not? The goal of this application is to identify subgroups of alcoholic&#xD;
      patients displaying specific clinical symptoms and cognitive disturbances linked to&#xD;
      consistent biological markers. Investigators propose that this might help clinicians improve&#xD;
      their treatment of alcoholic patients by focusing therapy on individual cognitive&#xD;
      disturbances, and by adapting pharmaceutical approaches to the identified brain&#xD;
      pathophysiology. In other words, investigators suggest that specifying the cognitive profile&#xD;
      of each individual patient may help clinicians in their choice of a suitable drug program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this aim, investigators suggest that a joined investigation of early (P100) and late&#xD;
      (P300) brain event-related potentials (ERP) components may help create subgroups of alcoholic&#xD;
      patients with homogenous cognitive deficits, and that this ''classification'' might help&#xD;
      optimize drug treatment. More precisely, investigators suggest that relapse in chronic&#xD;
      alcoholism is partly due to (1) the preferential attentional allocation to alcohol-related&#xD;
      information (e.g. the sight of a bottle of wine). As the P100 component has already been&#xD;
      shown to be enhanced by motivationally relevant stimuli, investigators think that this&#xD;
      component is well-suited for this purpose; and (2) the impairment of the inhibitory control,&#xD;
      which is necessary to suppress an inappropriate prepotent response. The Go/No-Go task is a&#xD;
      simple procedure, which has already proven to be highly reliable to evidence a deficit in&#xD;
      inhibitory control processing in alcoholics, indexed by a No-Go P3 of decreased amplitude and&#xD;
      less anterior topography. In summary, investigators have two simple experimental procedures,&#xD;
      an oddball task and a Go/No-Go task, which can be easily carried out in clinical settings,&#xD;
      and which can provide interesting data concerning, respectively, the existence of an implicit&#xD;
      attentional bias towards alcohol-cues and the deficit of inhibitory control towards a&#xD;
      prepotent response, through the observation of well-known and well-described cognitive ERP&#xD;
      components, i.e. the P100 and P3b components. The main goal of this project will be to test&#xD;
      the effect of different drug medications on both attentional (P100) and inhibitory (P300)&#xD;
      deficits observable in alcoholic patients.&#xD;
