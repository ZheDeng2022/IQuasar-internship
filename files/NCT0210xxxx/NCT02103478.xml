  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human, 3-stage, open-label study evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ASTX727, as well as determined the dose for later stages.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial was designed to define daily doses of the individual components (cedazuridine&#xD;
      [E7727] or decitabine) so that decitabine exposure after oral administration would be&#xD;
      comparable to exposure after IV decitabine at the approved daily dose of 20 mg/m^2. The main&#xD;
      objective of Phases 1 and 2 was to establish and confirm the doses of the 2 components to be&#xD;
      used in the final fixed-dose combination (FDC) product (ASTX727) using mainly&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as endpoints.&#xD;
