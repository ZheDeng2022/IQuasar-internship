      Approximately 15-25% of all breast cancers are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER2) positive and it has been well known that HER2 overexpression is associated with more&#xD;
      aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab administration as an adjuvant and in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer is&#xD;
      associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity. The incidence of&#xD;
      trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity were 27% with antracycline combination and 13% when it&#xD;
      was administered with paclitaxel .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 dimerization&#xD;
      domain, prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors (HER3,HER1, and HER4)&#xD;
      especially with HER3. Blocking HER2-HER3 dimerization is postulated to be the most clinically&#xD;
      relevant action of pertuzumab and this can effectively block her2-mediated cell signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertuzumab is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of breast cancer with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first line&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression might be complicated by cardiotoxicity in up to 14.5% of&#xD;
      the Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardinale et al showed that troponin I (TNI) positive identifies trastuzumab-treated patients&#xD;
      who are at risk for cardiotoxicity and are unlikely to recover from cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
      despite HF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very little data about the reversibility and identification of patients at risk for&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity of the pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel regimen and of those who&#xD;
      will not recover from cardiac dysfunction,this information is crucial. The usefulness of&#xD;
      troponin I (TNI) and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the identification of patients at&#xD;
      risk for PT cardiotoxicity and in the prediction of LVEF recovery has never been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      based on this background , this study aim is to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of pertuzumab&#xD;
      plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel regimen and the application of troponin I (TNI) and Brain&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women in Israel with 4000 new cases every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15-25% of all breast cancers are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER2) positive and it has been well known that HER2 overexpression is associated with more&#xD;
      aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody, is the standard treatment for both&#xD;
      early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition to other chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents, trastuzumab significantly improves response rate and survival in HER2-positive early&#xD;
      and metastatic breast cancer. Although it is well known that trastuzumab therapy is closely&#xD;
      associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly improved response rate, time to disease&#xD;
      progression and reduction of death compared to chemotherapy alone in HER2-positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (MBC). Thus, anti-HER2 treatment is a standard therapeutic approach for&#xD;
      HER2-positive MBC patients with visceral crisis. Trastuzumab administration as an adjuvant&#xD;
      and in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer is associated with both symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic cardiotoxicity. The incidence of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity were 27%&#xD;
      with antracycline combination and 13% when it was administered with paclitaxel .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 dimerization&#xD;
      domain, prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors (HER3,HER1, and HER4)&#xD;
      especially with HER3. Pertuzumab differs from trastuzumab in the epitope binding regions of&#xD;
      the light chain; pertuzumab binds to domain 2 ofHER2 essential for dimerization, whereas&#xD;
      trastuzumab binds to domain 4 of HER2. Blocking HER2-HER3 dimerization is postulated to be&#xD;
      the most clinically relevant action of pertuzumab and this can effectively block&#xD;
      her2-mediated cell signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertuzumab is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,phase III CLEOPATRA (the CLinical Evaluation&#xD;
      OfPertuzumab And Trastuzumab) study involved 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had not&#xD;
      received prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy, who were randomized to placebo plus&#xD;
      trastuzumab plus docetaxel or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first line&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression. No additional cardiotoxicity was observed when adding&#xD;
      pertuzumab compared to placebo. The incidence of any cardiac disorder as assessed by the&#xD;
      investigators was similar in the placebo (16.4%) and pertuzumab (14.5%) arms. Left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was observed in 8.3% and 4.4% of placebo and&#xD;
      pertuzumab patients, respectively. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction of grade III or&#xD;
      higher was reported in 7 (1.8%) patients in the placebo arm and 4 (1.0%) in the pertuzumab&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of breast cancer with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first line&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression might be complicated by cardiotoxicity in up to 14.5% of&#xD;
      the Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardinale et al showed that troponin I (TNI) positive identifies trastuzumab-treated patients&#xD;
      who are at risk for cardiotoxicity and are unlikely to recover from cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
