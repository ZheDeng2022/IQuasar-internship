      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEQUENCING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery (residual disease post&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and sequenced. The resulting sequencing data will&#xD;
      be interrogated for known genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA&#xD;
      approved agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD (CGTB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data&#xD;
      alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation. The CGTB will&#xD;
      consider the genomic data along with the patient's prior treatment history, ongoing&#xD;
      toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the&#xD;
      sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that&#xD;
      therapy. All participants and investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB&#xD;
      deliberations until the time of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to Experimental Arm A (genomically&#xD;
      directed monotherapy) or Control Arm B (standard therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A (GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA approved drug at standard&#xD;
      dose for four cycles (12-16 weeks total duration, depending on cycle length). Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory monitoring and dose-reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PIK3CA, PTEN: Everolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TOP2A: Doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PARP1, BRCA1: Cisplatin and Olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. VEGFA: Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TYMP: Capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. SSTR2: Octreotide&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. MGMT: Temozolomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. MYC: Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. EGFR: Cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. COX2: Celecoxib&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. hENT: Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. MET: Crizotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL ARM B (STANDARD THERAPY); Recently, a randomized phase III trial of over 900&#xD;
      HER2-negative patients demonstrated an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) for the addition of 8 cycles of capecitabine in the post-neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
      The hazard ratios were also significant in the triple negative subgroup. Thus, capecitabine&#xD;
      can be considered a standard option in this setting. As this represents only a single trial&#xD;
      (with prior data not demonstrating benefit for the addition of capecitabine in the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings in unselected patients), observation can be considered an&#xD;
      option as directed by the treating physician. While not recommended, other therapies can be&#xD;
      used as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of disease progression on the control arm, patient sequencing results will be&#xD;
      forwarded to the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) sequencing did not identify a&#xD;
      matched drug or 2) the matched drug was contraindicated. These participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to Control Arm B and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of&#xD;
      participants without an 'actionable' genomically directed therapy may differ, the primary&#xD;
      analysis will include only participants randomized to Control Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)&#xD;
             invasive breast cancer, clinical stage I-III at diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on&#xD;
             initial evaluation by physical examination and/or breast imaging prior to study&#xD;
             registration. NOTE: ER, PR and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology&#xD;
             review prior to randomization. ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells&#xD;
             stain weakly positive. HER2 will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ&#xD;
             hybridization (FISH) ratio of &lt; 2.0 or &lt; 6 copies per cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable&#xD;
             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who&#xD;
             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants may&#xD;
             not have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to randomization.&#xD;
             Bisphosphonate use is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The most recent surgery for&#xD;
             breast cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior (but no more than 84&#xD;
             days prior) to study registration. NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive margins may&#xD;
             enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and patient has&#xD;
             received radiotherapy. Participants with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ (LCIS) are eligible. Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (including&#xD;
             lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery&#xD;
             following preoperative chemotherapy. Significant residual disease is defined as at&#xD;
             least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. The presence of&#xD;
                  DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1cm with any lymph&#xD;
                  node involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only&#xD;
                  detected by immunohistochemistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or greater regardless&#xD;
                  of primary tumor site involvement (includes no residual disease in the breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or greater. NOTE: Prior to&#xD;
             randomization, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review and&#xD;
             percent values will be double checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing&#xD;
             Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BREAST RADIOTHERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent&#xD;
                  breast-conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.&#xD;
                  Participants must have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no more&#xD;
                  than 84 days prior) to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is required for all participants with a primary&#xD;
                  tumor ≥ 5 cm or involvement of ≥ 4 lymph nodes. For participants with primary&#xD;
                  tumors &lt; 5 cm or with &lt; 4 involved lymph nodes, provision of post-mastectomy&#xD;
                  radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician. Study registration&#xD;
                  must occur within 84 days of completion of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For radiation required prior to surgery, the participant must register within 84&#xD;
                  days of surgery. Also, participants in this situation would not be required to&#xD;
                  have additional post-mastectomy radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For those participants who do not require radiation, registration must be within&#xD;
                  84 days of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or may be&#xD;
             obtained separately. NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after&#xD;
             definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre-registered to the study and&#xD;
             proceed with central pathology review before full eligibility has been confirmed.&#xD;
             However ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and formal study registration&#xD;
             completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue sample from&#xD;
             definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the&#xD;
             time consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study registration. Women should be counseled regarding acceptable birth&#xD;
             control methods to utilize from the time of screening to start of treatment. If prior&#xD;
             to treatment after discussion with the subject it is felt by the treating physician&#xD;
             there is a possibility the subject is pregnant a pregnancy test should be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days prior to&#xD;
        study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in&#xD;
             the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of chronic hepatitis B or or untreated hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active second malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer or incidental&#xD;
             prostate cancer found on cystectomy): Active second malignancy is defined as a current&#xD;
             need for cancer therapy or a high possibility (&gt; 30%) of recurrence during the study.&#xD;
             Previous contralateral breast cancer is allowable unless it meets &quot;active&quot; criteria as&#xD;
             stated above.&#xD;
