    <description>Dose: Subjects weighing 3.0 kg received 3.15 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 5.1 - 10.0 kg received 5.25 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 10.1 - 15.4 kg received 10.5 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), subjects weighing 15.5 - 31.7 kg received 15.75 mg (1 spray/1 nostril), and subjects weighing &gt;=31.8 kg received 31.5 mg (1 spray/2 nostrils).&#xD;
Duration of Treatment: Subjects received a dose of SPRIX every 6 hours from the day of surgery until the morning of post-operative Day 2. Dosing may have resumed after final PK assessment of the morning of post-operative Day 3 until post-operative Day 4. A follow-up phone interview took place 14 days after the final dose of study drug.</description>
