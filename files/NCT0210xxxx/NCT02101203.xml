    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Lybridos in the domestic setting in healthy female subjects with hypoactive&#xD;
      sexual desire disorder and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-arm placebo and Lybridos (0.5 mg testosterone + buspirone 10 mg) extension to&#xD;
      study EB90 (Clinical Study Protocol EB90a, version 3.0, 07 June 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the efficacy of Lybridos will be evaluated in the domestic setting in&#xD;
      healthy female subjects with HSDD and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanism(s).&#xD;
      Sexual satisfaction and other aspects of sexual functioning will be measured within 24 hours&#xD;
      after each sexual activity. The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lybridos, as compared to placebo, will significantly increase the number of satisfying sexual&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy of Lybridos as compared to placebo in increasing the number of&#xD;
      satisfactory sexual episodes in healthy female subjects with hypoactive sexual desire&#xD;
      disorder (HSDD) and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the optimal dose of Lybridos to take into phase 3 clinical development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm that Lybridos has superior efficacy as compared to testosterone alone and to&#xD;
           buspirone alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of Lybridos as measured by scales of sexual satisfaction and/or&#xD;
           sexual desire/arousal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of Lybridos&#xD;
