  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a two-arm, randomized controlled trial of the effect of&#xD;
      emotional content in online videos on the extent to which the video is disseminated&#xD;
      (forwarded). Dissemination can be assessed in terms of the number of views which can increase&#xD;
      as a result from sharing and forwarding of the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, an experiment video and a control video, both of which are approximately 2.5&#xD;
      minutes long, will be uploaded on YouTube, the most visited video sharing website. The videos&#xD;
      concern the WOMAN trial, a large RCT of tranexamic acid in postpartum hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive a video with strongly emotional content (an interview with a&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage survivor and her husband). The control group will receive a short video&#xD;
      in which a researcher conveys the same information (but without the first hand experience of&#xD;
      the survivor and her husband). Otherwise, the two videos are identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, selected from clinicians and researchers in obstetrics and gynecology, will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to two groups. An e-mail with a link to either of the videos will be sent&#xD;
      to the participants. In the e-mail, they will be asked to watch the video and forward the&#xD;
      link to their colleagues if they find it helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is video forwarding. The secondary outcome is the number of access to the&#xD;
      video that each participant generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for 14 days after the e-mails are sent to the participants. The&#xD;
      relative risk (RR) of forwarding the videos will be calculated as effect measure and compared&#xD;
      using chi-square test. The distribution of the numbers of access to the video that each&#xD;
      participant generated will be compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that an online video with emotional content has higher chance of being&#xD;
      forwarded to other people and therefore, gets higher number of views than an less emotional&#xD;
      online video.&#xD;

      [Statistical analysis plan for the DIFFUSION trial]&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two videos will be uploaded on YouTube through a new account created for this study. The&#xD;
      uploaded videos will be embedded in two independent websites with white background. A&#xD;
      computer programme has been created to collect the data of access to the videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International journals in obstetrics and gynaecology published in 2013 and 2014 will be&#xD;
      sought for participant recruitment. The authors of the articles published in the journals who&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria will be assigned ID numbers and randomised to receive either the&#xD;
      intervention or control video. Randomised participants will be sent a unique web address&#xD;
      (URL) of the video that they are allocated to by e-mail via a mass e-mailing service,&#xD;
      Campaign Monitor. Each URL will be linked to the participant's ID number in the database.&#xD;
      They will be asked to watch the video and forward it to their colleagues if they find it&#xD;
      helpful. If a randomised participant forwards their URL to another person, and that person&#xD;
      clicks on it, the click will be recorded against the participant's ID number in the computer&#xD;
      programme. Therefore, if there are multiple accesses from the same ID number, it is either&#xD;
      because the participant watched the video more than once or because the participant forwarded&#xD;
      the URL and other people watched the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be coordinated from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine&#xD;
      (University of London) and conducted worldwide online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main factors determine the number of patients needed in a trial. These are the estimated&#xD;
      event rate and size of the treatment effect. The investigators will power the trial for our&#xD;
      main outcome: percentage of participants that forwarded the video at least once in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESTIMATED EVENT RATE: Based on other studies, baseline e-mail forward rate was assumed to be&#xD;
      10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND SIZE OF INTERVENTION EFFECT THAT SHOULD BE DETECTABLE: Assuming the change&#xD;
      from baseline is 7.5% (75% increase from 10% to 17.5%), the sample size required for this&#xD;
      study was calculated. The calculation suggested 1000 participants, 500 per group, are&#xD;
      required to test the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level with 90% power. We learnt&#xD;
      from the pilot trial that around 14% of e-mail recipients click on the link and watch the&#xD;
      video. In order to get 1000 participants to watch the videos, 7000 participants will be&#xD;
      required given the video viewing rate of 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants randomly assigned to one of the videos will be analysed together, regardless&#xD;
      of whether or not they watched the video, on an intention to treat basis. This analysis is to&#xD;
      examine the effect of the intervention in a practical scenario. In addition, only those who&#xD;
      watched the videos will be analysed on a per-protocol basis to estimate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent statistician will randomly allocate the ID numbers of the participants to&#xD;
      either the intervention or the control groups using a computer programme. Allocation will be&#xD;
      concealed to a person who will recruit participants. Randomisations were balanced 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING AND UNBLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      As two videos are apparently different, participants cannot be blinded in this trial.&#xD;
      However, each participant is not sent the other video so in principle they cannot tell if&#xD;
      they received a video with more or less emotional content. The study coordinator who will&#xD;
      conduct data analyses is masked to the allocation. The data will be unblinded after this SAP&#xD;
      is submitted to the ClinicalTrial.gov and all data analyses have been completed. The data are&#xD;
      kept in a password-secured online archive (Google drive). Access to the data is limited to&#xD;
      the trial coordinator and technical assistant who developed the computer programme for data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES FOR FINAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two different analyses will be conducted for the primary outcome on an&#xD;
           intention-to-treat basis and a per-protocol basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All tests will be two-sided, and the nominal level of Î± will be 5% for the main&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All statistical analyses will be unadjusted except where indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing values will not be imputed unless specified otherwise. Where the number of&#xD;
           missing observations is substantial, the number of observations used in the analysis&#xD;
           will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P values will not be adjusted for multiplicity. However, the outcomes are clearly&#xD;
           categorised by degree of importance (primary and secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND OUTCOME ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every time someone clicks on a URL to access a video our computer program collects four&#xD;
      variables: (a) ID number (b) IP address from which the URL is clicked, (c) date and time of&#xD;
      access (recorded in Great British Time regardless of the country of the IP address) and (d)&#xD;
      type of device (web browser, phone or computer device)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of access by the same person to a video:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no way to detect forwarding, accesses to the video by unique individuals will be&#xD;
      counted as the closest indicator of forwarding. It is also impossible to precisely&#xD;
      distinguish an access by a unique individual, in other words, to tell if the video was&#xD;
      accessed more than once by the same person or by different people. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators need to make assumptions based on the data collected by our programme. In the&#xD;
      main analysis, the investigators will consider that accesses with the same ID number from the&#xD;
      same IP address mean that a person watched the video more than once. Accesses with the same&#xD;
      ID number from different IP addresses will be considered as accesses by unique individuals.&#xD;
      The data of the other variables (time and type of device) will be considered in the&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis. Multiple accesses with the same ID from the same IP address within five&#xD;
      minutes will be counted as one access, allowing for the possibility that a person watched the&#xD;
      video more than once because the video did not play the first time or the parson wanted to&#xD;
      confirm the information in the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS AND BASELINE COMPARISONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the baseline characteristics listed below will be presented by intervention&#xD;
      group. The countries which the participants are based in were categorised into low, middle&#xD;
      and high income countries based on the classification by the World Bank. Discrete variables&#xD;
      will be summarised by frequencies and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according&#xD;
      to the number of participants for whom data are available. Where values are missing, the&#xD;
      denominator (which is less than the number of patients assigned to the treatment group) will&#xD;
      be stated in either the body or footnote of the corresponding summary table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion, i.e. either a mean or a median with SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome assessor will be masked to the identity of each participant by using ID numbers&#xD;
      instead of individual names or e-mail addresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accesses to the videos will be counted as a substitute for the measure of forwarding.&#xD;
      Therefore, even if a participant forwarded the URL to another person, if the person does not&#xD;
      click on the link, that forwarding will not be counted. This leads to the underestimate of&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME: A standard chi-square test will be used as the primary test of statistical&#xD;
      significance of the effect of intervention allocation on the proportion of video forwarding.&#xD;
      Frequencies and percentages per arm, and a risk ratio measuring the intervention effect and&#xD;
      its 95% confidence interval (CI) will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Distribution of number of accesses generated by each participant will be&#xD;
      compared. The difference in the means (SD) in each arm will be estimated in order to assess&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention along with the P value. To test the statistical difference in&#xD;
      distribution, Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be conducted. In case the distributions are&#xD;
      complex, the data will be stratified into a few groups and chi-square test will be conducted&#xD;
      to test the statistical difference in distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessing the distributions, a t-test and Mood's median test will be conducted to test&#xD;
      the statistical difference in the mean and median of the number of access to the videos that&#xD;
      each participant generated respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The effect of the intervention may vary according to the definition of&#xD;
      an access by a unique person. Therefore, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses&#xD;
      for all outcomes using two different definitions of an access by a unique person: most&#xD;
      conservative definition and most liberal definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible largest effect of the intervention and the difference in all the outcomes&#xD;
      between the two groups will be estimated using the most liberal definition of forwarding.&#xD;
      Likewise, the possible smallest effect of the intervention and the difference in all the&#xD;
      outcomes between the two groups will be estimated using the most conservative definition.&#xD;
      With the most liberal definition, the investigators will count all accesses as those by&#xD;
      different persons. With the most conservative definition, the investigators will count&#xD;
      accesses as those by different persons only if the data from all the categories are&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
