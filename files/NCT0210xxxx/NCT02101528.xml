    <textblock>
      Decreased muscle strength has been reported to be a factor contributing to increased&#xD;
      incidences of falling in the elderly patients causing fractures, joint dislocations, severe&#xD;
      soft tissue lesions and head trauma. Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients often complain of&#xD;
      weakness and it has been reported that they have reduced muscle strength, decreased rate of&#xD;
      force development, impaired ability to maintain constant force, and increased muscle&#xD;
      coactivation during balance perturbation tasks. The specific cause of this weakness is not&#xD;
      known, and in this study the investigators have analyzed and measured isokinetic muscle&#xD;
      strength in PD patients to clarify this issue. The investigators have compared the data&#xD;
      obtained with those of age-matched controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An isokinetic muscle action is defined by its performance at a constant speed or velocity.&#xD;
      The laboratory measurements of isokinetic strength provides torque measurements throughout&#xD;
      the active range of motion during a maximal effort. Torque is the force rotating about an&#xD;
      axis and is produced and recorded from the angular motion. Consequently, the peak torque is&#xD;
      an index of the muscular strength. Isokinetic testing was introduced as a quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of both statistic and dynamic muscular contraction in which all variables&#xD;
      involved (resistance, limb velocity, joint position) are under control. This is because&#xD;
      isokinetic muscle testing allows objective, valid, and reliable measurement of the force&#xD;
      produced by skeletal muscle during exercise at constant velocity and accommodating resistance&#xD;
      and it is appropriate for measuring muscle strength and muscle endurance across the&#xD;
      disability spectrum.&#xD;

    <description>To establish whether a Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment change the muscle functionality in these patients, and to determine whether isokinetic dynamometry is a reliable method for evaluating muscle strength in patients with PD.&#xD;
Muscle strength was measured in lower limbs with the subjects in a sitting position with hip flexed at 90°. To account for the influence of the gravity effect torque, data were corrected by the weight of the subject's lower limb at 45°. Subjects were tested at three fixed angular velocities: 90°/s, 120°/s, 180°/s. The subjects began each isokinetic contraction with the knee flexed at 90° and continued through the full range of motion. Peaks torque were obtained from the maximum isokinetic tests and subsequently analyzed.</description>
