      The investigators will monitor the pressure generated inside the abdomen in a patient in whom&#xD;
      the surgeon, for whatever reason, felt that the abdomen could not be closed at the initial&#xD;
      operation. The investigators will aggressively treat rises in intra-abdominal pressure and&#xD;
      see what changes, if any are found when the abdomen finally is closed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The detrimental effects of elevated intra-abdominal compartment pressure have been known for&#xD;
      some time and are actively managed by most surgical critical care physicians. Similarly, it&#xD;
      is well known that occasionally the abdomen cannot be immediately closed in some patients due&#xD;
      to concern of elevated intra-abdominal pressure or ongoing contamination; these patients&#xD;
      typically stay in hospital, often in expensive ICU's until final closure - and even then,&#xD;
      some patients do not get definitive reconstruction of the abdominal wall until many months&#xD;
      later, again adding to the expense of their care. Thus, there has been a move to give these&#xD;
      patients early, aggressive closure of the abdomen, often using a combination of negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy and biologic mesh. Currently these groups of patients who have early&#xD;
      aggressive closure are incompletely studied; although abdominal compartment pressure&#xD;
      measurements are routinely made on them, this is not commonly done intra-operatively when&#xD;
      closure is being performed; nor have these patients been studied with continuous monitoring.&#xD;
      This is especially striking considering the occlusive nature of negative wound therapy&#xD;
      dressings: anecdotal increases in abdominal pressures have been noted in these patients,&#xD;
      sometimes to dangerous levels. As there is accumulating evidence that diligent management of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure can improve outcomes in a variety of patients, there is an&#xD;
      opportunity to apply accurate monitoring to a patient group that is also likely to benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective observational study on patients who are unable to be&#xD;
      definitively closed at the time of surgery and are candidates for early aggressive abdominal&#xD;
      closure. The investigators will monitor abdominal pressure using the AbViser continuous&#xD;
      abdominal pressure monitoring device to ascertain whether there are episodes if&#xD;
      intra-abdominal hypertension in these patients, and whether this improves or not after&#xD;
      definitive closure. The research team will then attempt to correlate abdominal pressure&#xD;
      measurements to outcomes. Finally the team will compare patients to historical controls using&#xD;
      propensity scoring to explore differences in outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure monitoring will be initiated when a patient has been identified as&#xD;
      requiring an open abdomen. The monitoring will be done until the patient's abdominal wound&#xD;
      has been closed and there are no elevated measurements. Once the patient has been discharged&#xD;
      from the intensive care unit, the AbViser system will be discontinued. Patients will continue&#xD;
      to be followed for the duration of their hospital stay and outcome measures will be assessed&#xD;
      until discharge from the hospital, an expected average of 2 - 3 weeks.&#xD;
