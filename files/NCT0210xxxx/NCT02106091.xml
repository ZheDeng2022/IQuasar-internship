  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AFM11 is safe and active in the treatment&#xD;
      of relapsed and/or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19 is present on B-cells from earliest recognizable B-lineage cells during development to&#xD;
      B-cell blasts and is lost only upon maturation to plasma cells. Expression of CD19 on B-cells&#xD;
      at various development stages makes it an ideal target to treat B-cell associated&#xD;
      malignancies.The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both&#xD;
      malignant cells via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This&#xD;
      results in the formation of the &quot;immunological synapse&quot; and the subsequent T-cell activation&#xD;
      on leading to killing of malignant cells.&#xD;
