    <measure>Induction Phase: Change From Baseline to Week 6 in MCS Rectal Bleed Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Rectal bleeding data were collected via the participant's diaries and each day a participant provided a score from 0 to 3 according to the following definitions: 0 = no blood in the stool; 1 = streaks of blood with stool less than half the time; 2 = obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3 = blood alone passed. The Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) rectal bleeding subscore was calculated as the worst value of three days of daily diary scores closest to anchor dates at baseline and post-baseline. The data was considered non-parametric and was reported using RANK analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Participants were stratified by concomitant treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants at randomization and disease activity measured during screening (MCS ≤9/MCS ≥10); the model adjusted for these stratification factors along with the baseline rectal bleeding (RB) subscore.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 78</time_frame>
    <description>All Adverse Events (AEs) were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Any AE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs; some AEs have fewer than 5 options. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

        <title>Induction Phase: Change From Baseline to Week 6 in MCS Rectal Bleed Subscore</title>
        <description>Rectal bleeding data were collected via the participant's diaries and each day a participant provided a score from 0 to 3 according to the following definitions: 0 = no blood in the stool; 1 = streaks of blood with stool less than half the time; 2 = obvious blood with stool most of the time; 3 = blood alone passed. The Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) rectal bleeding subscore was calculated as the worst value of three days of daily diary scores closest to anchor dates at baseline and post-baseline. The data was considered non-parametric and was reported using RANK analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Participants were stratified by concomitant treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants at randomization and disease activity measured during screening (MCS ≤9/MCS ≥10); the model adjusted for these stratification factors along with the baseline rectal bleeding (RB) subscore.</description>

        <title>Induction Phase: Change From Baseline to Week 14 in UC Bowel Movement Signs and Symptoms, as Assessed by the Ulcerative Colitis Patient-Reported Outcome Signs and Symptoms (UC-PRO/SS) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The UC-PRO questionnaire is collected in the e-diary and completed by participants for at least 9-12 consecutive days prior to a study visit. The UC-PRO is being reported in three domains; two domains are key endpoints and reported as UC-PRO Signs and Symptoms (UC-PRO/SS). The bowel domain score ranges from 0-27, with a higher score indicating a worse disease state.</description>

        <title>Maintenance Phase: Percentage of Participants With Corticosteroid-Free Clinical Remission at Week 66 Among Participants Who Were Receiving Corticosteroids at Baseline, as Determined by the MCS</title>
        <description>The MCS ranges from 0 to 12 and is a composite of 4 assessments (each rated from 0-3): stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment. Higher scores represent greater disease severity. Corticosteroid-Free analysis was conducted only on a subgroup of participants who were randomized into the maintenance phase and receiving Corticosteroids (CS) at baseline. Participants were defined as being off CS if they had no record of taking CS on the date that was 24 weeks prior to Week 66.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event by Severity, According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0)</title>
        <description>All Adverse Events (AEs) were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Any AE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 = death related to AE. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs; some AEs have fewer than 5 options. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

        <description>All Adverse Events (AEs) were graded for severity using the NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Any AE not specifically listed was assessed per the following 5 grades: Grade 1 = mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated. Grade 2 = moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3 = severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated. Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs; some AEs have fewer than 5 options. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; are not synonymous and are independently assessed for each AE. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant at the highest (worst) grade.</description>

When determining post baseline incidence, participants were considered to be ADA positive if they were ADA negative or had missing data at baseline but developed an ADA response following etrolizumab drug exposure (treatment-induced ADA response), or if they were ADA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post baseline samples was at least 0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment-enhanced ADA response). Participants were considered to be ADA negative if they were ADA negative or had missing data at baseline and all post baseline samples were negative, or if they were ADA positive at baseline but did not have any post baseline samples with a titer that was at least 0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected).</description>
