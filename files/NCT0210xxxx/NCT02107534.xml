  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with dyslexia show a variety of comorbid disorders like behavior and adaptive&#xD;
      disorders, hyperkinetic and anxiety disorders. Raising and educating a child with dyslexia is&#xD;
      a challenging task for parents. Studies show that parents of children with dyslexia suffer&#xD;
      under depressive symptoms and higher parenting stress. In order to support the child's&#xD;
      academic development many parents of children with dyslexia practice reading and writing more&#xD;
      often and show controlling and maladaptive behavior. As a result learning motivation of the&#xD;
      child decreases and later homework situations are influenced in a negative way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, it is necessary to provide parent training on appropriate behavior with&#xD;
      homework and academic exercises, in order to raise parent's competences, reduce parenting&#xD;
      stress and promote learning motivation of the child. In the German-speaking area there is a&#xD;
      lack of elaborated and evaluated programs for parents of dyslexic children. Therefore, a&#xD;
      group program that especially addresses the needs of these parents was devised. The study&#xD;
      aims at evaluating the effects of the parent training. We hypothesize that the treatment&#xD;
      reduces parenting stress and raises competences of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-one mothers of third graders with dyslexia were randomly assigned to the group-based&#xD;
      parent training program (N=25) or a waiting list control group (N=16). Only children who&#xD;
      performed in the normal range on the test measuring cognitive abilities (IQ &gt; 70) and who&#xD;
      scored below average in at least one test measuring reading or writing (T-Score &lt; 40) were&#xD;
      included. Children with significant deficits in hearing or vision, pervasive developmental&#xD;
      disorder or genetic disorders were excluded. Data of children and their mothers were&#xD;
      collected prior to intervention, directly after intervention and three months after&#xD;
      intervention. For investigating training effects at all time points parenting stress and&#xD;
      competences in supporting academic development, mastering homework situations and attachment&#xD;
      to the child were measured. Parents of the waiting list control group had the possibility to&#xD;
      take part in the parent training after the follow-up was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program consists of five two-hour sessions held biweekly. The training lasts&#xD;
      about 10 weeks. It is designed for group sizes of three to ten persons. It follows a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral approach. The training aims at knowledge transfer about dyslexia,&#xD;
      raising parent's empathy for the child's difficulties in reading and writing, promoting&#xD;
      parent's competencies and self-efficacy in handling dyslexia within the family context and&#xD;
      during homework situations, sensitization for opportunities of integrating reading and&#xD;
      writing into daily life and reduction of parental stress. The main topics covered are&#xD;
      requirements and phases of acquisition of written language, the causes of dyslexia, helpful&#xD;
      strategies for managing homework and exercises, facilitation of literacy in everyday life and&#xD;
      dealing with dyslexia. Methods used are brief lectures, example cases, group discussions and&#xD;
      practice, as well as homework tasks. Written handouts summarizing important topics are given&#xD;
      at every session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A benefit of enrolling in the study is that parents get information concerning the academic&#xD;
      development of their children. At the moment it is not sure whether parents profit from&#xD;
      participating in the training because effects have not been investigated yet. The study takes&#xD;
      place at the University of Heidelberg (Children's Hospital) and the Early Intervention Centre&#xD;
      in Heidelberg. The study started in January 2012 and is expired to end in October 2014.&#xD;
      Participants have been recruited two times, at the beginning of a school year. The timeline&#xD;
      for every study flow was similar. Pretests took place in September and October; parent&#xD;
      training started in December and lasted until February. Post-Test took place in February and&#xD;
      March. Follow-Up measurements were realized from June to July. The study is funded by the&#xD;
      Günter Reimann-Dubbers foundation of Heidelberg. The main contact for the study is Bettina&#xD;
      Multhauf (M.Sc. Psych.), e-mail: fruehinterventionszentrum@googlemail.com&#xD;
