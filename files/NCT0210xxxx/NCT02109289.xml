  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this preliminary project is to study the effect of etanercept, a medicine&#xD;
      approved by Health Canada for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, on the inflammation of&#xD;
      certain blood vessels. In particular, the inflammation of the aorta and the carotid arteries&#xD;
      will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's goal is to determine if etanercept (that blocks TNF (tissue necrosis factor)&#xD;
      alpha) could have an effect on blood vessel inflammation. As well, the information from this&#xD;
      study will be used to determine the number of patients to recruit in a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of etanercept on 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis at&#xD;
      one rheumatology clinic in Montreal. The 10 patients will be recruited at the Montreal&#xD;
      Rheumatology Institute (Institut de Rhumatologie de Montr√©al) and the images of the blood&#xD;
      vessels taken at a medical imaging center will be analyzed by the Montreal Heart Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate vascular inflammation subjects will undergo a PET scan (Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 16 week, single center, open label trial, to study the effect of etanercept&#xD;
      on vascular inflammation of the ascending aorta and carotid arteries in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active RA already receiving methotrexate for at least 3 months will receive&#xD;
      etanercept for 16 weeks. Etanercept will be administered sub-cutaneously using the dose&#xD;
      approved in the Canadian product monograph for RA (50 mg every week). Patients will continue&#xD;
      methotrexate at a stable dose during the study unless a dose reduction or cessation is&#xD;
      required as judged necessary by the study investigator. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      Scan will be performed at baseline and after16 weeks of study treatment with etanercept. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, all PET Scan images will be analyzed in a blinded manner by the&#xD;
      Montreal Heart Institute core laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed using adverse events collection and laboratory hematology and&#xD;
      chemistry analysis (screening and Week 4) and pregnancy test.&#xD;
