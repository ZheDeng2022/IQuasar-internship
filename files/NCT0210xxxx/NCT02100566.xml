  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with life-limiting illness often receive more aggressive healthcare than desired&#xD;
      including costly procedures that provide little medical benefit. Advance Directives (AD) can&#xD;
      reduce this effect but various factors limit their adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial will target hospitalized patients with a serious, life limiting illness to&#xD;
      test if the behavioral economics principles of endowment (possessing something) and focusing&#xD;
      (featuring something important to patients) can motivate AD completion. Investigators will&#xD;
      examine if offering patients an AD by default, in combination with framing the rationale for&#xD;
      AD completion (emphasizing patient control or caregiver burden) improves AD completion and&#xD;
      family conversation compared to a no-intervention group. The study hypothesis is to determine&#xD;
      if rates of AD completion and family conversations will be highest among patients receiving&#xD;
      the intervention focused on reduced caregiver burden; and if the two intervention groups will&#xD;
      have higher rates of both than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suspect that a small change in how patient information is framed (endowment&#xD;
      and focusing used in tandem) will potentially leverage large increases in AD completion and&#xD;
      that targeting HHC patients allows AD discussions early in the disease trajectory when they&#xD;
      can participate in care decisions.&#xD;

      Primary research question: Does offering patients an Advance Directive (AD) document (by&#xD;
      default), in combination with framing the rationale for AD completion (emphasizing either: A.&#xD;
      patient control; or B. reduction in caregiver burden) improve AD completion as compared to a&#xD;
      no-intervention control group?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The project will conduct a 3-group randomized trial in which ADs are provided&#xD;
      to hospitalized patients by default in the two treatment groups. When discussing the benefits&#xD;
      of AD completion, intervention group A nurses will focus on ADs' potential to promote&#xD;
      patients' control over the care they receive. In intervention group B, nurses will focus on&#xD;
      the potential for AD completion to reduce caregiver burden. In the control group, patients&#xD;
      will receive ADs only if they actively request them (as in standard practice). Specially&#xD;
      trained nurses will be responsible for conducting the intervention. Training of RNs will&#xD;
      consist of didactic and experiential learning on applying endowment and focusing effect&#xD;
      scripts in a consistent manner that are true to the behavioral economic principles.&#xD;
      Intervention will occur while in the hospital during which the patient will be presented with&#xD;
      one of three options by the RN depending on their random assignment. Patients in both&#xD;
      intervention groups will be given an AD by default. Patients who elect to complete an AD can&#xD;
      have this completed with RN during the hospitalization or during a separate visit hospital&#xD;
      worker who is trained in Advance Care Planning (ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research RN will complete the &quot;Selection of Patient Form&quot; to determine eligibility for&#xD;
      participation in the study (see subjects/sample below). Patients who are determined to be&#xD;
      eligible for the study, will be asked if they are willing to participate in the study and&#xD;
      asked to sign a consent form .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient is assigned into one of the three intervention groups and is provided one of three&#xD;
      packets (packet includes script , copy of &quot;Your Health, Your Choice: My Advance Directive&quot;,&#xD;
      and self-addressed stamped envelope). The RN will provide the designated script regarding&#xD;
      advance directives (see &quot;Scripts for Intervention Groups&quot;). Four possible outcomes can occur&#xD;
      following this visit: A) patient indicates desire to complete AD while in the hospital; B)&#xD;
      patient indicates desire to complete AD with ACP facilitator as separate visit; C) patient&#xD;
      elects to complete AD on their own, or D) patient declines to complete AD. A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects/Sample: Hospitalized patients who reside in the County will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three groups. Eligibility will be determined before discharge. Inclusion criteria are adult&#xD;
      patients, 50 years and older, who have a serious, life-limiting illness and require&#xD;
      hospitalization (see below). Eligible patients will be identified and selected concurrently&#xD;
      from new intakes to Genesys Regional Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject will be eligible for study participation if he/she meets the both 1 &amp; 2 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Age 50 years and older 2.0 Subject must have one or more of the following serious life&#xD;
      limiting illness that requires hospitalization (as determined from review of medical records&#xD;
      and clinical judgment) 2.1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any respiratory&#xD;
      (pulmonary) disease that requires home oxygen use (e.g. interstitial lung disease,&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing), 2.2. End Stage Renal Disease 2.3. Peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
      (PVD) 2.4. NYHA Class III or IV Heart Failure (HF) Class III: Marked limitation in activity&#xD;
      due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances&#xD;
      (20-100 m). Comfortable only at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. Cancer as a discharge diagnosis (any type) Type: 2.6. Neuromuscular/movement disorders:&#xD;
      Myasthenia gravis, ALS, Parkinson's, and Multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject will not be eligible for study participation if he/she meets any of the following&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Patient cannot sign legal documents such as consent or AD (Impaired decision-making&#xD;
      capacity) 3.2. Previously specified written AD 3.3 Patient previously enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size- Calculated on the primary outcome of AD completion rate, the investigators used&#xD;
      an estimated baseline completion of 10% for the control group. A two-tailed test for&#xD;
      comparing completion rates between a default option and the standard, as well as, comparing&#xD;
      the two framing interventions will require a total of 350 participants (125 in each&#xD;
      intervention and 100 in the control). This achieves a minimum of 88% power to detect a 15%&#xD;
      absolute difference between the groups at alpha of 0.05 and accounts for a 5% attrition rate.&#xD;
      The hypothesis that AD completion rates differ by at least 15% between two groups within each&#xD;
      arm (default option compared to control; autonomy framing compared to caregiver burden&#xD;
      framing) will be analyzed using Chi-square analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that offering patients an AD document (by default), in combination with&#xD;
      framing the rationale for AD completion (emphasizing either: A. patient control; or B.&#xD;
      reduction in caregiver burden) will improve AD completion as compared to a no-intervention&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
