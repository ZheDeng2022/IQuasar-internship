    <textblock>
      This study measures biological and psychological processes that might help researchers to&#xD;
      better understand what is taking place during low or medium dose and full dose MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy treatment in people with PTSD. Heart rate variability (HRV) will be measured up&#xD;
      to three times; before and once or twice after receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Brain&#xD;
      activity will be measured before and after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in response to&#xD;
      personalized trauma-related scripts. Participants will complete a measure of self-compassion&#xD;
      at baseline and two months after a final experimental treatment session. Therapy techniques&#xD;
      observed during recorded treatment sessions will be classified using a standardized clinical&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a complex psychiatric disease characterized by a deficit in fear extinction,&#xD;
      hyperarousal, emotional numbing, and intrusive symptoms that cause the patient to&#xD;
      persistently re-experience a traumatic event over a period longer than a month. PTSD is&#xD;
      considered chronic when symptoms are present for at least six months. MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy is an innovative experimental mode of treatment that combines psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      techniques with the administration of MDMA. It may amplify certain aspects of psychotherapy,&#xD;
      as the pharmacological action of MDMA is thought to act as an adjunct to psychotherapy. With&#xD;
      positive results in two studies and ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies it is important to&#xD;
      further characterize the psychotherapeutic processes that occur during treatment sessions&#xD;
      conducted according to the manualized method of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Changes in&#xD;
      physiological status or brain activity that are associated with improvement or recovery in&#xD;
      people with chronic PTSD may offer a means of assessing treatment response that relies less&#xD;
      on self-report. This may be particularly important in studies with MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy where blinding is difficult due to the psychoactive nature of the&#xD;
      investigational product. This study is also interested in identifying and categorizing&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic processes taking place during MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The sub-study&#xD;
      will also examine elements of the experience with a self-report measure of self-compassion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory sub-study will identify psychotherapeutic processes occurring during MDMA-&#xD;
      assisted psychotherapy in people with chronic PTSD and assess the feasibility of exploring&#xD;
      physiological correlates of clinical outcomes in subjects enrolled in the ongoing clinical&#xD;
      trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, NCT #: NCT01211405. The sub-study will be conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Smith&#xD;
      College and the New School for Social Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the clinical outcomes measured by CAPS from the MP-8 study, the sponsor is&#xD;
      interested in correlations of outcomes with treatment-related changes in potential biological&#xD;
      markers of PTSD, measured by HRV and fMRI. Brain activity while listening to neutral and&#xD;
      personalized trauma-related scripts will take place at baseline and after experimental&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with low or medium or full dose MDMA. The fMRI scan will be&#xD;
      followed by a Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) scan. After each scanning session, pulse&#xD;
      measurements will be extracted as a digital data file from which HRV will be calculated. FMRI&#xD;
      scans and HRV measurements will occur at baseline for participants in all conditions, one&#xD;
      month after the second experimental session and again after a final experimental session for&#xD;
      participants in the low or medium dose condition, and two months after the final experimental&#xD;
      session for participants in the full dose condition. Participants will complete the&#xD;
      Self-Compassion Scale, a self-report measure of self-compassion at Baseline and after the&#xD;
      final MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. Psychotherapeutic processes will be assessed via&#xD;
      observing psychotherapy and sorting a set of 100 therapy-related items as a means of&#xD;
      describing the interactions. Trained coders will observe at least one pre-drug psychotherapy&#xD;
      session, one experimental (drug-assisted psychotherapy) session and one post-drug&#xD;
      psychotherapy session.&#xD;
