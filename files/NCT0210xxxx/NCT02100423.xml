      This phase II trial studies the efficacy (activity), and tolerability of curcumin and&#xD;
      cholecalciferol combination in treating patients with previously untreated stage 0-II chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Curcumin and cholecalciferol may prevent&#xD;
      or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) based on National Cancer Institute-Working&#xD;
      Group (NCI-WG) criteria in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or the Cheson criteria in small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time to first cytotoxic treatment (TFCT), progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and cholecalciferol PO daily on days&#xD;
      8-28 of course 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      achieving partial response or better may receive treatment for a total of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
