      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with alcoholism have differences in their brains compared with healthy people.&#xD;
      People who are dependent on alcohol also perform differently on behavioral tasks. Researchers&#xD;
      want to find out more about these differences. They also want to see if these differences are&#xD;
      related to DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if differences in brain structure relate to personality and behavior differences in&#xD;
      people with and without alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center once during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, EKG, and physical exam. They will&#xD;
           give blood and urine samples and undergo a psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking, to see if they have an alcohol&#xD;
           use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will play three computerized games. Some will play these games inside a&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: strong magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie&#xD;
           on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder. They will be in the scanner for about&#xD;
           90 minutes. They may lie still for up to 20 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud&#xD;
           knocking noises. They will get earplugs.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of this protocol is to obtain a standard set of assessments, including&#xD;
      brain behavioral, structural, functional, and connectivity (structural and functional)&#xD;
      information, on all NIAAA research participants, referred to hereinafter as Characterization&#xD;
      Imaging Instruments (CII); a) to determine how individual differences in brain structure and&#xD;
      evoked responses relate to generalized trait personality and behavior differences (as&#xD;
      assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and behavioral measures); and b) to&#xD;
      determine whether these individual differences relate specifically to genetic polymorphisms&#xD;
      in genes governing neurotransmitter activity. Thus, our goal of the CII is to identify the&#xD;
      brain structural, functional, behavioral, genetic, and other phenotypic factors that are&#xD;
      associated with alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Non-treatment seeking adult volunteers and inpatient participants with&#xD;
      alcohol dependence (ADs). Inpatient ADs refer to individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent&#xD;
      through DSM-IV-RT criteria or at least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder as determined by DSM-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will require one visit that will include an MRI scan (if the participant&#xD;
      is determined to be eligible for the scanner) consisting of a whole brain structural MRI,&#xD;
      Diffusion Tensor MRI, Resting State MRI (rsMRI) as well as several task-based functional&#xD;
      MRIs, while performing computerized behavioral, motivational, and cognitive/emotional tasks.&#xD;
      If the participant does not qualify for the MR scans, he/she will perform only the&#xD;
      computerized behavioral, motivational, and cognitive/emotional tasks outside the scanner.&#xD;
      These instruments include instruments in common with a similar protocol at NIDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The outcome measures are differences in behavioral responses using standard&#xD;
      statistical methods, in brain structural data in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      signal measured using standard techniques and analyzed using established image analysis&#xD;
      approaches and software tools such as AFNI, SPM, FSL, DTI, Studio, etc. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are to compare the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and&#xD;
      behavioral data acquired across other protocols.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of outpatient and inpatient participants who are 18 years&#xD;
        of age or older who are eligible for or enrolled in other NIAAA protocols. The participant&#xD;
        s AUD status at the time of this study will be evaluated as part of the screening&#xD;
        procedures of the NIAAA screening protocol 14-AA-0181. The participant s status will be&#xD;
        determined using either the DSM-IV-TR or the DSM-5, which also classifies present AUD as&#xD;
        mild, moderate, or severe.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adult participants must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been pre-screened, determined eligible for any NIAAA study, or enrolled in any&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIAAA study (including 14-AA-0181).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As this is a natural history protocol, there are no exclusionary criteria for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants should have been tested negative at the time of consent and study procedures&#xD;
        using an alcohol breathalyzer, Individuals with a positive breath alcohol concentration&#xD;
        (BrAC) will be re-scheduled or withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Upon completion of the consent, the participant will be invited for the study session. On&#xD;
        the study session day, the following exclusion criteria will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Exclusion criteria for MR scan*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive BrAC#,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug test (UDT) # for benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamines,&#xD;
             opiates and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for outpatients. Positive UDT for&#xD;
             benzodiazepines and THC are not exclusionary for the inpatients. It is common that the&#xD;
             inpatients who are treated for AUD withdrawal are treated with benzodiazepines.&#xD;
             Positive THC would also not be exclusionary for this study since it tends to be&#xD;
             detected over the long period of time after use. However, we will make note of these&#xD;
             for the data analysis purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Task performance (behavioral, fMRI) only: cleared based on neuromotor examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of the&#xD;
             head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types&#xD;
             of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner, implanted&#xD;
             delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the MRI scanner,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncomfortable in enclosed spaces (has claustrophobia) such that they would feel&#xD;
             discomfort in the scanner,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women: are pregnant#,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are left-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inpatient participants with alcohol use disorder who have symptoms of alcohol&#xD;
             withdrawal as indicated by the most recent measurement within the past 30 days,&#xD;
             measured by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-Ar) score &gt;= 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects excluded from MR scan may still perform the behavioral tasks which would&#xD;
                  otherwise be performed in the scanner, if they qualify for behavioral tasks. To&#xD;
                  avoid undue discomfort, burden, and inconvenience this information, if available,&#xD;
                  can be gathered from routine clinical care or other NIAAA clinical studies and&#xD;
                  data.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participants who meet this exclusion criterion will not participate in any&#xD;
                       part of this study at the time. They will be re-scheduled for a future&#xD;
                       date(s) when they do not meet any of the exclusionary criterion.&#xD;
