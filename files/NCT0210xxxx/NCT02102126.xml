      The ENSURE study is a multi-center, prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled study&#xD;
      of the effect of renal denervation on arterial stiffness and haemodynamics in subjects with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the catheter,&#xD;
      delivering radiofrequency energy through the luminal surface of the renal artery.&#xD;

      Biomarkers to identify responder It is known that about one fifth of patients have a systolic&#xD;
      BP reduction less than 10 mmHg after the renal denervation, and the failure of the HTN-3&#xD;
      study may be partly attributable to this point. Therefore, it is critical to identify a&#xD;
      biomarker in order to screen patients who would benefit from this catheter-based therapy.&#xD;
      Some investigators indicated that impaired cardiac baroreflex sensitivity may predict&#xD;
      response to renal denervation therapy [13]. In addition, we also have several other&#xD;
      candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arterial stiffness As indicated by Mitchell GF, it was proven that, in the Framingham&#xD;
           study, arterial stiffness is a major contributor to the onset and development of high&#xD;
           BP, but not the consequence [14]. Furthermore, from a physiological viewpoint,&#xD;
           age-related arterial remodeling was closely associated with elevation in sympathetic&#xD;
           activity [15], and it was reported that renal denervation lead to a decrease in&#xD;
           patients' arterial stiffness [16]. However, it remains unclear whether patients with&#xD;
           severe arterial stiffening would better benefit from this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endocrinic biomarker Theoretically, renal denervation decreased patients' BP mainly&#xD;
           through decreasing local and systematical sympathetic tone and&#xD;
           renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) activity. However, it remains unclear if patients&#xD;
           with high renin level or other biomarkers would have improved response from this novel&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other BP-related parameters Based on the published data from the HTN-1/2 and considering the&#xD;
      worldwide marketing of this catheter-based device, clinical investigations need to be&#xD;
      continued and not limited to efficacy on BP reduction or its safety. Several BP-related&#xD;
      parameters are of great interest to be investigated with the novel denervation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood pressure variability In 2010, Rothwell and colleagues indicated that increased BP&#xD;
           variability was significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality and stroke [17].&#xD;
           We found in the XCELLENT study that, rather than other antihypertensive agents,&#xD;
           amlodipine was the only agent significantly decreasing patients' BP variability in both&#xD;
           24-hour and beat-to-beat settings, partly through ameliorating the autonomic nervous&#xD;
           system (ANS) [18,19]. Renal denervation therapy is to denervate sympathetic nerve&#xD;
           surrounding bilateral renal arteries by radiofrequency, so theoretically, this treatment&#xD;
           many potentially have impact on patient's ANS, and further on patients' BP variability.&#xD;
           With the development of 24-hour aortic ABPM named MOBIL-O-GRAPH, which is now&#xD;
           commercially available and validated by invasive methods [20], we may investigate the&#xD;
           impact of renal denervation not only on 24-hour brachial BP variability but also on&#xD;
           24-hour aortic BP variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aortic blood pressure Several investigations indicated the superiority of central BP to&#xD;
           brachial BP in the association with target organ damage [21,22], so it is interesting to&#xD;
           investigate the efficacy of renal denervation not only on brachial BP but also on&#xD;
           central BP. Some investigations indicated that renal denervation also reduced patients'&#xD;
           aortic BP and augmentation index [15,23]. However, with the development of 24-hour&#xD;
           aortic ABPM as mentioned before, it makes more sense to investigate the influence of&#xD;
           renal denervation on ambulatory aortic BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Asymptomatic target organ damage As indicated by the HTN-1/2, even evaluated by 24-hour&#xD;
           ABPM, the renal denervation therapy decreased patients' BP by 20/12 mmHg for&#xD;
           systolic/diastolic BP, respectively [6]. Many asymptomatic target organ damages (TOD)&#xD;
           were actually BP-related, so if this novel treatment would have impact on patients' TOD,&#xD;
           including pulse wave velocity (PWV), echocardiograph-diagnosed and&#xD;
           electrocardiograph-diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), carotid intima-media&#xD;
           thickness (IMT) and plaque, and microalbuminuria, is still unknown, or even involving&#xD;
           some not established target organ damage, such as cardiac remodeling or left ventricular&#xD;
           diastolic dysfunction. Some investigators indicted the effect of renal denervation on&#xD;
           PWV [16], left ventricular mass and diastolic dysfunction [24], but a systematic&#xD;
           investigation on the efficacy of renal denervation on those BP-related target organ&#xD;
           damage is still warranted.&#xD;
