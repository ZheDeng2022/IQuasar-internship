  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effectiveness of the combination of stereotactic radiation&#xD;
      therapy and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma that has spread to four or fewer&#xD;
      sites in the body (oligometastatic). Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely give&#xD;
      a either a single large dose of radiation therapy to a tumor or several large doses of&#xD;
      radiation therapy to a tumor using precision and accuracy that is guided by onboard daily&#xD;
      imaging prior to radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block&#xD;
      tumor growth in different ways. Some monoclonal antibodies find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together&#xD;
      with ipilimumab may kill more tumor cells by causing addition melanoma antigens to be&#xD;
      presented to the immune system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with oligometastatic melanoma&#xD;
      treated with the combination of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) (stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery) and ipilimumab in patients with oligometastatic melanoma using modified World&#xD;
      Health Organization (mWHO) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival of the combination of SABR and 3 mg/kg&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with oligometastatic melanoma using immune related response criteria&#xD;
      (irRC) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the tolerability and safety of the combination. III. To evaluate the response&#xD;
      rate based on mWHO &amp; irRC criteria. IV. To evaluate the local control rate. V. To evaluate&#xD;
      the overall survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate changes in blood and serum markers: absolute lymphocyte count, T-cell activation&#xD;
      markers, T-cell suppression markers, T-helper cells and related cytokines, T-regulatory&#xD;
      (T-reg) markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and serum cytokines when SABR is added to the&#xD;
      ipilimumab regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations in key melanoma genes and their&#xD;
      correlation with response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 4, 7, and&#xD;
      10. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 total doses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. At approximately 5-6 weeks, patients undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery over 2-3 days per week. Patients with stable disease or confirmed&#xD;
      partial or complete response after completion of ipilimumab therapy at week 12 may receive&#xD;
      re-induction ipilimumab at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.&#xD;
