  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is in response to RFA-AA-12-008, Evaluation of NIAAA's Alcohol Screening Guide&#xD;
      for Children and Adolescents. Of particular interest to the agency are evaluation of the&#xD;
      Screener in clinical and/or other settings to predict alcohol-related consequences including&#xD;
      use disorder; its use as an initial screen for drug use, cigarette smoking, conduct disorder,&#xD;
      and unprotected sex; and its performance in making predictions concurrently and&#xD;
      prospectively. This proposal targets these areas of interest. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will study implementation of the Brief Intervention (BI) associated with the Screener. There&#xD;
      is a great need for both screening and BI in juvenile probation settings as many of these&#xD;
      youths have great need but are underserved.Many probation departments are turning to BI to&#xD;
      work with probationers and parolees. Screening and BI has demonstrated efficacy in these&#xD;
      settings, and yet no randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate effectiveness&#xD;
      in juvenile probation settings. Probation Officers (POs; n=40) are randomized to Screener&#xD;
      (S), Screener+BI (SBI), or coaching (CSBI). Youths (N=1000) are randomized to 1 of these 3&#xD;
      conditions, and all receive usual services (US). US consist of regular check-in with PO and&#xD;
      access to referral services as needed (counseling, academic tutoring, etc.). Research&#xD;
      staffers conduct in-depth assessment at baseline, 6- and 12- months. Sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and positive and negative predictive powers (SN, SP, PP, NP) are calculated to&#xD;
      predict alcohol risk and consequences, as well as other risky behaviors concurrently and&#xD;
      prospectively across age-groups. A 1-way design (S vs SBI vs CSBI) will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether SBI and CSBI enhance youth services-use and reduce risks (e.g., alcohol use, risky&#xD;
      sex). We examine moderators of outcomes (youth age, PO characteristics) and whether coaching&#xD;
      (an important consideration in implementation science) in use of BI improves outcomes. This&#xD;
      study will be the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of SBI in a&#xD;
      juvenile probation setting.&#xD;

      1. A) To evaluate SN, SP, PP and NP of the 2-question Alcohol Screener to detect: a)&#xD;
           alcohol problems (academic, social, injuries, intoxicated driving, unprotected sex), b)&#xD;
           abuse/dependence, c) past 4 week binge drinking. 1B) This will be repeated to predict&#xD;
           risk prospectively over 12 months. Classification rates will be compared for race,&#xD;
           ethnicity, gender, and age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A) To evaluate SN, SP, PP and NP of the 2-question Screener to detect a) 30-day drug&#xD;
           use, b) 30-day cigarette use, c) conduct disorder, d) unprotected sex. 2B) This will be&#xD;
           repeated to predict risk prospectively over 12 months. Classification rates will be&#xD;
           compared for race, ethnicity, gender, and age groups. 3) To evaluate BI as compared to&#xD;
           usual procedures. The investigators hypothesize those youths in BI will a) receive more&#xD;
           services, b) be more satisfied with services, c) rate the relationship with the PO more&#xD;
           highly, and d) have improved outcomes (alcohol, alcohol-related problems, problem&#xD;
           recognition).&#xD;

It is well known, reliable and valid (Harrison &amp; McKee, 2008; Carey et al, 2004). Days/month used, and binge-drinking are obtained. For analyses involving classification rates, binge &gt;&#xD;
1 is considered problematic, and definitions of binge will follow Donovan (2009).&#xD;
