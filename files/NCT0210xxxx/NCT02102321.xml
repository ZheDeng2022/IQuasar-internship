      Treatment of hookworm infected groups with albendazole has been shown to result in an&#xD;
      increase in hemoglobin levels and a related decrease in the prevalence of anemia. Increases&#xD;
      in hemoglobin levels due to treatment have been associated with significant gains in adult&#xD;
      labor productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that regular treatment of women smallholder&#xD;
      farmers in a high prevalence area with the anti-hookworm drug albendazole and iron&#xD;
      supplementation will improve hookworm associated anemia. Further, regular treatment of&#xD;
      albendazole and iron supplementation will improve their work capacity when compared to a&#xD;
      control group&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DRC has one of the world's highest prevalences (frequencies) of Soil Transmitted Helminths&#xD;
      (STH), a group of intestinal parasites that include Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm, each of&#xD;
      which can have significant impacts on the health and nutritional status of children.(1)(2)(3)&#xD;
      In addition, hookworm, because of prevalence increases noted during adulthood in many&#xD;
      countries and because of its relationship to significant intestinal blood loss, can also have&#xD;
      a significant impact on the health and nutritional status of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hookworm spreads easily in places without adequate control of feces; hookworm eggs are&#xD;
      excreted in feces of infected people, transition to larvae, and usually enter the body&#xD;
      through the skin on the bottom of the feet of other people who are not wearing footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of hookworm's health impact is mediated through intestinal blood loss as hookworms&#xD;
      attach to the human intestinal wall and digest the hemoglobin in human red blood cells. That&#xD;
      blood loss leads to - or exacerbates - iron deficiency and eventually to iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia (IDA). Because of menstrual blood losses, the large iron demands of pregnancy, and the&#xD;
      often low iron content of their diets, many women of childbearing age are at risk of iron&#xD;
      deficiency even without hookworm exposure. Any blood loss associated with hookworm infection&#xD;
      would exacerbate a pre-existing iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency with or without anemia has also been associated in several studies with lower&#xD;
      aerobic work capacity. IDA can effect an individual's ability to perform economic generating&#xD;
      tasks (work output) threaten one's livelihood and possibly food security. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) estimates an annual loss of 19.7 million disability-adjusted life years&#xD;
      (1.3% of the global total) is due to IDA with high burden in Africa (25%), an area which can&#xD;
      least afford it. The median annual economic loss due to IDA has been estimated at 4% of gross&#xD;
      domestic product in 10 different developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albendazole and Mebendazole are anti-helminthic drugs that that can cure or reduce the&#xD;
      severity (as measured by stool egg counts) of many hookworm infections. The major&#xD;
      programmatic use of these drugs is in programs of school-based mass drug administration (MDA)&#xD;
      as recommended treatment strategies have traditionally prioritized school-aged children.&#xD;
      Large amounts of these drugs are now being provided without charge by their manufacturers,&#xD;
      Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson respectively, and distributed through W.H.O. and ministries of&#xD;
      health to support current goals of control of pediatric hookworm and other STH infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of hookworm infected groups with Albendazole has been shown to result in an&#xD;
      increase in hemoglobin levels and a related decrease in the prevalence of anemia. Increases&#xD;
      in hemoglobin levels due to treatment have also been associated with significant gains in&#xD;
      adult labor productivity as measured in Kenyan road construction workers (16) and in&#xD;
      Bangladeshi women plantation tea pickers. However, the cure or amelioration of hookworm&#xD;
      infection caused by these drugs is not permanent; re-infection can occur within weeks or&#xD;
      months in heavily exposed people. Few studies have measured work productivity beyond 2-3&#xD;
      months and minimal information is available for longer term treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is in response to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges&#xD;
      Explorations RFP targeted specifically at &quot;Labor Saving Strategies and Innovations for Women&#xD;
      Smallholder Farmers.&quot; As hookworm in endemic areas is thought to be one of the primary causes&#xD;
      of IDA and IDA is known to decrease work productivity, then subsistence farmers will ideally&#xD;
      report improved productivity if hookworm is treated. Although the benefits of this proposed&#xD;
      intervention are not directly targeted at that specific goal, i.e., are not intended to&#xD;
      reduce the amount of necessary labor, the benefits of this intervention could lead indirectly&#xD;
      to the same result(s) through an increase of women's ability to accomplish a fixed amount of&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Democratic Republic of Congo is thought to be an appropriate location as it has one of&#xD;
      the world's highest burdens of NTD disease with an estimated 31 million hookworm cases,&#xD;
      second only to Nigeria for disease prevalence in Africa. The population is also particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable as moderate to heavy hookworm infections has been associated with lower hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels (in both children and adults) and thus with a greater risk of iron deficiency and&#xD;
      anemia. DRC has also been identified by USAID as a country in need of urgent NTD disease&#xD;
      surveillance and control activities. Information from this study will ideally extend&#xD;
      understanding of this disease process and provide information regarding inclusion of&#xD;
      anthelmintic treatment in maternal and other public health packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine whether regular treatment of women&#xD;
      smallholder farmers with the anti-hookworm drug Albendazole over a one-year period would have&#xD;
      an impact on their work capacity and possible productivity as small farmers. The intention is&#xD;
      to identify and enroll in an intervention study a group of women smallholder farmers who are&#xD;
      not pregnant in their first trimester of pregnancy, are not acutely ill with malaria, and&#xD;
      living in areas with poor sanitation and with endemic hookworm. Many of these women would&#xD;
      presumably be iron deficient, at least in part due to the blood loss associated with hookworm&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine prevalence of hookworm infection in the Safe Motherhood cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the prevalence of anemia in the Safe Motherhood cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the change in Hemoglobin of female subsistence small farmers who have been&#xD;
           treated with Albendazole and daily iron supplementation at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the change in work tolerance as measured by the STEP test when female&#xD;
           subsistence small farmers have been given Albenzazole and iron supplementation at 6 and&#xD;
           12 months&#xD;
