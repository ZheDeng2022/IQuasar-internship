      The Quit &amp; Fit intervention will be designed as a 12-week study to promote smoking cessation,&#xD;
      increase physical activity levels, and reduce weight gain through regular exercise and&#xD;
      healthy nutrition for African American Women smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to the fitness intervention group or control groups by a computer.&#xD;

      1. * Purpose of project (one or two sentences): The feasibility phase of the proposed study&#xD;
           is comprised of a two-arm randomized pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
           satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of 'Quit &amp; Fit'. Women (N=40) will receive 12&#xD;
           weekly smoking cessation telephone counseling sessions. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
           to either a fitness intervention (Quit &amp; Fit) or a contact time control (Quit for Life).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. * Study design (for example, hypothesis, research questions, standard and experimental&#xD;
           procedures/drugs/devices or equipment, etc.):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Quit &amp; Fit intervention will be designed as a 12-week, tailored multiple health&#xD;
           outcome intervention to promote smoking cessation, achieve energy balance, and reduce&#xD;
           post-cessation weight gain through regular PA and healthy nutrition for AAW smokers.&#xD;
           Culturally tailored comprehensive interventions that address smoking-cessation and&#xD;
           obesity/weight-control among AAW are needed. The conceptual basis of the proposal is&#xD;
           Albert Bandura's social cognitive Theory (SCT), which posits that people learn through&#xD;
           observation and modeling of behaviors, attitudes, and emotional reactions. When applied&#xD;
           to smoking cessation and health behavior change, social learning can be viewed as a&#xD;
           transition through stages of increased knowledge, self-efficacy, and social support,&#xD;
           culminating in readiness to change behaviors. The SCT model allows for targeting of&#xD;
           factors relevant to a given individual and tailoring messages to each each participant's&#xD;
           cultural values. Participants will be randomized into one of the study groups: the&#xD;
           'control arm' or the 'exercise arm'. Both groups will receive 12 weeks of smoking&#xD;
           cessation counseling, telephone counseling and and will receive 10 weeks of nicotine&#xD;
           replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of nicotine lozenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who are randomized to the 'control arm' will be asked to maintain their&#xD;
           current daily activities for 12 weeks. They will also be required to visit the study&#xD;
           site 3 times per week for 12 weeks to view videos on different wellness topics. Control&#xD;
           participants will have anthropometric measurements of weight, height, hip size and waist&#xD;
           size taken at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. Control participants&#xD;
           will also have a fitness test on a treadmill, full body scan, blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
           and questionnaires given at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks and at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who are randomized to the 'intervention arm' will be asked to come to the&#xD;
           study site to exercise 3 days per week for 12 weeks. The exercise duration will increase&#xD;
           over time from 75 minutes per week to 150 minutes per week. Intervention participants&#xD;
           will have anthropometric measurements of weight, height, hip size and waist size taken&#xD;
           at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. Intervention participants will&#xD;
           also have a fitness test on a treadmill, full body scan, blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
           questionnaires given at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks and at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed design of the intervention is to provide high does of education, support,&#xD;
           NR, and structured exercise to optimize success experiences that can build self-doses in&#xD;
           the first sessions. As the intervention progresses, support through mobile phones will&#xD;
           be used to assist with problem solving and social support as participants transition to&#xD;
           self-management. Content will be based on the extant literature on tobacco cessation,&#xD;
           nutrition, and exercise interventions, with emphasis given to published descriptions of&#xD;
           interventions tailored for AAW. Examples of resources from which content may be drawn&#xD;
           include Commit to Quit, Smoke Free Woman (NCI), Pathways to Freedom (2003 version), and&#xD;
           the Diabetes Prevention Program. Key content messages will be developed for each&#xD;
           counseling session. all print materials will be specifically targeted with visual images&#xD;
           and content that has been found to engage AAW. Focus groups will be conducted with women&#xD;
           representing the targeting population in order to develop the messages and visual&#xD;
           content. These qualitative data will be critical in the development of intervention&#xD;
           materials that engage and connect with the women. Focus groups will be conducted during&#xD;
           the first 3 months of the award, with the primary goal of furthering tailoring&#xD;
           intervention materials and protocols to the lives of African-American women residing in&#xD;
           urban District of Columbia (DC) neighborhoods. A total of 4 groups will be run with 8&#xD;
           women in each. The demographic makeup of the groups will resemble that of our target&#xD;
           population on such factors as educational attainment and socio-economic status (SES).&#xD;
           Participants will be recruited through outreach methods (flyers, community talks) used&#xD;
           successfully by Dr. Adams-Campbell's community lab. The multiple principal investigators&#xD;
           (MPIs) will refine the focus group facilitator's guide and review focus group&#xD;
           transcripts and notes to maintain protocol integrity. Open-ended questions will probe&#xD;
           views on target health behaviors as well as preferred information delivery modalities&#xD;
           and ways to remain in contact and provide optimal support. All focus groups will be&#xD;
           audio-taped, with a research assistant taking notes at each of the sessions. Audiotapes&#xD;
           will then be transcribed and translated in order to analyze their content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. * Rationale and justification for study (i.e. historical background, investigator's&#xD;
           personal experience, pertinent medical literature, etc.): Smoking is the leading cause&#xD;
           of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. African Americans experience clear&#xD;
           disparities in disease and death from smoking. African American women (AAW) are an&#xD;
           important subgroup to study because they are distinct from non-AAW and their male&#xD;
           African American counterparts on biopsychosocial factors that are relevant to smoking&#xD;
           behavior. In particular, AAW have lower smoking rates compared to Caucasian women (CAW)&#xD;
           yet similar lung cancer rates. Additional evidence indicates that AAW are more likely to&#xD;
           develop cancer of the larynx, esophageal cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease than CAW. African American smokers are less likely to be screened&#xD;
           by providers for tobacco use, receive advice to quit, or use cessation aids during a&#xD;
           quit attempt, even after controlling for health service use and socioeconomic factors.&#xD;
           Smoking cessation is the single most important preventative health behavior AAW can&#xD;
           engage in to significantly reduce their chances of morbidity and premature mortality&#xD;
           related to smoking related illnesses. Due to their disparate smoking-related health&#xD;
           outcomes, targeted and tailored smoking cessation interventions are extremely critical&#xD;
           for AAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the disease burden of tobacco use, sedentary lifestyles and obesity pose&#xD;
      heightened concerns for chronic diseases such as diabetes and vascular disease among AAW. In&#xD;
      2008, AAW had higher incidence of and mortality attributed to coronary heart disease, stroke,&#xD;
      heart failure, and high blood pressure, as compared to non-Hispanic Whites or Hispanics.&#xD;
      Energy balance is defined as the balance between energy taken in, generally by food and&#xD;
      drink, and energy expanded. Lifestyle behaviors strongly linked to obesity are taken in,&#xD;
      generally by low levels of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) or high consumption rates&#xD;
      of high-fat or energy-dense diets, or both. African Americans have been found to have&#xD;
      different dietary traditions than Caucasians and to consume a higher percentage of calories&#xD;
      from fat even after controlling for individual characteristics and neighborhood SES. Despite&#xD;
      robust evidence of the cancer-protective and health promoting influence of physical activity&#xD;
      (PA), more than 50% of Americans do not engage in adequate levers of PA. A recent study&#xD;
      identified both physical inactivity and smoking as two health behaviors for which relative&#xD;
      inequalities are increasing among those with less formal education compared with those with&#xD;
      more. SES-related obesity disparities are also increasing in women and among African&#xD;
      Americans. There is indeed a public health call for evidence-based research on both&#xD;
      regionally and culturally targeted energy balance strategies that can effectively reach and&#xD;
      engage African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly all evidence-based smoking cessation programs address the importance of post-cessation&#xD;
      weight gain through dietary choices and PA. However, these issues are not typically&#xD;
      emphasized as centrally important to the likelihood of success of the cessation attempt.&#xD;
      Likewise, weight control programs and initiatives that promote PA give only minimal attention&#xD;
      to tobacco cessation. Questions remain about the most effective ways to implement&#xD;
      interventions that simultaneously address multiple health behaviors. However, evidence&#xD;
      continues to emerge to suggest that such interventions are not only feasible, but have&#xD;
      advantages over approaches that focus on a single health promotion behavior. A targeted&#xD;
      multiple health outcome intervention has promise to change health behaviors that will lead to&#xD;
      improved health and ultimately reduce cancer death disparities among AAW. Culturally tailored&#xD;
      comprehensive interventions that address smoking-cessation and obesity/weight-control among&#xD;
      AAW are needed. This pilot project seeks to develop a combined health promotion intervention&#xD;
      tailored for urban AAW smokers. &quot;Quit &amp; Fit&quot; will be designed as a 12-week program to promote&#xD;
      smoking cessation and achieve energy balance through regular PA and healthy nutrition. The&#xD;
      first several weeks of the intervention will provide maximum structured in-person support&#xD;
      which will be tapered over time and followed by tailored mobile phone sessions to provide&#xD;
      ongoing support, counseling, and assist with the transition from initial structured&#xD;
      counseling to self-management. The program will employ evidence-based strategies that meet&#xD;
      the needs and preferences of AAW in an urban environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have focused on the various health problems we aim to target, but in the other&#xD;
      studies, these interventions have focused on only one aspect of the problem, e.g., smoking&#xD;
      cessation alone or PA alone. The success of the proposed multiple health outcome intervention&#xD;
      would also contribute novel findings to addressing the leading health behaviors (tobacco use,&#xD;
      PA, diet) associated with morbidity and mortality among minority and low-income populations&#xD;
      in this country. The opportunity to engage women at one time across multiple behaviors in a&#xD;
      targeted and cost-effective way has significant implications. Moreover, the use of technology&#xD;
      (cell phones) to provide support for adherence to the programs is at the cutting edge of&#xD;
      health care delivery. Cell phones are a cost-effective way to maintain contact with, and&#xD;
      provide support to difficult-to-engage patients. As reviewed, tailored messages delivered by&#xD;
      phone have been found effective to change energy balance among urban African Americans.&#xD;
      Moreover, the focus of the study on building self-efficacy through structured exercise and&#xD;
      counseling in the initial sessions and then providing support transitioning behaviors from&#xD;
      the structured sessions to the home environments is a unique design that can optimize&#xD;
      retention and sustained behavior change. This program could have a profound impact on&#xD;
      reducing tobacco-related health disparities with important implications for developing&#xD;
      cost-efficient ways of engaging this and many other patient populations.&#xD;
