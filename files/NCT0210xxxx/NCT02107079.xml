  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, is mainly regulated by melatonin. The synthesis&#xD;
      of melatonin is stimulated by the absence of light, leading to peak serum levels before&#xD;
      bedtime. In humans, this endogenous &quot;signaling&quot; neurohormone induces sleep. Exogenous&#xD;
      melatonin can be beneficial in different sleep disturbances including delayed sleep phase&#xD;
      insomnia, melatonin- deficiency-related insomnia (especially in elderly) and shift work sleep&#xD;
      disorder. Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high&#xD;
      first pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent&#xD;
      exposure of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a&#xD;
      short Tmax and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined.&#xD;
      This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper formulation for oral and&#xD;
      oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating the Tmax and relative&#xD;
      bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers after&#xD;
      administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg melatonin immediate release&#xD;
      capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate release tablet (produced by&#xD;
      Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet (produced by Vemedia&#xD;
      Manufacturing BV).&#xD;

      The circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, is mainly regulated by melatonin. The synthesis&#xD;
      of melatonin is stimulated by the absence of light, leading to peak serum levels before&#xD;
      bedtime. In humans, this endogenous &quot;signaling&quot; neurohormone induces sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exogenous melatonin can be beneficial in different sleep disturbances including delayed sleep&#xD;
      phase insomnia (Dahlitz et al. 1991, Regestein et al. 1995), melatonin- deficiency-related&#xD;
      insomnia (especially in elderly) (Garfinkel 1995, Etzioni et al. 1995) and shift work sleep&#xD;
      disorder (Folkard et al. 1993, Skene et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial of van Geijlswijk et al. (van Geijlswijk 2010) showed that no&#xD;
      relationship could be demonstrated between melatonin dose (0.05-0.15 mg/kg) and shift of&#xD;
      sleep onset time (SOT), shortening of sleep onset latency (SOL) and shift of dim light&#xD;
      melatonin (DLMO). On the other hand, the timing of melatonin administration did have a&#xD;
      clinically and statistically significant effect on all three parameters. Timing of melatonin&#xD;
      administration in relation to baseline DLMO determines the phase advance, as can be measured&#xD;
      by the shift of DLMO and SOT to an earlier time in the evening, resulting also in a shorter&#xD;
      SOL. Melatonin must be administered in a closely defined time-slot before endogenous DLMO and&#xD;
      before bedtime. The phase advance occurs when melatonin is administered 1-2 hours before DLMO&#xD;
      and bedtime (van Geijlswijk et al. 2010). This trial demonstrated that low dosage of&#xD;
      melatonin (0.05mg/kg) is effective in children when given at least 1-2 hours before the&#xD;
      individual DLMO and the desired bedtime. This means that the release of melatonin from any&#xD;
      pharmaceutical formulation should occur fast enough in order to achieve predictive high&#xD;
      levels within the desired time-slot before the occurrence of (baseline) DLMO to induce a&#xD;
      phase advance. These high maximum serum levels shortly after administration (Tmax) means the&#xD;
      release rate of melatonin from the formulation needs to be as fast as possible and the&#xD;
      bioavailability needs to be as high as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high first&#xD;
      pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent exposure&#xD;
      of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a short Tmax&#xD;
      and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined. Thereby,&#xD;
      the bioavailability must be made less variable in order to understand the biologic effects of&#xD;
      melatonin (Di 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/objective. This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper&#xD;
      formulation for oral and oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating&#xD;
      the Tmax and relative bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers after administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg&#xD;
      melatonin immediate release capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate&#xD;
      release tablet (produced by Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet&#xD;
      (produced by Vemedia Manufacturing BV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-design. Three-phased cross-overstudy. Study-population. The study population will&#xD;
      consist of 10 healthy volunteers (male) aged 18 to 35 years old without insomnia. They will&#xD;
      be recruited in the Netherlands. Intervention. The intervention starts between 10:00 and&#xD;
      11:00 am when the participant flushes his mouth with water, waits 15 minutes and starts to&#xD;
      chew on a cotton plug during 1 minute. Directly after that the participant will administer&#xD;
      one of the IMP's according to the instructions. The tablet and capsule will be swallowed. The&#xD;
      sublingual tablet will be administered sublingual. 10 minutes after administration the&#xD;
      subjects will drink one glass of water and subsequently try to swallow as much liquid&#xD;
      (including saliva), in order to prevent contamination of the saliva sample with the remaining&#xD;
      exogenous melatonin. At 15 minutes, 30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after oral&#xD;
      administration the participant will chew on new cotton plugs during 1 minute. After&#xD;
      administration of the sublingual tablet saliva samples will be collected at 25 minutes, 40&#xD;
      minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after sublingual administration. 15&#xD;
      minutes before each sampling the subject will flush his mouth with water. The cotton plugs&#xD;
      with salivary will be preserved in a test-tube in the freezer and will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Ziekenhuis Gelderse Vallei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint: the Tmax and relative bioavailability of oral and oromucosal melatonin&#xD;
      derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will burden the participants in a small extent. As mentioned before, melatonin is&#xD;
      well tolerated and is not reported to have a hangover effect. Its rarely occurring side&#xD;
      effects include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, mild drowsiness, hypothermia and headache (Wagner&#xD;
      1998, Waldhauser 1990, Dahlitz 1991, Garfinkel 1995, Dollins 1994). Besides that, the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to perform simple actions during 3 intervention days for only 3&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz table is available without prescription in&#xD;
      drugstores in the Netherlands. The tablet will also contain low dosage of melatonin,&#xD;
      respectively 1mg and the capsule will contain regular dose of melatonin (2,5mg). These&#xD;
      dosages are safe for adults and children. A few reports have been published on the&#xD;
      consequences of long-term treatment with melatonin in humans. (Severe) adverse events were&#xD;
      not described in these reports. (Van Geijlswijk 2011, Jan et al. 1996, Jan et al. 1994,&#xD;
      Gilberg et al. 1997, Smits et al. 2001, Arendt 2000).&#xD;
