      This study aims to investigate the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS) in reducing the symptoms of pain and numbness and improve the daily lives of cancer&#xD;
      patients who have Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) results from damage or dysfunction of the&#xD;
      peripheral nerves and is one of the most common side effects of antineoplastic chemotherapy&#xD;
      when neurotoxic drugs are used. Pain and paresthesia symptoms are prevalent, causing chronic&#xD;
      discomfort and loss of functional abilities whilst also interfering negatively with quality&#xD;
      of life and the patient's autonomy. In a pilot study of patients with CIPN, there was&#xD;
      evidence that Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) improved the painful&#xD;
      symptoms of patients with CIPN. This study aims to investigate the effects of TENS in&#xD;
      reducing the symptoms of pain and numbness and improve the daily lives of cancer patients who&#xD;
      have CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Primary Objectives Evaluate the effects of TENS in the reduction of symptoms related to&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy treatment of a high and moderate neurotoxic&#xD;
      potential in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in symptoms of&#xD;
           paresthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in activities of&#xD;
           the daily lives of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of TENS with frequency variation (FV) in symptoms of&#xD;
           neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the factors associated with better treatment response in paresthesia, in pain&#xD;
           and activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria: The participants of the research will include patients with any cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis who are being subjected to chemotherapy in either adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy,&#xD;
      containing in its protocol at least one chemotherapeutic drug of moderate and high neurotoxic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the research will receive TENS within the following parameters: VF mode&#xD;
      TENS with a variable frequency between 7 Hz and 65 Hz. It has a pulse width of 200 µs, this&#xD;
      is the highest tolerable intensity while still remaining comfortable for the patient. It has&#xD;
      an application time of 60 minutes with the highest tolerable intensity, while still remaining&#xD;
      comfortable for the patient. The treatment will be given on the same day as the chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and will be given from home within 3 cycles. The participants will be divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
      Experimental Group (EG) who will be administering the active TENS and the Control Group (CG)&#xD;
      who will be administering the placebo TENS. The evaluation of the effects will be measured&#xD;
      through the following instruments: Classification of neuropathy by the CTCAE (Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.02 2009, scale of functionality ECOG, the&#xD;
      Questionnaire of Neurotoxicity Induced by Antineoplastics (QNIA) for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      symptoms of CIPN, and the Analogue Visual Scale (AVS) to assess the symptoms of pain and&#xD;
      paresthesia. The error α is estimated at 5%.&#xD;
