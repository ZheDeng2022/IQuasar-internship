      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broad objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is planned to understand prevalence and practices related to tobacco use&#xD;
      among workers of the informal sector of Zari Industry and to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of effective strategies of a programmatic approach towards tobacco use&#xD;
      prevention and cessation intervention model in this by assessment of pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention knowledge, attitude and perception of tobacco use, followed by offering&#xD;
      education and cessation and finally assessing the impact and outcomes by changes in the&#xD;
      attitudes towards tobacco use and quit rates among tobacco users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess knowledge and understand the practices related to tobacco use among the Zari&#xD;
           workers' population using qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To implement a multicomponent community-based intervention model through trained health&#xD;
           workers in an unorganized workplace setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess any change in the Knowledge Attitude and Practices related to tobacco use at&#xD;
           post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine tobacco cessation rates at the end of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide oral screening service to the target groups at the end of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a LOCAL -language tobacco use prevention and cessation training module to train&#xD;
           counsellors in tobacco cessation interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, community-based randomized controlled design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Community based Zari work units of three urban slum pockets in Mumbai&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three distinct urban slum communities in Mumbai where Zari units operate will be identified.&#xD;
      Each of the slum community will serve as three arms of the trial, with one geographic cluster&#xD;
      / community serving as the intervention community for moderate intensity intervention, second&#xD;
      cluster /community for low intensity intervention and the third cluster/community serving as&#xD;
      the control arm with no intervention. These communities will be recruited on the basis of&#xD;
      comparable socio-demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools of Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre designed structured baseline questionnaire will be prepared to understand the&#xD;
      determinants that trigger the onset of tobacco use, dynamics of regular use of tobacco and&#xD;
      factors that motivate the user to quit tobacco. Written informed consent will be taken from&#xD;
      all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire at baseline will be administered in local language before the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention and will be repeated after 1 year with the same sample at&#xD;
      end to assess the efficacy of the intervention. The questionnaire will be administered by a&#xD;
      trained interviewer as per the convenience of the respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A community-based multi-component intervention model developed, will be&#xD;
      implemented and evaluated in the intervention community. The intervention model will address&#xD;
      numerous socio-environmental and intra-personal factors that trigger the onset of tobacco use&#xD;
      and other determinants that influence tobacco cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Awareness &amp; Education on Tobacco use prevention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interactive activities, pre-tested posters, in addition, pictorial handouts, booklets&#xD;
           and pamphlets will be distributed for knowledge enhancement by trained social workers.&#xD;
           The first interaction with the workers will involve an elaborate common education&#xD;
           programme on harms of tobacco use, tobacco use prevention and benefits of tobacco&#xD;
           cessation, by an audio visual presentation and distribution of pamphlets for knowledge&#xD;
           enhancement by trained social workers. All participants will be assessed for their&#xD;
           tobacco use status prior to the intervention. The participants with history of current&#xD;
           tobacco use in any form will then be enrolled for further interventions for tobacco&#xD;
           cessation. A structured questionnaire detailing information on sociodemographic&#xD;
           variables with medical and other risk factors with complete assessment of their tobacco&#xD;
           habit will be entered by medical social workers. All participants will be assessed for&#xD;
           their tobacco use status at all interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Focus Group discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This tobacco cessation intervention session with the tobacco users after three months of&#xD;
           the first contact program will involve thirty minutes of focus group discussion with&#xD;
           group behavioral therapy in groups of 5-10 individuals for reinforcement of tobacco use&#xD;
           prevention and cessation advice. Group discussion is intended to improve understanding&#xD;
           by exploring, sharing and reflecting psychosocial, familial, environmental issues which&#xD;
           attribute to the problem. Members of the group are encouraged to exchange information&#xD;
           and ideas about the perceived barriers towards tobacco cessation. Techniques like&#xD;
           reflecting, exploring and re-evaluation will be used to identify their problem to&#xD;
           improve insight and reinforce attitudinal change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individual tobacco cessation counseling sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iindividual counseling is commonly used to help people who are trying to quit tobacco. The&#xD;
      counseling adopting a interactive problem-solving approach will be done by trained Medical&#xD;
      Social Workers providing face-to-face sessions for 10-15 minutes per participant,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medium Intensity Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Medium intensity arm will implement the multi-component program with three contact&#xD;
           programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           I. First Contact program: Group health education session II. Second Contact program:&#xD;
           Focus Group Discussion III. Third Contact program: Brief Individual Counseling session&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low Intensity Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single contact session with Group health education session will be provided to the&#xD;
      participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Outcome Final outcome measure, the quit rates as self reported tobacco abstinence will&#xD;
      be assessed at the end of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral cancer screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the Zari workers will also be invited for oral cancer screening at the end of&#xD;
      intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral cancer screening to detect clinically recognizable precancerous lesions (leukoplakia,&#xD;
      erythroplakia and oral submucous fibrosis) and asymptomatic early invasive lesions will be&#xD;
      done by trained Primary Health Workers. Visual examination of the oral cavity with good light&#xD;
      source like halogen flashlight, is a simple approach to detect asymptomatic oral cancers and&#xD;
      precancerous lesions. The performance characteristics of this test are satisfactory in terms&#xD;
      of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value therefore, it is a suitable screening test&#xD;
      for oral cancer. One large study from Kerala has shown that screening by visual inspection of&#xD;
      the mouth by trained health workers may potentially reduce mortality in high risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical findings will be recorded as 1. Normal; 2. Benign or non cancerous lesions such&#xD;
      as fissures in the tongue, aphthous ulcer, black patch, tobacco-related blanching, fibroma,&#xD;
      hypertrophied papillae, etc.; and 3. Pre cancer lesions if found to have a white patch,&#xD;
      ulcerated white patch, verrucous lesion, submucous fibrosis, red patch, suspicious ulcer or&#xD;
      growth. All the above findings suspicious for oral precancer on screening evaluation will be&#xD;
      referred for further diagnostic evaluation by medical officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Active Intervention will be given in the control arm, but will distributed tobacco&#xD;
      awareness pamphlets in local languages. Only base line and end line survey assessment will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training as tobacco cessation counselors &amp; Development of Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and training of staff This involves the recruitment of project personnel and&#xD;
           their training. Training would involve the theoretical and practical teaching of&#xD;
           questionnaire/survey as well modular training for tobacco cessation counseling to the&#xD;
           project personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preparation of resource materials and questionnaire formats Resource materials would&#xD;
           include training module for tobacco use prevention and tobacco cessation techniques with&#xD;
           Individual and Group therapy sessions with pamphlets outlining the harmful effects of&#xD;
           tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two outcome measures used from the survey questionnaire were 'ever use' and 'current use'&#xD;
      of tobacco at baseline and endline. 'Ever users' were those who had consumed tobacco in any&#xD;
      form in their life time. 'Current users' were those who had consumed tobacco in any form in&#xD;
      the past one week. Current use at baseline and endline were compared to calculate the 'quit&#xD;
      rate' and 'rate of fresh uptake'. Quit rate of tobacco use among the communities will be&#xD;
      estimated as the proportion of workers who become non-users at endline from among those who&#xD;
      were current users in the baseline survey. Rate of fresh uptake will be estimated as the&#xD;
      proportion of workers who reported themselves as ever users or current users at endline from&#xD;
      among those who were never users at the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered and analyzed using SPSS version 18.3 The trial data will be analyzed on&#xD;
      an intention to treat basis and the participants will be included in the final analysis&#xD;
      irrespective of whether or not they could be followed up in all subsequent visits. Self&#xD;
      reported history will be taken as the main criteria to assess outcome of tobacco cessation.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify the factors promoting the use of tobacco&#xD;
      and quitting tobacco. The tobacco quit rates will be calculated as percentages. The post&#xD;
      intervention changes in the KAP of employees will be compared to the pre-intervention KAP.&#xD;
      Groups will be compared using non-parametric statistical techniques.&#xD;
