  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - There are very few documents to help young adults living with advanced cancer discuss their&#xD;
      concerns and end-of-life preferences. A new document, Voicing My CHOiCES, allows young adults&#xD;
      to explain what kind of care they would want if they became unable to communicate or make&#xD;
      medical decisions on their own. Researchers want to study if this document is helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study if Voicing My CHOiCES can reduce anxiety, improve sense of support, and improve&#xD;
      communication about advanced care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 to 39 years old being treated for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their age, gender, employment, religion,&#xD;
           health, and marital status. They will also complete several brief questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. General Anxiety Short Form&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Peace, Equanimity and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Functional Assessment of Social Support&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Quality of Communication&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Prior Communication about Advanced Care Planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then a health care professional will introduce Voicing My CHOiCES . Participants will&#xD;
           review the document and comment on parts they find relevant. They will also say if any&#xD;
           important items are missing. Participants will complete 3 pages of the document with the&#xD;
           assistance of a health care provider. They will be asked for positive and negative&#xD;
           observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second stage of the study will take place about 1 month later. Participants will&#xD;
           repeat the brief questionnaires listed above. They will be asked if they shared any of&#xD;
           the preferences they described when completing the 3 pages of Voicing My CHOiCES during&#xD;
           visit 1 with a family member, friend, or health care provider. Research staff will ask&#xD;
           the participant for permission to contact the people they spoke with in order to learn&#xD;
           whether their conversations about the document were helpful. They will ask for feedback&#xD;
           on how to make Voicing My CHOiCES more helpful.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussing end-of-life (EoL) care is very challenging for young adults (YA) living with a&#xD;
      life-threatening disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many helpful documents exist to facilitate EoL conversations with adults, few resources&#xD;
      exist to aid YA in understanding and accepting their changing physical, emotional and social&#xD;
      needs when treatment is no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2007-2011, the Pediatric Oncology Branch (07-C-0085) explored the helpfulness of Five&#xD;
      Wishes with adolescents and young adults living with HIV or advanced cancer. This research&#xD;
      led to the development of a new advance care planning (ACP) guide, Voicing My CHOiCES (VMC).&#xD;
      However, Voicing My CHOiCES has not been empirically examined in its completed form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the perceived helpfulness of VMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether engaging in advanced care planning using VMC is associated with reduced&#xD;
      anxiety, improved social support, increased acceptance of illness, and/or improved&#xD;
      communication about ACP with family, friends, and/or health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the helpfulness of the changes made to the original VMC as compared to the revised&#xD;
      VMC document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age: 18 through 39 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known cancer or other chronic illness and enrolled on an NIH protocol or treated at one of&#xD;
      the participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prior experience using Voicing My CHOiCES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled to assess the helpfulness of changes made to original VMC must be&#xD;
      English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and family/friend and health care providers must be English or Spanish speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete a baseline assessment of their anxiety pertaining to advance care&#xD;
      planning, quality of social support, acceptance of illness, and quality of communication with&#xD;
      family, friends and health care providers. They will be asked to review the advance care&#xD;
      planning document, Voicing My CHOiCES , and to comment on each section as to whether it can&#xD;
      provide an opportunity to address ACP needs for themselves and for other YA their age living&#xD;
      with a serious illness. They will also assess whether revisions are needed to the document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain the perspectives of different YA, the initial study arm included 200 participants,&#xD;
      27 YA who were living independently, 42 YA who have a child(ren) of their own, and 81 YA who&#xD;
      neither lived independently or had child(ren). In addition, up to 50 family/friends and&#xD;
      health care providers of the participants participated in the follow up assessment. Arm 2&#xD;
      will include up to 80 participants recruited, at the Clinical Center, The Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Hospital, and Rhode Island Hospital (Lifespan) to compare the original Voicing My CHOiCES to&#xD;
      the revised document. A total of up to 280 individuals may participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1-month pre-post design will be used to assess the utility of the document, anxiety,&#xD;
      quality of social support, acceptance of illness, communication about EoL planning, and&#xD;
      whether the patient participant has shared any of the work completed in the document with a&#xD;
      family member, friend, or health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant had shared the ACP preferences that were documented in Voicing My CHOiCES&#xD;
      with a family member or friend, and had consented for us to contact that person, we will&#xD;
      obtain the family member or friend s consent and complete a brief interview assessing the&#xD;
      helpfulness and limitations of Voicing My CHOiCES for ACP. If the participant had shared the&#xD;
      ACP preferences that were documented in Voicing My CHOiCES with their health care provider&#xD;
      and had consented for us to talk with that health care provider, a brief interview assessing&#xD;
      the helpfulness and limitations of Voicing My CHOiCES for end-of-life planning and whether&#xD;
      any changes in the participants health care was made in response to Voicing My CHOiCES , will&#xD;
      be documented.&#xD;
