  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional motor disorders, also called motor conversion disorder, are common reasons for&#xD;
      attendance at neurology outpatient clinics. Patients with functional motor disorders are more&#xD;
      common than patients with multiple sclerosis and have similar levels of disability but more&#xD;
      psychological morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited evidence for effective treatments in functional motor disorders. A small&#xD;
      number of studies of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a painless method of cortical&#xD;
      stimulation, have reported improvement in functional weakness after this treatment including&#xD;
      in patients with symptoms of several years duration. The Investigators intend to trial TMS in&#xD;
      a group of 40 patients with functional motor disorder, randomising patients to immediate or&#xD;
      delayed treatment and therefore comparing a single session of TMS with routine clinical care.&#xD;
      The Investigators will also ask patients to undergo tests of attentional focus in a cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience laboratory - these experiments will be analysed separately from TMS trial data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised non-blinded controlled study design will be used, with 3 months of treatment as&#xD;
      usual as the control condition and a single session of TMS as the treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients with functional unilateral upper limb weakness will be recruited from neurology&#xD;
      and neuropsychiatry clinics in Edinburgh and randomised to either immediate treatment or to 3&#xD;
      month delay during which they will receive routine clinical care. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      performed using computerised random number generator by a person not involved with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to delay will complete baseline measures of disability and motor function&#xD;
      including SF36, modified Rankin score and study specific questionnaires, and will repeat&#xD;
      these after 3 months. Patients undergoing immediate treatment will complete the same&#xD;
      questionnaires immediately before and 3 months after treatment. All individuals receiving TMS&#xD;
      treatment will undergo tests of grip strength and tapping frequency immediately before and&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment and experiments involved will be as follows. Patients will attend the PPLS&#xD;
      Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at George Square, University of Edinburgh for a single 2&#xD;
      hour session. During the first hour they will complete baseline symptom severity and&#xD;
      disability questionnaires and will undertake a series of 3 experiments. Experiments involve&#xD;
      participants sitting with their head on a chin-rest looking at either a computer screen or at&#xD;
      lights projected onto their own hands, and for one experiment with a vibrating 'buzzer' taped&#xD;
      to each hand. They will be asked to respond verbally in experiments which test their response&#xD;
      to distracting attentional 'cues' either visual or vibrotactile. These experiments will take&#xD;
      less than 1 hour. In anaylsis, performance will be compared between affected and unaffected&#xD;
      sides (ie left hand and right hand), and will also be compared with performance of a group of&#xD;
      15 healthy control participants recruited from spouses or partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participants will then receive treatment with 20 single pulses of TMS to the motor&#xD;
      cortex at 120% motor threshold. These will cause visible and palpable 'jerks' of the affected&#xD;
      limb. Between stimulations the researcher will offer verbal encouragement and ask the&#xD;
      participant to move the affected limb if possible. Treatment will take less than 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are patient-rated symptom severity and disability and simple&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be used to compare outcome after 3 months of treatment as normal&#xD;
      and 3 months after a single session of TMS treatment. Secondary outcome measures include grip&#xD;
      strength and tapping frequency before and after treatment. Data will be analysed on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis. Data from attentional tests will be analysed separately.&#xD;
