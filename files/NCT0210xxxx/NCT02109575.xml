      The primary goal of this Multicenter Study is to develop and to evaluate a method for&#xD;
      measuring donor-specific cell free DNA in blood samples from transplant recipients as markers&#xD;
      of rejection. Blood samples obtained periodically from heart transplant recipients are&#xD;
      assessed for cell free DNA relative to clinical data in order to determine whether changes in&#xD;
      the level of cell free DNA indicate rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study proposes testing a blood sample obtained from the heart transplant&#xD;
      recipient. The research seeks to establish whether this blood test will show when the patient&#xD;
      is beginning to or already rejecting the transplanted heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Identifying if a transplant patient is beginning to or already rejecting the heart&#xD;
      is necessary, so that appropriate treatment can be started to halt the rejection. Heart&#xD;
      catheterization with biopsy is the usual method used for assessing whether a patient may be&#xD;
      rejecting the heart. There are also a number of other methods that transplant physicians will&#xD;
      use to look for signs of rejection including other blood tests, echocardiograms, obtaining&#xD;
      pressure readings during heart catheterization, and micro-array testing of blood obtained&#xD;
      during biopsy. These technologies are limited in ability to consistently and accurately&#xD;
      identify the presence of rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual method of checking for rejection involves obtaining a sample of the heart tissue&#xD;
      (heart biopsy); biopsy can only be accomplished through heart catheterization which is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure that has risks associated with disturbing the heart such as puncturing the&#xD;
      heart or causing the heart rate to change or damaging tissue in the heart. Overtime,&#xD;
      repeating this invasive procedure can diminish the ease of the procedure because the veins&#xD;
      can become scarred and more difficult to access. For these reasons, researchers believe that&#xD;
      it would be good to have a blood test that gives information about the possibility of&#xD;
      rejection so that it may not be necessary to do as many heart biopsies. Also, a blood test&#xD;
      may be able to provide information about the heart or about rejection that is currently not&#xD;
      available at all.&#xD;

      Early detection of rejection is a major focus of organ transplant care. The use of aggressive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to alter the prognosis of heart transplant patients&#xD;
      who have acute rejection1. There are many modalities utilized in the routine surveillance of&#xD;
      heart transplant patients, each with limitations. Screening transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
      focusing on indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, along with regional wall&#xD;
      abnormalities, has been shown to have poor sensitivity and does not effectively discriminate&#xD;
      between patients with and without rejection. Newer echocardiographic parameters including&#xD;
      myocardial performance or diastolic velocity indices may be a better means of detecting&#xD;
      subtle changes in cardiac function in the setting of heart transplant, but these tools are&#xD;
      most helpful after the insult caused by rejection has already occurred. Hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      measured during heart catheterization have also been evaluated as a means of detecting&#xD;
      rejection. Rosenthal et al found that although there were statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between patients with higher or lower grades of rejection scores, heart&#xD;
      catheterization did not permit effective discrimination of patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      rejection. Heart biomarkers, including c-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptides, and&#xD;
      troponin, have been studied as non-invasive measures of determining heart dysfunction or&#xD;
      rejection. These surrogates are weakly associated with different rejection grades on biopsy&#xD;
      and have a poor predictive capacity for biopsy-detected rejection3. Recently, microarray&#xD;
      technology has been used to screen for genes expressed in heart allograft rejection using&#xD;
      peripheral leukocytes from blood samples obtained at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. This&#xD;
      technique was shown to have a high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection but it is unable to detect low grades of rejection4. Overall, these&#xD;
      technologies are limited in the ability to consistently and accurately predict the presence&#xD;
      of rejection and have low positive predictive values when compared to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard in detection of rejection is the use of endomyocardial biopsy.&#xD;
      Attaining these samples is invasive and long term repeated central venous access can be&#xD;
      difficult. Risk of endomyocardial biopsy includes perforation leading to cardiac tamponade,&#xD;
      arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and valvular&#xD;
      regurgitation secondary to rupture of chordae or damage to valve leaflets themselves. There&#xD;
      is variability in pathological interpretation of histologic grades, especially at higher&#xD;
      grades of rejection due to the difficulty in interpretation of nodular infiltrates. The 2005&#xD;
      revised ISHLT grading system has simplified the grading system of cellular rejection and now&#xD;
      includes assessment of antibody mediated rejection. This may improve the utility of&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsy, but much controversy still exists on the method of grading rejection&#xD;
      and its clinical implications. Thus, the development of a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      method that accurately predicts the presence of rejection is critical.&#xD;
