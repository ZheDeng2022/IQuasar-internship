  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on athletic performance, but the&#xD;
      findings have not been consistent. This is due, in part, to the differences in response that&#xD;
      has been observed both within and between studies. Previous research in our lab has shown&#xD;
      that genetic variations affecting caffeine metabolism modify the association between caffeine&#xD;
      and heart disease. We hypothesize that the inconsistencies among studies relating caffeine&#xD;
      and athletic performance may be due to genetic differences in caffeine metabolism or&#xD;
      response. Male athletes will take part in an intervention of caffeine versus placebo, using a&#xD;
      randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled design, which will test various exercise&#xD;
      protocols (power, strength, anaerobic capacity, endurance) that are associated with&#xD;
      performance across multiple sports. We will conduct a genome-wide association study, which is&#xD;
      an approach that involves scanning for markers across the genomes of our study participants&#xD;
      together, not individuals, to find genetic variations associated with a particular trait such&#xD;
      as VO2 max, lactate clearance efficiency, muscle fiber type and changes in exercise&#xD;
      performance following caffeine. We will also examine known genetic variations that are&#xD;
      associated with caffeine metabolism and response, to determine if these genes also affect&#xD;
      response to exercise after ingesting caffeine. Subjects will be paid $50.&#xD;

      Research Methods and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, within-subjects counter-measured study&#xD;
      design will include 100 male athletes from a variety of sports. Females will not be included&#xD;
      in this study because hormonal contraceptive use, which is common among female athletes, and&#xD;
      the time of the menstrual cycle have a significant effect on caffeine metabolism and exercise&#xD;
      test performance measures. Controlling for these factors would require a much larger pool of&#xD;
      participants and require considerable resources and time. However, if the findings from the&#xD;
      proposed research show promising results in men we would then aim to replicate those findings&#xD;
      in female athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 4 visits (~90-120 min each) in the Human Physiology Research&#xD;
      Laboratory in the Goldring Center at the University of Toronto. All testing will take place&#xD;
      Monday to Saturday at various times. Participants will be instructed to maintain their&#xD;
      regular diet (pre-testing meals will be replicated for all visits) and sleeping habits, avoid&#xD;
      strenuous activity 48 hours before each visit, and abstain from caffeine one week prior to&#xD;
      the first visit and for the duration of the data collection (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect size = 0.25: Although a large effect size for the main treatment effect was found in&#xD;
      previous research (0.38), it was decided that to be conservative, this trial would be powered&#xD;
      to detect a small-medium effect size which is still of physiological importance.&#xD;
      Additionally, we are interested in the effects between the two doses of caffeine which are&#xD;
      assumed to be smaller than the main treatment effect. Therefore, a small-medium effect size&#xD;
      was needed to ensure sufficient statistical power to make between-caffeine-effect conclusions&#xD;
      for the time trial analysis. Finally, other parameters of assessment such as the Vertical&#xD;
      Jump for power will likely have a smaller effects size than the time-trial as reported by&#xD;
      Tucker et al. (2013) in a study on vertical jump performance in male basketball players.&#xD;
      Therefore, a smaller effect size would be required to adequately power the study for all&#xD;
      outcome measures (i.e. power, strength anaerobic, aerobic etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alpha (error probability) = 0.025: In general, an alpha = 0.05 is the standard value to&#xD;
           use for this parameter. However, in our study the participants will be enrolled in a&#xD;
           number of independent trials, and therefore it was decided to use a lower alpha so as to&#xD;
           take into account error that can arise from multiple comparisons such as by sport (power&#xD;
           or endurance) plus genotype (risk or common variant).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power (1-Beta probability) = 0.8: The conventional value of 0.8 was used for power.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of groups = 2: Number of stratifications required for genotype subgroup analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of measurements = 4: The laboratory exercise tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation among repeat measures = 0: Zero correlation between measurements was&#xD;
           assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size = 74: Based on calculations 74 participants are required. We will recruit&#xD;
           100 athletes in order to account for possible withdrawal of up to 25%, without&#xD;
           potentially compromising the statistical significance of our results. In addition, if we&#xD;
           choose to use multiple comparisons (genotype + sport) we would benefit from a larger&#xD;
           sample to minimize the drop in effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be carried out at the University of Toronto, Ryerson and York University&#xD;
      campuses, the Canadian Sport Institute of Ontario, and at local running/triathlon clubs by&#xD;
      flyers posted in appropriate locations. A standardized email with study and contact&#xD;
      information will also be sent to head coaches and/or program directors of sports teams/clubs&#xD;
      (at all locations listed above) with eligible athletes, who can then choose to make their&#xD;
      athletes aware of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters of Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological data collected by two trained kinesiologists, a PhD level exercise&#xD;
      physiologist, one student assistant and Nanci Guest, the graduate student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and Clinical Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements, as well as pulse&#xD;
           rate, will be taken twice, one minute apart. The mean of the two consecutive readings&#xD;
           will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate will be measured before all tests to ensure participant calmness and similar&#xD;
           physiological state for all tests and test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate will be monitored throughout the duration of the trials (Visit 2-4) by Polar&#xD;
           Heart Rate Monitors (Polar Electro, Finland)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer and body&#xD;
           weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale with participant&#xD;
           wearing light clothing and without shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight value will be used to determine 2 and 4 mg per kilogram of body mass dosages&#xD;
           for caffeine treatments (plus a placebo dose) that will be ingested in random order&#xD;
           (derived by research assistant and blinded to all investigators) during visits 2, 3 and&#xD;
           4, over the following three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Composition will be assessed by a bioimpedence scale (BC-558 Ironman Segmental Body&#xD;
           Composition Monitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Aerobic Capacity will be assessed by a VO2 max test on a cycle ergometer. This test&#xD;
      is part of descriptive data and will be used to determine resistance set in the time trial&#xD;
      test (65% peak power). Participants will undergo a graded exercise test on a Monark cycle&#xD;
      ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands) until volitional fatigue. To determine maximal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2Max), air samples will be analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      concentrations via an indirect open circuit spirometry system (Parvomedics, Metabolic Cart,&#xD;
      Sandy, Utah). Subjects will be set up with a Polar Heart Rate monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four main outcome measures (power, strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscular Power will be assessed using the Vertical Jump Test (VJT) as described&#xD;
           previously (5). Participants will complete two attempts at each of two vertical jump&#xD;
           tests on a force plate (AMTI,Watertown, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. squat jump (SJ): from a squatting position (knee angle: 90° approximately) in which&#xD;
                no preliminary counter movement is performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. counter-movement jump (CMJ): from an upright standing position with a preliminary&#xD;
                counter movement; There will be a 30 second rest period between jumps and the best&#xD;
                score of two will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength (upper body) will be assessed using a Handgrip Dynamometer (Lafayette&#xD;
           Instrument Company model 78010). The highest score after 3 trials will be recorded (in&#xD;
           kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaerobic Capacity will be assessed using the Wingate Anaerobic Test on a cycle&#xD;
           ergometer (Ergomedic 849E, Monark, Sweden). Participants will cycle against a fixed&#xD;
           resistance of 0.085kg / kg body mass. Three main measures will be recorded during the&#xD;
           test:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peak power (PP): a measure of maximal anaerobic power, or the maximum power output&#xD;
                reached for a 5-second period during the first 10 seconds of the test. PP will be&#xD;
                recorded in Watts (W) and W/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean power (MP): a measure of anaerobic capacity, or the mean power output achieved&#xD;
                during the 30-second test. MP will be recorded in W and W/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue Index (FI): a measure of the rate of power decrease, or the difference&#xD;
                between the highest 5-second power output and the lowest 5-second power output,&#xD;
                divided by elapsed time. FI will be recorded as a percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endurance/Aerobic Capacity and power output will be assessed by a Cycling Time Trial&#xD;
           (TT). Participants will be instructed to complete a 10 km TT, carried out on a cycle&#xD;
           ergometer (Monarch Sports and Medical, Vansbro, Sweden), as quickly as possible with no&#xD;
           temporal, verbal, of physiological feedback.Time required to complete the test and&#xD;
           average power output will be recorded on completion of each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests during Exercise Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Lactate Testing. Immediately after the Wingate test participants will have their&#xD;
           finger pricked with a disposable lancet to puncture the skin and obtain a capillary&#xD;
           blood sample for analysis with the Lactate Pro analyzer (LT-1710, Arkray Inc, Kyoto,&#xD;
           Japan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) - The Borg scale for RPE will be used to assess&#xD;
           subjects' perception of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be collected during Visit 1 of exercise testing using the Oragene-500 kit&#xD;
      for DNA isolation using standard procedures as described previously.We will conduct a&#xD;
      genome-wide association study, which is an approach that involves scanning for markers across&#xD;
      the genomes of our study participants together, not individuals, to find genetic variations&#xD;
      associated with a particular trait such as VO2 max, lactate clearance efficiency, muscle&#xD;
      fiber type and changes in exercise performance following caffeine. We will also examine known&#xD;
      genetic variations that are associated with caffeine metabolism and response, to determine if&#xD;
      these genes also affect response to exercise after subjects ingest caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 196-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to determine&#xD;
      habitual caffeine intake as well as other dietary factors. Dietary intake information will be&#xD;
      used to identify potential effect modifiers such as usual caffeine consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The General health, lifestyle and physical activity questionnaire (GHLPA) will include&#xD;
      detailed questions on caffeine (e.g. intake habits, withdrawal effects etc), previously used&#xD;
      in our lab, combined with a validated habitual physical activity/sport history questionnaire&#xD;
      previously used to assess sport/physical activity in athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be carried out using SAS (Version 9.2, NC, USA, 2009) statistical software.&#xD;
      Briefly, we will report descriptive data (height, weight, age, blood pressure, caffeine&#xD;
      intake and habits, body fat %, VO2max, years in sport, training hours per week, dietary&#xD;
      assessment data and other lifestyle measures) comparisons between genotype groups using&#xD;
      independent t-tests. Potential differences in VO2max, 10 km time trial, anaerobic capacity,&#xD;
      lactate threshold, power and strength and rate of perceived exertion will be assessed using&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with treatment as a within participants&#xD;
      factor and genotype as a between-participants factor. For all RMANOVA procedures, posthoc&#xD;
      tests will be performed using independent and dependent t-tests with a Bonferroni correction&#xD;
      such that P&lt; 0.05 will be required as the threshold for significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Screening - phone call or in-person visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will verify their sports participation and ability to commit to four&#xD;
      2-hour visits to the lab 7 days apart. Participants will be reminded of the importance of&#xD;
      maintaining their regular diet. The importance of the required caffeine abstinence, including&#xD;
      any caffeine-containing supplements for 7 days prior to the first visit and the duration of&#xD;
      the study (4 weeks) will be emphasized and reiterated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (~90 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit to the laboratory will involve familiarization, and obtaining written&#xD;
      informed consent from all participants after an explanation about the aims, benefits, and&#xD;
      risks involved with the study. Participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete an &quot;exercise readiness&quot; questionnaire (PAR-Q; Physical Activity&#xD;
      Readiness Questionnaire) have descriptive and anthropometric data collected, including date&#xD;
      of birth, height, body mass, and blood pressure, and they will also provide a saliva sample&#xD;
      for DNA isolation and genotyping. During this first visit, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max;&#xD;
      described below) will also be measured for descriptive baseline data, and to derive workload&#xD;
      levels for experimental time trials on subsequent testing visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2, 3 and 4 (~120 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three visits will be identical with the exception of the 20 min waiting period (then 10&#xD;
      min pre-testing warm-up begins) for serum concentration of caffeine levels to reach peak&#xD;
      levels, where the participant will complete a different questionnaire or sit quietly with&#xD;
      their own activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival participants will have been randomly assigned (to maintain blinding) to ingest&#xD;
      either the supplement at 2 or 4 mg of caffeine per kg body weight, or dextrose placebo&#xD;
      (PLAC). Each participant will ingest the same number of capsules with identical color and&#xD;
      size during each visit, whether it is 0, 2 or 4 mg/kg, in order to maintain double-blinding&#xD;
      of treatment. Each subject will complete a questionnaire or sit quietly (e.g. reading, using&#xD;
      e-devices etc.) while waiting for the first exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise test protocol will be identical for visits 2, 3 and 4. After 20 min, participants&#xD;
      will warm-up for 10 min and then carry out 4 exercise tests (commencing at 30 min&#xD;
      post-caffeine ingestion) to determine different measures of performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Muscle power - Vertical Jump Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Strength - Handgrip Dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Anaerobic Capacity - Wingate&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Endurance/Aerobic Capacity (aerobic power) - 10 km Cycling Time Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may drink water ad libitum throughout the exercise tests.&#xD;
