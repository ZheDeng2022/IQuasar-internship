    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize subjects in terms of their sputum phenotype. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to learn more about the impact of having abnormally elastic sputum&#xD;
      on asthma severity by comparing subjects with severe as well as mild/moderate asthma to&#xD;
      healthy controls. The characterization will include medical history, pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing, imaging of the lungs and biospecimen collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by airway hyperreactivity and chronic airway&#xD;
      inflammation. Published literature from the last few years has shown that asthma does not&#xD;
      behave like a single disease but is more of a syndrome with vast heterogeneity in&#xD;
      pathogenesis, severity, and treatment response. Various clinical phenotypes and endotypes&#xD;
      have been described that advance our understanding of these differences and the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying them. We propose there is a subgroup of asthmatic patients that have sputum with&#xD;
      abnormal biophysical properties. Healthy airway mucus is composed of a lightly cross-linked&#xD;
      gel that is easily transported by the mucociliary apparatus, coughed and expectorated or&#xD;
      swallowed. Pathologic mucus has, in contrast, abnormally high elasticity. This is due to a&#xD;
      more cross linked structure which gives the sputum the properties of solid and makes sputum&#xD;
      difficult to mobilize. Increased sputum elasticity makes expectoration of sputum more&#xD;
      difficult and leads to airflow obstruction. Pathologic mucus contributes to airflow&#xD;
      obstruction and airway infection in multiple lung diseases, including asthma. Mucus plugs are&#xD;
      a particular problem in asthmatic patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;
      (ABPA)The identification of phenotype of severe asthma with pathologic mucus contributing to&#xD;
      disease severity may change how we think about severe asthma, moving towards therapies&#xD;
      targeting mucus clearance such as in other conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Pathologic&#xD;
      mucus in severe asthma is characterized by cellular inflammation, high concentrations of&#xD;
      mucins and DNA polymers. Knowledge of specific cellular and biochemical constituents of&#xD;
      pathologic mucus in severe asthma can guide targeted mucolytic treatment with&#xD;
      n-acetylcysteine, rhDNAse, or novel mucolytic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), UCSF is in a unique position to recruit&#xD;
      a large number of severe asthmatic subjects within which we expect a portion will demonstrate&#xD;
      high sputum elasticity. We will also through CAESAR recruit additional subjects with moderate&#xD;
      to severe airflow obstruction. We will perform rheological measurement on all subjects that&#xD;
      are recruited to our site and from this identify a group of asthmatic cases that have an&#xD;
      elastic modulus of ≥1 or &lt;1 and compare properties of sputum from these subjects to healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

        A diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain better understanding of asthma&#xD;
        and its endotypes. CAESAR will therefore enroll subjects between 18 and 65 years with a&#xD;
        physician diagnosis of asthma as well as a group of healthy subjects. The target&#xD;
        recruitment goal for UCSF is 50 adults with asthma and 25 healthy controls (age 18 and&#xD;
        older). Within the asthma group, an attempt will be made to enroll 60% of subjects with&#xD;
        severe with the rest of the subjects mild to moderate asthma.Within the cohort, an attempt&#xD;
        will be made to enroll at least 50% females and 10% minorities.&#xD;
