      Objective - to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of intra-articular injections (IAI)&#xD;
      of hexacetonide triamcinolone (HT) for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) in&#xD;
      interphalangeal joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:randomized, controlled, double-blinded study Materials and methods: sixty patients&#xD;
      were randomized into: the TH / lidocaine (LD) group (n=30) who underwent IAI at the most&#xD;
      symptomatic interphalangeal joint with HT (20mg/ml) and LD 2% or the LD group (n=30) who&#xD;
      received IAI with just LD. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks by a&#xD;
      blinded observer. The following parameters regarding the affected joint were assessed: pain&#xD;
      at rest (VASr); pain at movement (VASm); pain (VAS) during the 48 hours after the procedure;&#xD;
      swelling (VASs); goniometry; grip and pinch strength; hand function; treatment improvement;&#xD;
      daily requirement of paracetamol and incidence and types of local side effects after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of&#xD;
      medium-term IAI of corticosteroids HT for the treatment of OA in proximal interphalangeal&#xD;
      joints(PIP) or distal interphalangeal joints(DIP) joints on clinical and functional&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating the effectiveness of intra-articular therapies in patients with hands OA&#xD;
      are very heterogeneous, either by addressing different types of joints at the same time, for&#xD;
      wearing unusual drugs, for failing to placebo groups , by using very soluble corticosteroid&#xD;
      or not using corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blinded, intention to treat study was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Patients were collected from the outpatient clinics of the Federal University of Sao&#xD;
      Paulo, from August 2011 to August 2012. A total of 60 patients were randomized into two&#xD;
      groups of 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients had to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of PIP or DIP hands&#xD;
      OA according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, age greater than 40 years, and&#xD;
      pain in at least one PIP or DIP hand joints between 3-8 cm on Visual Analog Scale for pain&#xD;
      (VAS for pain at rest 0-10cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with change in the corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug in the last&#xD;
      thirty days; change in chondroprotective drugs in the last two months; IAI with&#xD;
      corticosteroids in the studied joint in the last three months; any change in hand OA&#xD;
      treatment in the last two months (rehabilitation, acupuncture and others); suspicion of local&#xD;
      or systemic infection; hand x-ray suggesting another etiology of hand arthropathy (psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis, microcrystalline arthropathy, deposit disease) and severe coagulation disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients were randomized into two groups. The study group was called&#xD;
      hexacetonide triamcinolone / lidocaine (TH / LD) and a control group, called lidocaine (LD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in TH / LD group underwent treatment scheme in its most symptomatic interphalangeal&#xD;
      (IP) joint composed of IAI with HT (20mg/ml) and 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor. The&#xD;
      IAI was realized in the 0.3 ml dose (6mg) of HT for PIP and 0.2 ml (4 mg) of HT for DIP,&#xD;
      always associated with 0.1 mL of 2% lidocaine. The LD group patients underwent IAI with only&#xD;
      2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor in its most symptomatic IP joint. Paracetamol 750 mg /&#xD;
      tablet were also used if required during the 12 weeks of follow-up (up to 03 tablets per day)&#xD;
      for both groups. Both groups of patients underwent only one IAI in the most symptomatic joint&#xD;
      and on a single occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures of the two groups were performed blindly by the same rheumatologist with 10&#xD;
      years of experience in interventional rheumatology after rigorous antisepsis with alcoholic&#xD;
      0.5% chlorhexidine. Sterile insulin syringe BD ™ Ultra Fine needles 8 mm x 0.3 mm 30 G) was&#xD;
      used in all patients. The anatomical place used for needle entry was located in the dorsal -&#xD;
      lateral joint aspect 14 (Figure 1). After the procedure, the injected joint was immobilized&#xD;
      for 48 hours, in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment All patients had their data reported in an evaluation form. The data collected&#xD;
      were: age, sex, race, use of chondroprotective drugs, anti-inflammatory and / or analgesics&#xD;
      drugs. Hands x-ray was performed in anteroposterior view for study inclusion. The measurement&#xD;
      was done according to the method of Kellgren and Lawrence and used to evaluate homogeneity of&#xD;
      the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five assessment evaluations were scheduled for a total of 12 weeks of follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      were assessed at T0 (before intervention), T1, T4, T8 and T12 weeks after intervention. The&#xD;
      assessment was carried out by a &quot;blinded&quot; assessor, trained in assessment instruments. This&#xD;
      study was an intention to treat study. The last observation carried forward in case of&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were assessed in both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analogue scale (VAS) for rest pain (VASr 0- 10cm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS for movement pain (VASm 0- 10cm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS for joint swelling (VASs 0- 10cm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint goniometry in flexion (degrees of range of motion);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesic consumption after the intervention (paracetamol daily average);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grip strength using Jamar® dynamometer (kgf) by obtaining the average of three attempts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pinch strength using dynamometer Pinch Gauge (kgf) - by obtaining the average of three&#xD;
           trials for the three types of pinches: tip, key and tripod 16;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hand function assessed by COCHIN questionnaire and the AUSCAN Index using the sub-scales&#xD;
           pain, stiffness and hand function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment improvement scale varying 5 points (much worse, worse , unchanged, little&#xD;
           improvement and much improved);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects following the procedure (atrophy and / or cutaneous hypochromia and joint&#xD;
           instability);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worsening of pain after IAI measured by VAS (post IAI VAS 0- 10cm) in 48 hours after the&#xD;
           procedure (reported only at T1) in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Using the VAS for pain as the primary study variable, considering a standard&#xD;
      deviation equal to 1.5 points, based on previous work , and using the ANOVA for repeated&#xD;
      measures as the statistical method for the calculation of the sample, with power of 90%, 5%&#xD;
      significance and a detectable difference of 2.0 points on the VAS pain scale, measured 5&#xD;
      times over time into two independent groups, the investigators found a sample of 24 patients&#xD;
      for each group. Considering a possible loss of up to 20% of patients over time, the&#xD;
      investigators started the study with 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients were randomized using the MINITAB 14.0 software, with secret&#xD;
      allocation guaranteed by opaque sealed envelopes. The responsible for the inclusion of these&#xD;
      patients had no prior access to randomization list; it was responsible for verifying that the&#xD;
      patient was within the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study and after this procedure&#xD;
      refer patients to the evaluators in another room, where medication was prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Blinding Only the responsible for the inclusion / exclusion of patients had access to&#xD;
      which group the patient belonged, after enrollment. Evaluators and the responsible for the&#xD;
      procedure had no access to such information. This blinding was relative impaired, since the&#xD;
      volume used in the infiltration group TH / LD was substantially greater than that used in the&#xD;
      LD group. However the responsible for the procedure was not responsible for the&#xD;
      recruitment/allocation or evaluation of the sample. Regarding this essay the evaluators did&#xD;
      not identify problems related to &quot;blinding&quot; during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods SPSS software version 17.0 (Chicago, IL) was used to perform statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, confidence interval 95%) was&#xD;
      used to characterize the patients in groups. Continuous variables of the 2 groups at baseline&#xD;
      were compared using the Student t test (for normally distributed variables) and the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test (for variables with distribution not considered normal). Categorical&#xD;
      variables were evaluated using the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response to intervention, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures&#xD;
      was used to intragroup and intergroup analysis over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was considered statistically significant if p values &lt;0.05.&#xD;
