  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if radiation therapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      can help control Stage 1 and/or 2 NK cell lymphoma. The safety of the radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Radiation and chemotherapy are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for patients with Stage 1 and/or 2 NK cell lymphoma. The combination&#xD;
      of these therapies given at the same time is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 28 to 30 treatments (up to 6 weeks). You&#xD;
      will receive a separate consent form that will describe this treatment and its risks in more&#xD;
      detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits During Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will start Cycle 1 of chemotherapy during your first week of radiation. Each cycle will&#xD;
      be 21-days long (or longer if it takes longer for your blood cell counts to recover). You&#xD;
      will receive up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-3 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive dexamethasone by vein over about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive ifosfamide by vein over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesna is given to protect the bladder from side effects. You will receive mesna by vein&#xD;
           as a non-stop infusion over 24 hours on Days 1-3 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 only, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits During Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On or before Day 1, on Day 15 of Cycle 2, and on Day 15 of Cycle 3, blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests. You may also have an EKG, if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On or before Day 1 of Cycle 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG, if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive radiation and up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have routine follow-up visits every 3 months for the 1st year, every 4 month&#xD;
      during the 2nd year, and every 6 months during the 3rd-5th years. After that, you will have&#xD;
      follow up visits 1 time every year. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will&#xD;
      be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any skin lesions that you may have that are related to the tumor will be measured and&#xD;
           photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor thinks it is needed, your MRI and PET/CT scans will be performed more or less&#xD;
      often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you leave the study early:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT, MRI, and PET/CT scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any skin lesions that you may have that are related to the tumor will be measured and&#xD;
           photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
