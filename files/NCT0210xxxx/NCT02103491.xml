      Background: Ultradistance athletes frequently consume salt supplements during competitions to&#xD;
      compensate the loss of electrolytes by sweating. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of oral salt supplementation to improve exercise performance during a&#xD;
      half-ironman triathlon. Methodology: Twenty-six experienced triathletes were matched for age,&#xD;
      anthropometric data and training status and randomly placed into the salt group (113 mmol Na+&#xD;
      and 112 mmol Cl-) or the control group (cellulose). The experimental treatments were provided&#xD;
      in unidentifiable capsules and were ingested before and during the race. Participants&#xD;
      competed in a real half-ironman triathlon and race time was measured by means of chip timing.&#xD;
      Pre and post-race, body mass, maximal force during a whole-body isometric strength test,&#xD;
      maximal height during a countermovement jump, and blood samples were obtained. Sweat samples&#xD;
      were obtained during the running section.&#xD;

      Participants Forty healthy and well-trained triathletes were recruited by email or through&#xD;
      internet announcements to participate in this study. Before enrolling in the investigation, a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their medical history, previous training, previous triathlon experience&#xD;
      and best race time in half-ironman triathlon races was filled out by each participant.&#xD;
      Potential participants with a previous history of muscle disorder, cardiac or kidney disease&#xD;
      or those taking medicines during the two prior weeks were discarded. Finally, twenty-six&#xD;
      participants were selected and matched (in pairs) for age, anthropometric data, training and&#xD;
      best race time. Then, an equal number of triathletes (n = 13) was randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      control group or to the salt ingestion group. Main morphological variables, training status&#xD;
      and best performance time in the half-ironman distance were similar between these groups (P &gt;&#xD;
      0.05; Table 1). All the participants were informed of the risks and discomforts associated&#xD;
      with the experiments and signed a written consent before their participation in this&#xD;
      investigation. The study was approved by the Camilo Jose Cela Ethics Committee in accordance&#xD;
      with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol Participants were instructed to perform light exercise and to avoid&#xD;
      pain-relieving strategies (e.g., analgesic medications, manual massage, ice, etc) the two&#xD;
      days before the race. In addition, participants were instructed to avoid any sources of&#xD;
      caffeine and alcohol 24 h before the onset of the race. Three hours before the race,&#xD;
      participants arrived at an area close to the start line having drunk 500 mL of tap water two&#xD;
      hours before arrival. Participants had their habitual pre-competition meal and it was not&#xD;
      standardized among participants to avoid affecting participants' pre-competition routines.&#xD;
      However, the pre-competition meals were analyzed afterwards and their content in&#xD;
      carbohydrates, proteins and salt was similar between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival, participants rested for 10 minutes in a recumbent chair and a 5-mL venous blood&#xD;
      sample was drawn from an antecubital vein. The blood was allowed to clot and centrifuged at&#xD;
      5000g to obtain serum. Participants then completed a 10-min standardized warm-up consisting&#xD;
      of running, dynamic leg exercises and practice jumps. After that, participants performed two&#xD;
      countermovement vertical jumps (CMJ) for maximal height on a force platform (Quattrojump,&#xD;
      Kistler, Switzerland) to assess pre-race leg power output. On command, the participant flexed&#xD;
      their knees and jumped as high as possible while maintaining the hands on the waist and&#xD;
      landed with both feet. The highest values for jump height and the peak muscle leg power&#xD;
      during the concentric phase of the jump were used for statistical analysis. Participants were&#xD;
      previously familiarized with the jump test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, whole-body isometric muscle strength was measured by means of a hand-held pull&#xD;
      gauge (Isocontrol Isométrico, EV-Pro, Spain) set at a frequency of 1000 Hz. For this&#xD;
      measurement, participants stand on a 50 × 50 cm iron base connected to a handle-bar by a&#xD;
      non-elastic cable. The isometric gauge was inserted within the cable and the height of the&#xD;
      cable was individually set to provide a 135º knee flexion while the back and the arms were&#xD;
      completely extended. Participants were instructed to perform a maximal pull by for 3-s using&#xD;
      their whole body (mainly legs and arms) while maintaining this position. Verbal motivation&#xD;
      was provided during the test. An adjustable lumbar-back protector was used for support and&#xD;
      protection during the execution. Maximal and mean isometric strength were obtained during the&#xD;
      test. Participants were previously familiarized with this measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, participants were provided with 3 plastic bags each one containing 4 white&#xD;
      capsules (e.g., a total of 12 capsules). In the salt group, the capsules were filled with a&#xD;
      commercially available product that contains buffered electrolyte salts (Saltstick caps,&#xD;
      Saltstick, California US). The total amount of electrolytes provided in the salt group was:&#xD;
      2580 mg of sodium (113 mmol), 3979 mg of chloride (112 mmol), 756 mg of potassium (19.3 mmol)&#xD;
      and 132 mg of magnesium (5.4 mmol). In the control group, participants received the same&#xD;
      number of capsules with the exact same appearance but filled with an isocaloric placebo&#xD;
      (cellulose). All the participants were instructed to ingest the contents of the first bag in&#xD;
      the transition between the swimming and cycling sections, the second bag around the middle of&#xD;
      the cycling leg and the third bag during the transition between the cycling and running&#xD;
      sections. This schedule was used to facilitate ingestion and electrolyte absorption during&#xD;
      the race. Participants received a sample of these capsules (filled with placebo) the week&#xD;
      before the race to practice the ingestion protocol during the transition and the cycling&#xD;
      sector. Participants were encouraged to ingest all the capsules in the programmed schedule&#xD;
      and to report any incidence during the capsule ingestion throughout the race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just 15-min before the race (and after their habitual warm-up), participants were weighed in&#xD;
      their competition clothes (without wetsuit) and a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis&#xD;
      was performed (BC-418, Tanita, Japan) to predict pre-to-post race total body water changes.&#xD;
      The race started at 12:00 h and consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 75 km of cycling (1100 m net&#xD;
      increase in altitude) and 21.1 km of running. Environment conditions were recorded at 30-min&#xD;
      intervals and mean ± SD (range) dry temperature during the event was 22.5 ± 2.7ºC (18.8 -&#xD;
      26.6 ºC) with a relative humidity of 36.8 ± 8.3% (32 - 45%). The swim section was performed&#xD;
      in a natural lake with water temperature at 17.5 ± 0.3ºC. All participants wore a neoprene&#xD;
      wetsuit during the swim section. Participants drank and consumed food ad libitum and swam,&#xD;
      cycled and ran at their own pace with no instructions given by the experimenters (apart from&#xD;
      those related to capsule ingestion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second transition (between the cycling and running legs), two sweat patches&#xD;
      (Tegaderm+Pad, 3M, US) were placed on the forearm to collect sweat samples. For this purpose,&#xD;
      participants went to an area located just outside the transition area and the forearm skin&#xD;
      was cleaned with distilled water and alcohol and dried with clean gauze to eliminate any&#xD;
      remains of previous sweat from the skin. After this, the sweat patch was firmly adhered to&#xD;
      the skin and fastened by an elastic tubular net bandage (Elastofix, Insfarma, Germany). This&#xD;
      process took approximately 1-min and this time was subtracted from the final race time of&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1-min of the end of the race, participants went to a finish area and body mass and&#xD;
      body bioelectrical impedance were immediately measured using the same apparatus described&#xD;
      previously. Participants were instructed to avoid drinking from the finish line till the&#xD;
      post-race weighing and an experimenter assured compliance. Then, participants performed two&#xD;
      countermovement vertical jumps and the whole-body isometric muscle strength test, as&#xD;
      previously described. These performance tests were completed within 5-min of the end of the&#xD;
      race. Participants then rested for 5-min and a venous blood sample was obtained. During this&#xD;
      resting period, the sweat patches were removed using clean tweezers and placed in a sterile&#xD;
      10 mL- tube. Sweat patches that were detached from the skin or presented a leak were&#xD;
      discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these protocols, the rate of perceived exertion during the race was self-rated using&#xD;
      the Borg scale (6 to 20 points) while perceived leg muscle soreness was self-rated using a&#xD;
      visual analog scale (0 to 10 points). Participants also filled out a detailed questionnaire&#xD;
      about fluid and food intake during the race. Data on this questionnaire were used to&#xD;
      calculate fluid, calorie and carbohydrate intake during the race. With this self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaire, we also calculated electrolyte intake during the race (apart from the salt&#xD;
      ingested with the capsule treatment). Finally, participants reported any incident during the&#xD;
      intake of the capsules and the side-effects derived from their ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and sweat sample analysis The blood was allowed to clot in situ and serum was separated&#xD;
      by centrifugation (10 min at 5000 g) and frozen at -80ºC until the day of analysis. At a&#xD;
      later date, the serum portion was analyzed for osmolality (1249, Advance 3MO, Spain), sodium,&#xD;
      chloride, potassium and magnesium concentrations (Nova 16, NovaBiomedical, Spain). In&#xD;
      addition, the serum creatine kinase concentration was measured as a blood marker of muscle&#xD;
      damage by means of an autoanalyzer (AU5400, Beckman Coulter, US). The sweat was separated&#xD;
      from the patches by centrifugation (10 min at 3000 g), transferred to 5-mL sealed tubes and&#xD;
      refrigerated at 4 ºC. At a later date (within 2 days of the race), sweat osmolality was&#xD;
      measured with the same osmometer employed for the serum samples while sweat electrolyte&#xD;
      concentration were measured using an ion selective electrode analyzer (Cobas 6000, Roche,&#xD;
      Madrid, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The normality of each variable was initially tested with the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. All the variables presented a normal distribution. For the variables&#xD;
      obtained once during the experiment (race time, body mass change, sweat electrolyte&#xD;
      concentration, self-rated fatigue and muscle soreness, etc) the comparison between groups&#xD;
      (salt vs control) was performed using Student's t test for independent samples. For the&#xD;
      variables obtained twice during the experiment (body mass, blood variables, jump performance,&#xD;
      etc) the comparison between groups was performed by using a mixed model ANOVA (time ×&#xD;
      treatment) with repeated measures for the variable time. The data were analyzed with the&#xD;
      statistical package SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The significance level was&#xD;
      set at P &lt; 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SD.&#xD;
