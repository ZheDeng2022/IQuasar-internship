      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study--an&#xD;
      investigation carried out in 816 pregnant (pregnant week 17±2 group and pregnant week 39±2&#xD;
      group; 408 cases in each group) and 408 lactating women (post-natal lactation day 42±7 group)&#xD;
      from a total of 4 sites in 3 typical areas (1 coastal regions, 2 inland regions and 1 lake&#xD;
      regions) in China to study the correlation between DHA intake and DHA concentrations in blood&#xD;
      and breast milk.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study in 816&#xD;
      pregnant (gestation week 17±2 group and gestation week 39±2 group 408 cases in each group)&#xD;
      and 408 lactating women (post-natal lactation day 42±7 group) from a total of 4 sites in 3&#xD;
      typical areas (1 coastal regions, 2 inland regions and 1 lake regions) in China to study the&#xD;
      correlation between DHA intake and DHA concentrations in blood and breast milk. Investigators&#xD;
      are mainly physicians majoring in gynaecology and obstetrics, etc. During visits, the study&#xD;
      physician will record the patient's social demographic data, disease and relevant medication&#xD;
      history, review her medical records, assess DHA intake by the DHA Screener, and determine DHA&#xD;
      concentrations in erythrocyte membrane, plasma and breast milk, so as to validate the&#xD;
      feasibility of DHA Screener as DHA intake assessment tool for determining DHA concentrations&#xD;
      in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria will be informed of&#xD;
      relevant information of the study. Subjects should be voluntarily consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of the study is scheduled for as long as 5 months. In this study, additional&#xD;
      examinations or other interventions are not required.&#xD;
