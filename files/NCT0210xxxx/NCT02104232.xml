    <textblock>
      Background The rates of perinatal depression in South Asian women are reported to be amongst&#xD;
      the highest in the world, ranging from 18%-30% in urban areas and 28%-36% in rural areas. In&#xD;
      addition to its profound impact on women's health, disability and functioning, perinatal&#xD;
      depression is associated with poor child health outcomes such as pre-term birth, infant&#xD;
      under-nutrition and stunting. There is robust evidence that perinatal depression can be&#xD;
      effectively managed with psychological treatments delivered by non-specialist health care&#xD;
      workers. The Thinking Healthy Program (THP), a psychological treatment delivered by community&#xD;
      health workers (CHWs) in Pakistan, more than halved the rate of perinatal depression among&#xD;
      mothers and led to significant improvements in child health outcomes. To enhance access to&#xD;
      such evidence-based psychological treatments there is a need to examine the potential role of&#xD;
      other human resources such as lay persons in delivering psychological treatments such as THP&#xD;
      in poor resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of THP delivered by peers (the&#xD;
      Thinking Healthy Program-Peer delivered in Goa, India; THPP-I) over the duration of 6 months.&#xD;
      Peers will be healthy mothers who live in the same community as potential trial participants&#xD;
      (TPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and outcomes Individual randomized controlled trial in Goa, India involving 280&#xD;
      women. TPs will not be blinded to treatment allocation. Mothers attending antenatal clinics&#xD;
      at hospitals will be assessed for eligibility to participate in the trial (e.g. whether they&#xD;
      are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy). Those who are eligible will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in screening for depression; mothers who consent will be screened for depression&#xD;
      with a locally validated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Women who&#xD;
      screen positive (PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10) and give informed consent for further participation in the&#xD;
      trial will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive enhanced usual care (EUC) or&#xD;
      THPP-I+EUC, using a computer generated allocation sequence. The primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      remission (i.e. recovery from depression and depressive symptoms), both assessed by the PHQ-9&#xD;
      at 6 months. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms and remission at 3 months (PHQ-9),&#xD;
      maternal disability at 3 and 6 months (measured with the WHO-DAS), perceived social support,&#xD;
      breastfeeding rates and infant weight and height of children at 3 and 6 months. Outcomes will&#xD;
      be analyzed on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions EUC will comprise communicating the results of the screening to the mother&#xD;
      through an information sheet on self-care for mental health, communicating the results to the&#xD;
      mother's gynaecologist, providing the gynaecologist with the WHO mhGAP guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression, and providing guidance on referral of depressed mothers to mental&#xD;
      health services. TPs who are in the THPP-I group will receive, in addition to EUC, between 6&#xD;
      to 14 sessions of THPP starting from their recruitment in the second/ third trimester until&#xD;
      up to 6 months after child birth. Sessions will be delivered by peers on an individual basis&#xD;
      at a location of convenience to the TPs (usually at their own homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications THPP-I has the potential to advance knowledge of the extent to which&#xD;
      task-shifting of the delivery of evidence-based psychological treatments can be extended to&#xD;
      peers in the community. If effectiveness is observed, this approach offers a potential&#xD;
      opportunity to access a vast untapped human resource for maternal mental health care and&#xD;
      addresses a major barrier in global mental health - the lack of skilled and motivated human&#xD;
      resources in the formal health sector - offering a new avenue for the scaling up of&#xD;
      evidence-based psychological treatments and mental health services in low resourced settings.&#xD;
