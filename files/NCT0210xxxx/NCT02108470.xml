      The aim of this study is to determine whether by incorporating an Oral Health-Related Quality&#xD;
      of Life (OHRQoL) measure in dental practice will improve patient-dentist communication and&#xD;
      enhance patient's satisfaction. The objectives of this study are: (i) To determine the&#xD;
      measurement equivalence of Computer Touch Screen Assessment (CTSA) and Paper Based Assessment&#xD;
      (PBA) of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). (ii) To evaluate and compare how useful a&#xD;
      standardized OHRQoL assessment improves patient-dentist communication with regards to number&#xD;
      of relevant OHRQoL issues addressed and percentage of most frequently items discussed between&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups, assess the patient's active participation between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups and enhances patient's satisfaction between the intervention&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Oral Health Division of the Ministry of Health in Malaysia recognizes that customer&#xD;
      centered/ patient-centered care (PCC) is of key importance in providing quality oral health&#xD;
      care to the population. This paradigm shift in health care to 'patients' rather than&#xD;
      'providers' in determining health needs and service outcomes requires a more holistic&#xD;
      approach relying on active patient involvement. This in turn has led to the development and&#xD;
      use of patient-centred health status measures - termed 'health-related quality of life'&#xD;
      [HRQoL] within medicine. These HRQoL have proved effective in understanding patients' health&#xD;
      needs, ability to cope with illnesses, compliance with treatment and ultimately the overall&#xD;
      success of care, thus ensuring PCC. In dentistry, considerable advances have been made in&#xD;
      developing valid and reliable HRQoL for oral health [OHRQoL] . The most widely used and&#xD;
      sophisticated measures being the Oral health Impact Profile which has been adapted for use&#xD;
      and validated in Malaysia. The challenge now is to determine how effective such a measure is&#xD;
      in attaining the goal of PCC for dentistry in Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. This study id divided into two phase; phase 1 &amp; phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1; Testing the measurement equivalence of 'Touch-screen' versus 'Paper-based'&#xD;
      assessments of OHRQoL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: This study is a randomized crossover study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Area: Selangor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample and Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participants from the residential colleges at a university campus will be&#xD;
                randomly assigned through block randomization in groups of four (ABBA) into two&#xD;
                arms of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
                (i) Arm A where participants self-completed the CTSA followed by the PBA or (ii)&#xD;
                Arm B where participants self-completed PBA followed by CTSA. Intervention (test):&#xD;
                The participants answered the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire&#xD;
                using the CTSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Protocol (Control): The participants answered the OHIP-14 using the PBA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participants were randomized to either (i) Arm A: completed CTSA then PBA of&#xD;
           OHIP-14, or (ii) Arm B: PBA and then CTSA of OHIP-14 within the same day. User&#xD;
           preference and time taken to complete the assessments were recorded. The first&#xD;
           assessment was conducted in the morning (AM) session and the second assessment was&#xD;
           conducted in the afternoon (PM) session. The period of 'washout' was a 'lunch period'&#xD;
           between morning and afternoon sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who able to read and speak Malay are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All eligible participants, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in this study. Assignment to trial arm was concealed in envelopes that were&#xD;
           opened when informed consent was obtained from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PBA involved 'pen and paper' for participants to self-complete questions. Data from PBA&#xD;
           were entered manually into the computer package of SPSS for the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For the CTSA a Samsung tablet with Android operating system was used. The respondents&#xD;
           entered their responses by touching the relevant buttons on the screen. The navigation&#xD;
           buttons at the bottom of the screen allowed the screen to be moved backwards and&#xD;
           forwards through the questions. The responses were compiled automatically into an excel&#xD;
           file that could be accessed in Statistical Program for the Social Sciences software&#xD;
           (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The formats of the questions were similar in both CTSA and PBA. The time taken for&#xD;
           participants to complete PBA and CTSA was recorded by stopwatch. On completion of the&#xD;
           trial participants were asked to rate their preference for PBA or CTSA (touch screen,&#xD;
           paper, or no preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2; To evaluate and compare how useful a standardized OHRQoL assessment improves&#xD;
      patient-dentist communication :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: This study is a randomized crossover study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Area: Selangor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample and Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Community Health Care Centers (CHCC) will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      group A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will start with intervention (test) and follow by the standard protocol&#xD;
           (Control) and vice versa for group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (test): Dental consultation will be carried out by incorporating an OHQoL&#xD;
      assessment. The OHQoL will be measured globally using Oral Health Impact Profile (S-OHIP[M]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Protocol (Control): Dental consultation will be carried out in a conventional way&#xD;
      (without OHQoL assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participating dentist(s) randomized to group &quot;A&quot; will conduct 35 consultations&#xD;
           incorporating the OHQoL assessments (i.e. the intervention) on a selected patients and&#xD;
           then following a washout period of 1-month will conduct 35 consultations without OHQoL&#xD;
           assessments (control). At those CHCC randomized to group 'B' participating dentist(s)&#xD;
           will conduct 35 consultations without incorporating OHQoL assessments (control) and then&#xD;
           following a washout period of 1-month will conduct 35 consultations with OHQoL&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients aged 18 and older with presenting complaint of oral pain are eligible to&#xD;
           participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All eligible patients, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in this study. Screening for eligibility will be done at the registration&#xD;
           site. All patients in the intervention group will be asked to complete the S-OHIP[M] on&#xD;
           the touch screen Samsung tablet with Android operating system prior to the consultation.&#xD;
           The program will systematically summarize the results of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dentists in the intervention group will perform the consultation with an addition of&#xD;
           using the OHRQoL information as presented on the iPad screen in the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists in the control group, on the other hand, will perform the conventional consultation.&#xD;
      The consultation will be audiotape. At the end of the treatment, patients will be given the&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire to be completed.&#xD;
