    <textblock>
      Patients with back pain with spinal stenosis of the lower back will be asked to volunteer for&#xD;
      this research study. These patients don't need immediate surgery for this problem. Treatment&#xD;
      of this kind of back pain with spinal stenosis usually includes physical therapy exercises&#xD;
      and steroid injections. Both treatments are usually helpful in patients with back pain with&#xD;
      spinal stenosis. However, physicians and other healthcare providers don't know which&#xD;
      treatment is better to give first. The purpose of this research is to answer that question.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive both treatments: physical therapy (PT) and a&#xD;
      steroid injection (&quot;shot&quot;). However, patients may get the shot first followed by PT, or they&#xD;
      may have PT first, followed by the shot. Their time in this study will last up to 6 months,&#xD;
      and there will be five outcome measurements (via visits or telephone). All study visits will&#xD;
      take place at the Atlanta VA Medical Center (Atlanta VA). Investigators hope to enroll about&#xD;
      120 subjects from the Atlanta VA. Enrolled patients will be randomized using a randomization&#xD;
      computer program.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: chronic low back pain (at least 3 months in duration), a Visual&#xD;
        Analogue Scale (VAS) greater than 30 (on a 100 point scale), between the ages of 18 to 80&#xD;
        years, either without radiating leg pain (below the knees) or with low back and/or buttock&#xD;
        pain greater than leg pain (in which case the VAS for leg pain must be 20 or less), ability&#xD;
        to read English and complete the assessment instruments, and diagnosis of lumbar spinal&#xD;
        stenosis by a board certified radiologist or a board certified physiatrist either by&#xD;
        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed-tomography (CT) that has previously been done&#xD;
        as part of a normal course of patients medical treatment. All underlying etiology or&#xD;
        diagnoses that are the source for lumbar spinal stenosis will be recorded (e.g.&#xD;
        spondylolisthesis, herniated or degenerative discs, spondylosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of lumbar surgery, acute disc herniation as reported on a radiologic imaging&#xD;
             report, acute or severe chronic illness that are unstable, cognitive impairment which&#xD;
             prevents the patient from providing accurate data or giving informed consent,&#xD;
             neurological conditions (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's, brain injury), lower extremity&#xD;
             amputees, fibromyalgia or chronic generalized pain, unstable opioid use or any signs&#xD;
             or evidence of alcohol dependence or illicit drug use (as determined by screening&#xD;
             questionnaire), clinical suspicion of facet joint-originating back pain or a positive&#xD;
             response to prior facet joint block, lumbar epidural steroid injections within the&#xD;
             last 6 months, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders, serious concomitant medical illness&#xD;
             (e.g. acute heart failure, acute renal failure) or severe pain that may impair&#xD;
             patient's ability to participate in physical therapy exercises or pain that is deemed&#xD;
             so severe such that withholding of an ESI until after completion of the PT exercises&#xD;
             is seen as causing unreasonable suffering to the patient, and conditions that would&#xD;
             prevent the patient from undergoing fluoroscopy (e.g. pregnancy).&#xD;
