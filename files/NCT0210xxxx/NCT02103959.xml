  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate CMX-2043 for prevention of renal and cardiac&#xD;
      injury associated with coronary angiography in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS),&#xD;
      but excluding ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. This study will&#xD;
      specifically examine the ability of CMX-2043 to prevent acute renal injury following coronary&#xD;
      angiography. The study will also examine the ability of CMX 2043 for prevention of&#xD;
      periprocedural cardiac injury. Information will be obtained relating to the ability of CMX&#xD;
      2043 for prevention of major adverse cardiac and renal events following the procedure.&#xD;
      Additional information will be obtained in this study to evaluate safety of the drug. Dose&#xD;
      and regimen information will also be obtained for future clinical studies of CMX-2043.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subjects undergoing coronary angiography with the possibility of going on to PCI.&#xD;
             However, if it is known that the patient is unlikely to undergo PCI, the patient&#xD;
             should not be enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. An eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min as determined by the MDRD equation and at least one of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects free of non-cardiac acute injuries or illnesses that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could put the subject at risk or obscure the interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;

             exams and laboratory investigations.&#xD;
