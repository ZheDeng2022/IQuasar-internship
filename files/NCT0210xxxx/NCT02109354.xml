  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) is doing a study to test 2 experimental HIV vaccines in&#xD;
      combination with 2 licensed vaccines for tetanus and hepatitis B. HIV is the virus that&#xD;
      causes AIDS. Tetanus is an infection that causes muscular spasms. Hepatitis B is a virus that&#xD;
      can cause liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 100 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The US National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are doing this study to answer several questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the HIV study vaccines safe to give to people?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are people able to take the HIV study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do people's immune systems respond to the HIV study vaccines? (Your immune system&#xD;
           protects you from disease.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can people's immune responses to a tetanus or hepatitis B vaccines help us understand&#xD;
           how their immune systems might respond to the HIV study vaccines?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a common immune response to licensed vaccines like the tetanus and hepatitis B&#xD;
           vaccines?&#xD;
