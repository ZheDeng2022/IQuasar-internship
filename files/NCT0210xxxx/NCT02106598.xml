  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current imaging devices usually detect cancer prior to surgery. However, these devices cannot&#xD;
      be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called &quot;sentinel&#xD;
      lymph nodes&quot;). This is a Phase II study, containing a total of 67 patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. The purpose of this study is to test if imaging, with cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots is&#xD;
      useful for evaluating your type of cancer. This is currently not approved by the FDA. The&#xD;
      researchers want to see if cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots, can improve upon the usual scans. As a&#xD;
      part of your standard of care, you will initially undergo imaging of your lymph nodes prior&#xD;
      to your surgery. Prior to your surgery, you will be injected with a radioactive dye around&#xD;
      the tumor site, and images will be acquired about 2 hours later using a device to image the&#xD;
      location of the dye. We have tested, for the first time in humans, a new, experimental&#xD;
      dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph node mapping. This particle,&#xD;
      the size of a small protein, will be injected around sites of your tumor before or during&#xD;
      your surgery to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held camera system. The dye-labeled&#xD;
      particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. The particles will not treat your&#xD;
      cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your&#xD;
      treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to&#xD;
      detect and/or treat tumors.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, and prior to standard of care wide local resection of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection, will receive a locally-administered, peritumoral injection of fluorescent cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots (0.25 - 1 ml) around the primary lesion while under standard-of-care anesthesia for identification of optically-avid SLNs and to assess for metastatic disease. After completion of the neck dissection, nodal specimens will be examined ex vivo for fluorescence signal. Any fluorescent and non-fluorescent nodes will be compared to determine the true positive and false positive rates for cancer detection in this pilot study. No change in standard of care surgical practice will occur.</description>

             whom SLN mapping is indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual clinically or radiographically evident tumor, including primary&#xD;
