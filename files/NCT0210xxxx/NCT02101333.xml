      First-line tocilizumab treatment during 6 months could permit rapid steroid-tapering and&#xD;
      induction of remission in Takayasu arteritis (TA).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific/Medical Rationale Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a large-vessel vasculitis that&#xD;
      affects the aorta and its primary branches and may lead to arterial segmental stenosis,&#xD;
      occlusion and/or aneurism formation. The symptoms are either non specific and reflect&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, or related to vascular injury and induced organ-ischemia. Even though&#xD;
      many patients respond to glucocorticoids, relapses or steroid-dependence may necessitate the&#xD;
      use of combination therapy. Azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (20-25 mg/week) have&#xD;
      been used in patients with TA, and can induce disease remission and prevent the development&#xD;
      of new arterial lesions. The addition of other immunosuppressive agents to glucocorticoids&#xD;
      could be required in majority of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging constitutes an&#xD;
      interesting non-invasive imaging to assess arterial changes during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of TA includes vessel injury mediated by T-cells, natural killer cells, γδ-T&#xD;
      cells and macrophages. T-cells and macrophages infiltrates contribute to granuloma and giant&#xD;
      cells formation, and produce IFNγ which stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL-6, is&#xD;
      implicated in vascular inflammation and injury in TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of these data, several studies have reported the efficacy of TNFα inhibitors in&#xD;
      TA, but only one observational study of 15 cases and a few case-reports are available. The&#xD;
      investigators have reported the French multicenter experience on infliximab in TA. In this&#xD;
      cohort of 15 french TA patients refractory to other immunosuppressive agents with more than&#xD;
      20 mg prednisone daily, infliximab enabled a significant improvement of both clinical and&#xD;
      biological features, in addition to having a steroid-sparing effect. Furthermore, early&#xD;
      response was notable, since clinical, biological remission and steroid-sparing were achieved&#xD;
      within 3 months in the investigators refractory TA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines in TA was recently raised by the&#xD;
      report of the efficacy of the humanized anti-IL6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Likewise to&#xD;
      TNF-α inhibitors, a dramatic and rapid improvement in clinical manifestations and on&#xD;
      laboratory parameters was noted. This early response in even long-standing TA disease, as&#xD;
      also noted in the investigators study and in previous reports, supports the use of&#xD;
      cytokine-targeting therapies in TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like other immunosuppressive agents in TA, TNF-α inhibitors and tocilizumab were used mostly&#xD;
      in refractory TA disease, and thus its benefits as a first-line treatment option,&#xD;
      particularly with regard to their steroid-sparing effect and in prevention of relapses, could&#xD;
      not be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently in severe and relapsing ANCA-associated vasculitis, the use of initial biotherapy&#xD;
      with rituximab was sufficient to induce remission and permit completely tapering&#xD;
      glucocorticoids at 6 months, comparatively to the conventional cyclophosphamide-based&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the limited treatment options and the number of TA, a multicenter trial may be&#xD;
      necessary to address the benefits of first-line tocilizumab treatment in inducing remission&#xD;
      and as steroid-sparing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • First-line tocilizumab treatment during 6 months could permit rapid steroid-tapering and&#xD;
      induction of remission in TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of number of good responders without prednisone after 6-months tocilizumab&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence of 6-months tocilizumab treatment to induction of partial and good responders&#xD;
           at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence of 6-months tocilizumab treatment to cumulative dose of steroids during 6&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the TA global activity associated with tocilizumab treatment, by the&#xD;
           questionnaires: BVAS, PGO, Dei-Tak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the radiological response : PET and MRI at 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the biological response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the clinical response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the patients' quality of life associated with tocilizumab treatment, by the&#xD;
           quality of life questionnaires: SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine time to recurrence during the observation period of 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of patient will be 15 patients with active TA, as this protocol is a&#xD;
           non-comparative pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A number of 15 patients was chosen, as in this rare disease the 2 most important studies&#xD;
           with TNFalpha antagonists included 15 subjects. In these studies complete or partial&#xD;
           response was obtained in almost 70% of patients, but concerned refractory patients. In&#xD;
           concern on tocilizumab, only case reports are available and all demonstrate a&#xD;
           spectacular improvement and 100% clinical, biological and radiological improvement and&#xD;
           the response seem to be better than to TNFalpha antagonists. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
           calculate at least 50% of response with first-line tocilizumab which could taper&#xD;
           steroids at 6 months, with ± 25% precision with the number of included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients will undergo a screening visit and an inclusion visit and will be assessed at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment per subject/patient:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Duration of Trial Recruitment:&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  time to recurrence during the observation period,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  safety as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Monitoring standard of care for Tocilizumab treatment, as per European SmPC.&#xD;
                Investigators must immediately notify the sponsor, AP-HP of serious adverse events&#xD;
                (SAE) and serious and non serious adverse events of special interest (AESI).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The clinical outcome and the results of any clinical assessments and diagnostic&#xD;
                and/or laboratory investigations and any other information providing a reasonable&#xD;
                analysis of the causal relationship will therefore be reported. For serious adverse&#xD;
                effects the ethical committee and research investigators must be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All SAE and AESI (serious and non serious), need to be reported to Roche within 24&#xD;
                hours. Categories of AESI have been identified for ACTEMRA (Tocilizumab):&#xD;
                infections (including opportunistic infections), myocardial infarction/acute&#xD;
                coronary syndrome, gastrointestinal perforations and related events, malignancies,&#xD;
                anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, demyelinating disorders, stroke, bleeding&#xD;
                events, hepatics events. The Investigators should use their clinical judgement to&#xD;
                identify events falling in any of these AESI categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
                For all AESI (serious and non serious), Guided Questionnaires will be used to&#xD;
                obtain follow up information.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Statistical analyses The aim of the descriptive analysis will be to determine the&#xD;
                variation of the different parameters during the follow-up and to evaluate their&#xD;
                importance. Data will be presented as means with standard deviations, medians with&#xD;
                interquartiles, ranges including the missing data for continuous variables. Data&#xD;
                will be presented as frequencies with percentages (95%CI) for qualitative&#xD;
                variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Kaplan Meier estimation will be used for the analysis of the time to occurrence of&#xD;
                categorical parameters (pe different response: yes/no). The evolution of the&#xD;
                different continuous variables will be analyzed with the model of ANOVA (random&#xD;
                effect) and could be normalized if necessary. In case of failure, rank analyses&#xD;
                will be performed. All tests will be considered as significant with p &lt; 0.05. &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
                Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
                This first study of Tocilizumab in TA could assess that fist-line tocilizumab&#xD;
                induce remission and steroid-tapering. This study could ascertain the new option of&#xD;
                treatment of vasculitis, as rapid induction of remission by combination therapy to&#xD;
                obtain steroid-tapering and long-standing remission.&#xD;
