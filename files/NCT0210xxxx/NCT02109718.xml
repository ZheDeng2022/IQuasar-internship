  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Effectiveness of open dressing with petrolatum jelly in minor burns has not been clearly&#xD;
      established. This study determined if the use of open dressings with petrolatum jelly as&#xD;
      effective as standard gauze dressing with silver sulfadiazine in treating minor burns in&#xD;
      terms of time-to-re-epithelialization, incidence of wound infection,incidence of adverse&#xD;
      reactions, and patient acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-extensive superficial partial thickness burns constitute a major proportion of burn&#xD;
      injuries. Conventional treatment involves regular changing of absorptive dressings including&#xD;
      the application of a topical antimicrobial, commonly silver sulfadiazine. A systematic review&#xD;
      has found insufficient evidence to support or refute such antimicrobial prophylaxis. Another&#xD;
      review compared silver sulfadiazine dressings with other occlusive and non-antimicrobial&#xD;
      dressings and found insufficient evidence to guide practice. Other research has suggested&#xD;
      that dressings with petrolatum gel are as effective as silver sulfadiazine. This trial sought&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of conventional silver sulfadiazine dressings with treatment&#xD;
      with petrolatum gel alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with superficial partial thickness burns less than 10% Total Body Surface Area were&#xD;
      recruited. Patients with burns involving the primary areas (face, hand, groin, joints, feet),&#xD;
      previous treatment of the burn wound, previous burn injury to the same area, electrical&#xD;
      burns, and patients with inhalation injury were excluded Also excluded were patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, known sensitivity or allergy to one of the dressings or their constituents and&#xD;
      allergy to NSAIDS, those being treated with systemic steroid medication, and patients with&#xD;
      AIDS and AIDS related complex. Participants were then randomized to undergo either open&#xD;
      dressings with petrolatum jelly or standard gauze dressings with silver sulfadiazine cream.&#xD;
      The number of days to complete re-epithelialization was recorded for each patient. The&#xD;
      incidence of wound infection and adverse reactions, notably the occurrence of allergic&#xD;
      contact dermatitis was also recorded. The study also assessed both dressings in terms of&#xD;
      adherence to the wound bed, ease of dressing removal, pain on application and removal of&#xD;
      dressings, time required for dressing change and number of dressing changes in between&#xD;
      follow-ups..&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 participants were recruited. Age, sex, race, health condition, location of&#xD;
      burn, % Total Body Surface Area area affected, time lag, causative agent, presence of initial&#xD;
      cooling maneuver, medical condition, and associated injuries were similar for petrolatum&#xD;
      jelly and silver sulfadiazine groups. There was no significant difference with regard to&#xD;
      number of days to re-epithelialization. There was also no significant difference between the&#xD;
      two treatment groups with regards to pain experienced during application and removal of the&#xD;
      dressings, and the number of dressing changes required in between follow-ups. There was,&#xD;
      however, a significant difference between open dressings with petrolatum jelly and silver&#xD;
      sulfadiazine gauze dressing in terms of adherence to the wound bed, ease of removal of&#xD;
      dressings and time required to change dressings. Open dressings with petrolatum jelly were&#xD;
      found to be less adherent, easier to remove, and required less time for dressing change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Consenting adults 18-45 years old with&#xD;
      superficial partial thickness burns less than or equal to 10% total body surface area seen&#xD;
      within 24 hours of the injury were randomized to daily dressing either with petrolatum gel&#xD;
      without top dressings or conventional silver sulfadiazine treatment with gauze dressings.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes were blinded assessment of time to complete re-epithelialization, wound&#xD;
      infection or allergic contact dermatitis. Secondary outcomes included assessment of ease,&#xD;
      time and pain of dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients were recruited and follow up data available for 38. Mean time to&#xD;
      re-epithelialization was shorter in the treatment group by more than one day within an&#xD;
      overall mean healing time of 7.0 days (p = 0.050). No wound infection or dermatitis was&#xD;
      observed in either group. Scores for adherence to the wound, ease of dressing removal and&#xD;
      time required to change dressings were significantly better in the petrolatum treatment arm&#xD;
      (p &lt; 0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Petrolatum gel without top dressings may be at least as effective as silver sulfadiazine&#xD;
      gauze dressings with regard to time to re-epithelialization, and incidence of infection and&#xD;
      allergic contact dermatitis. Petrolatum gel appears to be an effective, affordable and widely&#xD;
      available alternative in the treatment of minor superficial partial thickness burns in&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
