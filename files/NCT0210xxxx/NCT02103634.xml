      This study will look at two new technologies being developed for measuring cancer in bones.&#xD;
      One of these technologies is a substance called Sodium Fluoride (NaF). Fluoride is a normal&#xD;
      body substance. The amount that patients will receive has been shown to be very safe. One&#xD;
      study of over 400 patients showed no adverse reactions after receiving the recommended&#xD;
      dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NaF (known as a radiotracer) is taken up into the bones under a normal process and&#xD;
      researchers can measure the amount within patient's bones through an imaging system called a&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI). This system combines&#xD;
      aspects of both a PET study as part of the regular standard of care and an MRI study. The&#xD;
      belief is that the combination of these two studies will be better than either study&#xD;
      alone.People who have enrolled in this study will receive their clinically requested PET/CT&#xD;
      scan as part of their normal diagnostic care and will follow all the said recommendations for&#xD;
      this study such as not being pregnant, having fasted overnight, etc. Subjects will return&#xD;
      within 7 days for a 10 mCi NaF PET/MRI study. The patients' imaging time will be up to 120&#xD;
      minutes depending on the MRI sequences acquired. Imaging for the PET portion of the study&#xD;
      will take approximately 20-30 minutes with the rest of the time devoted to MRI sequences.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to assess NaF PET/MRI compared to NaF PET/CT and standard of&#xD;
      care imaging made available for assessment of bone metastases in all cancers as well as other&#xD;
      standard of care indications for MDP bone scintigraphy. The study will use both the currently&#xD;
      available and approved MRI sequences for attenuation correction and localization as well as&#xD;
      non FDA approved sequences to assess the ability of the modality to identify bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of NaF PET/MRI vs. Naf PET/CT vs. current&#xD;
           standard of care imaging. This will be done on a lesion by lesion basis based on a prior&#xD;
           study looking at NaF PET/CT (14). Lesions that are positive on NaF PET/MRI but not on&#xD;
           other imaging will be followed up on future imaging to see if they eventually become&#xD;
           positive given that physiology changes before anatomy. Follow up will include both&#xD;
           repeat NaF PET/CT (PET/MRI) studies (as per standard of care MDP bone scintigraphy&#xD;
           indications) as well as review of other surveillance standard of care imaging up to 6&#xD;
           months after the NaF PET/CT (PET/MRI) was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess various NaF MRI sequences for attenuation correction and localization both from&#xD;
           approved and developmental sequences compared to NaF CT attenuation corrected images&#xD;
           through software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the ability of MRI sequences acquired for attenuation correction and localization&#xD;
           to evaluate bone metastases in comparison to other modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the image quality of various NaF MRI sequences acquired for attenuation&#xD;
           correction and localization using both approved and developmental sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ascertain, if there are lesions identified on the NaF PET/MRI study but not seen on the&#xD;
           NaF PET/CT study (or other standard of care imaging) or vice versa.&#xD;
