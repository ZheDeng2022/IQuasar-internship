      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -How people respond to drugs depends in part on their genes. For some drugs, doctors can use&#xD;
      an individuals genetic background to help in dosing the drug. Researchers want to know how&#xD;
      doctors incorporate personalized or genomic medicine into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To study how physicians make personalized treatment decisions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Healthy adult primary care physicians who are internal (or family) medicine residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will put on a headset, called a head-mounted display, showing a virtual&#xD;
           reality environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The environment will contain an exam room and the virtual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After interacting with the virtual patient, participants will complete a series of&#xD;
           survey measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation will last for about 60 minutes. The virtual patient interaction and&#xD;
           follow-up questions will be audio taped.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine factors related to primary care physicians clinical decision-making.&#xD;
      Using a virtual clinical interaction experiment, we aim to better understand physicians&#xD;
      decision-making processes and to explore their communication behaviors toward patients in the&#xD;
      clinical encounter. Physician participants will enter a virtual exam room where they will be&#xD;
      asked to respond to a virtual patient, acting as her primary care physician in a follow-up&#xD;
      visit to evaluate her for depression. Various aspects of physician communication in the&#xD;
      virtual clinic and self-report measures related to decision-making will be analyzed.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All physicians will be healthy adult volunteers who are medical residents in the&#xD;
             internal medicine specialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. persons with seizure or vestibular disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. persons who are highly prone to motion sickness;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. those without normal or normal to corrected vision or hearing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. all current and past employees and contractors of NHGRI; and&#xD;

             participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NHGRI employees are excluded for this protocol because they are likely to have specialized&#xD;
        genomic knowledge and may think differently about genomics in the clinical interaction.&#xD;
