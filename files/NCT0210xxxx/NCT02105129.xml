    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose&#xD;
      of up to 800 mg in Part A (evaluated in planned steps of 5, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300 mg under&#xD;
      fasted conditions, followed by 300, 400, 600 and 800 mg HMPL-523 under fed conditions of a&#xD;
      standard meal, followed by multiple doses of 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg of HMPL-523 in Part B,&#xD;
      in healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of single (Part A) and&#xD;
      multiple (Part B) oral doses of HMPL-523 in healthy male volunteers and to determine the&#xD;
      preliminary effect of food (Part C）&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study with 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, single dose study in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, multiple dose study in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Open labeled, single dose, cross-over, preliminary food effect study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: 80 healthy volunteers (10 cohorts of 8 subjects) Part B: About 40 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (5 cohorts of 8 subjects) In Part B, the multiple doses are 200(Cohort B1), 300(Cohort B2),&#xD;
      400(Cohort B3), and 500 mg(Cohort B4) and 8 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort. At dose&#xD;
      200mg, additional cohort (Cohort B1a) with 8 subjects needs to be enrolled based on the&#xD;
      clinical data (safety, tolerability, available PK data and clinical laboratory values). The&#xD;
      decision is made jointly by the Principal Investigator and the sponsor. Within each cohort, 6&#xD;
      subjects will receive HMPL-523 and 2 subjects will receive placebo Part C: 6 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (1 cohort; all will receive HMPL-523 100 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Part A: Single Ascending Dose.Subjects will receive a single dose of up to 800 mg HMPL-523&#xD;
      or matching placebo during Day 1. The planned dose levels are: 5, 20, 50,100, 200, 300 mg&#xD;
      under fasted conditions, followed by 300, 400, 600, 800 mg under fed conditions with a&#xD;
      standard meal, according to the randomization schedule. Dose levels may be repeated, reduced&#xD;
      or administered as a split dose if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator and&#xD;
      Sponsor's medical Expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort 1 a sentinel group (1 HMPL-523 and 1 placebo) will be dosed at 5 mg HMPL-523, 24&#xD;
      hours prior to the planned dosing of the remaining six subjects. Dosing of the remaining six&#xD;
      will be based on investigator judgment. The decision to dose escalate will be made jointly by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and the sponsor based on the clinical data (safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      available PK data and clinical laboratory values).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD). Part B of the study has been designed to assess the&#xD;
      effects of multiple ascending doses of HMPL-523 in healthy volunteers. The total daily doses&#xD;
      and dosing regimen for Part B have been determined as 200, 300,400 and 500 mg based on the&#xD;
      review of safety and PK data from Part A, made jointly by the Principal Investigator and the&#xD;
      sponsor. The dose will be the same or less than one already administered to participants in&#xD;
      Part A. Because dog has similar protein binding to humans, we will closely monitor the&#xD;
      clinical safety and laboratory result when the AUC is getting to 2085 h*ng/mL, which is the&#xD;
      NOAEL AUC in dogs. Further dose escalation will be based on clinical safety and discussion&#xD;
      between the sponsor and the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Preliminary Food Effect Study. Part C of the study has been designed to preliminarily&#xD;
      assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of HMPL-523 in healthy volunteers. Subjects&#xD;
      will first receive a single dose of HMPL-523 100mg under fasted conditions (Period 1) and&#xD;
      then following a washout period of 7 days, will receive a single dose of HMPL-523 100mg after&#xD;
      consuming a standard high fat breakfast (fed conditions) (Period 2). Part C may be conducted&#xD;
      at any time, provided 100 mg has been deemed safe in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study: Adverse events, physical&#xD;
      examination, clinical safety laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), body&#xD;
      weight, oral temperature, triplicate blood pressure and heart rate , and ECG .&#xD;
