  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this Phase 2 cellular and adoptive immunotherapy study&#xD;
      using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&#xD;
      followed by an early, post-transplant infusion of donor natural killer (NK) cells on Day +7&#xD;
      will not only be well-tolerated in this heavily-treated population (safety), but will also&#xD;
      provide a mechanism to treat high-risk solid tumors, leading to improved disease control rate&#xD;
      (efficacy). Disease control rate is defined as the combination of complete (CR) and partial&#xD;
      (PR) response and stable disease (SD). The investigators further propose that this infusion&#xD;
      of donor NK cells will influence the development of particular NK and T cell subtypes which&#xD;
      will provide immediate/long-term tumor surveillance, infectious monitoring, and durable&#xD;
      engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high-risk solid tumors (Ewings Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma and Rhabdomyosarcoma) who&#xD;
      have either measurable or unmeasurable disease and have met eligibility will be enrolled on&#xD;
      this trial for a goal enrollment of 20 patients over 4 years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for 6 days that consists of&#xD;
      Fludarabine 150 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg, and 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI),&#xD;
      followed by HLA-haploidentical marrow from a family member on Day 0. On Days +3 and +4,&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg will be infused for selective in vivo T cell depletion. Additional&#xD;
      post-grafting immune suppression will consist of mycophenolate mofetil and either tacrolimus&#xD;
      or sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected from donors on Day +6,&#xD;
      from which NK cells will be selected and infused into patients on Day +7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for any transplant-related complications and will undergo disease&#xD;
      monitoring every three months for the first two years post-transplant. Research studies will&#xD;
      be conducted to follow the patient's immune status and quality of life post-transplant.&#xD;

        DONOR SELECTION An Unrelated Donor Search is not required for entry on this trial. Lack of&#xD;
        HLA-matched related or unrelated donors is not a requirement for entry on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Related, HLA-haploidentical donors who are identical for one HLA haplotype and&#xD;
             mismatched for any number of HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1 or DQB1 loci of the unshared&#xD;
             haplotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Marrow will be prioritized as the hematopoietic stem cell source of choice. In cases&#xD;
             where adequate stem cells cannot be collected, fresh (preferred) or cryopreserved&#xD;
             donor PBSC may be substituted. In the case that PBSC are used, the donor must be 18&#xD;
             years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HLA-haploidentical donor selection will be based on standard institutional criteria;&#xD;
             otherwise no specific prioritization will be made amongst the suitable available&#xD;
             donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;

             assent in the presence of a parent and an Attending physician who is not a member of&#xD;
             the recipient's care team&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Children greater than or equal to 12-17.9 years of age who have inadequate peripheral&#xD;
             vein access to safely undergo apheresis&#xD;

             initial HCT, storage of autologous blood prior to marrow harvest (if applicable), or&#xD;
             apheresis one week after marrow harvest&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donors who are not expected to meet the minimum target dose of marrow cells (1 x 108&#xD;
             total nucleated cells/kg recipient weight) for the initial marrow HCT or PBSC&#xD;
             transplant (5.0 x 106 CD34/kg recipient weight). The average nucleated cell content of&#xD;
             harvested marrow is 22 x 106 nucleated cells/mL or 220 x 108 total nucleated&#xD;
             cells/Liter&#xD;
