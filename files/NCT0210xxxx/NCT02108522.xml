  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled on this study will have received a stem cell transplant. After a&#xD;
      transplant, while the immune system grows back the patient is at risk for infection. Some&#xD;
      viruses can stay in the body for life and if the immune system is weakened, like after a&#xD;
      transplant, they can cause life threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on this study will have had an infection with one or more of the following&#xD;
      viruses - Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK virus, JC virus, adenovirus or&#xD;
      HHV6 (Human Herpes Virus 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells to treat&#xD;
      infections of these viruses after a transplant. Investigators have observed in other studies&#xD;
      that treatment with specially trained T cells has been successful when the cells are made&#xD;
      from the transplant donor. However as it takes 1-2 months to make the cells, that approach is&#xD;
      not practical when a patient already has an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have now generated multivirus-specific T cells (VSTs) from the blood of healthy&#xD;
      donors and created a bank of these cells. Investigators have previously successfully used&#xD;
      frozen multivirus-specific T cells from healthy donors to treat virus infections after bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant and now have improved the production method to make it safer and target&#xD;
      more viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators want to find out if they can use these banked VSTs to fight&#xD;
      infections caused by the viruses mentioned above.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These VST lines have been made at Baylor College of Medicine from donors for other transplant&#xD;
      patients or other normal donors some of whom were from the National Marrow Donor Program. All&#xD;
      donors have been screened with the standard blood bank donor questionnaire, medical history&#xD;
      and testing for infectious disease by a doctor who is experienced in screening transplant&#xD;
      donors. Only donors who have cleared this process and were deemed to be eligible provided&#xD;
      blood for VST generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lines were made using a special process. To make the VSTs investigators mixed donor cells&#xD;
      with small pieces of proteins, called peptides that come from adenovirus, CMV, EBV, BKV and&#xD;
      HHV6. These peptides stimulate donor T cells that react against the viruses to grow and train&#xD;
      the donor T cells to kill cells that are infected with CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BKV and HHV6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the investigators made sufficient numbers of VSTs, they tested them to make sure they&#xD;
      would target cells infected with these viruses but not normal cells. Then the cells were&#xD;
      frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients treated on this study, the VSTs will be thawed and injected into their&#xD;
      intravenous line. The patient will remain in the clinic for at least one hour after the&#xD;
      infusion. After the patient receives the cells, their transplant doctor will monitor the&#xD;
      levels of the virus the patient is infected with in their blood. The investigators will also&#xD;
      take blood to see how long the VSTs given to the patient last in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will continue to be followed by their doctors after the injection. The patient&#xD;
      will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by a research nurse to follow up for&#xD;
      this study every week for 6 weeks then at 3, 6 and 12 months. The patient may have other&#xD;
      visits for their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also have regular blood tests done to follow their counts and the viral&#xD;
      infection, but most of these will be done as part of their standard medical care. To learn&#xD;
      more about the way the VSTs are working in the patient's body, up to an extra 30-40 ml (6-8&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months. Blood should come from the central intravenous line, and should not require extra&#xD;
      needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants on this study will be infused with the same number (dose) of cells. If after&#xD;
      the first treatment the patient has a persistent infection, we would discuss this with&#xD;
      him/her and allow an option to receive more treatments. These additional treatments might be&#xD;
      with cells from the same donor or if we feel that there is another donor's whose cells might&#xD;
      be better for the patient, we would use cells from a different donor. This second product&#xD;
      will be administered at the same dose level 28 days after the initial infusion, and&#xD;
      subsequent infusions should be at least 14 days apart. After each VST infusion, the patient&#xD;
      will be monitored as described above.&#xD;

                       rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. BK virus: Treatment of persistent BK virus infection or BK virus disease despite&#xD;
                  antiviral treatment with cidofovir or leflunomide. No clear standard treatment is&#xD;
                  defined. Cidofovir has been administered in low doses as well as high doses to&#xD;
                  HSCT patients with BK infections but no randomized trials are available proving&#xD;
                  its clinical efficacy. In small trials leflunomide had activity against BK virus,&#xD;
                  therefore we will consider this agent an acceptable alternative to cidofovir,&#xD;
                  given the absence of a clear first line option.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  BK virus infection is defined as the presence of BK virus positivity as&#xD;
                       detected by PCR or culture in one site such as blood or urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  BK virus disease is defined as the presence of BK virus detectable by&#xD;
                       culture or PCR in blood or urine or other body fluids and symptoms of&#xD;
                       disease including, but not limited to persistent microscopic or macroscopic&#xD;
                       hematuria or detectable BK virus in more than one site.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Failure of therapy is defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral&#xD;
                       load in peripheral blood or any site of disease as measured by PCR or any&#xD;
                       other quantitative assay) or worsening hematuria after 7 days of antiviral&#xD;
                       therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. HHV6: Treatment of persistent HHV6 infection or disease despite antiviral&#xD;
                  treatment with ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet. No clear standard treatment&#xD;
                  is defined. Ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet all have variable in vitro&#xD;
                  activity against HHV-6, and may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated disease&#xD;
                  - therefore antiviral treatment with one or more of these agents will we&#xD;
                  acceptable initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  HHV6 virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated HHV-6 levels as&#xD;
                       detected by PCR or positive culture in one site such as CSF or blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  HHV6 disease is defined as defined as the presence of HHV6 detectable by&#xD;
                       culture or PCR in one or more sites such as blood or CSF and symptoms of&#xD;
                       disease including symptoms of HHV6 encephalitis OR detectable HHV6 by PCR or&#xD;
                       culture in more than one site.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Failure of therapy is defined as a rise or a fall of less than 50% in viral&#xD;
                       load in peripheral blood or any site of disease (as measured by PCR or any&#xD;
                       other quantitative assay) after 7 days of antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. JC virus: Treatment of progressive or persistent JC virus infection or disease&#xD;
                  without suitable alternative treatment option. Pepmixes specific for antigens on&#xD;
                  adenovirus, EBV, CMV, HHV6 and BK virus are used to generate our&#xD;
                  multivirus-specific VSTs. No pepmix specific for the rare JC virus is used for&#xD;
                  generation of these CTLs, however given the high homology (&gt;90%) between JC and&#xD;
                  BK and the fact that BK virus-specific T cells targeting VP1 and Large T (as&#xD;
                  targeted in our multivirus VSTs) have been administered to treat JCV-PML,&#xD;
                  resulting in viral clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid it is likely that our&#xD;
                  VSTs are efficacious against JC virus. Given the current lack of treatment&#xD;
                  options for JC virus infection or reactivation after HSCT and the risk of&#xD;
                  progression to JML, which is almost uniformly fatal, and the apparent activity of&#xD;
                  BK virus-directed T cells against JC virus infected cells, we propose including&#xD;
                  patients with progressive or persistent JC virus on this study, unless a suitable&#xD;
                  alternative therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  JC virus infection is defined as the presence of elevated JC virus levels as&#xD;

             have received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients receiving ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies within 28 days of screening for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must&#xD;
             be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72&#xD;
             hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive&#xD;
             systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or&#xD;
             new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to&#xD;
             infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as&#xD;
             progressing infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are less than 28 days removed from their allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
             cell transplant or who have received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) within 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with active acute GVHD grades II-IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy&#xD;

          <description>Partially HLA-matched multivirus specific T cells (VSTs) will be thawed and given by intravenous injection. Patients will receive 2 x 10^7 VSTs/m2 as a single infusion. In the rare case where insufficient banked cell product is available, a lower number of cells may be infused after discussion with the principal investigator, patient and/or guardian and the treatment team.&#xD;
If after the first treatment there is persistent infection, there is an option to receive more treatments. These additional treatments might be with cells from the same donor or another donor whose cells are also thought to be a good match for the patient and effective against their virus. This second product will be administered at the same dose level 28 days after the initial infusion, and subsequent infusions should be at least 14 days apart.</description>
