      The purpose of the study is to find the best way to mobilize a knee after total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA). In particular, the aim of this study will be to investigate the&#xD;
      advantages of adding a gentle knee mobilization to the standard rehabilitation used by&#xD;
      physiotherapists in this hospital after TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals waiting for TKA from the &quot;Departement de l'appareill Locomoteur (DAL) -&#xD;
      Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudoise (CHUV)&quot; will be considered for this research trial.&#xD;
      The number of individuals necessary to complete this study is 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants deciding to take part will be given an information sheet and asked to sign a&#xD;
      consent form. If deciding to take part, they will still be free to withdraw at any time and&#xD;
      without giving a reason. A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part,&#xD;
      will not affect the standard of care they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who agree to take part will be randomly selected into 2 groups: one group will follow&#xD;
      the standard treatment used in physiotherapy after TKA, the other group will have the same&#xD;
      treatment and the technique of A+ mobilization in investigation added. Participants have 50%&#xD;
      chances to be allocated to either of the groups. Before surgery, at the first and seventh day&#xD;
      after operation, the researchers will measure the range of motion (ROM) of the replaced knee.&#xD;
      This means that the study will last till the moment the last participant leaves the DAL -&#xD;
      CHUV, which is estimated to be in 12 months after the first recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals over 18 years old undergoing unilateral primary TKA caused by osteoarthritis will&#xD;
      included. Exclusion criteria will be: a) insufficient French language skills to agree a&#xD;
      written consent, b) body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2, c) symptomatic OA in the contralateral&#xD;
      knee (defined as self-reported knee pain &gt;4 on a 10-point verbal analogue scale), d) other&#xD;
      lower extremity orthopedic problems limiting function, e) neurologic impairment or g)&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No life-style restrictions will be requested. Patients will just need to follow the&#xD;
      physiotherapist's usual advices during the in-hospital period at the DAL - CHUV. This study&#xD;
      does not alter the standard procedures, patients will receive all the techniques used in&#xD;
      physiotherapy as every other TKA patient. If allocated into the mobilization group, a&#xD;
      specific knee splint will be positioned on the patient's knee. This position will be held for&#xD;
      20 minutes with the leg straight and 20 minutes bent, twice a day. The person in charge of&#xD;
      these procedures is the principal investigator of the study, a certified orthopedic&#xD;
      physiotherapist on the staff of the DAL - CHUV. No additional changes to patients' daily&#xD;
      routine will be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, there are no side effects due to use of this mobilization.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the pain levels of every patient will be recorded to identify any differences&#xD;
      between groups. If, during or after the clinical study, any patient will face unexpected&#xD;
      health problems related with the study, they will be kindly asked to transmit the information&#xD;
      to the principal investigator of the study. The mobilization technique involves no additional&#xD;
      risk over that of standard treatment performed in the hospital. This study hypothesis that&#xD;
      adding A+ graded mobilization combined with the standard in-hospital rehabilitation protocol&#xD;
      will improve ROM without increasing pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information collected will be kept strictly confidential. Any information used will have&#xD;
      names and addresses removed. All data will be stored, analyzed and reported in compliance&#xD;
      with the Data Protection Legislation of Switzerland.&#xD;
