  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is closely associated with apparition of type 2 diabetes mellitus; it is&#xD;
      an independent risk factor and predicts future cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is a validated method to assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and It is also the gold standard technique. However, the complexity and length of this&#xD;
      technique render it unsuitable for routine clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators use a new technique to provide precise, objective, fast and&#xD;
      automated quantification of insulin resistance with camera SPECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They compare the results with those of the measurement of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp&#xD;
      in population with or without insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is to validate this new non-invasive imaging technique for evaluation of&#xD;
      insulin resistance in patients with or without insulin resistance with a comparison with&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, type II diabetes mellitus, has reached epidemic levels in the world. Moreover, the&#xD;
      prediction for the year 2030 is even more alarming. Insulin resistance, characterized by a&#xD;
      depressed cellular sensitivity to insulin in insulin-sensitive organs, is a central feature&#xD;
      of the metabolic syndrome and a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Its appearance may precede&#xD;
      the diagnosis of true diabetes several years. Insulin resistance results in decreased&#xD;
      membrane translocation of GLUT-4, whole the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no simple tool to measure insulin resistance. The gold standard technique remains&#xD;
      the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. However, the complexity and length of this technique&#xD;
      render it unsuitable for routine clinical use. Many methods or index have been proposed to&#xD;
      assess insulin resistance in human, but none have shown enough relevance to be used in&#xD;
      clinical use. Moreover, all these clinical measurements focus on whole-body glucose uptake,&#xD;
      however an accurate and convenient procedure for insulin resistance measurement by organ&#xD;
      would be interesting. Indeed there are increasingly evidences to insulin resistance as a&#xD;
      primary etiologic factor in the development of nonischemic heart failure (HF), another&#xD;
      growing public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nuclear imaging provides interesting methods to measure insulin resistance using Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomographic (PET) tracer. Two glucose analogs [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)&#xD;
      and [11Cl-30methyl-n-glucose (3-OMG) have been used to evaluate noninvasively the cellular&#xD;
      uptake of glucose using PET techniques for several organs like heart, skeletal muscle&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier, and liver. [18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the most commonly&#xD;
      used to study glucose metabolism in humans, allows the estimation of glucose transport and&#xD;
      its phosphorylation. A number of kinetic modeling approaches have been used for the&#xD;
      quantitation of glucose utilization rates using FDG. FDG is transported and phosphorylated as&#xD;
      native glucose, but calculation of glucose uptake and metabolism requires the use of&#xD;
      correction factors for each process merged into a lumped constant. The major limitation of&#xD;
      these approaches is that quantification of glucose metabolism requires the knowledge of the&#xD;
      lumped constant, a factor, which relates the kinetic behavior of FDG to naturally occurring&#xD;
      glucose in terms of the relative affinity of each molecule for the trans-sarcolemmal&#xD;
      transporter and for hexokinase. Unfortunately, the value of the lumped constant in humans&#xD;
      under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions varies, and metabolic imaging&#xD;
      with PET need standardization of metabolic conditions by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp.&#xD;
      3-OMG appears as an ideal glucose analog to probe transmembrane transport. However, due to&#xD;
      the short half-life of the 11C (t1/2 = 20 min), this analog can be used only in clinical&#xD;
      institutions in close proximity of a cyclotron and which have access to PET devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these knowledge, the investigators have developed an original compound, [123I]&#xD;
      6-deoxy-6-iodo-D-glucose (6DIG), as a tracer of glucose transport equivalent to 3-OMG, the&#xD;
      reference tracer. 6-DIG has previously been exploited to measure IR in vivo and the&#xD;
      investigators transfer to human this measurement technique, perfectly validated in animal.&#xD;
      Previous, they have reported the first use a potential single-photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) tracer to study basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport&#xD;
      non-invasively. In a phase I of development, they use a new nuclear probe using an iodinated&#xD;
      tracer of glucose transport for clinical application and specific imaging processing to&#xD;
      assess cardiac insulinoresistance in healthy or diabetic subjects. The results in human&#xD;
      subjects show that this technique rapidly provides insulinoresistance index (ratio&#xD;
      scintigraphy measurement of glucose transport in heart before and after infusion of insulin)&#xD;
      in a simple procedure, opening up new opportunities for screening for pre-diabetic patients.&#xD;
