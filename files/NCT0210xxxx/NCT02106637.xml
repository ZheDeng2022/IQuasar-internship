  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that combination of Varenicline treatment with nurse-led&#xD;
      hospital support during hospitalization and after discharge will result in clinically&#xD;
      significant higher long term abstinence rates in smokers with ACS, as compared with nurse led&#xD;
      support and placebo, without a significant increase in the risk of adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers hospitalized with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for ischemic events&#xD;
      or death. Over two thirds of patients continue to smoke after acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives will evaluate safety and efficacy of Varenicline vs. placebo in hospitalized&#xD;
      ACS patients complemented by nurse-led support. Interventions will continue following&#xD;
      discharge for the duration of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcome measure is continuous abstinence rate at 1 year after&#xD;
      hospitalization as assessed by self-reporting and verified by CO breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      multi-center study. Overall 300 patients will be recruited, randomly allocated to active and&#xD;
      placebo treatment groups that will receive nurse-led support by trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized ACS smokers will be evaluated by the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Patient's demographics, medical and laboratory data will be obtained including Fagestrom&#xD;
      tobacco addiction questionnaire and digitally captured. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to study groups and will receive, Varenicline or placebo, which will be initiated&#xD;
      on the last day of hospitalization and continued for 12 weeks after discharge. Additionally,&#xD;
      a structured nurse-led behavioral support program for smoking cessation will be initiated&#xD;
      during hospitalization, followed by telephone calls that will provide motivational support&#xD;
      and an interview exploring protocol adherence, side effects, changes in health status and&#xD;
      smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be re-assessed at one, 3 and 12 -months post discharge. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will comprise of a physical examination, adverse event assessment and CO breath testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in Western countries, and cigarette&#xD;
      smoking has a clear cause-and -effect relationship with atherosclerotic disease (1). Smokers&#xD;
      hospitalized with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for subsequent ischemic&#xD;
      events and present 50% higher chance of death in the first 2 years (2). Nevertheless, over&#xD;
      two thirds of patients continue to smoke after an acute myocardial infarction. Varenicline&#xD;
      has been shown to be highly effective smoking cessation intervention (4), yet concerns have&#xD;
      been raised regarding safety in coronary patients (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant number of eligible patients do not receive structured smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions following ACS. Initiation of secondary prevention interventions during hospital&#xD;
      stay has been shown to be highly effective for other key secondary prevention interventions&#xD;
      (i.e. statins, beta blockers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, combination of Varenicline treatment with nurse-led hospital support, initiated&#xD;
      early during hospitalization is expected to result in better adherence and better long-term&#xD;
      abstinence rates in smokers with a recent ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study would be the first Israeli trial with Varenicline.&#xD;
