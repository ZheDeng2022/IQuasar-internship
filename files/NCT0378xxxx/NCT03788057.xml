      A prospective, observational, interventional, single-blind study (blinded for a clinician in&#xD;
      the field of inflammatory parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is evaluation of the usefulness of induced sputum eosinophilia and other&#xD;
      inflammatory indices [exhaled nitric oxide (NO), exhaled breath temperature, bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness] in predicting the failure of treatment reduction with inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICS) in stable asthma in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants with a stable course of the asthma (confirmed in the run -in period), every 3&#xD;
      months the dose of ICS is halved (according to GINA guidelines) until the control is lost or&#xD;
      the lowest daily ICS dose is reached (200 mcg, calculated as budesonide equivalent).&#xD;
      Throughout the treatment reduction period, the participants run an observation card (clinical&#xD;
      symptoms) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements. Clinical evaluation is performed&#xD;
      every month, with spirometry, exhaled NO and exhaled breath temperature measurements. Before&#xD;
      the reduction and then one month after the change of treatment, the hyperresponsiveness&#xD;
      measurement is carried out with the sputum induction (combined method using hypertonic&#xD;
      saline), and 2 months after the change of treatment with the exercise challenge test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of loss of asthma control, beta-mimetic will be administered (temporarily) and&#xD;
      return to dose of ICS before reduction or further increase of treatment is planned. In severe&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations, oral steroids will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational: treatment is modified according to GINA guidelines based on&#xD;
      clinical data as part of routine medical care. Only difference compared do standard care is&#xD;
      supplementary inflammation evaluation (exhaled NO, sputum eosinophilia, bronchial&#xD;
      hyperreactivity).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Guidelines for the treatment of asthma recommend the use of the smallest dose of&#xD;
      inhaled steroid (ICS), which allows to maintain control of the symptoms of the disease. The&#xD;
      GINA 2006 guidelines proposed (and later editions it upheld) that in the case of symptom&#xD;
      control by monotherapy with ICS, to reduce their dose every 3 months, up to the lowest dose&#xD;
      administered once a day, which should be used for one year before taking possible decision to&#xD;
      stop it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no clear of simple and sensitive indicators that would allow detection of a&#xD;
      threatening loss of control before the clinical symptoms worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study Evaluation of the usefulness of induced sputum eosinophilia and other&#xD;
      inflammatory indices [exhaled nitric oxide (NO), exhaled breath temperature (EBT), bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness] in predicting the failure of treatment reduction with inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids in stable asthma in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Participants aged 12-18 years with stable asthma (mild or moderate), treated in the&#xD;
      Allergy Clinic of the Hospital in Lesko with medium doses in ICS. The severity of asthma was&#xD;
      initially determined in accordance with the GINA criteria and verified during several years&#xD;
      of observation by the assessment of clinical symptoms, functional examinations and the dose&#xD;
      of inhaled steroids controlling the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description A prospective, observational, single-blind study (blinded for a clinician&#xD;
      in the field of inflammatory parameters). Clinician takes decision about possible reduction&#xD;
      of ICS dose basing on clinical data only - is not aware of the results of the inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is consisting of two periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First period (run - in):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four-week run - in period in which clinical symptoms and the use of short acting beta2&#xD;
      agonists (SABA) and PEFR are monitored. At the end of this period, in participants with&#xD;
      stable disease the following parameters are measured: eNO, EBT, spirometry, and sputum&#xD;
      induction with hyperosmolar saline in combination with the hyperresponsiveness. Before the&#xD;
      reduction of treatment on another day, an exercise challenge test is also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for the stability of asthma in the run - in period are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptoms no more than 3 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SABA use less than 3 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  without night wake up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEFR variability below 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FEV1 above 80% of predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second period of the study - reduction of anti-inflammatory therapy. In participants with&#xD;
      previously stable course of the asthma (confirmed in the run -in period), the control of&#xD;
      asthma is monitored regularly throughout the observation period. All participants run an&#xD;
      observation card (clinical symptoms) and PEFR measurements. Monthly spirometry, exhaled NO&#xD;
      and exhaled breath temperature measurements are performed. Every 3 months and one month after&#xD;
      the change of treatment (i.e in months 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7), the hyperresponsiveness&#xD;
      measurement is carried out with the sputum induction (combined method, [7]). Two months after&#xD;
      the dose change (months 2, 5, 8) the exercise challenge test is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months control of the asthma symptoms is evaluated taking account the clinical data,&#xD;
      and possible change of ICS dose is considered. Results of bronchial reactivity measurements&#xD;
      and sputum cytology are not known to clinician who decide on a possible ICS dose change - he&#xD;
      is blinded to the results of tests and the therapeutic decision is based solely on clinical&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants with a stable course of the disease over past 3 months, the dose of ICS is&#xD;
      halved, in accordance with GINA guidelines. In the case of loss of asthma control,&#xD;
      appropriate treatment modifications are administered and the patient is withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is continued until asthma control is lost or the lowest daily dose&#xD;
      is reached (200 mcg, calculated as budesonide equivalent) - without losing asthma control at&#xD;
      next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily clinical evaluation by the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  symptoms score according to the Santanello questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PEFR measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Every month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Asthma Control Test&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  spirometry [forced expiratory flow in 1st second (FEV1), forced vital capacity&#xD;
                (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75)]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  eNO measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  exhaled breath temperature measurement (EBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life test (QoL, Polish version of the questionnaire), i.e. months 3, 6,&#xD;
                9&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cytological evaluation of induced sputum (i.e. months 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of bronchial hyperresponsiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  one month after the ICS dose reduction and then before each subsequent dose&#xD;
                     reduction in ICS ((i.e. months 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) - during the sputum induction&#xD;
                     with hyperosmolar salt (combined method)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  2 months after each treatment reduction (i.e. months 2, 5, 8): exercise&#xD;
                     challenge test (6-minute free-running test monitored by pulse)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for loss of control [1, 6] - any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of bronchodilators&gt; 5 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the need for treatment with oral corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEFR decrease above 20% for 2 consecutive days, compared to the average run-in period In&#xD;
           the case of loss of asthma control, beta-mimetic will be administered (temporarily) and&#xD;
           return to the chronic administration of the previous, twice higher dose of ICS is&#xD;
           restored (or further increase of treatment). In severe exacerbations, inclusion of oral&#xD;
           steroids will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discontinuation of participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Loss of asthma control (treatment strategy: beta-mimetic temporarily, return to dose of&#xD;
           ICS before reduction or further increase of treatment; in severe exacerbations,&#xD;
           inclusion of oral steroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lack of adherence to the recommendations or failure to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff of the center has experience in the production of sputum induction in participants&#xD;
      with asthma [Ciółkowski J, Mazurek H, Stasiowska B. Evaluation of step - down therapy from an&#xD;
      inhaled steroid to montelukast in childhood asthma. Allergologia et immunopathologia (Madr.),&#xD;
      2014: Jul - Aug; 42 (4): 282 - 288].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will be performed in conditions ensuring patient safety, with the availability of an&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist and anti-shock kit.&#xD;
