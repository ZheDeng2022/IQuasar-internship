    <textblock>
      Open maternal-fetal surgery is currently used on fetuses with myelomeningocele (MMC).&#xD;
      Fetoscopic or minimal access fetal surgery is also being used to treat fetuses with&#xD;
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following accurate diagnosis of a congenital malformation such as MMC or CDH, prospective&#xD;
      parents face a range of uncertainties regarding the future of their unborn child, and the&#xD;
      options provided require major ethical considerations. In the situation under study,&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy may be for some parents an alternative option to expectant prenatal&#xD;
      management. Fetal therapy provides a tantalising third option for some, where procedures are&#xD;
      undertaken to reduce the likelihood of a more complicated neonatal course, potentially&#xD;
      improving long term outcome, but at risk of amniotic fluid leakage, infection and most&#xD;
      importantly very preterm delivery, itself associated with significant neonatal mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity and long-term consequences. Balancing these competing risks is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an intervention to be effective it also needs to be acceptable to women and their&#xD;
      families. &quot;Acceptability&quot; can be defined as a multi-faceted construct that reflects the&#xD;
      extent to which people delivering or receiving a healthcare intervention consider it to be&#xD;
      appropriate, based on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study it is the aim to assess how women (and their partners) perceive the&#xD;
      acceptability of a fetal surgical intervention for MMC and CDH. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      share their thoughts, views, feelings and experiences with regards to the decision to&#xD;
      participate in fetal surgery. Data are collected by the use of in-depth face-to-face&#xD;
      interviews. In-depth interviews are used to understand the participant's perspectives and&#xD;
      perceptions of a situation they are in. It explicitly includes participants interpretation&#xD;
      and understanding of an event&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be held in two or three moments in time (for parents opting for fetal&#xD;
      surgery, there will be one additional interview, after the intervention while admitted in&#xD;
      hospital): after counselling for options, but before eventual intervention; for intervention&#xD;
      group shortly after the intervention, and 12 weeks after birth of the baby, or termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      1. Background and rationale Fetal surgery is a highly technical procedure carried out by&#xD;
           only a few specialised teams around the world. Fetal surgery improves outcomes for key&#xD;
           conditions, but at significant procedure related fetal and maternal risk. Open&#xD;
           maternal-fetal surgery is currently used on fetuses with myelomeningocele (MMC).&#xD;
           Fetoscopic or minimal access fetal surgery is also being used to treat fetuses with&#xD;
           congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). By combining improved instrumentation, imaging,&#xD;
           clinical training and public engagement The Guided Instrumentation for Fetal Therapy and&#xD;
           Surgery (GIFT-Surg) project aims to provide fetal surgeons with tools to make fetal&#xD;
           surgery safer and more efficient. The UZ and KU Leuven team participates in this&#xD;
           engineering project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following accurate diagnosis of a congenital malformation such as MMC or CDH,&#xD;
           prospective parents face a range of uncertainties regarding the future of their unborn&#xD;
           child, and the options provided require major ethical considerations. In the situation&#xD;
           under study, termination of pregnancy may be for some parents an alternative option to&#xD;
           expectant prenatal management. Fetal therapy provides a tantalising third option for&#xD;
           some, where procedures are undertaken to reduce the likelihood of a more complicated&#xD;
           neonatal course, potentially improving long term outcome, but at risk of amniotic fluid&#xD;
           leakage, infection and most importantly very preterm delivery, associated with&#xD;
           significant neonatal mortality and morbidity and long-term consequences. Balancing these&#xD;
           competing risks is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Myelomeningocele Prevalence, incidence, clinical presentation Myelomeningocele&#xD;
                (MMC) or spina bifida is a congenital abnormality arising 28 days post-conception&#xD;
                when part of the neural tube fails to close. Open spina bifida can present either&#xD;
                with a flat defect without a fluid filled sac covering (myeloschisis), or&#xD;
                membranous covering with extrusion of the cord into the sac (myelomeningocele). Its&#xD;
                prevalence is approximately 4.9 per 10,000 live births in Europe. Myelomeningocele&#xD;
                is a severe, yet non-lethal congenital abnormality affecting the central nervous&#xD;
                system, with complex physical and neurodevelopmental sequelae. In most cases it is&#xD;
                also associated with the Chiari Type II malformation (hindbrain herniation) and&#xD;
                ventriculomegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Therapy, risks and (long-term) outcome Until recently, the only options available&#xD;
                to parents, once a diagnosis was made prenatally, were expectant management with&#xD;
                delivery and postnatal surgery, or a pregnancy termination. But over the last&#xD;
                thirty years, it became obvious that the condition is progressive in utero, as is&#xD;
                suggested by the &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis; an initial embryonic failure in neurulation&#xD;
                followed by secondary changes because of continuous exposure of the spinal cord to&#xD;
                the intrauterine environment and the suction gradient on the hindbrain. This led to&#xD;
                the concept of fetal intervention to arrest or reverse this natural course.&#xD;
                Successful fetal coverage of MMC with improved functional outcome in the lamb model&#xD;
                was first described in the late 1990s. This was translated clinically with&#xD;
                encouraging early results in several case series and eventually led to the&#xD;
                randomized controlled Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS). This study&#xD;
                demonstrated that mid-gestational layered repair reduces the need for&#xD;
                ventriculoperitoneal shunting, improves the degree of hindbrain herniation, and&#xD;
                preserves motor function better than postnatal surgery. However, fetal surgery for&#xD;
                spina bifida comes with substantial maternal and fetal risks. The fetus is at&#xD;
                increased risk of premature birth and its sequelae including sepsis,&#xD;
                intraventricular haemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing&#xD;
                enterocolitis and death. Besides there is the risk for maternal complications and&#xD;
                the corporeal scar compromises uterine integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia Prevalence, incidence, clinical presentation Due to&#xD;
                a defect in the diaphragm during embryonic development, abdominal organs herniate&#xD;
                through the defect into the thoracic cavity, interfering with lung growth,&#xD;
                resulting in developmental arrest of both airways and pulmonary vasculature.&#xD;
                Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in 1/2500 to 1/5000 births, depending&#xD;
                on whether stillbirths are included. Although the diaphragmatic defect is&#xD;
                correctable after birth, the prenatal arrest of airway and vessel development is&#xD;
                the main reason for postnatal problems, leading to respiratory failure and&#xD;
                pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in the neonatal period. Although prenatal referral to&#xD;
                specialist centers, high throughput and advanced neonatal care has improved&#xD;
                survival, still 20-30% of all cases die. Besides, survivors experience ongoing&#xD;
                pulmonary and nutritional morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Therapy, risks and (long-term) outcome In fetuses with poor prognosis, fetal lung&#xD;
                growth can be stimulated by fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) with a&#xD;
                balloon. The fetal lung is a net secretor of fluid into the amniotic cavity and the&#xD;
                lungs are maintained at a small positive pressure in normal development. Fetal&#xD;
                tracheal occlusion (TO) prevents egress of lung liquid, leading to increased back&#xD;
                pressure, in turn promoting stretch-induced growth of airways and vessels. TO&#xD;
                appears to trigger sufficient lung growth to protect the lung from developing&#xD;
                pulmonary hypoplasia. In utero reversal of the occlusion prompts pulmonary&#xD;
                maturation. Experimentally an endoscopic technique of tracheal occlusion using a&#xD;
                balloon was developed. In 2004, it was first applied clinically and referred to as&#xD;
                Fetoscopic Endoluminal Tracheal Occlusion (FETO).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The major risk following the procedure is spontaneous pre-labour rupture of&#xD;
                membranes before 37 weeks (PPROM). Gestational age at delivery logically is an&#xD;
                important predictor of survival and morbidity in CDH fetuses, also when undergoing&#xD;
                fetal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A meta-analysis suggests that FETO improves survival, but the procedure remains to&#xD;
                be considered investigational and is therefore currently evaluated within a&#xD;
                randomized controlled clinical trial (www.totaltrial.eu).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Acceptability For an intervention to be effective it also needs to be acceptable to&#xD;
                women and their families. &quot;Acceptability&quot; can be defined as a multi-faceted&#xD;
                construct that reflects the extent to which people delivering or receiving a&#xD;
                healthcare intervention consider it to be appropriate, based on anticipated or&#xD;
                experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the intervention. Based on this&#xD;
                definition a theoretical framework of acceptability comprising seven components has&#xD;
                been developed: affective attitude, burden, perceived effectiveness, ethicality,&#xD;
                intervention coherence, opportunity costs, and self-efficacy. Successful&#xD;
                implementation of an intervention means that it is acceptable for both recipients&#xD;
                and deliverers. This study focuses on the recipients; measurement of acceptability&#xD;
                for deliverers will be considered as other facets of the wider GIFT-Surg project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Timing is an important factor in the assessment as the relationship to perceived and&#xD;
           actual experiences may differ. Acceptability is therefore assessed in two or three&#xD;
           moments in time: prospective acceptability, concurrent acceptability and retrospective&#xD;
           acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective: to assess how women (and their partners) perceive the acceptability&#xD;
           of a fetal surgical intervention for MMC and CDH. Participants will be asked to share&#xD;
           their thoughts, views, feelings and experiences with regards to the decision to&#xD;
           participate in fetal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a qualitative in-depth interview study, to include approximately 48&#xD;
           women/couples at University Hospital Leuven for two fetal conditions (MMC and CDH),&#xD;
           given all data on these 48 patients are complete. An estimated dropout rate of 50% means&#xD;
           that in total 4 patients per treatment option (fetal surgery, expectant management,&#xD;
           termination), and per condition (MMC or CDH) will be available for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As not all parents opt for fetal surgery, after referral and counselling for prenatal&#xD;
           diagnosed isolated spinal defects and congenital diaphragmatic hernia, patients fall&#xD;
           into three groups: 1. Parents opting for fetal surgery, 2. Parents opting for&#xD;
           termination of pregnancy and 3. Parents opting for expectant management. To assess&#xD;
           acceptability of the intervention, it is of value to assess acceptability of the&#xD;
           intervention in all three groups. In particular, knowledge of non-acceptability&#xD;
           important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Trial Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will take place by executing face-to-face interviews. The interviews&#xD;
           will be held in three moments in time: before, during (i.e. shortly after the&#xD;
           intervention) and after the intervention. Prospective acceptability will be assessed,&#xD;
           after patients have been first counselled and assessed, but before the intervention at&#xD;
           stake. Concurrent acceptability, patients will be interviewed shortly after the&#xD;
           intervention while still admitted for post-surgery observation, and retrospective&#xD;
           acceptability three months after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The interviews assessing prospective and concurrent acceptability will always be planned&#xD;
           along visits to the treatment hospital so parents never have to come on purpose to the&#xD;
           hospital for an interview, and will be held in Dutch or English. The interviews are&#xD;
           expected to last approximately 30-60 minutes and will follow an interview guide. As it&#xD;
           is acknowledged women (and their partners) go through an intensive and emotionally&#xD;
           upsetting process, interviews will only be carried out if the patient is capable of&#xD;
           participating in an interview, based on the patient's personal assessment as well as&#xD;
           their doctor's assessment. For retrospective acceptability, depending on participant's&#xD;
           preference, the interview can take place through teleconference or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data-collection Data are collected by the use of in-depth interviews. In-depth&#xD;
           interviews are used to understand the participant's perspectives and perceptions of a&#xD;
           situation they are in. It explicitly includes participants interpretation and&#xD;
           understanding of an event. The style of interviewing will be 'responsive'; this style&#xD;
           emphasises on the importance of building a relationship of trust between interviewer and&#xD;
           interviewee. This is done by creating a quiet and calm environment, an empathically&#xD;
           neutral position of the interviewer and an open approach by using verbal and non-verbal&#xD;
           communication. There will not be a set list of questions, but an interview guide based&#xD;
           on one main-question, with different themes for probing, based on the seven components&#xD;
           of the framework of acceptability. The interview will follow six stages as described by&#xD;
           Yeo et al.: arrival and introduction: establish rapport, 'host' the interaction(stage&#xD;
           1); introducing the research (aims and objectives, confidentiality, voluntary, scope of&#xD;
           interview (participant in control), no right or wrong answers(stage 2); beginning of the&#xD;
           interview: discuss contextual background information for reference and set the tone&#xD;
           (stage 3); during the interview (start recording: breadth and depth of subject)(stage&#xD;
           4); ending the interview: advance notice of end and opportunity for respondent to raise&#xD;
           anything important not yet discussed (stage 5); and after the interview: thanking and&#xD;
           emphasize on value of sharing their experience, how information is treated and used,&#xD;
           follow up and further meetings to be scheduled (stage 6)(interview guide).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The interviews will be recorded digitally with an audio recorder. Subsequently,&#xD;
           interviews will be transcribed and coded transcripts will be translated into English and&#xD;
           used for analysis. Back-translation will be used for a sample of 5 transcripts in Dutch&#xD;
           to ensure accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intended sample size in Belgium is 12 women for MMC and 12 for CDH at study completion;&#xD;
           in the UK the investigators expect to include 10 women for MMC and 5 for CDH. This&#xD;
           sample size has been determined from interviewing clinical stakeholders. Sample size in&#xD;
           qualitative research are usually small, as in analysis there will be at some point a&#xD;
           moment in which no new information is obtained from additional interviews. This is also&#xD;
           called saturation. The aim of this research is not to determine statistically&#xD;
           significant discriminatory variables, but to get an in-depth understanding of the views&#xD;
           and preferences of the participants, and to assess acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
           Exact sample size will depend on saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis is purely qualitative. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim by the&#xD;
      researcher. Content analyses will be performed by using the qualitative software programme.&#xD;
      First, initial content and subjects of interest are identified, the so-called familiarization&#xD;
      with the data. This first step is followed by the initial construct of a framework. The&#xD;
      framework constructs the headings under which respondent's views, feelings, experiences and&#xD;
      perceptions can be organized. The framework is than used for labelling the data: quotes or&#xD;
      pieces of text are ordered according to the different themes to fit in. The next step will be&#xD;
      further refinement of the framework by making connections between categories and placing them&#xD;
      in a broader context related to the framework of acceptability. To improve the quality of the&#xD;
      analysis, at various moments interim analyses will be discussed among co-authors with a&#xD;
      background in psychology and qualitative analysis. Thereafter, all previously analyzed&#xD;
      transcripts will be reviewed to check that the content is consistent with this concept&#xD;
      (thematic analysis).&#xD;
