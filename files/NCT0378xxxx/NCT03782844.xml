  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and frequently-occurring disease. The incidence of&#xD;
      OSA is more than 4% in general population, and as high as 20% - 40% in the elderly. At&#xD;
      present, CPAP machines commonly used for OSA treatment includes traditional pressure fixed&#xD;
      single-level CPAP machine and automatic pressure regulation CPAP machine. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that the CPAP treatment pressure of OSA patients is normally below 11 cmH2O. Since the&#xD;
      condition of OSA patients and the required CPAP treatment pressure may change over time, a&#xD;
      CPAP machine with automatic pressure regulation function may theoretically better meet the&#xD;
      needs of treatment. However, a recent large-scale clinical study with an average follow-up of&#xD;
      four years showed that there was little need to change CPAP treatment pressure after&#xD;
      titration. Although different types of CPAP have different functions, the basic principle is&#xD;
      to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed to eliminate sleep apnea and hypopnea by&#xD;
      continuously applying positive pressure to the upper respiratory tract through an air pump. A&#xD;
      complex CPAP machine with functions such as pressure regulation, boost delay, end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure release will cost more than a single-function CPAP machine. Some patients from poor&#xD;
      areas, even with severe OSA, may give up treatment when they can not afford CPAP machines&#xD;
      that have not yet been included in national health insurance in China. In view of the current&#xD;
      economic level in China, it is urgent to find an inexpensive and effective CPAP machine for&#xD;
      the treatment of OSA and related complications. Recently, Guangzhou Yinghui Medical&#xD;
      Technology Co., Ltd.and State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease have developed a new&#xD;
      simple CPAP machine. The CPAP treatment pressure is fixed at the factory to 6 cm H2O (SKL), 8&#xD;
      cm H2O (SKM) and 10 cm H2O (SKH). Compared to traditional CPAP machine, only a power switch&#xD;
      button is attached on the body, and the additional adjustment devices including display&#xD;
      screen are removed, which not only reduces the cost of the CPAP machine, but also facilitates&#xD;
      the operation of patients.&#xD;

      Study Design: A randomized, cross-over and double blind study . Objective: To investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of simple device of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A randomized, cross-over and double blind study would&#xD;
      be performed on 100 OSA patients using both simple CPAP and traditional CPAP during overnight&#xD;
      polysomnography. Pressure for CPAP treatment would be manual titrated. The sleep apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index (AHI), arousal index (ArI), Oxygen desaturation Index (ODI), sleep structure&#xD;
      and the preference of CPAP model were to be observed.&#xD;
