    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, single centre study investigating the pharmacokinetics, safety and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of a single dose of teverelix TFA, a gonadotrophin releasing hormone&#xD;
      antagonist, via subcutaneous or intramuscular route of administration in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of teverelix following single dose,&#xD;
      subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of teverelix TFA in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of teverelix TFA after single s.c. and i.m.&#xD;
           injections in healthy male subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of teverelix following single dose, s.c. and&#xD;
           i.m. administration of teverelix TFA in healthy male subjects&#xD;

             related restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up&#xD;
             visits and improbability of completing the clinical study.&#xD;

         23. Subject has any concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the clinical&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Subject is an employee or the close relative of an employee of the Sponsor or the&#xD;

         25. Vulnerable subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a&#xD;
             clinical study may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not,&#xD;
             of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior&#xD;
             members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate (e.g., persons in detention,&#xD;
             minors and those incapable of giving consent).&#xD;
