  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mariposa Community Health Center, a health center in Nogales, Arizona on the US-Mexico&#xD;
      border, will provide a program to prevent obesity in children and create a community&#xD;
      environment that supports a healthy lifestyle. Mariposa designed and implemented the La Vida&#xD;
      Buena (&quot;The Good Life&quot;) program and already know that helps families eat more healthily and&#xD;
      exercise. Mariposa Community Health Center will test this program on younger children aged&#xD;
      5-8 years old. Providers will refer children who are overweight or obese to the La Vida Buena&#xD;
      Program. In order to determine if the La Vida Buena program works, Mariposa Community Health&#xD;
      center will implement the 8-week program with 100 overweight or obese children in their&#xD;
      Nogales clinic. They will measure their weight (BMI), exercise levels and food habits at the&#xD;
      beginning of the program and then 3- months and 6-months after the program ends. Mariposa&#xD;
      will compare these results to children in the nearby Rio Rico clinic who do not receive the&#xD;
      La Vida Buena program. These 100 overweight or obese children in Rio Rico will instead&#xD;
      receive one educational session, and the same information will be collected regarding BMI,&#xD;
      exercise level and food habits. After the 6-month period, the children from Rio Rico will be&#xD;
      able to receive the full La Vida Buena program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      La Vida Buena is a Mariposa project to educate children and families about healthy eating and&#xD;
      exercise habits. The Health providers at Mariposa Nogales and Rio Rico clinics will refer&#xD;
      children between 5-8 years old who are overweight or obese and their parents. Each child must&#xD;
      participate with a parent or adult caregiver who is at least 18 years old. Before the program&#xD;
      begins, the participant will attend an informational consent/registration session where they&#xD;
      will be asked to sign a consent form for themselves and their child if they want to&#xD;
      participate. The study will ask for certain information from each participant in order to&#xD;
      determine if the program is working. Each family will respond to a questionnaire at three&#xD;
      points: at the beginning of the program, three months after beginning the program, and six&#xD;
      months after beginning the program, for a total of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will include questions about fruit, vegetable and carbohydrate consumption,&#xD;
      family behavior and habits regarding eating and exercise, moderate and vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity, sedentary behavior, local foods and environment factors that impact the family. In&#xD;
      addition, the child's weight will be measured at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in La Vida Buena will take 6 months. At the Nogales site, participants will be&#xD;
      invited to a series of weekly classes over the course of 8 weeks that are being offered by&#xD;
      the Mariposa clinic related to child healthy weight, exercise and nutrition. At the Rio Rico&#xD;
      site, participants will be offered one face to face educational session about child healthy&#xD;
      weight with Mariposa staff. Participants will be scheduled for BMI measurements and&#xD;
      questionnaires three months after initiating the program, as well as six months after&#xD;
      initiating the La Vida Buena Program.&#xD;
