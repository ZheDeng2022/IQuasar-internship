      This study is being conducted as a feasibility clinical investigation to collect safety and&#xD;
      technical performance data of the WOLF Thrombectomy Device for the removal of thrombus in the&#xD;
      neurovasculature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, feasibility&#xD;
      clinical investigation to evaluate the safety and device technical performance of the WOLF&#xD;
      Thrombectomy Device in removing thrombus from an occluded large intracranial vessel(s) in&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. The device may be used alone or as an adjunct to&#xD;
      intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or to other traditional, thrombectomy&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;

    <description>Technical Success defined as the ability to achieve a revascularization rate (Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [TICI] 2b/3) of ≥50% with the first pass of the WOLF Thrombectomy device. Revascularization is assessed by the investigator using fluoroscopy and after the first pass of the device is assessed using the TICI scale. Additional passes will be performed as necessary and the total number of attempts to achieve revascularization documented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects age ≥18 years (no upper limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. NIHSS &gt; 6 at the time of baseline neuro imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated within 60 minutes of qualifying&#xD;
             neuroimaging and intended vessel recanalization within 90 minutes of qualifying&#xD;
             neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stroke symptom onset within 24hrs of when groin puncture can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Anterior and posterior circulation large vessel occlusion as confirmed through neuro&#xD;
             imaging (CT/CTA/mCTA/MRI/MRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Neurovascular imaging (CTA/mCTA and or MRA) must include the aortic arch, cervical&#xD;
             vessels and intracranial circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Advanced neurovascular imaging is required for patients when groin puncture can be&#xD;
             obtained after 6 hours and before 24 hours (multiphase CTA, CT Perfusion or perfusion&#xD;
             diffusion imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The occlusion is located in a proximal intracranial artery (carotid artery, M1 segment&#xD;
             of the MCA, or proximal M2 divisions) of the anterior circulation for patients after 6&#xD;
             hours and before 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. There is imaging and clinical evidence of small core and large areas at risk, defined&#xD;
             in the previous trials (DAWN &amp; DEFUSE 3) as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. NIHSS ≥10 and either 0-21 ml core infarct (≥80 years old) or 0-31 ml core infarct&#xD;
             (&lt;80 years old), or NIHSS≥20 and 31 to &lt;51ml core infarct and &lt;80 years old (DAWN&#xD;
             trial criteria).&#xD;

             months.&#xD;
