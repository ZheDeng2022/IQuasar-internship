    <textblock>
      Betamethasone is currently given routinely in conjunction with tonsillectomy surgery at the&#xD;
      majority of Ear, Nose &amp; Throat clinics in Sweden. The scientific evidence regarding the&#xD;
      effects of betamethasone in adults is limited when it comes to postoperative nausea (PONV),&#xD;
      pain and postoperative bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Steroids are used routinely aiming to reduce pain and nausea, especially in surgery with high&#xD;
      levels of postoperative pain. The majority of international studies on tonsillectomy (TE) are&#xD;
      performed on dexamethasone which is used in large parts of the world. Use of steroids when TE&#xD;
      is performed on children are also more studied on than on adults. Islam et al 2011&#xD;
      demonstrated in a study that dexamethasone (8 mg) reduced postoperative nausea for 24 hours&#xD;
      in a study population of both children and adults. Mc Kean et al 2006 studied the effect of&#xD;
      10 mg dexamethasone on nausea in adults after TE during a seven-day period. Effect was seen&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours but not the remaining days. With regard to postoperative pain, the&#xD;
      research results differ in terms of what effect steroids have at TE. Mc Kean et al 2006&#xD;
      showed significantly lower estimated pain on surgery day and day 4 to 7 after a single dose&#xD;
      of dexamethasone peroperatively. Stewart et al 2002 has shown that, by means of&#xD;
      preoperatively given dexamethasone (8 mg) and in decreasing dose over an 8 day period&#xD;
      postoperative [2mgx2 for 4 days and then 2mgx1 for 4 days], the patient's estimated pain and&#xD;
      consumption of additional pain relievers were reduced. Michele et al 1999, on the other hand,&#xD;
      found no effect on pain over a 10 day period despite a relatively high peroperatively dose of&#xD;
      dexamethasone (20 mg). There are, however, studies on children, suggesting that there is a&#xD;
      dose-dependent relationship between dexamethasone and postoperative bleeding after TE in&#xD;
      children. In a study by Czarnetzki et al 2008, 0.05, 0.15 and 0.5 mg / kg dexamethasone were&#xD;
      used peroperatively. In this study it was seen that 0.5 mg / kg dexamethasone increased the&#xD;
      risk of bleeding from 4% to 24%, which led to a premature termination of the study due to the&#xD;
      bleeding risk. In 2012, a meta-analysis of the steroid effect on bleeding after tonsillectomy&#xD;
      was conducted by Plante et al. Both studies on children and adults were included. No&#xD;
      significant increase in the overall frequency of bleeding after tonsillectomy was seen. On&#xD;
      the other hand, a significant increase in the number of haemorrhages that required operative&#xD;
      action was noted. This could be interpreted as that the severity of bleedings was increased.&#xD;
      It was recommended that systemic steroids should be used with caution until further studies&#xD;
      have been performed. The investigators conducted a retrospective study on children with TE in&#xD;
      Gällivare with and without betamethasone (69 patients in total) and found no evidence of&#xD;
      increased bleeding risk, but also no effect on PONV. However, a significant effect on pain&#xD;
      was found during the first 24 hours postoperative with the average dose of 0.15 mg / kg. When&#xD;
      comparing different cortisone preparations, 8 mg of betamethasone corresponds to&#xD;
      approximately 10 mg of dexamethasone. Bellis et al., 2014 performed a meta-analysis of&#xD;
      dexamethasone and postoperative bleeding at TE in children, but considered that more studies&#xD;
      are needed to determine the bleeding risk before any safe conclusions can be drawn. Thus,&#xD;
      there are uncertainties with regard to the cortisone effect, both when it comes to the size&#xD;
      of the dose and whether there really is an effect on PONV and / or postoperative pain or not.&#xD;
      On the other hand one does not want to use high doses with risks of postoperative bleeding.&#xD;
      Betamethasone has not been studied to the same extent as dexamethasone, and in Sweden&#xD;
      betamethasone is preferably used preoperatively to counteract PONV and pain associated with&#xD;
      certain operations. The results of previous studies are however not conclusive and there is&#xD;
      no consensus of what doses that should be used. In Sweden 4 mg of betamethasone, given&#xD;
      intravenously during the surgery, is routine at tonsillectomy surgery. However, in the&#xD;
      literature there is very weak evidence that such a small dose have any effect. On the other&#xD;
      hand, there are studies signaling that dexamethasone doses of 20 mg (= 16 mg betamethasone)&#xD;
      reduced PONV, but increased postoperative hemorrhages after TE surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids may act via the following mechanisms: (1) anti-inflammatory effect; (2)&#xD;
      direct central action at the solitary tract nucleus, (3) interaction with the&#xD;
      neurotransmitter serotonin, and receptor proteins tachykinin NK1 and NK2, alpha-adrenaline,&#xD;
      etc.; (4) maintaining the normal physiological functions of organs and systems; (5)&#xD;
      regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; and (6) reducing pain and the&#xD;
      concomitant use of opioids, which in turn reduces opioid-related nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Risk/Benefit evaluation One of the main problems after tonsillectomy is PONV and&#xD;
      especially postoperative pain that can persist up to 10-14 days after the surgery. This long&#xD;
      period of postoperative pain leads to weakness and dehydration due to difficulties to eat and&#xD;
      drink after the operation. Sometimes hemorrhage after TE can be fatal, but normally the&#xD;
      bleeding can be stopped with local anaesthesia or diathermy during general anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Normally this type of bleeding occurs in 8-10% after TE. After TE the patients normally go&#xD;
      home the same day as the surgery. In northern Sweden the distances from the Hospital with an&#xD;
      ear, nose and throat (ENT) emergency unit to the home of the patients could be as far as&#xD;
      3-400 kilometers. In this situation it is not advisory to give additional medications, which&#xD;
      increases the risk of lethal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of 8 mg betamethasone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced PONV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced pain =&gt; Less NSAID pain killers =&gt; Less risk of hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced pain =&gt; Increased ability to eat and drink =&gt; less risk of postoperative&#xD;
           infection =&gt; less risk of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced pain =&gt; Shorter sick leave =&gt; Socioeconomic benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of 8 mg betamethasone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased bleeding risk =&gt; more patients comes back to the hospital due to hemorrhage =&gt;&#xD;
           more patients need re-surgery with diathermy of the bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with gastric ulcers have an increased risk of gastric bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous retrospective study showed a reduced pain postoperatively with 8 mg betamethasone,&#xD;
      without any sign of increased postoperative hemorrhage. There are no studies that have showed&#xD;
      an increased postoperative risk of hemorrhage with 10 mg of dexamethasone given to adults at&#xD;
      TE surgery. On the other hand lower doses of dexamethasone, as for example 5 mg (= 4 mg of&#xD;
      betamethasone), does not seem to have any clinical benefits. The aim of the present study is&#xD;
      to evaluate if it is possible to register a beneficial effect of 8 mg betamethasone, given as&#xD;
      a premedication orally, without increasing side effects as increased bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the side effects are mild and probably very infrequent, while the positive&#xD;
      effects are visible in almost all patients with less pain and a shorter recovery period after&#xD;
      the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 3.1. Primary objective The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to verify if 8 mg of betamethasone at adolescents and adult TE operations can&#xD;
      significantly reduce PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Secondary objective(s) The secondary objective is to verify that 8 mg of betamethasone&#xD;
      in adolescents and adult TE operations reduces postoperative pain but does not increase the&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES 4.1. Overall study design and flow chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in 100 volunteered patients&#xD;
      over 12 years of age selected for elective tonsillectomy at the ENT clinic in Norrbotten.&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criterias will be&#xD;
      included. Enrollment will be continued until the required sample size is achieved (100&#xD;
      subjects). Once informed consent is obtained, screening data will be collected to determine&#xD;
      each subject´s eligibility for study participation. The total expected duration of the&#xD;
      subject participation is maximum 95 days, from screening visit to end of follow-up. The&#xD;
      active participation is 5 days (surgery at visit 2 and phone calls, 1 and 5 days after day of&#xD;
      surgery). The study pharmaceutical (betamethasone) is a well-known substance and has been&#xD;
      used in humans for many years for the same indications as in the present study. Thus it will&#xD;
      be regarded as a phase IV study.&#xD;
