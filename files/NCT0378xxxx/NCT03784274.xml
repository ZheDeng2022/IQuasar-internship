  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, numerous policies have been formulated in the past on pneumonia management&#xD;
      translated into various programs. However, despite completion, the state of pneumonia&#xD;
      mortality remains unchanged as no sustainable solutions have been yielded by these programs.&#xD;
      This is probably because there was no ownership of these policies and programs at the&#xD;
      provincial, district and community level. We, therefore, plan to understand pneumonia related&#xD;
      policy environment within Pakistan to identify gaps in this system through a two phased&#xD;
      study. The first will be qualitative with key informant interviews conducted from relevant&#xD;
      stakeholders, e.g, policy makers, practitioners, academicians, researchers etc., to&#xD;
      understand how policies are conceptualized. Data will be analyzed through an integrated&#xD;
      approach in a software. The second phase will social network research conducted by studying&#xD;
      actors linked together by social relations. This will be achieved through net mapping&#xD;
      exercise to understand, discuss, and visualize how various actors influence pneumonia related&#xD;
      outcomes through technical and financial links. Data will be analyzed through the&#xD;
      Organizational Risk Analyzer (ORA) which is a meta-network assessment and analysis tool. This&#xD;
      study will be the first of its kind for under-five pneumonia and will guide policy makers for&#xD;
      creating effective solutions to combat the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of standard pneumonia management guidelines and multiple global&#xD;
      efforts, pneumonia continues to be the leading killer of children under five, accounting to&#xD;
      around 17% of the total under five deaths globally. It has been estimated that annually there&#xD;
      are around 120 million episodes of pneumonia among children with around 14 million&#xD;
      progressing to severe episodes. Out of these cases, close to 1.3 million children die with&#xD;
      81% of these deaths occurring under 2 years of age. 52% of these deaths occur in the&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan region and South Asia with main contributions from India, Nigeria, Congo,&#xD;
      Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Pakistan, pneumonia contributes to 16% of under-five mortality&#xD;
      in the country with annually around 65,000 children dying due to this disease; a status&#xD;
      unchanged for more than a decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce pneumonia related morbidity and mortality, World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) have developed multiple&#xD;
      action/ intervention plans. This includes initiatives like the Integrated Global Action Plan&#xD;
      for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, Global Strategy for Women's and&#xD;
      Children's Health, Committing to Child Survival, Global Vaccine Action Plan etc. All these&#xD;
      initiatives/interventions focus on a unified goal of &quot;ending preventable deaths&quot;. They bring&#xD;
      together critical interventions to promote practices to save lives of children, to create&#xD;
      healthy environments and to have access to appropriate preventive and treatment measures.&#xD;
      Pakistan, among other countries, has been actively involved in various related forums on&#xD;
      prevention and management of pneumonia. But for best outcomes at national level, such&#xD;
      initiatives need to be supported by appropriate policies/strategies because policies entail&#xD;
      political and strategic support for best management and care. Also needed is engagement by&#xD;
      regional governance structures, including roles such as coordination, funding, and guidelines&#xD;
      for policy development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan has launched multiple national programs in line with these global initiatives at&#xD;
      various periods of time. These programs include the National Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI)&#xD;
      control program which was launched in 1989 with the main objectives of reducing severity and&#xD;
      mortality due to pneumonia and rationalize the use of antimicrobial and other drugs for&#xD;
      treatment of ARI. WHO soon realized that this disease centric narrow approach has not been&#xD;
      able to achieve its desired objectives. Therefore, it developed a more integrated approach&#xD;
      and launched it globally as Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) launched in&#xD;
      Pakistan in 1998. The approach in IMCI focused on improving case management skills of health&#xD;
      workers, strengthening the health system, and addressing family and community practices.&#xD;
      Duplicity was very much evident from the fact that ARI existed as an independent program and&#xD;
      was also part of the IMCI package. Between 2004-2010 The Pakistan Initiative for Mothers and&#xD;
      Newborns (PAIMAN), a United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded&#xD;
      project was undertaken which focused on improving the status of maternal and newborn health&#xD;
      in 24 districts across the four provinces and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in Pakistan. ARI&#xD;
      was an important component in that project. Thereafter, a national Maternal, Neonatal and&#xD;
      Child Health program (MNCH) was launched in 2010 funded mainly by Department for&#xD;
      International Development (DFID) focused on strengthening of management and organization&#xD;
      mechanism of healthcare delivery systems which ended after 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This shows that there has been a constant flow of ARI related program initiation and&#xD;
      termination which could be attributed to the unsteady health policy environment of Pakistan&#xD;
      markedly influenced by the unsteady political environment. Before 2011, the health ministry&#xD;
      at the federal level was responsible for policy development, implementation, monitoring and&#xD;
      surveillance. In June 2011 in wake of the 18th amendment of the national constitution, this&#xD;
      National Health Ministry was devolved. This led to the shift of certain responsibilities from&#xD;
      the federal level to the provinces. As a result, health policy formulation, planning along&#xD;
      with service delivery was devolved to the provinces leading to differences in health outcomes&#xD;
      across the country. Considering the development of all these programs/strategies/policies has&#xD;
      been influenced by various stakeholders including the ministry, academicians, researchers,&#xD;
      physicians, and development partners, it is, therefore, important to understand how different&#xD;
      actors come together and influence policy making and implementation. This could assist in&#xD;
      exploring the existing policy support for reducing pneumonia related morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and thus underpin recommendations for improving the status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and analyse pneumonia related policies/ strategies in Pakistan for children&#xD;
           under five.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify key stakeholders who shape under five pneumonia related policy environment,&#xD;
           through technical and/or financial contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify how under five pneumonia related policies are developed and implemented in&#xD;
           Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify barriers and/or facilitators for under five pneumonia related policy&#xD;
           development and implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive study design will be used for this study which will be conducted through&#xD;
      pneumonia related policy &quot;content analysis&quot; along with net map activities and in depth&#xD;
      interviews to collect both qualitative and quantitative data on the stakeholders involved and&#xD;
      their level of support and influence to the cause (stakeholder analysis). The basic purpose&#xD;
      of coupling policy content analysis with stakeholder analysis is to correlate ground&#xD;
      realities with what has been mentioned in the policies/strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use Walt and Gilson's framework for policy analysis, which focuses on policy content,&#xD;
      actors, context, and process (agenda-setting, policy development, implementation) as&#xD;
      indicated in Figure 1[17-19]. Walt and Gilson developed a policy analysis framework&#xD;
      specifically for health, although its relevance extends beyond this sector. They noted that&#xD;
      health policy research focused largely on the content of policy, neglecting actors, context&#xD;
      and processes. Their policy triangle framework considers how all four of these elements&#xD;
      interact to shape policy-making. The framework has influenced health policy research in a&#xD;
      diverse array of countries, and has been used to analyse a large number of health issues,&#xD;
      including mental health, health sector reform, tuberculosis, reproductive health and&#xD;
      antenatal syphilis control.The aim of this component is to map the pneumonia related policies&#xD;
      and strategies in Pakistan. We will first develop a matrix to guide the data collection&#xD;
      process. This matrix will be developed through a mind mapping exercise to identify relevant&#xD;
      policy document types. These document types could be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Government strategic plans (5-10 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health ministry action plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any national or provincial pneumonia related strategies/guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General program guidelines with pneumonia as a component&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any training guidelines on pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any facility guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any community intervention guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any monitoring guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant documents will then obtained. We plan to source documents from government websites,&#xD;
      government archives, and through requests to Ministry of Health officials (and those from&#xD;
      related Ministries), development partners, and researchers involved in pneumonia related&#xD;
      research in the past. We will acquire policies from the provinces of Punjab, Sindh,&#xD;
      Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtukhuwa (KPK). All the relevant documents will then be explored&#xD;
      for the information as indicated in the matrix. For each policy document, we will note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any mention of pneumonia (as per matrix)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Name of Policy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Year of release&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Released by (e.g. which ministry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Component/section of the document with relevant information&#xD;
&#xD;
      All documents will be copied and retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stakeholder Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase of research, we will identify how pneumonia related policies are&#xD;
      conceptualized, developed, implemented and delivered through a qualitative approach. This&#xD;
      will be accomplished through &quot;grounded theory&quot; by conducting in depth interviews from key&#xD;
      informants. This will be explored through policy makers, program managers, academicians,&#xD;
      researchers and healthcare providers. This means that we will draw on both 'top-down' and&#xD;
      'bottom-up' theories of implementation incorporating the perspectives of both health policy&#xD;
      makers and implementer of the policy. The policy content analysis will also guide the&#xD;
      development of the interview guides. The content of the interviews will be (not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A brief on the roles and responsibilities of the respondents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their knowledge of pneumonia related policy environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How such policies/strategies have been/are developed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What has the respondents' role been in the development and implementation of such&#xD;
           policies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are barriers and facilitators of policy development and implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are the key stakeholders involved in influencing pneumonia related policies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the key recommendations for sustainable implementation of these policies to&#xD;
           reduce pneumonia related morbidity and mortality in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respondents will be those spread across the country and focus will be in post devolution era.&#xD;
      But if highly valuable information is being provided by respondents on the pre devolution era&#xD;
      then that will also be noted. This will help in assessing difference among provinces as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Net Mapping Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the Net-Map method developed by International Food Policy and Research Institute&#xD;
      (IFPRI) to map and analyze information regarding stakeholder influence. Net mapping is a part&#xD;
      of social network research. We shall be using this technique also based on prior experience&#xD;
      in health policy research. A social network is a group of actors that are linked together by&#xD;
      a set of social relations. These relations describe the ties of a specific kind among the&#xD;
      actors of the network. The key principles within social research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) actors and their actions in a social network viewed as interdependent rather than&#xD;
      independent, autonomous units; and (ii) relational ties between actors as channels for&#xD;
      transfer of resources (either material or non-material. The location of an actor inside a&#xD;
      social network can be an indicator of the strength of ties associated with that actor.&#xD;
      Moreover, net mapping provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of network relations&#xD;
      among actors within that network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These activities will be group based interviews whereby upon identification of key&#xD;
      stakeholder/ groups through the qualitative approach, relevant stakeholders will be recruited&#xD;
      upon taking consent and these group activities will be conducted in each province. A net map&#xD;
      interview guide will be developed focusing on the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are the influential stakeholders who provide technical contributions in pneumonia&#xD;
           related policy environment in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are the influential stakeholders who provide financial contributions in pneumonia&#xD;
           related policy environment in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is their level of influence in pneumonia related policy environment in Pakistan&#xD;
           where influence is referred to as formal supervision, funding, technical information,&#xD;
           advice, advocacy and pressure, but might go beyond the links mentioned above, e.g.&#xD;
           Influence because one is respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is their level of support in pneumonia related policy environment in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group activity will start by listing down the names of relevant stakeholders, referred&#xD;
      to as actors, who provide technical and/or financial support for pneumonia related policy&#xD;
      environment in Pakistan. For drawing maps, we will first consider Technical support which is&#xD;
      defined as formal exchange of technical support (training, technical guides, equipment,&#xD;
      staff/consultant (pres elected), information, research evidence, routine data, and field&#xD;
      experience/case studies). This will be followed by Funding support which is defined as&#xD;
      exchange of funds or in-kind support (this could be funding or supplies for programs or staff&#xD;
      employed by the recipient, or budget provision). For both kind of supports we will ask first&#xD;
      about the technical support that the actor receives, then who the actor provides it to (&quot;from&#xD;
      whom?&quot;, then &quot;to whom?&quot;). Arrows will be drawn between actors and their support links whereby&#xD;
      a different color will be used for technical and financial links. After drawing the links,&#xD;
      level of influence will be identified against each actor which could be high or low indicated&#xD;
      as positive or negative. This will be followed by identifying the level of support which&#xD;
      every actor has on the cause. The rate used is supportive, not supportive and neutral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Analysis Approach. The steps involved in synthesis will include development of a&#xD;
      theoretical model revolving around pneumonia related policy environment, preliminary&#xD;
      synthesis using the matrix, and exploring associations in the data. This approach will enable&#xD;
      us to consider specific policy content within the broader policy context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In depth interviews will be analysed through development of themes and sub themes which will&#xD;
      be drawn from the framework used in content analysis with particular emphasis on the type of&#xD;
      actors and their role in the process, the structure and content of the policies and&#xD;
      experiences of implementation and suggestions of those in the system. Qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative data of the net map activities will be triangulated. The quantitative data will&#xD;
      be analysed using ORA (Organizational Risk Analyzer), specialized software meant for analysis&#xD;
      of net map data.&#xD;
