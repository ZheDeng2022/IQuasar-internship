      This study will test the efficacy and safety of application of LED light to meibomian glands&#xD;
      in upper and lower eyelids in eyes of patients suffering with meibomian gland disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of blue LED&#xD;
      light with meibomian gland expression of the upper and lower eyelids in dry eye disease by&#xD;
      change from baseline in subjective questionnaire and by measurement of non-invasive tear&#xD;
      break up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Improvement of tear break up time over the length of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: subjective patient comfort over the length of the study using a validated&#xD;
      dry eye comfort questionnaire administered at each study visit, VAS, 0= no pain and 100 =&#xD;
      maximal discomfort, Improvement in the number of corneal SPK that stain with fluorescein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 study subjects 18-85 will be enrolled with male or female in the Nashville and Memphis, TN&#xD;
      areas who are generally healthy but have signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with Meibomian&#xD;
      gland dysfunction.&#xD;
