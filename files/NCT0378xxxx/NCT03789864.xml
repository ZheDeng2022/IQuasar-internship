    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study designed to find out if the laser&#xD;
      light-based imaging test called Biodynamic imaging (BDI) can correctly predict the cutaneous&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma mycosis fungoides (MF) cancer response to chemotherapy treatment. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to develop phenotypic profiles of response and non-response to gemcitabine,&#xD;
      given at a standard-of-care dose and schedule. A secondary objective is to perform a&#xD;
      cross-species analysis of phenotypic responses of human and canine mycosis fungoides to&#xD;
      gemcitabine using biodynamic imaging. The study will seek to enroll 10 patients with MF who&#xD;
      are planning to receive treatment with gemcitabine given at a standard-of-care (SOC) dose and&#xD;
      schedule at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC). All subjects will undergo&#xD;
      standardized staging tests, with tumor stage defined according to established guidelines. For&#xD;
      the study, three 6-mm x 4-mm dermal punch biopsies from one or more target lesions will be&#xD;
      collected prior to treatment initiation and sent to Purdue University researchers for BDI.&#xD;
      Objective response for tumor samples treated with gemcitabine in the laboratory will be&#xD;
      assessed. Patients with an objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response&#xD;
      (PR) that persists during the first 2 treatment cycles will be considered to have responsive&#xD;
      cancers, while those failing to meet these criteria will be considered to have resistant&#xD;
      cancers. All patients will be considered off-study after completing cycle 2. Accrual is&#xD;
      expected to last approximately 24 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the laser light-based imaging test called&#xD;
      Biodynamic imaging (BDI) can correctly predict the response of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      mycosis fungoides cancer to gemcitabine chemotherapy treatment. No untested medications or&#xD;
      devices will be used in this study. Subject's response to chemotherapy will be measured after&#xD;
      the first and second months (cycles) of chemotherapy; therefore, the BDI test cannot be used&#xD;
      to predict whether subject will respond to the treatment or not in advance, and treatment&#xD;
      decisions will not be made using any of the information obtained through this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of routine treatment for mycosis fungoides, subjects who are being referred for&#xD;
      routine treatment with gemcitabine chemotherapy given at a standard-of-care (SOC) dose and&#xD;
      schedule at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Standard-of-care Gemcitabine is given intravenously (i.e. in the vein as in infusion) 3 times&#xD;
      every 28 days on days 1, 8, and 15. Each 28 day period is called a cycle. Gemcitabine&#xD;
      infusion generally lasts 30 minutes. If subject agrees to participate in this study,&#xD;
      researchers would document representative skin lesions by color photography including a ruler&#xD;
      to estimate the size of the lesion, and objectively calculate disease burden by using the&#xD;
      modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). Researchers would also collect samples of&#xD;
      your tumor tissue before subject starts chemotherapy to be used for the BDI testing in the&#xD;
      laboratory by the Purdue University collaborative research team. The BDI testing will be done&#xD;
      at baseline on day of collection. We would also evaluate subject's response to treatment&#xD;
      after the 1st and 2nd cycles completion through PET/CT or CT scans, skin examinations, and/or&#xD;
      laboratory tests depending upon subject's disease. The following is a list of what subjects&#xD;
      can expect at each of their study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment: Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject Consenting - approximately 30 - 40 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect Demographic information, Medical History - approximately 5- 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical Exam/performance status: A physical exam will be performed by the doctor, and&#xD;
           the doctor will document subjects' overall health and how well subjects are able to&#xD;
           perform their activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Skin biopsy: One or more areas of subject's skin that has the cancer will be cleansed&#xD;
           with alcohol. The areas will be numbed by injecting a small amount of anesthesia in the&#xD;
           skin. As part of routine biopsy procedures in the Department of Dermatology, photographs&#xD;
           may be taken of the lesions/tumors that will be biopsied. When the areas of the skin are&#xD;
           numb, 3 samples of your skin about 4-mm deep (6-mm wide skin punch biopsies), will be&#xD;
           removed from one or more sites and sent for BDI testing. A small stitch will be placed&#xD;
           in each biopsy site. Subjects will be given sterile wound dressings and wound care&#xD;
           instructions including samples of petrolatum to allow subject to take care of the small&#xD;
           wounds. The stitches from the biopsy sites will be removed 10-14 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Skin disease severity scoring: In order to determine the extent of subject's disease,&#xD;
           the physician will physically examine subject's skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laboratory tests: These tests are used to determine subject's fitness to undergo&#xD;
           treatment with gemcitabine and to determine extent of disease. These tests are&#xD;
           comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and peripheral blood&#xD;
           flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scans: Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or CT scans of&#xD;
           subject's neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be done to determine extent of your&#xD;
           disease. A PET/CT scan from subject's skull to the base of subject's thighs may be done&#xD;
           depending upon subject's disease at the recommendation of subject's doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these tests are done routinely in patients with the same disease being referred for&#xD;
      treatment with gemcitabine with the exception of skin biopsy and, if needed, flow cytometry&#xD;
      and radiological scans after the first round of chemotherapy, which are being done for&#xD;
      research purposes. Treatment End of Cycle 1/Before Cycle 2 (Approximately day 28 depending&#xD;
      upon whether subjects have any delays in treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical exam: A routine physical exam will be performed by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin disease severity scoring: The physician will physically examine subject's skin to&#xD;
           determine subject's response to chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count (CBC)&#xD;
           blood tests will be done as is routine for patients undergoing gemcitabine treatment;&#xD;
           however, peripheral blood flow cytometry may also be done depending upon the&#xD;
           researcher's assessment of subject's disease to determine subject's response to&#xD;
           chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CT scan: A CT scan may also be done depending upon the researcher's assessment of&#xD;
           subject's disease to determine subject's response to chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Cycle 2/Before Cycle 3 (Approximately day 56 depending upon whether subject have any&#xD;
      delays in treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical exam: A routine physical exam will be performed by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin disease severity scoring: The physician will physically examine subject's skin to&#xD;
           determine subject's response to chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory tests: Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count (CBC)&#xD;
           blood tests will be done as is routine for patients undergoing gemcitabine treatment;&#xD;
           however, peripheral blood flow cytometry may also be done depending upon the&#xD;
           researcher's assessment of subject's disease to determine subject's response to&#xD;
           chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CT scan: A CT scan may also be done depending upon the researcher's assessment of&#xD;
           subject's disease to determine subject's response to chemotherapy at this time point.&#xD;
