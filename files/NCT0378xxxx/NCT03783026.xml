  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      apremilast, either in monotherapy or with stable Methotrexate (MTX), on Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) outcomes in subjects with active PsA with up to 5 years of disease duration&#xD;
      (since diagnosis).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 120 subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg BID, after a 5-day titration period,&#xD;
      with or without MTX. All subjects will be permitted to take NSAIDs and/or low-dose oral&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or equivalent) throughout the study. The NSAIDs and&#xD;
      low-dose oral glucocorticoids must be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
      baseline. MTX (≤ 25 mg/week) will be permitted if treatment duration is ≥ 6 months and on a&#xD;
      stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to baseline. In addition, Nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), and low-dose glucocorticoids must be continued from Day 1&#xD;
      through the Week 24 Visit. Change in doses, increase or decrease, and/or discontinuation will&#xD;
      not be allowed, except for safety reasons or for lack of availability. After the Week 24&#xD;
      Visit, the doses of MTX, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids may be adjusted as clinically required.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Must not have been treated with more than 2 csDMARDs&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects taking csDMARDs, with the exception of MTX, cyclosporine, or LEF, do not&#xD;

         11. Subjects who have been previously treated with MTX for &lt; 6 months and who are not on&#xD;
             stable doses for at least 3 months will require a 28-day washout prior to the Baseline&#xD;
             Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1) to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects who have been previously treated with LEF will require a 12-week washout&#xD;
             prior to the Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1), or treatment with cholestyramine,&#xD;
             per LEF prescribing label (ie, 8 g cholestyramine 3 times daily for 11 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have been previously treated with cyclosporine will require a 28-day&#xD;
             washout prior to the Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1) to participate in the study&#xD;

         14. If taking MTX (≤ 25 mg/week), continuity of treatment will be allowed if duration of&#xD;
             treatment is ≥ 6 months and on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to the&#xD;
             Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. If taking oral glucocorticoids, must be on a stable dose of prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or&#xD;
             equivalent for at least 4 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. If taking NSAIDs or narcotic analgesics, must be on stable dose for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and baseline. While on IP and for at least 28 days after taking the last&#xD;
             dose of IP, a FCBP who engages in activity in which conception is possible must use&#xD;
             one of the approved contraceptive§ options described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception&#xD;
             (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device;&#xD;
             tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex&#xD;
             condom or non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example,&#xD;
             polyurethane]); PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b)&#xD;
             cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             † An FCBP is defined as a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the&#xD;
             surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24&#xD;
             consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24&#xD;
             consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the&#xD;
             female subject is screened into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should&#xD;
             be initiated at least 28 days before screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Must be in general good health (except for PsA) as judged by the investigator, based&#xD;
             on medical history, physical examination, and clinical laboratories. (Note: The&#xD;
             definition of good health means a subject does not have uncontrolled significant&#xD;
             comorbid conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindication to MRI examination including, but not limited to, intracranial metal&#xD;
             clips, heart pacemakers, insulin pumps, implanted hearing aids, neurostimulators,&#xD;
             metal hip replacements, profound claustrophobia or inability to lie in the MRI machine&#xD;
             in an appropriate position to obtain quality images, history of hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             gadolinium contrast agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL per minute estimated&#xD;
             by the Cockroft-Gault equation), which would prevent the use of gadolinium enhancement&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,&#xD;
             endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic,&#xD;
             immunologic disease, or other major uncontrolled disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the&#xD;

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
