      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore families' representations and strategies about their teenagers or&#xD;
      young adults involved in the radicalisation process and use these findings to build specific&#xD;
      tools to help professionals provide family support.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With repeated attacks, literature about radicalization is growing up. But only few have&#xD;
      families as concern, whereas during adolescent process, the place of family remains central.&#xD;
      Moreover, professionals of health care and social work lack of understanding and specific&#xD;
      tools so as to support families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 11th of September, 2001, literature research about terrorism increased by 300%.&#xD;
      Many aspects have been investigated. A recent sytematic review studied the early process,&#xD;
      pathway and determinant of radicalization and extremism among muslim society. Many themes are&#xD;
      described by studies : role of identity, social drivers, individual factors health and&#xD;
      personality, precipitating factors, personal experiences, media and government influence,&#xD;
      grievances, perpetuating factors, in-group qualities, methods of persuasion. But none of the&#xD;
      studies focus on families of radicalized people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent review explores the radicalization's motivation and links with&#xD;
      psychopathology. None study speaks about families; neither to support nor to prevent from&#xD;
      radicalisation. In contrast, if families are missing in the study of radicalisation process&#xD;
      they appear in &quot;deradicalization process&quot;: for self-preservation aim; for grant of pardon and&#xD;
      sign of strong attachment; as way to restor self-preoccupation, opposed to radicalization&#xD;
      preoccupation. It conclude with importance of social connection to support out of radicalism&#xD;
      process in which family and closed community are central and first mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, family is often at the forefront to realize first breakdowns with currently&#xD;
      environment, changes, new friendship and group affiliations. Knowing family sociocultural&#xD;
      references of the radicalized people by inside, their views and explanation are very&#xD;
      precious; especially when there is subculture or migration history, where parentality, for&#xD;
      example isn't thought with the same way according to different origin culture. Moreover in&#xD;
      French context, most of the radicalized people are young people: from 15 to 30 years old,&#xD;
      with two third between 15 and 21 years old. And during all adolescent process, family role&#xD;
      remain central to reach adulthood with inside security enough, supporting&#xD;
      autonomisation-separation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among heterogeneity of adolescent and timing process, scientific literature agree that&#xD;
      adolescence can happen between 10 and 25 years old. Thus in this period, radicalisation&#xD;
      process and recovery can't be understood without view of close entourage (and especially&#xD;
      parents or attachment figures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found only found a very few studies on families of radicalized people, that don't totally&#xD;
      cover the field we will explore, and with no qualitative guidelines criteria reported (COREQ&#xD;
      32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Analysis This study aims to explore families' representations and strategies&#xD;
      about their teenagers or young adults involved in the radicalisation process and use these&#xD;
      findings to build specific tools to help professionals provide family support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study supplemented by quantitative data. A sample of representative&#xD;
      French families (parents, siblings, and persons identified as attachment figures) of&#xD;
      adolescents or young adults (12-25 years old) involved in the radicalisation process will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in semi-structured interviews or focus groups to explore their&#xD;
      representations and strategies about radicalisation. It will be supplemented by genogram draw&#xD;
      and sociodemographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be coded and analysed in accordance with the principles of interpretative&#xD;
      phenomenological analysis (IPA), with Nvivo software, and then discussed with the entire&#xD;
      research group. At the end, feedback from participants will be sought to ensure the validity&#xD;
      of results and obtain their opinion about whether their meanings and perspectives are&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study and the report will follow the COREQ recommendations. After the data are collected&#xD;
      and analysed, the tools will be built and tested, before dissemination.&#xD;
