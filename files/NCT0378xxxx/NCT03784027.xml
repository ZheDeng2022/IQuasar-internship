    <textblock>
      The suggested clinical trial is part of the KidsAP project funded by the European&#xD;
      Commission's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme with additional funding by JDRF. The project&#xD;
      evaluates the use of the Artificial Pancreas (or closed loop system) in very young children&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 1 to 7 years. The suggested trial is an outcome study to&#xD;
      determine whether 24/7 automated closed loop glucose control will improve glucose control as&#xD;
      measured by time in range compared to sensor augmented pump therapy. In the extension phase,&#xD;
      the purpose is to evaluate the effect of long-term home use of 24/7 automated hybrid closed&#xD;
      loop insulin delivery on glucose control (UK sites only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts an open-label, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, two period,&#xD;
      cross-over design study, comparing two 16-week periods during which glucose levels will be&#xD;
      controlled either by a closed loop system (intervention period) or by sensor augmented pump&#xD;
      therapy (control period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a 2 to 4 week run-in period, followed by two treatment periods&#xD;
      that will last 16 weeks each, with a 1 to 4 week washout period in between. The order of the&#xD;
      two treatments will be random. A total of up to 80 young children aged 1 to 7 years with T1D&#xD;
      on insulin pump therapy (aiming for 72 randomised subjects) will be recruited through&#xD;
      paediatric outpatient diabetes clinics of the investigation centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the use of study devices, participants and parents/guardians will receive&#xD;
      appropriate training by the research team on the safe use of the study pump and continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring device, and the hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system. Carers at&#xD;
      nursery or school may also receive training by the study team if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the closed loop study arm, subjects and parents/guardians will use the closed loop&#xD;
      system for 16 weeks under free-living conditions in their home and nursery/school environment&#xD;
      without remote monitoring or supervision by research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the control study arm, subjects and parents/guardians will use sensor augmented pump&#xD;
      therapy for 16 weeks under free-living conditions in their home and nursery/school&#xD;
      environment. All subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study&#xD;
      phase including 24/7 telephone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is time spent in target range, between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/l as recorded&#xD;
      by CGM. Secondary outcomes are the time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as&#xD;
      recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics. Safety evaluation comprises assessment of the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the extension phase, participants will have follow-up contacts every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is time spent in target range, between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/l as recorded&#xD;
      by CGM, over 18 months from the end of the primary phase, as compared to sensor augmented&#xD;
      pump therapy during the primary phase. Secondary outcomes as well as safety and utility will&#xD;
      be assessed as per primary phase.&#xD;

      Purpose of clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether 24/7 automated hybrid closed loop will improve glucose control as&#xD;
      measured by time within the target range compared with sensor augmented pump therapy in very&#xD;
      young children with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and utility of automated hybrid&#xD;
      closed loop glucose control in very young children with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess the ability of a hybrid closed loop system to&#xD;
           maintain CGM glucose levels within the target range of 3.9 to 10 mmol/l (70 to 180&#xD;
           mg/dl) in comparison with sensor augmented pump therapy in very young children with type&#xD;
           1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of closed loop glucose control compared&#xD;
           with sensor augmented pump therapy in terms of episodes and severity of hypoglycaemia,&#xD;
           frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and nature and severity of other adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the acceptability and duration of use of the&#xD;
           closed loop system in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HUMAN FACTORS: The objective is to assess emotional and behavioural characteristics of&#xD;
           participants and parents/guardians and their response to the closed loop system and&#xD;
           clinical trial using validated surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. HEALTH ECONOMICS: The objective is to perform a cost utility analysis to inform&#xD;

      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 participants randomised (8-12 participants per centre). At the primary phase final visit,&#xD;
      participants (UK sites only) on sensor-augmented pump therapy as their standard clinical care&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in an extension phase of closed loop therapy for a further 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum duration of study for a subject: 11 months (primary phase). 29 months for&#xD;
      participants (UK sites only) opting to participate in 18-month extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited through paediatric diabetes outpatient clinics at&#xD;
      participating clinical centres (see above). Enrolment will target up to 80 (aiming for 8-12&#xD;
      participants per centre) to allow for dropouts during run-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (UK sites only) completing the primary phase, who are on sensor-augmented pump&#xD;
      therapy as their standard clinical care, will be invited to participate in the extension&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all parents/guardians and written assent from&#xD;
      older children before any study related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional written consent will be obtained for the extension phase from all&#xD;
      parents/guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a baseline assessment including a blood sample for the&#xD;
      measurement of HbA1c. Questionnaires will be completed by parents/guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Study Training and Run-in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions on the use of the study CGM and insulin pump will be provided by the&#xD;
      research team. During a 2-4 week run-in period, subjects will use study CGM and insulin pump.&#xD;
      For compliance and to assess the ability of the subject to use the study devices safely, at&#xD;
      least 8 days of CGM data need to be recorded and safe use of study insulin pump demonstrated&#xD;
      during the last 14 days of run-in period. The CGM data will also be used to assess baseline&#xD;
      glucose control and may be used for treatment optimization as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency on the use of study insulin pump and study CGM will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      competency assessment tool developed by the research team. Training may be repeated if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomised using randomisation software to the initial use of&#xD;
      automated hybrid closed loop glucose system or to sensor augmented pump therapy for 16 weeks&#xD;
      with a 1 to 4 week washout period before crossing over to the other study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated day and night closed loop insulin delivery (intervention arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the closed loop arm and their caregivers will receive an additional training&#xD;
      session covering the use of the closed loop system provided by the research team prior to&#xD;
      starting closed loop insulin delivery. During this 1-2 hour session, parents/guardians will&#xD;
      operate the system under the supervision of the clinical research team. Competency on the use&#xD;
      of closed loop system will be evaluated. Thereafter, subjects and their parents/guardians&#xD;
      will use the hybrid closed loop system for 16 weeks at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first study arm, a blood sample for the measurement of HbA1c will be taken&#xD;
      and weight and height will be measured. Validated surveys evaluating the impact of the&#xD;
      devices employed on quality of life, psychosocial function, diabetes management and treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will be invited to be interviewed to gather feedback on and reactions to&#xD;
      their current treatment, the clinical trial, and quality of life changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor augmented pump therapy (control arm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the sensor augmented pump therapy arm and their caregivers will receive&#xD;
      refresher training on key aspects of insulin pump therapy and CGM use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and their parents/guardians will continue using sensor augmented pump therapy for 16&#xD;
      weeks at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted 24h after starting each study arm to ensure there are no&#xD;
      concerns regarding the study devices. In between study visits, participants will be contacted&#xD;
      by the study team (email/phone) once monthly and 3-monthly in the extension phase, in order&#xD;
      to record any adverse events, device deficiencies, and changes in insulin settings, other&#xD;
      medical conditions and/or medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of any problems related to the technical device or diabetes management such as hypo-&#xD;
      or hyperglycaemia, subjects will be able to contact a 24-hour telephone helpline to the local&#xD;
      research team at any time. The local research team will have access to central 24 hour advice&#xD;
      on technical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study assessments (primary phase):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c at the end of the study. Height and&#xD;
      weight will be recorded. Study devices will be downloaded and returned. Participants will&#xD;
      resume usual care using their pre-study insulin pump. Validated surveys evaluating the impact&#xD;
      of the devices employed on quality of life, psychosocial function and diabetes management and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will be invited to participate in a sleep sub-study prior to the final&#xD;
      visit (UK &amp; Luxembourg only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians will be invited to be interviewed to gather feedback on and reactions to&#xD;
      their current treatment, the clinical trial, and quality of life changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase (UK sites only):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up contacts will be conducted 3-monthly, in line with routine clinic visits, including&#xD;
      recording of adverse events, medical history, insulin requirements and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 18 months from the end of the primary phase, parents/guardians will complete validated&#xD;
      questionnaires evaluating the impact of the technology on quality of life, diabetes&#xD;
      management, sleep quality and fear of hypoglycaemia. Height and weight will be measured. A&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c at the end of the extension phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events will be in&#xD;
      place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and&#xD;
      specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events and&#xD;
      any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and will review&#xD;
      compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal of subjects on safety grounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject/guardian may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily&#xD;
      giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the&#xD;
      participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision by the investigator, or the sponsor, that termination is in the subject's best&#xD;
           medical interest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reaction to insulin&#xD;
