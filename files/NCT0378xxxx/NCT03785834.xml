  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators wish to study the value of dermatologic testing assessments in&#xD;
      differentiating between cellulitis and pseudocellulitis in the inpatient setting. The&#xD;
      Investigators propose that by utilizing cutaneous biopsies and tissue cultures in patients&#xD;
      that have been admitted to inpatient internal medicine teams, the investigators may be able&#xD;
      to improve multiple measures of hospital efficiency in patients presenting with&#xD;
      cellulitis-like symptoms, by more accurately recognizing cellulitis from pseudocellulitis.&#xD;
      The patient will undergo encrypted digital imaging for his or her condition. This image will&#xD;
      then be sent to the study investigators, along with basic clinical information on the skin&#xD;
      evaluation form. The study investigators will develop a differential diagnosis and then the&#xD;
      patient will undergo a skin biopsy. The patient will then be randomized to one of two arms&#xD;
      using a random number generator: A) Skin biopsies and tissue cultures recorded and published&#xD;
      in patient's medical chart as they would be in a standard of care procedure B) Skin biopsies&#xD;
      and tissue cultures consultation performed but not published in the patient's medical chart&#xD;
      unless medically necessary. Information will be collected from medical records in IHIS.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone 30 days after discharge.&#xD;

    <measure>The feasibility of conducting a larger study will be conducted, by establishing patient enrollment rates</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion, around 2 years after study start</time_frame>
    <description>According to the NIH: The goal of pilot work is not to test hypotheses about the effects of an intervention, but rather, to assess the feasibility/acceptability of an approach to be used in a larger scale study. We will use descriptive statistics to monitor patient enrollment and pilot data on additional secondary outcomes for inferential statistics.</description>

    <description>Cellulitis is a common type of bacterial skin infection. Pseudocellulitis is a skin infection that is very similar to cellulitis and is often misdiagnosed as cellulitis</description>
