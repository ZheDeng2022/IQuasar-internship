  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a traditional Chinese medicine compound, SaiLuoTong capsule is proven to have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on learning and memory ability in animal models of vascular dementia (VaD). According&#xD;
      to the result of the phase II study, the efficacy of SaiLuoTong capsule in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with VaD was better than that of placebo group and no difference in safety. So the&#xD;
      study hypothesis is also that SaiLuoTong capsule will be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with VaD and will be well tolerated. The purpose of the study is to confirm the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of SaiLuoTong capsule on patients with mild to moderate VaD. The outcome&#xD;
      measures include general cognitive function, executive function, daily living skills, and&#xD;
      mental behavior changes of symptoms in VaD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular dementia (VaD) is a clinical syndrome of acquired intellectual and functional&#xD;
      impairment that results from cerebrovascular diseases. SaiLuoTong capsule is a traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine compound; it is composed of ginseng extract (the main composition: ginseng&#xD;
      total saponins), ginkgo biloba extract (the main composition: YinXingTong ester) and&#xD;
      safflower extract (the main composition: the west safflower total glycosides). The function&#xD;
      of SaiLuoTong capsule is Yiqi Huoxue and Huayu Tongluo in Chinese traditional medicine&#xD;
      theory. Pharmacodynamics studies showed that SaiLuoTong capsule can significantly improve&#xD;
      neurological symptoms caused by focal cerebral ischemia in animals, and learning and memory&#xD;
      ability in animal models of VaD. The result of the phase II study showed that the efficacy of&#xD;
      SaiLuoTong capsule in the treatment of patients with VaD was better than that of placebo&#xD;
      group and no difference in safety. Based on these previous evidences, the investigators&#xD;
      conduct this study to further confirm the efficacy and safety of SaiLuoTong capsule in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate VaD. This study is a phase III clinical trial of SaiLuoTong&#xD;
      capsule for treatment of vascular dementia. The study is a 52-week, multicentre, randomized,&#xD;
      double -blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;

    <description>The VaDAS-cog comprises the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale(ADAS-cog) plus the Maze and Number Cancellation test to specifically assess executive function. The score of each item is summed to compute a total score. The range of the total score was from 0(no cognitive impairment) to 90(severe cognitive impairment). The data in the table below is the statistical data (mean,SD) of precise scores at screening and week 0 (baseline), while the statistical data of difference value compared to the score of Baseline at weeks 52.</description>

    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-clinical Global Impression of Change(ADCS-CGIC) involves comparison of data acquisition from both home and clinic and the use of both informant-ratings and self-ratings. Important outcomes include clinical global impressions of change (CGIC) as indicators of clinically meaningful change. In week 0 (baseline), the score was to judge the severity of the cognitive, 0(no evaluate),1(normal),2(slight intelligence obstacle),3(mide intelligence obstacle),4(moderate intelligence obstacle),5(significantly intelligence obstacle),6(severe intelligence obstacle),7(intelligent obstacle end-stage). In week 13,26,39,52, the score was to judge the change of the clinical global impression,1(improved significantly),2(improve),3(improve a little),4(no change),5(a little deteriorated),6(deteriorated),7(serious deterioration).</description>
