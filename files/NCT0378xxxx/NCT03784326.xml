    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well atezolizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      fluorouracil works in treating patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and fluorouracil, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, oxaliplatin, and&#xD;
      fluorouracil may work better in treating patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Atezolizumab in combination with oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (5-FU) (modified&#xD;
      fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin [FOLFOX]) therapy in the neoadjuvant setting will&#xD;
      achieve a pathological complete response of approximately 20% in patients with localized&#xD;
      esophageal and gastroesophageal (gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]) adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and toxicity profile of intravenous atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and 5-FU therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the efficacy of the combination by tumor regression grade scoring in the&#xD;
      surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the overall safety and tolerability of adjuvant atezolizumab in subjects with&#xD;
      resected esophageal and GEJ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). V. To explore changes&#xD;
      in tumor stroma profile before and after immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously&#xD;
      over 48 hours, and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Within 4-6 weeks of treatment completion, patients undergo surgical resection. Beginning 6&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, patients continue to receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil&#xD;
      IV continuously over 48 hours, and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive atezolizumab monotherapy IV over 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
