  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a lifelong condition which causes the lungs and digestive system to&#xD;
      become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. This leads to recurrent chest infections and reduced&#xD;
      nutrient absorption from food. The average age at death is 31 years, usually from respiratory&#xD;
      failure. The nutritional status of people with CF (PWCF) is important to help them live&#xD;
      healthier and longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recommended that adults with CF achieve a BMI of 23 for males and 22 for females.&#xD;
      However, fewer than 50% of adults with CF achieved that target BMI despite effective&#xD;
      nutritional support to help weight gain. There is a clear need for a behavioural intervention&#xD;
      that can help PWCF use the available nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to try out a multi-component behavioural intervention supported&#xD;
      by a nutrition app. The intervention is designed to help PWCF use their nutritional support&#xD;
      to gain weight. It will focus on testing the methods and procedures to be used on a larger&#xD;
      scale, improving the behavioural intervention and estimating how many people are needed for&#xD;
      the larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be invited to participate, and the investigators anticipate recruiting&#xD;
      6 participants. The participants will have 6 weeks of intensive intervention, which will&#xD;
      include a mix of clinic visits, home visits and telephone calls followed by 6 weeks of&#xD;
      maintenance phase. Data will be collected during clinic visits at baseline, week 6 and week&#xD;
      12 along with weight monitoring at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will interview each participant at the end of the study period to improve&#xD;
      the intervention and study processes based on participant feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesised that using a nutrition app, along with regular input from a&#xD;
      dietitian, will help PWCF to use the available nutritional support.&#xD;
