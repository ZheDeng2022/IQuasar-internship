  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer and a leading cause of death among&#xD;
      HIV-infected women living in resource-limited settings. Although screening for premalignant&#xD;
      lesions is an effective way of reducing cervical cancer incidence, its uptake in low-resource&#xD;
      settings to date is low. The use of HPV testing for primary screening is currently&#xD;
      recommended by many guidelines - including the WHO guidelines for cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      in resource-limited settings - because of its greater sensitivity and ease of use compared to&#xD;
      other options. However, these WHO guidelines have both highlighted the need to conduct more&#xD;
      research on appropriate HPV-based algorithms among HIV-infected women, as immunodeficiency&#xD;
      may affect the screening performance. Indeed, HPV infections in HIV-infected women are very&#xD;
      common, so there is a need for additional triage to identify women most at risk and there&#xD;
      remains considerable uncertainty on the optimal option for such triage. Most of the evidence&#xD;
      available comes from HIV-negative populations living in high-resource settings and is not&#xD;
      necessarily relevant for low-resource contexts where the epidemiological background is&#xD;
      different, women access late to screening and may not have follow up visits, where financial&#xD;
      constraints are important and health service resources limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the proposed project aims to provide evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of&#xD;
      HPV-based screening algorithms among HIV-infected women in low-resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter cross-sectional study will include 3,000 HIV-infected women (30-49 years&#xD;
      old) receiving HAART and followed in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and&#xD;
      Phnom Penh (Cambodia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After self-collection of cervico-vaginal samples, each participant will have an HPV test with&#xD;
      partial genotyping primary using the Xpert HPV assay, a real-time PCR assay that provides the&#xD;
      possibility of identifying 14 HR-HPV types within one hour. The Xpert HPV test has been&#xD;
      chosen because of the wide availability of the Genexpert platform in HIV care centers from&#xD;
      resource-limited settings. Furthermore, it can specifically detect HPV-16, 18 and 45, the&#xD;
      most carcinogenic HPV types in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive women, separately from&#xD;
      other high-risk HPV types. VIA will be another triage option either alone or combined to HPV&#xD;
      DNA genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants treated for cervical lesion will be followed over 12 months to&#xD;
      assess the risk of post-treatment lesions (CIN2+/HSIL) and to identify associated&#xD;
      risk-factors.&#xD;
