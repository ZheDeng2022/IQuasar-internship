      The objectives of this phase 2 study are to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of AD07030, a trivalent influenza virus antigens vaccine, given intranasally in 2 doses in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 prospective, randomized controlled, double-blind, multi-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of AD07030, a trivalent influenza virus&#xD;
      antigens vaccine, given intranasally in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 358 healthy subjects, meeting all the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study and randomized into 3 study groups (in 2:2:1 ratio) to receive either the study vaccine&#xD;
      at one of the dose levels of adjuvant AD07010 (30μg or 45μg LTh(αK)) in combination with&#xD;
      hemagglutinin (HA) antigens or to receive control vaccine consisting of HA antigens alone.&#xD;
      The 3 study groups are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 22.5μg HA with 30μg AD07010&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 22.5μg HA with 45μg AD07010&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: 22.5μg HA alone Each subject will receive intranasal administration of 2 doses&#xD;
           of IP (study or control vaccine) at same dosages, given 7 days apart on study Day 1 and&#xD;
           Day 8. Solicited local and general AEs will be recorded after each vaccination in the&#xD;
           subject's diary card for up to 7 days (the vaccine administration day and 6 days&#xD;
           following it). Subjects will be followed up for monitoring of safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
           for 180 days. AE and SAE and concomitant medication/vaccination will be collected&#xD;
           throughout the study. There will be total of 6 study visits and a telephone call.&#xD;
