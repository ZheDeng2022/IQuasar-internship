  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will determine the association between d,l-methylphenidate (MPH) therapeutic&#xD;
      outcomes in ADHD patients and genetic variants of CES1 and reveal key associations between&#xD;
      CES1 genotypes and the PK and PD of MPH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychostimulants are the first-line pharmacotherapy for Attention deficit-hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD), and MPH accounts for approximately 50% of all stimulant usage. There has&#xD;
      been an ~10-fold increase in MPH prescribing since 1990, with 18 million prescriptions&#xD;
      dispensed in 2010, including 1.9 million new starts on MPH, making it the 5th most commonly&#xD;
      prescribed medication to children ages 2 -11 and the single most frequently prescribed&#xD;
      medication of any type in those aged 12-17 years. The annual exposure of pediatric patients&#xD;
      to MPH is extremely high and MPH is among the most commonly prescribed chronic use oral&#xD;
      medications for US children. Despite nearly 60 years of accrued clinical experience with MPH,&#xD;
      the significant inter-individual variability in MPH pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) and adverse effects is inadequately explained and unpredictable. Up to 35% of ADHD&#xD;
      patients do not respond satisfactorily to MPH therapy, and an even larger percentage&#xD;
      discontinues treatment despite persistent ADHD. During clinical trials of MPH in&#xD;
      treatment-na√Øve patients, a significant number suffer from adverse effects that are severe&#xD;
      and persistent enough to require dose decreases or even study withdrawal. Moreover, some&#xD;
      severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) - including sudden cardiac death - have been associated&#xD;
      with MPH, although the precise reasons for these associations remain elusive and&#xD;
      controversial. Research efforts have been made to identify genetic biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      MPH therapeutic outcomes, almost exclusively focusing on genes related to MPH PD (e.g.,&#xD;
      dopamine transporter gene [DAT1, SLC6A3]). Unfortunately, findings from these studies have&#xD;
      been somewhat inconsistent, equivocal or even contradictory, and they do not explain the&#xD;
      variability in the PK of MPH. Pharmacogenomic studies in MPH-treated children have not&#xD;
      assessed the influence of genes associated with individual variability in PK in relation to&#xD;
      clinical response. Carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), an abundant hepatic enzyme encoded by the&#xD;
      polymorphic CES1 gene, is the sole hepatic enzyme catalyzing the metabolism (i.e., hydrolytic&#xD;
      deactivation) of MPH. CES1 expression and activity are known to vary substantially among&#xD;
      individuals. The first clinically significant CES1 variant G143E (rs71647871), discovered in&#xD;
      the study team's lab during the course of a healthy volunteer MPH PK study, led to gross&#xD;
      impairments in MPH metabolism. This variant has been unequivocally shown in vitro and in&#xD;
      clinical studies to lead to significantly impaired metabolism of MPH and other known CES1&#xD;
      substrates. The study team has established the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the G143E&#xD;
      variant as 3-4% in the general population. Accordingly, with ~1.9 million new starts of MPH&#xD;
      annually, an estimated 133,000 pediatric patients (i.e. G143E carrier's frequency 6-8%) with&#xD;
      a genetically impaired ability to metabolize/deactivate the drug will receive it - exposing&#xD;
      them to high systemic concentrations of MPH and any attendant risks or toxicities. In&#xD;
      addition, the study team's in vitro studies have revealed that another common CES1 variant&#xD;
      D203E (rs2307227) exhibited significantly impaired activity on MPH metabolism, although the&#xD;
      effects on D203E on clinical response are in need of further elucidation. Furthermore,&#xD;
      despite recent intensive research on CES1 pharmacogenetics, the functions of a large number&#xD;
      of additional CES1 variants remain undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team's hypothesis is that the CES1 variants, such as the G143E and D203E, can&#xD;
      significantly alter the expression and/or activity of CES1, thereby influencing the&#xD;
      metabolism and disposition of MPH. These influences will be directly investigated in relation&#xD;
      to MPH therapeutic response and tolerability in ADHD patients.&#xD;
