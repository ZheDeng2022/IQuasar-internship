    <textblock>
      Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated encouraging results of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) chronotherapy in the management and treatment of inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, no previous clinical trials have addressed&#xD;
      how the timing of NSAID administration within the day affects pain and healing outcomes after&#xD;
      oral surgery that involves bone removal, such as surgical extraction of the third molars.&#xD;
      Methods to address our aim, Single-center double-blind randomized controlled trial study&#xD;
      design has been adopted. Patients who needed a lower third molar extraction and meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be recruited. Participants will be randomized into two groups.&#xD;
      Subjects in group one will be instructed to take an NSAID (ibuprofen 400 mg) at 7 AM and 12&#xD;
      PM combined with a placebo before bed between 8 and 10 PM for three days postoperatively.&#xD;
      Subjects in group 2 will be instructed to take an NSAID (ibuprofen 400 mg) between 7 AM, 12&#xD;
      PM and between 8 and 10 PM for three days postoperatively. The patients' self-reported pain&#xD;
      in the three days after surgery will be recorded as the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, healing indicators such as the maximum interincisal distance and measurements&#xD;
      of facial swelling will be recorded preoperatively and four days postoperatively. Each&#xD;
      participant's blood level of C-reactive protein will be recorded pre- and postoperatively as&#xD;
      an inflammatory marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will estimate the effect of using NSAID only in the morning following surgical&#xD;
      extraction of the third molar to decrease pain and improve postoperative healing and recovery&#xD;
      in comparison to the routine use of NSAIDs three times per day.&#xD;

      Introduction and background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical extraction of wisdom teeth under local anesthesia is one of the most common oral&#xD;
      surgical procedures (1). Ten million third molars (wisdom teeth) are extracted from&#xD;
      approximately 5 million people in the United States of America each year at an annual cost of&#xD;
      over $3 billion. Additionally, more than 11 million patient-days of &quot;standard discomfort or&#xD;
      disability&quot; were reported due to surgical removal of wisdom teeth, with an average of 4.9&#xD;
      lost work days per procedure (2, 3). Most of wisdom teeth surgical extractions require bone&#xD;
      removal (4). Bone removal is associated with a broad range of postoperative discomfort and&#xD;
      complications (e.g., pain, swelling, bruising, and malaise). Most of these complications are&#xD;
      initiated by the inflammatory process from traumatic injury to the bone during the surgery.&#xD;
      Currently, postoperative pain management is limited to acetaminophen, opioids and NSAIDs (5,&#xD;
      6). However, these drugs are all problematics. Acetaminophen is not effective in managing&#xD;
      severe pain (6). Opioids and NSAID are effective in pain management, but opioids can cause&#xD;
      constipation and addiction (7, 8), While NSAIDs may delay bone healing (9, 10). Dentists and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgeons all over the world prefer to prescribe NSAID after this type of&#xD;
      surgery (11). The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is the reversible inhibition of the enzyme&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase (COX), which is believed to be responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins&#xD;
      (PGs) (10). Prostaglandins play a major role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes (12).&#xD;
      Two isoforms of COX, namely, COX-1 and COX-2, are responsible for the synthesis of PG from&#xD;
      arachidonic acid (AA). Both have essential roles in the inflammatory process after bone&#xD;
      surgery, but COX-1 is involved more in the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and renal&#xD;
      tract tissue, while COX-2 is mainly involved in the inflammatory and healing process later&#xD;
      (13). NSAIDs are either nonselective (inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2) or selective&#xD;
      (inhibiting COX-2 only). Ibuprofen is a peripherally acting analgesic with potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action that works through reversible and balanced COX-1/ COX-2 inhibition,&#xD;
      which provides faster and more effective analgesia than many other NSAIDs without any&#xD;
      apparent increased safety risk (14). Ibuprofen is routinely used in the treatment of moderate&#xD;
      to severe acute pain in the general population, including dantal pain (15-17). Results from&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic reviews demonstrate that higher doses and frequencies of NSAID use are&#xD;
      associated with better pain control after dental (wisdom tooth extraction) and non-dental&#xD;
      surgeries (9, 18, 19). Increasing the dose and frequency of NSAIDs was associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of adverse effects. Despite the promising results associated with the use of&#xD;
      different NSAIDs for pain control after wisdom tooth surgeries, patients still report pain&#xD;
      and other discomfort indicators such as swelling and trismus, especially during the first&#xD;
      three days after the procedure (20). These symptoms can affect patient's life, including&#xD;
      activities of daily living and even quality of life (3, 20-22). Animal studies suggest that&#xD;
      NSAID affect bone healing outcomes such as biomechanical measuments and number of bones with&#xD;
      non-unions (23-35). Some authors have even compared the effect of NSAIDs on fracture healing&#xD;
      with those of other pharmacological agents such as steroids (36, 37). Høgevold et al,&#xD;
      demonstrated that short-term administration of some anti-inflammatories, such as&#xD;
      indomethacin, inhibits fracture healing, while methylprednisolone does not (36).&#xD;
      Bhattacharyya et al. reported that patients receiving NSAIDs within 90 days after fracture&#xD;
      had a 3.7-fold risk of nonunion, while the risk for opioid users was 1.6-fold (38). Clinical&#xD;
      trials in humans pose some challenges, especially the need to control confounders such as&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, obesity and other factors that are associated with the healing of&#xD;
      long-bone fractures (6, 39). Four retrospective studies suggested that patients using NSAIDs&#xD;
      after fracture had a higher incidence of non-union compared to those that did not use NSAIDs&#xD;
      (38, 40-42). All living organisms possess a circadian rhythm that anticipates the response to&#xD;
      changes during the 24-hour cycle (43). The circadian system in mammals is composed of a&#xD;
      central clock within the suprachiasmatic nuclei and a peripheral clock inside all cells. The&#xD;
      circadian clock is controlled through a feedback loop featuring a heterodimer of two core&#xD;
      clock gene products: circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle&#xD;
      Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1). Clock and Bmal1 drive the expression of two inhibitors,&#xD;
      cryptochrome (Cry) and period (Per) (44). This molecular clock modulates the immune response&#xD;
      and bone healing process (44). The circadian rhythms in the expression of various cytokines&#xD;
      by immune cells are presented in Table S1. Macrophage activity, leukocyte recruitment, and&#xD;
      proinflammtory mediators such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-12 increased at the&#xD;
      beginning of the daily activity phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the active phase, there are also increased levels of Toll-like receptors TLR9 and&#xD;
      TLR4, which upregulate the expression of CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL5, leading to leukocyte&#xD;
      recruitment and potential tissue damage at the injured site (43-46)(Fig.1.). On the other&#xD;
      hand, anti-inflammatory mediators and other growth and angiogenesis factors, such as vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), peak during the resting phase (44, 47, 48) (Table S2.). The&#xD;
      24-hour circadian rhythm oscillation occur in bone tissue during growth (49), formation,&#xD;
      resorption (50, 51), and endochondral ossification during fracture bone healing (51).&#xD;
      Experimental studies in rodents and humans reveal that disruption of sleep and circadian&#xD;
      rhythm impair bone formation (52). All bone cells such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and&#xD;
      chondrocytes express clock genes that influence bone volume regulation, such as Per or Cry&#xD;
      (53, 54). The circadian clock also affects pain, with sensitivity peaking during the active&#xD;
      phase (55). Part of the pain response oscillation could be explained by changes in COX-1 and&#xD;
      COX-2 activity throughout the day (56), especially after an injury or insult (57). These&#xD;
      variations may contribute to the clinical evidence of circadian and circannual variations in&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics effects of NSAID. Specifically, maximum absorption and effectiveness are&#xD;
      achieved when the drug is administered during the active phase (58-62). We performed&#xD;
      experimental studies to estimate the extent to which the timing of NSAID doses can affect&#xD;
      animal pain behaviour and recovery after bone fracture surgery. We used a validated model of&#xD;
      fracture healing in young female mice. The results showed that administration of NSAIDs&#xD;
      during the active phase after tibia fracture surgery, compared to administration during the&#xD;
      resting phase, significantly attenuated the pain response and improved the mechanical and&#xD;
      histomorphometric properties of the healing callus. Recent evidence suggests that the timing&#xD;
      of skin wounds or surgery affects healing and postoperative recovery after cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgeries (63, 64). The chronotherapeutic use of anti-inflammatory medications after oral&#xD;
      surgeries is of clinical importance, especially with increasing evidence regarding the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of this approach in medicine. No clinical studies have investigated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this approach after minor oral surgeries. Expected contribution and research&#xD;
      question The overarching aim of this study is to contribute evidence regarding the efficacy&#xD;
      of NSAID chronotherapy in patient recovery from wisdom tooth surgery. This is an important&#xD;
      aim considering that the outcomes of this investigation can be used for other medical&#xD;
      interventions involving bone healing. The research question is as follows: among patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical extraction of wisdom teeth, to what extent does a morning doses of&#xD;
      ibuprofen 400 mg, in comparison to a routine dose schedule of three times per day, decrease&#xD;
      patients' pain and improve wound healing when taken for three days after surgery .&#xD;
