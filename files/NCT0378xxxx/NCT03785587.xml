  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of abnormal excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits,&#xD;
      hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused&#xD;
      by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands. Sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) is&#xD;
      a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis. This Phase 2&#xD;
      study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of&#xD;
      sofpironium bromide gel applied topically to pediatric subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 long-term study designed to evaluate the safety, local&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel when applied topically&#xD;
      to the axillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will apply the gel once daily at bedtime, to both axillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 24 subjects, will be enrolled to receive sofpironium bromide gel, 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at each&#xD;
      visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for women of&#xD;
      child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified&#xD;
      visits. Patient-reported outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of a total of 8 scheduled visits to take place over a 26 week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subject ≥9 to &lt;17 years of age in good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of primary axillary hyperhidrosis that meets all the following criteria: (a)&#xD;
             HDSM-Ax of 2 - 4 inclusive at both the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Baseline Visit&#xD;
             (Visit 2). (b) Symptoms of axillary hyperhidrosis for greater than or equal to 6&#xD;
             months' duration prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, any skin or subcutaneous tissue conditions of the&#xD;
             axilla(e), (i.e., the axillary area should be deemed otherwise &quot;normal&quot;, besides the&#xD;
             hyperhidrosis diagnosis, and free of blisters, large boils or sinus tracts,&#xD;
             significant scarring or open wounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of any prohibited medication(s) or procedure(s) within the specified&#xD;

             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any cholinergic drug (e.g., bethanechol) within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant, amphetamine product or drugs with&#xD;
             known anticholinergic side effects is prohibited with the following exceptions: (a) If&#xD;
             a subject has been on a stable dose of an anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant drug and&#xD;
