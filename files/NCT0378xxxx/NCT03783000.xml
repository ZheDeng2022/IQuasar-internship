    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure&#xD;
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 4 months after&#xD;
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants,&#xD;
                  injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
                  enrolment) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus intrauterine device or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus partner of non-childbearing potential (including homosexual men)&#xD;
                  Subjects are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the&#xD;
                  partner to the study drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the&#xD;
                  subject's preferred and usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually&#xD;
                  active but becomes active, with their partner, they must comply with the&#xD;
                  contraceptive requirements detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)&#xD;
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant&#xD;
             by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 139 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 45 to 89 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 40 to 100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory (including but&#xD;
             not limited to interstitial lung disease), cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or&#xD;
             hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Further exclusion criteria apply&#xD;
