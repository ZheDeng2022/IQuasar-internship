  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Standing trunk extension postures have been used for many years as a mechanical&#xD;
      approach to low back pain (LBP), sometimes directed by therapeutic intervention, sometimes&#xD;
      subconsciously performed by patientsto relieve LBP. However, no study to date has&#xD;
      investigated the effect of standing trunk extension postures on spinal height and clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this study will be to evaluate in subjects with LBP following a&#xD;
      period of trunk loading, how spinal height and/or pain, symptoms' centralization, and&#xD;
      function outcome measures respond to:(1) standing repetitive trunk extension posture; and (2)&#xD;
      standing sustained trunk extension posture. Lumbar range of motion (ROM) achieved during&#xD;
      these two trunk extension postures will be compared to spinal height and outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:A pre-test, post-test comparison group design (randomized clinical trial) will be&#xD;
      used to determine how spinal height changes in response to sustained and repetitive standing&#xD;
      trunk extension after a period of spinal loading. The study will evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      sustained and repetitive trunk extension in standing on spinal height, pain, symptoms'&#xD;
      centralization and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: A mixed ANOVA will be used to statistically identify significant&#xD;
      interactions and main effects for spinal height, pain and functionoutcome measures. Post-hoc&#xD;
      pairwise comparisons will be used to locate significant differences between the different&#xD;
      conditions. Significance will be set at Î± = 0.05. The Kruskal-Wallis 1-factor ANOVA for&#xD;
      difference scores will used to determine changes of intensity and location of symptoms&#xD;
      following sustained versus repetitive standing trunk extension. Spearman Rank correlation&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate the relationship between spinal height changes and changes of pain&#xD;
      and location of symptoms for each group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Standing trunk extension postures have been used for many years as a mechanical approach to&#xD;
      low back pain (LBP), sometimes directed by therapeutic intervention, sometimes subconsciously&#xD;
      performed by patients to relieve LBP. However, no study to date has investigated the effects&#xD;
      of standing extension postures on spinal height, pain, centralization and function.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purposes of this study will be to evaluate in a sample of LBP patients the&#xD;
      effect of standing trunk extension, both sustained and repetitive, following a period of&#xD;
      spinal loading, on (1) spinal height; (2) pain; (3) symptoms centralization and (4)&#xD;
      functional measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design(s) A pre-test, post-test comparison group design (randomized clinical trial)&#xD;
      will be used to determine how spinal height changes in response to sustained and repetitive&#xD;
      standing trunk extension after a period of spinal loading. The study will use a 2 (between&#xD;
      subjects - type of trunk extension: sustained vs. repetitive) x 3 (within subjects - time:&#xD;
      before vs. after vs. 2 weeks after) mixed design to evaluate the effects of sustained and&#xD;
      repetitive trunk extension in standing on spinal height, pain, centralization and function&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects / Specimens Systematic consecutive sampling of up to 100 subjects with LBP (40&#xD;
      subjects completing both days of data collection) attending &quot;Sports medicine and Physical&#xD;
      therapy clinic&quot; in Fredericksburg (Texas) as patients or for the purpose of health and&#xD;
      wellness will be recruited. Flyers will also be posted at physician offices and the general&#xD;
      Fredericksburg community and surrounding areas to inform subjects about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Sequence Subjects will be asked to attend two physical therapy sessions over&#xD;
      approximately a 60-minute period each to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SESSION 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a pre-screening questionnaire regarding inclusion. Each subject&#xD;
      will watch an audio-visual power point presentation explaining the study, test procedures and&#xD;
      describing the interventions (standing repetitive trunk extension and standing sustained&#xD;
      trunk extension). Written informed consent will be obtained. To determine directional&#xD;
      preference, the investigator (JH) will use the guidelines set forth in the directional&#xD;
      preference definition and based off of standards set forth in randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
      Directional preference has been defined as either (1) a specific direction of trunk movement&#xD;
      or posture noted during the physical examination or (2) a specific easing factor reported by&#xD;
      the patient during the subjective history that alleviates or decreases the patient's pain,&#xD;
      with or without the pain having changed location and/or increased the patient's lumbar range&#xD;
      of motion. A questionnaire including pertinent medical history will be completed. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete (1) a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) to rate their current, minimum,&#xD;
      maximum and average LBP over the last two days as well as paresthesia signs/symptoms&#xD;
      intensity; (2) Body Diagram for indicating location of symptoms; (3) Modified Oswestry low&#xD;
      back pain questionnaire; (4) Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire. A researcher will record&#xD;
      subject's height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject meets criteria for inclusion in the study, the subject will complete a&#xD;
      familiarization procedure to determine the consistency to reposition themselves in the&#xD;
      stadiometer. Subjects able to reposition themselves in the stadiometer with a SD of 1.3mm or&#xD;
      less for five consecutive measurements will be included in the study. The digital display&#xD;
      will be covered to blind the researcher performing the measurements. The data will be&#xD;
      automatically recorded by the stadiometer and manually downloaded to a laptop computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of data collection, a randomization plan generator&#xD;
      (http://www.randomization.com ) will assign each subject to one of two interventions: (1)&#xD;
      standing repetitive trunk extension at a rate of 10 per 45 seconds, repeated five times with&#xD;
      15-second rest breaks; or (2) standing sustained trunk extension for 5 x 45 seconds with&#xD;
      15-second rest breaks. Each subject will complete one intervention. The intervention number&#xD;
      assigned will be recorded by the subject next to their name to allow blinding of the&#xD;
      investigator as to which intervention the subject is assigned to. The subject will undergo&#xD;
      the test sequence after a 10-minute period of trunk unloading in a supine posture to ensure&#xD;
      spinal height is normalized, head in neutral posture, knees supported over a small bolster&#xD;
      pillow, hands placed on the abdomen. The subject will reposition on the stadiometer and&#xD;
      spinal height will be measured after a relaxed exhalation. The subject then will undergo a&#xD;
      five-minute period of loaded upright sitting with a 4.5kg bag secured on each shoulder and&#xD;
      spinal height will be measured (Measurement 2). As continued spinal height reduction has been&#xD;
      demonstrated following loaded sitting, the subject will undergo an additional five minutes&#xD;
      sitting without load and spinal height will be measured (Measurement 3). Inclinometers will&#xD;
      be used to take an initial measure of each subject trunk extension prior to intervention. The&#xD;
      subject will then undergo one intervention for 5 minutes as previously described, according&#xD;
      to the randomization assignment. In order to determine how sustained and repetitive&#xD;
      interventions related in terms of change in spinal height, the time to perform the sustained&#xD;
      lumbar posture matches the time necessary to perform the repetitive lumbar extension&#xD;
      postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will reposition on the stadiometer and spinal height will be measured&#xD;
      (Measurement 4). Trunk extension will be measured to determine the strength of correlations&#xD;
      between the degree of trunk extension during standing trunk extension posture and spinal&#xD;
      height, pain and centralization testing outcomes changes. The subject will score their low&#xD;
      back and lower extremity symptoms using NPRS, and map their pain on a body pain diagram prior&#xD;
      to intervention, immediately after and 2-week following the intervention to determine pain&#xD;
      rating and centralization of symptoms. The principal investigator will apply a numeric&#xD;
      overlay template to the patient's body diagrams to document the most distal pain location&#xD;
      scores between 1 and 6. Higher score will indicate a more distal symptoms' location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home instructions Subjects will be instructed to continue to use their medications, including&#xD;
      medications aimed at decreasing their pain, as prescribed by their primary healthcare&#xD;
      provider and not to change them during the follow-up two-week period. A sheet including home&#xD;
      exercise instructions will be provided to each patient. Instructions will include repetitive&#xD;
      or sustained trunk extension based on random group assignment, performed approximately 5&#xD;
      times per day. Each subject will complete a sheet recording home exercise compliance upon&#xD;
      arrival in session 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SESSION 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete: (1) a NPRS to rate their current, minimum, maximum and average LBP&#xD;
      over the last two days as well as paresthesia signs/symptoms intensity; (2) Body Diagram for&#xD;
      indicating location of symptoms; (3) Modified Oswestry low back pain questionnaire; (4) Fear&#xD;
      Avoidance Belief Questionnaire. Each subject will then complete a familiarization procedure&#xD;
      to determine the consistency to reposition themselves in the stadiometer as described in&#xD;
      session 1. The subject will undergo a 10-minute period of trunk unloading in a supine posture&#xD;
      to ensure spinal height is normalized as described in session 1. The subject will reposition&#xD;
      on the stadiometer and spinal height will be measured after a relaxed exhalation (Measurement&#xD;
      1). The subject then will undergo a five-minute period of loaded upright sitting with a 4.5kg&#xD;
      bag secured on each shoulder and spinal height will be measured. The subject will then&#xD;
      undergo an additional five minutes sitting without load and spinal height will be measured&#xD;
      (Measurement 3). Inclinometers will be used to take an initial measure of each subject trunk&#xD;
      extension prior to intervention. The subject will then undergo the same intervention as in&#xD;
      session 1 for 5 minutes as previously described (standing repetitive trunk extension or&#xD;
      standing sustained trunk extension). The subject will reposition on the stadiometer and&#xD;
      spinal height will be measured (Measurement 4). Trunk extension will be measured to determine&#xD;
      the strength of correlations between the degree of trunk extension during standing trunk&#xD;
      extension posture and spinal height, pain and centralization testing outcomes changes. The&#xD;
      subjects will then score their low back and lower extremity symptoms using NPRS, and map&#xD;
      their pain on a body pain diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator Blinding Two investigators will be involved with data collection and will carry&#xD;
      out inclinometer measurements of lumbar and sacral posture, supervised positioning in the&#xD;
      stadiometer and stadiometric measurements. The measuring investigator will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention (each subject will receive a hidden random number and will perform independently&#xD;
      the intervention in a treatment room) and the stadiometric measurements during the&#xD;
      experiment. He will also be responsible for assigning subjects to their initial groups,&#xD;
      supervising the subjects' positioning in the different standing postures and confirming that&#xD;
      a stadiometer reading is recorded on an Excel spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Charges There will be no charge for the two physical therapy sessions, including&#xD;
      examination and intervention. Following the two intervention sessions, subjects referred by&#xD;
      primary care providers (physicians, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants)&#xD;
      to physical therapy for LBP will have the choice to receive standard care and be charged for&#xD;
      physical therapy intervention.&#xD;
