  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:Moderate three week hypofractionated adjuvant radiotherapy schedule is a standard&#xD;
      care in breast cancers. A five day schedule has been demonstrated to be iso-toxic as a&#xD;
      standard three week schedule. Recently studies have also demonstrated the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of simultaneous integrated boost in this setting. This randomized trial will&#xD;
      investigate if a one-week course of hypofractionated breast radiotherapy is non-inferior to a&#xD;
      three week course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine if one-week schedule of adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer is&#xD;
      non-inferior to a three week schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Locoregional Recurrence Rate (LRR) (Cumulative proportion of patients with&#xD;
      locoregional recurrence) at 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall survival (OS) (Time from randomization to death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Invasive Disease-free survival (iDFS) (Time from randomization to any invasive disease&#xD;
           recurrence, death due to any cause or second invasive malignancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Late adverse events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of Life (QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1 week schedule will be non-inferior to a three week schedule for Locoregional&#xD;
           Recurrence Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1 week schedule will be non-inferior to a three week schedule for OS&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 1 week schedule will be not result in worse late adverse events as compared to 3 week&#xD;
           schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proportion of patients decrease in quality of life will not differ between the two arms&#xD;
           at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Open-label, parallel group, two arm, randomised, phase III, non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Patients with breast cancer who need adjuvant radiotherapy after breast&#xD;
      conservation or mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to 15 days or 5 days of radiotherapy to the whole&#xD;
      breast or chest wall or reconstructed breast. Nodal radiation will be delivered as indicated.&#xD;
      A simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) will be delivered to patients who need a tumor bed&#xD;
      boost after breast cancer. The following dose schedules will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks (with SIB of 8 Gy)*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Group: 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week (with SIB of 6 Gy).*&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Use of Sequential Boost is allowed in both arms if prespecified by the institution. If used&#xD;
      dose is 12 Gy in 4 fractions in 1 week in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LRR : Cumulative proportion of patients with ipsilateral Locoregional Recurrence after&#xD;
           treatment at 5 years .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OS: Time from randomization to the time of death due to any cause. Cumulative proportion&#xD;
           reported at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. iDFS: Time from randomization to any disease recurrence, death due to any cause or&#xD;
           second primary invasive cancer.Cumulative proportion reported at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AE: Proportion of patients with late Grade 2 or more AE as defined by the CTCAE 5&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. QoL: Proportion of patients with a worse summary score in the EORTC QLQ C30 at 12 months&#xD;
           post-treatment as compared to the baseline score.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status : 0 - 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent curative intent surgery for the breast cancer with complete microscopic&#xD;
             resection either in the form of a mastectomy or breast conservation surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate axillary clearance or a validated sentinel node biopsy procedure. For the&#xD;
             purpose of this study, adequacy of the axillary clearance will be determined by a&#xD;
             multidisciplinary tumor board and rationale for the decision documented in the case&#xD;
             records. As a general guideline, at least 10 axillary lymph nodes need to be sampled&#xD;
             for an axillary nodal dissection to be considered as adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of distant metastases. Patients who have high risk breast cancer as defined by&#xD;
             a Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) of &gt; 5.4 will be considered for metastatic workup&#xD;
             in the form of a 18 FDG PET CT. Alternatively, a CT scan of the thorax and whole&#xD;
             abdomen, and a bone scan is also allowed. Metastatic workup will also be recommended&#xD;
             in patients with AJCC 8 T3/T4 tumors at presentation, 4 or more nodes positive after&#xD;
             surgery (pN2 or above). Patients with low or intermediate NPI will be considered for&#xD;
             metastatic workup on a case by case basis. Metastatic workup will also be recommended&#xD;
             for all patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast&#xD;
             cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear margins of resection for the breast primary as defined by absence tumor on ink&#xD;
             in the specimen if a breast conservation has been performed or excision upto the deep&#xD;
             fascia of the pectoralis major or skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated. The following patients will be considered as&#xD;
             candidates to receive adjuvant radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients after breast conservation surgery or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients after mastectomy if any of the below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T3 - T4 tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  more than 3 axillary lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T0-T2 tumor with 0 - 3 axillary lymph nodes with a Cambridge Score of 3 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The SCF will be included in patients with axillary nodal involvement in pathology or&#xD;
             in those patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The internal mammary&#xD;
             nodes will be included based on the institutional policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any one of the following will exclude the patient from participation in&#xD;
             the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pure ductal carcinomas in situ (in patients undergoing upfront surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-epithelial malignant conditions of the breast viz. Sarcomas,&#xD;
             lymphomas, phyllodes tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metaplastic breast cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of pathologically proven residual supraclavicular nodal metastases or&#xD;
             residual internal mammary lymphadenopathy at time of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast/chest wall or the mediastinum. Patients&#xD;
             with synchronous / metachronous contralateral breast malignancies will be eligible for&#xD;
             inclusion. Patients requiring bilateral breast radiotherapy are also eligible for&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness, including severe infection that may jeopardize the ability of the&#xD;
             patient to undergo the procedures outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric conditions that might limit the ability of the patient&#xD;
             to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planned for concurrent chemotherapy during radiation therapy. Concurrent&#xD;
             hormonal therapy or targeted therapy using anti-HER2 agents is allowed.&#xD;
