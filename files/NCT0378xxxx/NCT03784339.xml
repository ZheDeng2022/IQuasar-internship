      Feasibility study: Does a designated education session change levels of catastrophizing,&#xD;
      kinesiophobia and pain beliefs in patients with patellofemoral pain? Design: Single site&#xD;
      feasibility Study Aim: Aims are to identify if a formal education session (intervention)&#xD;
      improves patient outcomes and to assess if it is possible to test the intervention for&#xD;
      efficacy in a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score-Patellofemoral) KOOS-PF. The original KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other&#xD;
      Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and&#xD;
      knee related Quality of Life (QOL). The KOOS-PF was developed to evaluate individuals or&#xD;
      samples of individuals who present with anterior knee pain/patellofemoral pain and/or&#xD;
      patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA), or who are at risk of developing patellofemoral pain or&#xD;
      OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures are Pain Catastrophizing Scale and The Tampa Scale for&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for inclusion in the study will be identified from the&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal Clinical Assessment Service (MCAS) by Band 6's and 7's and approved by a Band&#xD;
      8 Physiotherapist the South Liverpool Treatment Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention will comprise a 1:1, 30 minute education session delivered by&#xD;
      a specialist musculoskeletal physiotherapist with over ten years' experience who has an&#xD;
      interest in patellofemoral pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education session will be based on a schedule formed from the most recent research on&#xD;
      patellofemoral pain PFP which considers psychosocial factors (Robertson et al 2017). Crepitus&#xD;
      is a word used to describe any grinding, creaking, cracking, grating, crunching or popping&#xD;
      that occurs when the patellofemoral joint moves (Robertson et al 2017). The psychological&#xD;
      factors, specifically patients' beliefs about crepitus, avoiding crepitus and the influence&#xD;
      of others will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be supported by the leaflet 'managing my patellofemoral pain' developed&#xD;
      by Barton and Rathleff (2016) on the basis of international opinion from 21 international&#xD;
      experts and subsequent review by 20 patients diagnosed with PFP to ensure clarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Within the time constraints of a Masters Degree, patients will be recruited over a&#xD;
      four month period. There will be four months for follow up and a further four months for&#xD;
      write up, total study duration 12 months.&#xD;

      Design: A feasibility study to assess if a physiotherapy education session in addition to&#xD;
      standard care improves patients scores regarding catastrophizing and kinesiophobia when&#xD;
      measured by KOOS-PF, Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Tampa Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess if providing a specific education session which reviews patients beliefs about&#xD;
           crepitus, causes of pain, joint mechanics and purpose of exercise has an effect on&#xD;
           catastrophizing and kinesiophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify if the study is feasible on a larger scale, which would allow the&#xD;
           intervention to be assessed for efficacy. If a future study was able to demonstrate that&#xD;
           the intervention was effective this would provide an additional evidence based&#xD;
           intervention for use in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: NHS patients diagnosed in a Musculoskeletal Clinical Assessment Service [MCAS]&#xD;
      with patellofemoral pain at the South Liverpool Treatment Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults aged 18-40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to understand and converse in English&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of PFP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to attend for up-to 12 weeks of physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who present with referred pain from the spine or hip, or have tibiofemoral&#xD;
           pathology of any nature on the ipsilateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A diagnosis of patellofemoral joint (PFJ) OA as confirmed by X-Ray or Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
           Imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: There is limited published research regarding the use of the questionnaire&#xD;
      KOOS-PF in research. As a result it is not possible to do a definitive study to test whether&#xD;
      or not the education session effects patient outcome. Therefore it is necessary to do a&#xD;
      feasibility study with a small sample size of 24 patients (control n=12, intervention n=12)&#xD;
      which will allow any change in the questionnaire scores to be used to calculate how many&#xD;
      patients would be needed for a definitive study which would allow researchers to assess&#xD;
      whether or not the exercise intervention affected patient outcome, which could improve&#xD;
      patient care. The research team are confident that the required number of patients could be&#xD;
      recruited as audit data from the service identified that 104 patients in the MCAS service met&#xD;
      the criteria for inclusion in this proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures: Participants' characteristics including age, gender and duration of&#xD;
      symptoms will be collected alongside baseline measures for the chosen questionnaires - the&#xD;
      KOOS-PF, Tampa-scale for Kinesiophobia and Pain Catastrophizing. These questionnaires will be&#xD;
      repeated at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients recruited into the study will be randomised to either the intervention&#xD;
      (n=12) or the control group (n=12). Participants in the control group will undergo standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention: Participants in the intervention group will receive standard treatment plus&#xD;
      the education session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education session will be based on a leaflet produced by other leading researchers in the&#xD;
      field and will also explore the causes of pain, beliefs about pain, beliefs about noise that&#xD;
      come from the joint, the impact of the pain on activity and the influence of other family&#xD;
      members' experience and beliefs about knee pain. At 12 weeks, participants from both groups&#xD;
      will be asked to repeat the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed on the data and the&#xD;
      lead researcher will work with the statistics department at MMU to review the change in the&#xD;
      chosen questionnaires to identify the sample size required for a definitive study which will&#xD;
      assess how effective the education session is on patients' symptoms of PFP.&#xD;
