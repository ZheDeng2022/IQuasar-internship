      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety of rHSA/EPO to healthy subjects and to&#xD;
      investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rHSA/EPO in healthy subjects, and to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;

      This experiment was a single-center clinical study with randomized, open, positive drug&#xD;
      control and single dose increment. The test group will be conducted in the order of&#xD;
      incremental dose from 150μg to 1200μg 5 dose groups, with 1 positive control groups (EPIAO).&#xD;
      After 7 days of administration, the researchers looked at the drug safety tolerance of the&#xD;
      test to determine whether to proceed with the next higher dose group test.&#xD;
