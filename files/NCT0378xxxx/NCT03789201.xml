      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People tend to pay more attention to one side of space than the other and this may be due to&#xD;
      differences in the structure and function of the two sides of the brain. We are interested in&#xD;
      whether we can detect those difference with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to understand how differences in brain structure may cause people&#xD;
      to pay more attention to one side than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 35&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2-3 visits for a total duration of about 7/8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test before each MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of attention, and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS. A brief electrical current will pass through a wire coil on the scalp. Participants will&#xD;
      hear a click and may feel a pull. They may be asked to tense muscles or do tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for a maximum of 1 hour. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
      table that slides into a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will do tasks on a&#xD;
      computer screen or lie still. They will get earplugs for loud noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG for no longer than 5 hours, with most lasting 3 hours. Gel and a cap with electrodes will&#xD;
      be placed on the scalp. They will record brain waves while the participant gets TMS or does&#xD;
      nothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about participants dominant hand and about the MRI.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol to explore correlations between lateralized individual differences&#xD;
      in visual attentional preference and hemispheric asymmetries in functional connectivity&#xD;
      between the frontal and parietal visual attention areas. To measure functional connectivity,&#xD;
      resting state functional MRI and electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials evoked with&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used. Protocol research will also attempt to&#xD;
      validate the TMS-evoked EEG potentials against fMRI resting state functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 right-handed and right-eyed healthy volunteers, aged 18-35&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) and fMRI will be used to measure functional connectivity&#xD;
      between the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal visual attention area. Various tasks&#xD;
      will be used to quantify attention and explore their relationship with asymmetries in&#xD;
      functional connectivity. A qualitative comparison between the value of fMRI and TEPs for&#xD;
      predicting attentional bias will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral measures of attention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEP measures of functional connectivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fMRI measures of functional connectivity&#xD;
