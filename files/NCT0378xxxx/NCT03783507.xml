  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For weight loss to occur, energy intake needs to be reduced to incur an energy deficit. One&#xD;
      dietary strategy that may facilitate weight loss is consuming a diet low in dietary energy&#xD;
      density (ED). It is hypothesized that a diet low in ED, which can be achieved by a high&#xD;
      intake of low-ED foods, low intake of high-ED foods, or a combination of the two, will allow&#xD;
      a greater amount of volume of food to be consumed relative to energy consumed, which can&#xD;
      assist with reducing energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand how best to lower the ED of the diet, it is important to understand the&#xD;
      relationship between low-ED and high-ED foods. Behavioral economics is a framework that&#xD;
      provides a foundation to understand that eating behaviors can be substitutes for each other.&#xD;
      Substitute eating behaviors are two behaviors that change in the opposite direction of each&#xD;
      other (i.e. one behavior increases as the other behavior decreases). If low-ED and high-ED&#xD;
      foods are substitutes for each other, in situations in which low-ED food intake increases,&#xD;
      high-ED food should automatically decrease, and vice versa. If they are not substitutes, when&#xD;
      low-ED food intake increases, high-ED food intake should remain unchanged, and when high-ED&#xD;
      food intake decreases, low-ED food intake should remain unchanged. When low-Ed and high-ED&#xD;
      foods are not substitutes for each other, purposeful change in intake for both low- and&#xD;
      high-ED foods need to occur to best lower dietary ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate if low-ED foods and high-ED foods&#xD;
      substitute for each other. Healthy weight adults will be served a meal over 4 sessions, with&#xD;
      each meal containing 5 different food items. The foods in the meal will vary in ED: low-ED =&#xD;
      0 to 1.0 kcal/kg; medium-ED = 1.1 to 2.9 kcal/kg; high-ED = &gt; 3.0 kcal/g. For the 4 sessions,&#xD;
      the meals will include: 1) 3 low-ED foods, 0 medium-ED foods, 2 high-ED foods; 2) 3 low-ED&#xD;
      foods, 1 medium-ED food, 1 high-ED food; 3) 1 low-ED food, 2-medium ED foods, 2 high-ED&#xD;
      foods; and 4) 1 low-ED food, 3 medium-ED foods, and 1 high-ED food.&#xD;

      All participants will be asked to come to Healthy Eating and Activity Lab (HEAL) for 1,&#xD;
      60-minute screening session and 4, 30-minute meal sessions, with no more than two meal&#xD;
      sessions occurring per week between the hours of 11:00am and 7:00pm. For each participant,&#xD;
      each meal session will need to occur within the same two-hr time frame (i.e., all meal&#xD;
      sessions occurring between 11am and 1pm). During the first session interested participants&#xD;
      will sign the consent form. After signing the consent form, eligibility will be confirmed by&#xD;
      taking height and weight measures and confirming liking of foods, using a 100mm visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS). Participants will also be given questionnaires related to demographics.&#xD;
      Prior to attending their meal session, participants will be asked to not change their typical&#xD;
      eating pattern in the day prior to their session (including eating before 10 am), but to not&#xD;
      eat within 3 hours of their session, and to not engage in physical activity for 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the remaining four sessions, at the start of the session the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      recall all foods and beverages consumed 24 hours prior to the scheduled appointment. During&#xD;
      this recall if a participant reports consuming any foods or beverages besides water within 3&#xD;
      hours of the appointment, the appointment will be rescheduled. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked if they have participated in any physical activity 24 hours prior to their scheduled&#xD;
      appointment. If the participant answers &quot;yes,&quot; then the appointment will be rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing hunger, fullness, and liking of foods questionnaires, participants will be&#xD;
      presented with one of the four variations of meals. Each meal consists of a total of&#xD;
      1,500kcals of five of the following items: chicken noodle soup (Low-ED), sugar-free chocolate&#xD;
      pudding (Low-ED), red seedless grapes (Low-ED), macaroni and cheese (Medium-ED), strawberry&#xD;
      yogurt (Medium-ED), vanilla ice cream (Medium-ED), pretzels (High-ED), or graham crackers&#xD;
      (High-ED). Following the presentation of the meal, participants will be instructed to taste&#xD;
      each foods and that they will have 25 minutes to eat as much or as little as they would like&#xD;
      of the meal provided. At the completion of 25 minutes, the lunch will be removed and the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete a scale for evaluating levels of hunger, fullness, and&#xD;
      liking of the foods. The participant will also be scheduled for a subsequent session the&#xD;
      following week at a similar time. Upon completing all 5 sessions, participants will receive a&#xD;
      $25 gift card.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In order to examine if low-ED foods and high-ED foods substitute for each other, a 4 X 4 mixed-factor design with a between-subjects factor of order and a within-subjects factor of meal will be used. For the within-subjects factor of meal, four meal conditions will be implemented. Participants will be randomized to one of 4 orders to reduce the possibility of an order effect. During all sessions, participants will be provided with 12 ounces of water.</intervention_model_description>
