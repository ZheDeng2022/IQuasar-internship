  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Application of trigger point dry needling can induce post-dry needling soreness. This is not&#xD;
      a negative experience, but sometimes some patients want to reduce it as much as possible.&#xD;
      Different therapeutic strategies targeting to decrease post-dry needling soreness need to be&#xD;
      investigated. Previous studies have investigated spray and stretch, ischemic compression or&#xD;
      low-load eccentric exercise as post-needling intervention procedures. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence supporting the role of descending pain inhibition mechanisms for paon control. The&#xD;
      application of virtual reality as a distraction technique could active brain mechanisms&#xD;
      during dry needling. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of playing virtual reality during the application of dry needling on post-needling&#xD;
      soreness over trigger points in the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. A secondary aim&#xD;
      will be to determine the prognostic role of baseline scores of pressure pain sensitivity,&#xD;
      related-disability, anxiety and catastrophizing levels.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes after, 12 hours after, 24 hours after, 36 hours after, 48 hours after, and 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A numerical Pain Rate Scale (NPRS, 0-10) will be used to record post-dry needling soreness and pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline score of upper extremity related-disability assessed with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH questionaire consists of 30-items assessing: 1, degree of difficulty during the preceding week in performing physical activities because of problems in the upper extremity (21 items); 2, severity of each pain symptom, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness, and stiffness (5 items); and, 3, the problem's effect on social activities, work, and sleep, and its psychological impact (4 items). Each item is answered on a 5-points scale ranging from 1 (no difficulty to perform, no symptom, or no impact) to 5 (unable to do, very severe symptom, or high impact). Responses are summed to form a raw score that is converted to a 0 to 100 scale where higher scores reflect greater related-disability.</description>

    <measure>Baseline data on pressure pain sensitivity assessed with a pressure algometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds over the cervical spine, the lateral epicondyle and the tibialis anterior muscle will be assessed with a pressure algometer at baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline anxiety levels as assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is a 40 items scale assessing separate dimensions of state anxiety (items l-20, STAI-S) and trait anxiety (items 21-40, STAI-T). The STAI-S items assess relatively enduring symptoms of anxiety. Participants use a 4-points response scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;, to indicate the extent to which they experience each emotion. The STAI-T scale measures a stable propensity to experience anxiety, and tendencies to perceive stressful situations as threatening. It consists of 20 statements requiring individuals to rate how they generally feel on a 4-points scale. In both scales, higher scores indicate greater state or trait anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catastrophizing belief as assessed with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale will be used for determining baseline participant's propensity to catastrophize about pain. It consists of 13-items evaluating the three components of catastrophizing: rumination, magnification and helplessness.</description>
