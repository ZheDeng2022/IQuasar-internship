  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to look at the effectiveness of prescribing yoga&#xD;
      classes to patients with dysmenorrhea (irregular or painful periods), or other menstrual&#xD;
      disorders on patients' self reported pain and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from primary care clinics around Illinois, including Carle&#xD;
      Hospital. This is a randomized trial in which patients will first be randomized into the&#xD;
      control or intervention group. Patients in the control group will undergo usual care and be&#xD;
      surveyed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months. Patients in the control group will be&#xD;
      offered the 3 months of yoga therapy complimentary after completing the 9 month control.&#xD;
      Control patients who choose to participate in the yoga therapy will be asked to also complete&#xD;
      the surveys at the end of the 3 month yoga intervention. Patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      will first undergo 3 months of regular care and then 3 months of biweekly yoga classes.&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys at baseline, 3 months (after of control care), 6 months&#xD;
      (after 3 months of biweekly yoga classes), 9 months, and 12 months (after 6 months of&#xD;
      observation and optional yoga practice).&#xD;

      Participants will contact the research team with the information on the flyer. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to come to the Iyengar Yoga Center (407 W Springfield Ave, Urbana, IL 61801) to&#xD;
      receive more information. Participants will need to disclose their diagnosis to the research&#xD;
      staff. If they are not aware of what their diagnosis is, they will need to contact their&#xD;
      physician to get their official diagnosis. For example, a woman with dysmenorrhea may be&#xD;
      diagnosed with poly cystic ovarian disease or endometriosis or idiopathic dysmenorrhea, or&#xD;
      another reproductive disease; participants will need to know their specific diagnosis or find&#xD;
      out their specific diagnosis and report it to the research staff. Participants can do this by&#xD;
      calling their physicians. For participants that are unaware of their diagnosis, they may also&#xD;
      request a copy of their medical records. These records may be shared with the research staff&#xD;
      to help determine diagnosis. The research staff will not keep these medical records, but&#xD;
      return them to the participants. Participants can then either consent on the first visit or&#xD;
      choose to take time as much time as they need and return to the yoga center when they are&#xD;
      ready to sign the consent form. Participants will complete the first round of surveys at the&#xD;
      yoga center after they sign the consent form (20 minutes). Participants will receive an email&#xD;
      or phone call from the study team to inform them of their randomization results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blind third party statistician will complete the randomization for all participants at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study for all 90 participants and will email the study coordinator with the&#xD;
      randomization results. Randomization will be done through a free online software called&#xD;
      graphpad. (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts 12 months for the intervention and 9 months for the control group with an&#xD;
      optional 3 month yoga therapy session offered at the end: Once consented, participants will&#xD;
      fill out baseline surveys, and then undergo 3 months of usual care (no intervention), the&#xD;
      same baseline surveys will be filled out again, then participants will get biweekly free yoga&#xD;
      therapy classes for 3 months, and surveys will again be completed at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention. Patients will then have a 6 month follow up and will fill out the surveys one&#xD;
      last time. Recruitment will occur on a rolling basis so patients may join the study at&#xD;
      anytime and not have to wait for a batched group.&#xD;
