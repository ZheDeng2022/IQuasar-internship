      The precise amount of protamine required to neutralize unfractionated heparin (UFH) remains&#xD;
      unknown. This study will systematically identify the doze needed to neutralize UFH following&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The precise dose of protamine needed to neutralize unfractionated heparin (UFH) is unknown.&#xD;
      Research suggests that low dose protamine is associated with decreased need for transfusions&#xD;
      in cardiac surgery. The ATS guidelines recommend that half of the total UFH dose given for&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) should be neutralized with protamine. However, it is unknown if&#xD;
      this is routinely followed by anesthesiologists. Furthermore, the reference standard for UFH&#xD;
      has changed recently and it is unknown how this has affected the dose of protamine in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. Protamine does have a very short life and heparin rebound occurs very&#xD;
      commonly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common practice to divert the suctioned mediastinal blood following CPB while the&#xD;
      patient is still anticoagulated. The traditional practice is that once half dose protamine&#xD;
      has been given, suction to the cardiotomy reservoir is turned off. All surgical field blood&#xD;
      loss is then diverted to wall suction. The inherent risk of letting too much protamine into&#xD;
      the CPB reservoir is that UFH therein may get neutralized and predispose to clot formation in&#xD;
      the venous reservoir. This precludes an emergency 'crash' on to CPB, should that be required&#xD;
      for some reason. Experience of the Investigators indicates that most surgeons will turn off&#xD;
      suction leading to the cardiotomy reservoir once half the total protamine dose has been&#xD;
      administered. The concern with this is that &quot;half dose&quot; protamine may be quite different for&#xD;
      different anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research investigators hypothesize low dose protamine is sufficient to neutralize the&#xD;
      effects of UFH as monitored through activated clotting time (ACT). Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      administer varying doses of protamine to neutralize UFH in cardiac surgery and the rationale&#xD;
      behind such decisions is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose of protamine required to&#xD;
      neutralize UFH following CPB. Secondary objectives are 1) to assess the amount of protamine&#xD;
      needed to neutralize UFH in intravenously administered cardiotomy reservoir blood. 2) To&#xD;
      examine the amount of residual heparin postoperatively in the cardiac surgery ICU; 3) to&#xD;
      examine, through semi-structured interviews, the decision-making processes involved in&#xD;
      managing (anti)coagulation in cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The functional activity is ideally measured via its ability to accelerate the inhibition of activated coagulation enzymes IIa (thrombin) and Xa respectively.&#xD;
These tests are available commercially as ELISA kits. Briefly, an excess of coagulation factor IIa or Xa respectively is added to the sample and residual anti-IIa/Xa activity is quantified with a synthetic chromogenic substrate.</description>
