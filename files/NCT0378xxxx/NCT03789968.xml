      This study will assess changes in the incidence and severity of drug interactions before and&#xD;
      after switching antiretroviral therapy to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide-based regimens in treatment experienced patients living with HIV infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simple, safe and effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) can provide optimal treatment&#xD;
      outcomes for people living with HIV infection (PLWH) [1]. Increasingly complex and poorly&#xD;
      tolerated regimens, on the other hand often limit ART adherence, while drug-drug interactions&#xD;
      (DDIs) and safety concerns with individual ART agents can limit treatment selection [2-4].&#xD;
      Fortunately, recent advances in ART have included the emergence of several highly effective,&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated regimens with limited DDIs. In clinical trials, integrase strand&#xD;
      transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) such as raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir and bictegravir&#xD;
      are consistently as effective or more effective than comparator agents and often superior in&#xD;
      terms of tolerability [5-10]. Due to their efficacy, safety, and tolerability, INSTI-based&#xD;
      regimens are now routinely used in treatment naïve patients and emerging data suggests that&#xD;
      several may be used to simplify therapy for selected patients with treatment experience [11,&#xD;
      12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the INSTIs, bictegravir is the newest agent in the class [13]. Similar to dolutegravir&#xD;
      and raltegravir and in contrast to elvitegravir, it has few significant drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions. Unlike dolutegravir and raltegravir, bictegravir is available as part of a&#xD;
      single-tablet, once-daily regimen that includes tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine&#xD;
      (BIC/TAF/FTC). Raltegravir is not available within a single tablet regimen, while&#xD;
      dolutegravir is available as part of a single-tablet regimen, but it includes abacavir, which&#xD;
      has been linked to an increased cardiovascular disease risk. As a result, BIC/TAF/FTC is&#xD;
      currently among the most effective, safe, well-tolerated treatment options with limited&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With several new treatment options available, particularly in the INSTI class, current&#xD;
      guidelines advocate switching ART when possible in virologically suppressed, ART experienced&#xD;
      patients [1]. Switching ART can simplify treatment, improve tolerability, eliminate toxicity,&#xD;
      and mitigate drug-drug interactions. When switching ART for any reason, it is critical to&#xD;
      review a patient's full HIV treatment history, including virologic responses, past&#xD;
      ART-associated toxicities, and cumulative resistance before selecting a new regimen [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-drug interaction assessments with a patient's concomitant medications should also be&#xD;
      performed prior to switching ART. More than 70% of the HIV population will be above the age&#xD;
      of 50 by the year 2020 and many are receiving 5 or more medications for common chronic&#xD;
      conditions in addition to being ART experienced [14, 15]. Cardiovascular disease, hepatic and&#xD;
      renal disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, metabolic disorders, and cancers are among&#xD;
      the conditions that can occur more commonly in PLWH and at times earlier in life in&#xD;
      comparison to their HIV negative counterparts [16]. Drug-drug interactions between&#xD;
      medications needed to treat or prevent these comorbid conditions can often interact with ART.&#xD;
      Switching ART, in many circumstances can reduce the number drug interactions with medications&#xD;
      for comorbid conditions. Conversely, switching can also lead to new interactions requiring&#xD;
      intervention to avoid toxicities or prevent ineffective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have confirmed that switching HIV treatment can improve patient adherence&#xD;
      and quality of life [17]. Several studies have also confirmed that clinically significant&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions are common in patients living with HIV, but none have assessed changes&#xD;
      in the incidence and severity of drug-drug interactions in the setting of ART switches&#xD;
      [18-20]. The primary objective of this study is to assess changes in the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of drug interactions before and after switching ART to BIC/TAF/FTC -based regimens&#xD;
      in treatment experienced patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the incidence and severity of drug-drug interactions between ART&#xD;
      and concomitant medications before and after switching to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based ART regimen in&#xD;
      treatment experienced patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and severity of drug-drug interactions between ART and concomitant medications&#xD;
      is reduced after switching to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based ART regimen in treatment experienced&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Subjects from the Jefferson Infectious Diseases Associates outpatient HIV&#xD;
      Clinic will be evaluated for study inclusion. Co-investigators at six partner institutions&#xD;
      will also evaluate patients at their HIV clinics for study inclusion. The following&#xD;
      information will be collected for patients meeting the study criteria: age, gender, race,&#xD;
      duration of HIV infection, duration of ART treatment, number of previous ART regimens, CD4+&#xD;
      cell count and HIV RNA directly prior to switching to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based ART regimen, and&#xD;
      the reason for switching ART to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based regimen. Additionally, all concomitant&#xD;
      medication names at the time of the ART switch will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring System To assess the combined incidence and severity of drug interactions with&#xD;
      concomitant medications (CM) prior to and following each patient's ART switch, a DDI&#xD;
      incidence and severity score was developed. The score is based upon results obtained when&#xD;
      entering medications into the University of Liverpool's HIV Drug Interaction Checker (ULHDIC)&#xD;
      database [21]. Each ART-CM pair is given one of the following scores: &quot;do not co-administer&quot;&#xD;
      is assigned a score of 2, &quot;potential interaction&quot; a score of 1, and &quot;potential weak&#xD;
      interaction&quot; or &quot;no interaction&quot; a score of 0. For those interactions that have &quot;no clear&#xD;
      data,&quot; or for those medications that are not listed in the drug database, the Department of&#xD;
      Health and Human Services HIV treatment guidelines will be consulted along with the FDA&#xD;
      product labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Validation A separate analysis (data not provided here) was completed by study&#xD;
      investigators to validate the use of the ULDIC severity ranking. The medication profiles of a&#xD;
      random, representative sample of the study's population were selected for analysis. Drug&#xD;
      interaction scores using the aforementioned ULHDIC were compared with drug interaction scores&#xD;
      determined manually using the Department of Health and Human Services HIV treatment&#xD;
      guidelines and FDA product labeling. No statistical difference in drug interaction scores&#xD;
      between methods was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of the study will be to measure the change in mean&#xD;
      total drug interaction scores pre and post ART switch to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based ART regimen. The&#xD;
      total drug interaction scores for each patient pre- and post-switch will be calculated. The&#xD;
      average pre-switch and post-switch scores will then be determined and analyzed for&#xD;
      statistical differences using a two-sided paired t-test (normal distribution) with an alpha&#xD;
      level of 0.05 or a Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test (non-normal distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoint of the study will be to identify predictors of&#xD;
      achieving drug interaction score reductions after switching to a BIC/TAF/FTC-based ART&#xD;
      regimen. Predictors for achieving drug interaction score reductions will be examined using a&#xD;
      multivariable linear regression model. Initial models will include all a priori determined&#xD;
      variables and all variables will be examined for multi-collinearity. Models will be fit using&#xD;
      a backwards selection procedure. Candidate predictors will be eliminated individually by&#xD;
      comparing the log likelihood ratio test for each model step and using the 5% significance&#xD;
      level.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is to measure the change in mean total drug interaction scores pre and post ART switch to a bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen. The total drug interaction scores for each patient pre- and post-switch will be calculated using a drug interaction score developed for this study. The score is obtained when entering a patient's ART and concomitant medications (CM) into the University of Liverpool's HIV Drug Interaction Checker database [21]. Each ART-CM pair is given one of the following scores: &quot;do not co-administer&quot; is a score of 2, &quot;potential interaction&quot; a score of 1, and &quot;potential weak interaction&quot; or &quot;no interaction&quot; a score of 0. When no interactions are observed between a patient's ART and CMs, the total score will be 0. Higher scores occur when interactions are present. A decrease in score indicates that switching to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide decreased the number and severity of interactions present.</description>
