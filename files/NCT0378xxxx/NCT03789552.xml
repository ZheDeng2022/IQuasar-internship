  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3&#xD;
      clinical study to confirm the safety and efficacy of T89 in patients with stable angina&#xD;
      pectoris, with an extended open-label period to evaluate the long-term safety of T89. This&#xD;
      study includes three main periods: the first study period is a 3-week single-blind qualifying&#xD;
      run-in period to screen eligible stable angina patients by exercise tolerance test (ETT). The&#xD;
      second study period is a 8-week double-blind treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of T89 in patients with stable angina by ETT. And, the last study period is a 44-week&#xD;
      open-label period to observe long-term use safety of T89.&#xD;

      After signing the consent, patients will enter the single blind qualifying run-in period for&#xD;
      3 weeks. All prophylactic anti-anginal medications will be withdrawn except no more than one&#xD;
      beta blocker or one calcium channel blocker (CCB) to remain. If patients can tolerate the&#xD;
      withdrawal of the multiple anti-anginal medications, the dose of the remained one beta&#xD;
      blocker or one CCB will be kept unchanged until the double-blind treatment period ends. In&#xD;
      this study period, patients will have two exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) on standard Bruce&#xD;
      protocol, conducted one week apart. Sublingual nitroglycerin is allowed for symptomatic&#xD;
      relief of angina attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the three&#xD;
      double-blind treatments: high dose T89 of 300 mg, bid, low dose T89 of 225 mg, bid, or&#xD;
      placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient will be instructed to administer assigned treatment&#xD;
      twice daily for 8 weeks. ETTs will be performed at the end of week 6 and 8 of treatment, or&#xD;
      end of treatment (EOT) if study patient discontinues study prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) will be used to record patients' quality of life. Clinical&#xD;
      evaluations and adverse event monitoring will be assessed throughout the study. Laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be performed at screening and the designated visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the treatment period is completed, patients will enter the extended open label safety&#xD;
      assessment period for a further 44 weeks. During this period, all patients will receive T89&#xD;
      at a daily dose of 600 mg, and they can resume their original anti-anginal medications as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise, a common physiological stress, can elicit cardiovascular abnormalities that are not present at rest, and it can be used to determine the adequacy of cardiac function. Clinical exercise tolerance test (ETT) is an established non-invasive procedure that provides diagnostic and prognostic information for the evaluation of several pathologies, the most common of which is coronary heart disease. Total exercise duration (TED) is the time from starting ETT to terminating ETT, usually presented by minutes and seconds. Standard Bruce protocol, one of the protocols used for the conduction of an ETT as a pre-defined speed and gradient in different time interval, will be applied in this study. The TED at each ETT will be collected and recorded as primary parameter, and the change from baseline of symptom-limited TED at trough drug levels on standard Bruce protocol to Day 57 of treatment in high-dose and low-dose groups will be compared with that in placebo group.</description>

    <description>A Wearable Cardiac Monitor (WCM) is a device similar to a Holter but quite smaller in size. This is a FDA-approved device used for recording the ECG up to for 7 days when patients may suffer from transient symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, anxiety, fatigue, syncope, pre-syncope, light-headedness, shortness of breath. The WCM device is safe and easy for patients to use even when they are taking a short shower. Angina episodes during the past 7 days will be mainly collected from this device and recorded by site staff at due visit until Day 57. And percent change in the average frequency of angina episodes (average over 14 days) from baseline [Day -14 to 1] to end of double-blind treatment period [Day 43 to 57] in high-dose and low-dose groups will be compared with that in placebo group.</description>
