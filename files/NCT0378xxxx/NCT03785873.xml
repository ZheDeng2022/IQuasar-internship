&#xD;
          -  No known medical condition (e.g. a condition associated with uncontrolled diarrhea&#xD;
             such as ulcerative colitis or acute diverticulitis) that, in the investigator's&#xD;

             the interpretation of safety results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be on warfarin, strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin,&#xD;
