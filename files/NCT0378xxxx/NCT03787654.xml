  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the effect of electroacupuncture in female patients with&#xD;
      urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. A three-arm non-inferior randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) using electroacupuncture, sham electroacupuncture and solifenacin with&#xD;
      a total sample of 282 is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the improvement (difference in number of urgency urinary incontinence&#xD;
      episodes between baseline and 12-week evaluation) in the electroacupuncture group would be&#xD;
      50% or less of the difference in the improvement between the Solifenacin and the sham&#xD;
      electroacupuncture groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) features complaint or involuntary loss of urine associated&#xD;
      with urgency and also with effort or physical exertion or on sneezing or coughing. It is&#xD;
      regarded as urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (UMUI) when sudden sensation of&#xD;
      voiding accompanied by uncontrolled incontinence domains the symptoms. UMUI can bring shame&#xD;
      and inconvenience to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As first-line medicine for urge-predominant urinary incontinence, Solifenacin can reduce&#xD;
      urgency urinary incontinence episodes in 24 hours. However, the side effects tend to bring&#xD;
      about poor compliance among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture might be effective in treating UMUI. Previous research indicated that&#xD;
      electroacupuncture might be noninferior to pelvic floor muscle training plus Solifenacin in&#xD;
      reducing the urgency incontinence episodes of UMUI women. However, that study didn't focuse&#xD;
      on UMUI exclusively, thus unable to decide whether electroacupuncture is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of UMUI.&#xD;

    <description>ICIQ-UI-SF was a questionnaire developed by the International Consultation on Incontinence to evaluate the severity of incontinence and impact to QoL in the past four weeks. It contains four items: frequency, amount of leakage, impact of UI on QoL and a separate item to indicate the cause of incontinence. The score was the sum of the first three items, providing a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with a higher score indicating worse symptoms and greater impact on QoL.</description>
