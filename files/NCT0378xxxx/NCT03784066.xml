  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, prospective, pilot phase I/II study with focus on&#xD;
      translational research and on the evaluation of the biological changes that are observed in&#xD;
      sequential tumor tissue acquisition in patients with newly diagnosed advanced (stage IV) oral&#xD;
      cavity SCC. Patients are treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or Durvalumab + Tremelimumab (arm B)&#xD;
      after biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced resectable SCCHN of the oral cavity.&#xD;
      After surgery, the standard of care treatment is radiotherapy, and, depending on risk&#xD;
      assessment concurrent cisplatin. Patients will be treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or&#xD;
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab (arm B) during six additional cycles, starting from day one of&#xD;
      the postoperative radiotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durvalumab has shown activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Locally&#xD;
      advanced resectable cancers of this type represent a challenge, as the majority of these&#xD;
      patients still die from this disease in spite of surgery, radio- and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checkpoint inhibitors have recently proven to prolong life in recurrent/metastatic SCCHN, and&#xD;
      several new molecules are currently tested in clinical trials in this indication, including&#xD;
      PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 antibodies, either as single agent or in combination. These compounds&#xD;
      might represent a valuable treatment for SCCHN patients in the adjuvant setting, given the&#xD;
      favorable toxicity profile. Combination of Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibition) and Tremelimumab&#xD;
      (CTLA-4 inhibition) is currently tested in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, and&#xD;
      compared to Durvalumab as single agent, and to standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study both options, i.e. durvalumab as a single agent or Durvalumab in combination&#xD;
      with Tremelimumab, will be tested in a randomized fashion. Randomization would be used to&#xD;
      reduce selection bias, in a non-comparative study. Newly diagnosed patients with SCCHN of the&#xD;
      oral cavity, will be treated with a single dose of Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab&#xD;
      two weeks before scheduled surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients are first diagnosed with a resectable oral SCC, a biopsy is taken to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis, and surgery is planned. This standard practice thus involves sequential tissue&#xD;
      harvesting, both at the time of biopsy as well as the final resection specimen, making it&#xD;
      possible to observe hallmarks of immune response when patients are treated once with&#xD;
      Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab after confirmation of the diagnosis on biopsy, but&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
