  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a combination of 4 therapies, three of which are used to treat a single &quot;target site&quot;&#xD;
      of your cancer (such as a lymph node or a single tumor), and the 4th is given directly into&#xD;
      the blood stream (intravenous or &quot;IV&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiation: The target site --lymph node or tumor (the one what will be injected) --will&#xD;
           get two small treatments of radiation. Radiation is often times used to shrink and kill&#xD;
           tumors in patients with certain types of lymphoma, breast cancer and head and neck&#xD;
           cancer, however, the dose of radiation that you will receive --one dose on day one of&#xD;
           the clinical trial and one dose on day two --is 10 to 20 time less radiation that you&#xD;
           would receive for treatment of these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flt3L/CDX-301 is an immune cell growth factor, similar to white blood cell growth&#xD;
           factors (Neupogen or Neulasta) or red blood cell growth factors (EPO or Epogen) that you&#xD;
           may have received to help protect your blood cells previously. Flt3L causes your body to&#xD;
           make more immune cells, specifically a type of immune cell called &quot;dendritic cells&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Poly-ICLC is an immune cell activating factor. Its function is to turn on the immune&#xD;
           cells that have been brought to the tumor by Flt3L.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pembrolizumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is being tested to see if it&#xD;
           will allow the body's immune system to kill your tumor cells. Pembrolizumab is approved&#xD;
           for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult&#xD;
           patients with many different types of cancer including head and neck cancer.&#xD;
           Pembrolizumab is not FDA approved to treat patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer, as it has not been effective at treating these cancers when&#xD;
           used alone. While most people do not have immediate side effects when this medication is&#xD;
           given, it has the ability to cause side effects for.&#xD;

      Phase 1 and Phase 2 will occur sequentially:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is the preliminary safety assessment portion of the study, which will follow a&#xD;
      modified 3 + 3 design to assess toxicity. The trial would be held for review should there be&#xD;
      more than 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observed within the first 3-6 patients. The toxicity&#xD;
      of the in situ vaccine without pembrolizumab (ongoing and previous trials) has been minimal,&#xD;
      limited to transient febrile response to the intratumoral Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand&#xD;
      poly-ICLC, typically resolving with oral acetaminophen. As such, the primary objective of&#xD;
      Phase 1 is to assess the safety of the addition of pembrolizumab to this in situ vaccine&#xD;
      protocol. In Phase 1, patients will only be enrolled at the lead institution (Mount Sinai).&#xD;
      After enrollment of the initial 3 patients, enrollment will pause until all three patients&#xD;
      have completed cycle 1 of pembrolizumab (DLT evaluation window is 63 days from initiation of&#xD;
      in situ vaccine). During the pause, new patients may be consented and screened, but not&#xD;
      initiated on therapy. If 1 or no DLTs are observed in the first 3 patients, an additional 3&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. The regimen will be considered safe (in order to progress to Phase&#xD;
      2) if no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT. If two or more DLTs are observed at&#xD;
      any point in Phase 1 then accrual will be stopped for protocol review by Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board, PIs and sponsor for possibility of protocol amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will follow a Simon's two-stage design. This Phase will proceed only if toxicity is&#xD;
      acceptable as determined in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1/2 design: Patients will be enrolled concurrently into three independent cohorts, with&#xD;
      patients from Phase 1 evaluated within their subsequent disease-specific cohorts. iNHL, MBC&#xD;
      and HNSCC often have peripherally accessible tumors amenable to intratumoral injection, and&#xD;
      have all had relatively modest responses to single-agent checkpoint blockade, so are good&#xD;
      candidates for this novel combination. Patients will be enrolled regardless of the PD-L1&#xD;
      staining of their tumor. We will also enroll patients previously exposed to PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      targeted therapies either on a clinical trial or as standard of care (as for HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: iNHL including but not limited to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL),&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). This cohort excludes patients&#xD;
      with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and any other lymphoma determined to be&#xD;
      progressing rapidly by investigator (PI or site PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: MBC with peripherally palpable disease amenable to intratumoral injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C: HNSCC with peripherally palpable disease amenable to intratumoral injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Seven patients will be evaluated in Stage 1 of Phase 2 in each disease-specific&#xD;
      cohort, inclusive of patients enrolled in Phase 1. If no patient in a cohort achieves a&#xD;
      response, the study in that cohort will close due to a lack of efficacy. The first seven&#xD;
      patients in each histology will only be enrolled at Mount Sinai.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: If one or more responses are seen in Stage 1, enrollment of an additional 12&#xD;
      patients for Cohorts A and B or 11 patients for Cohort C will proceed. These cohorts may be&#xD;
      also be enrolled at collaborator sites (to be determined).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts A or B: If at least three out of the 19 patients achieve a response, the&#xD;
           intervention will be considered promising and worthy of further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: If at least four out of the 18 patients achieve a response, the intervention&#xD;
           will be considered promising and worthy of further investigation.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;

             interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment (roughly two and a half years&#xD;
             after enrollment).&#xD;

             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
