    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A most common liver cancer in adults is hepatocellular carcinoma. Other kinds of liver cancer&#xD;
      happen when colorectal or pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      if a combination of drugs helps people with these cancers. The drugs are nivolumab,&#xD;
      tadalafil, and vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if nivolumab given with tadalafil and vancomycin causes liver cancer to&#xD;
      shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 years and older with hepatocellular carcinoma or metastases to the liver from&#xD;
      colorectal or pancreatic cancer for which standard treatment has not worked&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of symptoms and ability to perform normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart test. Some participants may meet with a cardiologist and/or have another heart test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample review. This can be from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drugs in 4-week cycles. In each cycle participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Get nivolumab through a small plastic tube in the arm on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take tadalafil by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take vancomycin by mouth 4 times a day. They will take it every day for weeks 1 3, then not&#xD;
      take it for week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete a medicine diary of dates, times, missed doses and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, participants will repeat screening tests and will give stool samples or&#xD;
      rectal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their last cycle, participants will have 3 follow-up visits over 3 months. Then they&#xD;
      will be contacted every 6 months by phone or email and asked about their general well-being.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatment options for patients with liver cancers, including hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma(HCC) and advanced liver cancers are limited and take no account of the known&#xD;
           biological and genetic heterogeneity in these diseases. Median survival for advanced&#xD;
           disease remains poor at approximately 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody that is specific&#xD;
           for human programmed death-1 (PD-1, cluster of differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface&#xD;
           membrane receptor. Nivolumab has been approved by FDA for the treatment of HCC and other&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor which have been approved by the&#xD;
           FDA for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia&#xD;
           and erectile dysfunction, with a relative safe clinical profile. PDE5 inhibitors have&#xD;
           been examined in multiple malignancies and cancer cell lines for their direct anticancer&#xD;
           activities, for their&#xD;
&#xD;
      efficacy as chemo-sensitizers and for cancer chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral vancomycin is antibiotic that has effect on altering gut commensal bacteria&#xD;
           subsequently inducing a liver-selective anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aim of the study is to evaluate whether the immunomodulatory effect induced by PDE5&#xD;
           inhibitor and oral vancomycin can be enhanced by immune checkpoint inhibition in&#xD;
           advanced liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the Best Overall Response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) to combined treatment of nivolumab, oral vancomycin and tadalafil in patients&#xD;
      with refractory primary HCC or liver dominant metastatic cancer from colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed carcinoma highly suggestive of a diagnosis of HCC Or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed advanced colorectal or pancreatic malignancy with liver&#xD;
           involvement as dominant site of metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable lesion, accessible for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptable renal, bone marrow and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to undergo two mandatory tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed study is a phase II study of combined nivolumab, oral vancomycin and&#xD;
           tadalafil treatment in patients with HCC or liver dominant metastatic cancer from&#xD;
           colorectal or pancreatic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be delivered in cycles consisting of 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) until&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be seen in Clinical Center on monthly basis with disease status evaluation&#xD;
           every&#xD;
&#xD;
           8 (+/-1) weeks after start of study therapy.&#xD;

             with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or&#xD;
             phospholipid syndrome. Such diseases should be excluded because of the risk of&#xD;
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Of note, patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with&#xD;
        replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with&#xD;
        rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren s syndrome and psoriasis controlled&#xD;
        with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies&#xD;
        (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myocardial infarction or myocarditis within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Stroke within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are excluded because HIV causes complicated immune deficiency&#xD;
             and study treatment can possess more risks for these patients.&#xD;

             for a minimum of 3 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab s potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with nivolumab&#xD;
