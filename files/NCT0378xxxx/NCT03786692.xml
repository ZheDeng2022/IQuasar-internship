  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of most lung cancer cases, lung carcinoma&#xD;
      in never smokers account for nearly 20 percent of cases. Never smokers with lung cancer&#xD;
      typically present with different molecular profiles from that of smokers, which results in&#xD;
      prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular changes in NSCLC that have therapeutic&#xD;
      significance include mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and&#xD;
      rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These driver mutations typically&#xD;
      are present in lung tumors found in never or light smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC showed improved survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone,&#xD;
      12.3 vs. 10.3 months respectively. Results from the POINTBREAK trial demonstrated that&#xD;
      carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab is an alternative option to carboplatin + paclitaxel +&#xD;
      bevacizumab, with comparable survival but less toxicity. In recent years, immunotherapy has&#xD;
      emerged as a form of treatment that can lead to robust responses in a subset of patients. The&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown prolonged survival&#xD;
      in comparison to docetaxel in patients who previously progressed with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Thus, this study combines immunotherapeutic agent&#xD;
      atezolozumab with an ant-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, and double platinum therapy&#xD;
      (carboplatin and pemetrexed).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The design of this study will be an open label, randomized, phase 2 study in adult (≥ 18 years) male and female subjects with stage IV disease who have never smoked, irrespective of their driver mutation status, as well as subjects who have tumors that possess a driver mutation.&#xD;
The study will be comparing the four agent treatment group (Arm A) that includes carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab + atezolizumab versus a three agent control group (Arm B) that includes carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab for 4 cycles, each cycle lasting for 3 weeks. Treatment will be followed by maintenance in both arms that will include all agents except carboplatin. There is no crossover in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must either have tumors that harbor an EGFR mutation in exon 19 or exon 21,&#xD;
             or must be never smoker wild-types. Never smoker wild-types are defined as patients&#xD;
             with tumors without an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement, and are not harboring any EGFR&#xD;
             mutation (this includes exons 19 or 21, exon 20, and any other rare EGFR mutations).&#xD;
             Never smoker wild-type patients must have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in a&#xD;
             lifetime. Patients with an EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 may be included irrespective&#xD;
             of their smoking history. If tissue-based testing for EGFR mutation status is not&#xD;
             available, blood-based EGFR testing that confirms presence of a mutation in exon 19 or&#xD;
             21 is acceptable, and these patients may be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by CT or MRI, defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST&#xD;
