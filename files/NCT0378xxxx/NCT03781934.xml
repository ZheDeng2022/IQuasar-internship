  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicentre dose escalation/expansion study to assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of MIV 818 as either monotherapy or in combination with 1) lenvatinib, a&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a standard of care for the treatment of HCC or 2)&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. The monotherapy parts of the study will include patients&#xD;
      with various solid tumours that have spread to the liver, or alternatively originating in the&#xD;
      liver. Evaluations of MIV-818 in combination with lenvatinib or pembrolizumab will only&#xD;
      include patients with HCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in three phases. The initial phase, 1a, will enroll up to 12&#xD;
      subjects and include a total of one dose escalation per patient. Once pre-defined criteria&#xD;
      for starting phase 1b monotherapy has been met among the enrolled patients in phase 1a, the&#xD;
      next phase of the study will be initiated. Phase 1b monotherapy will enroll up to 30 patients&#xD;
      in a 3+3 design with interpatient dose escalations. All dose escalation decisions will be&#xD;
      made by a safety review committee that will meet regularly during the study conduct. When the&#xD;
      MTD has been established, the SRC will provide a RP2D for monotherapy. Phase 1b combination&#xD;
      constitutes an interpatient dose escalation to identify the RP2D for MIV-818 when used in&#xD;
      combination with 1) lenvatinib and 2) pembrolizumab therapy. This part of the study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 36 patients in a 3+3 design with interpatient dose escalations. Safety review&#xD;
      will be performed by the SRC to determine the RP2D of MIV 818 for use in combination with&#xD;
      lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. The SRC may recommend that the selected dose of MIV-818 is&#xD;
      further evaluated in up to 30 patients in the Phase 2a expansion part of the study.&#xD;
