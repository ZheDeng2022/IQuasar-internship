    <measure>Proportion of patients with a Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) pustulation subscore of 0 indicating no visible pustules at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 1.</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) relies on clinical assessment of the Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP) patient's skin presentation. The investigator (or qualified site personnel) scored the erythema, pustules, and scaling of all GPP lesions from 0 to 4.&#xD;
The GPPGA pustulation subscore ranges from 0 to 4 where:&#xD;
0 = clear;&#xD;
= almost clear;&#xD;
= mild:&#xD;
= moderate;&#xD;
= severe. A lower GPPGA pustulation subscore indicates a better outcome. A GPPGA pustulation subscore of 0 means no visible pustules.&#xD;
The proportion of patients who achieved a GPPGA pustulation subscore of 0 at Week 1 is reported.</description>

    <measure>Key secondary: Proportion of patients with a Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) score of 0 or 1 at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 1.</time_frame>
    <description>GPPGA relied on clinical assessment of the Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP) patient's skin presentation. The GPPGA total score was calculated by taking the mean of the erythema subscore, pustules subscore and scaling/crusting subscore. The severity of each subscore was assessed using a 5 point scale score ranging from 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe). The final GPPGA score is assigned as follows:&#xD;
0, if scores for all three subscores are 0,&#xD;
1, if 0 &lt; mean &lt; 1.5,&#xD;
2, if 1.5 ≤ mean &lt; 2.5,&#xD;
3, if 2.5 ≤ mean &lt; 3.5,&#xD;
4, if mean ≥ 3.5. A lower GPPGA score indicates a better outcome, with 0 being clear and 1 being almost clear. The proportion of patients with a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 1 is reported.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index for Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPPASI) 75 at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (GPPASI) provides a numeric scoring for a patient's overall Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP) disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin affected by erythema, pustules, and scaling and the severity of erythema, pustules, and scaling (desquamation) over 4 body regions (head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs).&#xD;
A higher score indicates a worse disease state, while a score of 0 indicates no disease. GPPASI 75 is based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an 75% reduction.&#xD;
Proportion of patients with GPASI 75 at Week 4 is reported.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a participant-administered single-item scale designed to measure skin pain intensity from generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) using a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. Overall severity of participant's skin pain from GPP is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal 100 mm scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (pain as bad as one can imagine).&#xD;
Change from baseline was calculated by substracting the VAS score at baseline from the VAS score at Week 4.&#xD;
Median and Interquartile range of the absolute change from baseline at Week 4 in the VAS score are reported. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Psoriasis Symptom Scale (PSS) score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Symptom Scale (PSS) is a 4-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument that assess the severity of psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The symptoms included are: pain, redness, itching, and burning. The symptom severity was assessed using a 5 point scale ranging from 0 to 4 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe. The symptom scores are added to an unweighted total score (range: 0 to 16). A lower PSS score indicates a better outcome.&#xD;
Change from baseline was calculated by substracting the PSS score at baseline from the PSS score at Week 4.&#xD;
Median and Interquartile range of the absolute change from baseline at Week 4 in the PSS score are reported. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) - Fatigue score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and it's impact upon daily activities and function over the preceding 7 days. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4 (0= not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much). To calculate total FACIT-Fatigue score, which ranges from 0 (extreme fatigue) to 52 (no fatigue), the scores of all questions except for &quot;I have energy&quot; and &quot;I am able to do my usual activities&quot; were reversed by subtracting the observed score from 4 (i.e. 4-observed score). Then, scores of all non-missing questions were summed, multiplied by 13 and divided by the number of answered questions.&#xD;
Change from baseline was calculated by substracting the FACIT - Fatigue score at baseline from the FACIT-Fatigue score at Week 4.&#xD;
Median and Interquartile range of the absolute change from baseline at Week 4 in the FACIT-Fatigue score are reported. A positive change indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
