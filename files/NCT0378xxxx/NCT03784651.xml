  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in European women. Patients treated for early&#xD;
      non-metastatic breast cancer comprise a growing group of survivors due to early diagnosis and&#xD;
      improved treatment. Many of these survivors experience adverse effects such as decreased bone&#xD;
      mineral density, derangement of metabolic markers (fat, glucose, insulin) and increased blood&#xD;
      pressure. Increasing risk of bone fracture and cardiometabolic disease (eg. diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      type 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify mechanisms behind cardiometabolic changes that may&#xD;
      be connected to the (neo-)adjuvant treatment. On top of this we hope to indentify potential&#xD;
      biological markers that can help prevent development of metabolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be recruiting 120 post-menopausal women age 50-70 with early breast cancer and 1-2&#xD;
      times a year for 5 years examine bone mineral density, body composition, glucose and fat&#xD;
      metabolism and nerve damage. A questionnaire will be used to collect information on diet,&#xD;
      physical activity and quality of life. Derudover anvendes spørgeskemaer til at indsamle&#xD;
      information vedrørende. This new knowledge will help clinicians start adequate preventive&#xD;
      measures to help patients avoid cardiometabolic disease secondary to cancer treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose and background Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Danish women, and has an&#xD;
      average of 4,750 new cases a year (1). Patients treated for early (non-metastatic) breast&#xD;
      cancer (EBC) comprise, due to earlier diagnosis and improved treatment, a large and growing&#xD;
      group of cancer survivors. However, many patients experience treatment-related endocrine&#xD;
      side-effects such as reduced bone mineral density (BMD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      hypertension increasing the risk of bone fractures as well risk of development of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic disease including Type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to understand the underlying physiological and molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for the chemotherapy-induced bone and cardiometabolic derangements to&#xD;
      identify novel disease mechanisms as well as to identify potential biomarkers to be used for&#xD;
      better prediction and prevention of metabolic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cohort of women (n=120) with EBC to assess (WP1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Bone metabolism, body composition, insulin resistance, neuropathy, bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) and lung function before chemotherapy, after chemotherapy and during five years&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Patients treated for EBC comprise, due to earlier diagnosis and improved&#xD;
      treatment, a large and growing group of cancer survivors. However, there might be unintended&#xD;
      complications associated with the treatment, since patients experience treatment-related&#xD;
      endocrine side-effects including an average weight gain of approximately 5 kg primarily&#xD;
      reflected by an increase in fat mass and a decrease in muscle mass and thus change in body&#xD;
      composition (2, 3). Besides less physical activity contributing to weight gain,&#xD;
      (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-estrogen treatment administered to prevent disease&#xD;
      recurrence, may cause sarcopenia, increased appetite, reduced basal metabolic rate and&#xD;
      altered whole-body metabolism (4, 5). Obesity is not only a risk factor for breast cancer&#xD;
      development but also a risk factor for recurrence of breast cancer (6, 7). In addition to&#xD;
      increased weight, several studies have reported increased fasting glucose, insulin and&#xD;
      adipokine levels, increased lipids, increased insulin resistance (homeostatic model&#xD;
      assessment (HOMA-IR)) as well as hypertension in response to chemotherapy (3, 5, 8, 9). All&#xD;
      together these metabolic changes may induce a prediabetic phenotype associated with increased&#xD;
      risk of developing cardiometabolic disease including Type 2 diabetes as well as cancer&#xD;
      recurrence (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with estrogen receptor positive early breast cancer may be sensitive to antihormonal&#xD;
      therapy. For postmenopausal women, a common adjuvant hormonal therapy is with an aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor (AI) for five years (11). However, treatment with AIs is associated with reduction&#xD;
      in BMD and increase in fracture risk due to accelerated bone resorption from estrogen&#xD;
      suppression (12-16). Previous studies reported the highest rates of bone loss during the&#xD;
      first year of AI treatment (17). Additionally, it has been shown that the increased bone&#xD;
      resorption and bone loss with regard to AI can be prevented and managed with lifestyle&#xD;
      changes, calcium and vitamin-D supplementation and the use of anti-resorptive medication&#xD;
      (18-22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) have an 88% 5-year survival, and if&#xD;
      hormone-receptor-positive EBC, this is even higher and underscores the importance of ensuring&#xD;
      that therapeutic interventions do not confer long-term morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying cause for the changes in body composition during chemotherapy has not been&#xD;
      well described and likewise has the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for the cardio-metabolic derangements not been described either. Understanding&#xD;
      the underlying causes and impact of treatment-related metabolic disease, will allow&#xD;
      clinicians to initiate interventions to prevent, that these otherwise healthy women develop&#xD;
      metabolic disease secondary to cancer treatment. This will in turn improve quality of life&#xD;
      and reduced morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Subjects Postmenopausal women age 50-75 years diagnosed with EBC stage I-III eligible&#xD;
      to receive (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy or other adjuvant antineoplastic treatments Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include prior malignancy, preexisting T2D or other metabolic disease. The women will&#xD;
      be recruited via the Department of Oncology at Rigshospitalet, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 120 EBC women (WP1) will be followed from time of diagnosis through treatment and&#xD;
      five years follow-up during AI treatment. Examinations will be performed either every six&#xD;
      months or once a year, alongside routine visits and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1 (n=120)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples (safety biochemistry, buffy coat (DNA), calcium homeostasis, bone markers,&#xD;
           glucose, insulin and lipid levels, adipokines and inflammation markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry (height, weight, waist/hip ratio)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy test by RR-interval-variation-analysis and vibration test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: food frequency (FFQ), physical activity (IPAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA scanning of body composition (GE Electric) and bone mass (Hologic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  App &quot;Bone@BC&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density (BMD)/trabecular bone score (TBS) BMD is measured at the lumbar spine&#xD;
      (mean of L2-L4), femoral neck and total hip on both sides using DXA (Hologic DiscoveryTM QDR&#xD;
      Series scanner). DXA accurately determines 2 dimensional BMD (g/cm2) and detects patients at&#xD;
      a heightened risk for osteoporotic fracture (23). The (unitless) calculated TBS is a novel,&#xD;
      readily available, non-invasive clinical technique based on DXA images of the LS that&#xD;
      provides a surrogate measure of the 3 dimensional microarchitecture of the skeleton (24). A&#xD;
      high correlation between the TBS and CT42addressed microarchitecture has been observed (25),&#xD;
      and the TBS is less influenced by the presence of osteoarthritis than BMD (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same laboratory technician will perform all analyses. According to the manufacturer, the&#xD;
      CV (coefficient of variation) of the total BMD is approximately 1% (Europe H. Hologic&#xD;
      Osteoporosis Assesment. Reference Manual. 2006; Document No. Man-00214Revision 006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone@BC app A newly developed app &quot;Bone@BC&quot; from RegionH that will be used by all women, is a&#xD;
      guide and data collection app addressed to women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant&#xD;
      anti-estrogen treatment. The app collects data on patient experiences (1. quality of life&#xD;
      measures i.e. mobility, power/energy, mood, social contact and 2. measures of possible&#xD;
      side-effects i.e. pain, dizziness, sleep) and from i.e. DXA-scanning, blood markers of bone&#xD;
      turn-over and other biochemical measures. The specific data collection is for patient use,&#xD;
      and can if approved by the patient, be part of the patient-caretaker-MD collaboration within&#xD;
      the confines of this research study. The Bone@BC app will, with regard to patients in the&#xD;
      study, only collect data for use in the study. The Bone@BC app has approved integration of&#xD;
      app data with Region Security Requirements and is an official RegionH App legally approved at&#xD;
      all levels (Nem-ID login, informed consent, approved by Datatilsynet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological material Blood samples: Blood samples are obtained via venipuncture and processed&#xD;
      at the central laboratory following routine procedures at Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five ml urine will be stored in the biobank for metabolomics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research biobank The biological material will be used for molecular analyses as described in&#xD;
      the present protocol. These analyses including statistics will take place in a 10-year period&#xD;
      after initiation of the project. After 10 years the biological material will be transferred&#xD;
      to a research biobank at Rigshospitalet for future metabolic research. Participants will be&#xD;
      made aware of this in the information material. The use of these samples would require&#xD;
      re-approval of the Research Ethics Committee of the Capital Region. The establishment of a&#xD;
      biobank has been approved by the Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Based on literature studies the large cohort is estimated to&#xD;
      include 120 enrolled EBC patients based on a power calculation of 80 finalizing the study&#xD;
      (drop-out rate ~33% at year 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects, risks and inconveniences During the examinations, there will be a temporary&#xD;
      discomfort when applying peripheral venous catheters (venflon). In addition, blood tests are&#xD;
      always associated with a risk of infection. All tissue samples will be excised by a trained&#xD;
      professional, and the research team has comprehensive experience with blood and tissue&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total blood loss at each examination will not exceed 20 ml. Radiation from the DXA scan&#xD;
      (DXA, TBS and Vertebral Fracture Assessment) is equivalent to 0.06 mRem and considered quite&#xD;
      harmless. In comparison, a conventional X-ray image of the heart and lungs has a beam volume&#xD;
      of approx. 30 mRem (0.3 mSv), and the annual background radiation in Denmark is about 300&#xD;
      mRem (3 mSv), corresponding to 0.8 mRem (0.008 mSv) daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for any unforeseen reason, doubt arises about the health and security of the subject the&#xD;
      study will be terminated immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Data security All personal information regarding the participants will be protected by the&#xD;
      &quot;Lov om behandling af personlige oplysninger og Sundhedsloven&quot;. The protocol will be&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki II, and has been approved by the&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency. Analysis of biological material can possibly take place in Europe&#xD;
      and/or in the United States. In such cases, the analyses will be conducted under the&#xD;
      receiving country's laws and regulations, and in accordance with &quot;Lov om behandling af&#xD;
      personoplysninger&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient files will be used to check standard biochemistry tests. In addition due to the long&#xD;
      observation period and the potential for relapse due to the underlying condition, it will be&#xD;
      necessary to check patient files to maintain the security of the patients. Therefore consent&#xD;
      from the patient will give the involved researchers access to the electronic patient files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Financing Senior scientist, PhD. Charlotte Brøns and professor, dr.med. Peter Schwarz are&#xD;
      responsible for initiating the research project. Neither have any conflicts of interest to&#xD;
      declare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation There will not be given any compensation to patients participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment All subjects will be recruited consecutively from the Department of Oncology, the&#xD;
      breast cancer section, at Rigshospitalet, Denmark until 120 EBC patients have been included.&#xD;
      All information given before consent is signed, will be to a researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication and dissemination strategy The scientific results obtained from the study,&#xD;
      whether positive, negative or inconclusive, will be written up in original manuscripts to&#xD;
      become submitted to peer-reviewed international journals in the field. The results will&#xD;
      furthermore be disseminated in oral presentations as well as in poster forms at relevant&#xD;
      national and international meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Before entering the study, all individuals will receive oral and&#xD;
      written information, and there will be a written consent to participate in the study. A&#xD;
      unique subject ID number will be subscribed to all participants to anonymize data. The&#xD;
      identification key (ID to personal information) will be encrypted and stored securely and&#xD;
      separately from the unique ID number on a secure database, to ensure that no information on&#xD;
      the participant can be assigned to the ID number. All data will automatically be backed up on&#xD;
      a secure server. Only the research team will have access to the data. Neither the absolute&#xD;
      nor the relative risk will be of unjustifiable size or of irresponsible character considering&#xD;
      the impact of the study. The participants will gain information about personal health status.&#xD;
      The current study provides an innovative and highly promising study approach to understanding&#xD;
      metabolic and bone changes after adjuvant cancer treatments in early non-metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, participants are covered by the insurance of Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
