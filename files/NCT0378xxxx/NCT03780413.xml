      The method &quot;Collaborative and Proactive Solutions&quot; (CPS) was developed by Dr. Ross Greene,&#xD;
      Harvard University, to understand and help kids with social, emotional, and behavioral&#xD;
      challenges. The underlying theory is that challenging behavior is caused by lagging cognitive&#xD;
      skills, commonly in the domains of flexibility/adaptability, frustration tolerance, and&#xD;
      problem-solving. Thus, challenging behavior can be seen as a form of developmental delay, and&#xD;
      the most effective way for adults to help the children and to facilitate interaction with&#xD;
      them is to understand the lagging skills behind the behavior and to change their own mindset&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD and autism belong in a group of overlapping neurodevelopmental conditions now often&#xD;
      referred to under the umbrella term of ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations). A common impairing problem in both autism and ADHD&#xD;
      - and in several of the other disorders in the group of ESSENCE (including Tourette syndrome&#xD;
      and other tic disorders) - is the marked inability to control temper, coupled with&#xD;
      oppositional-defiant behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPS-method has been evaluated by Ross Greene et al. in United States studies for&#xD;
      families, in schools, and in institutions for young people with serious behavior problems.&#xD;
      Our research group published the first Swedish study with the method in 2012, a small open&#xD;
      pilot study. Based on experiences in clinical work after that study our group reached the&#xD;
      conclusion that, in order for the intervention to be useful for families with severely&#xD;
      impairing ESSENCE, the CPS model needed to be modified. After a number of research meetings&#xD;
      and seminars, we therefore designed a new model, based on our CPS-experience, that we now&#xD;
      refer to as PR-ESSENCE (Problem Resolution in ESSENCE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial for approximately 130 children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 5-18 years, with neuropsychiatric disorders (for instance Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD),&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette syndrome, learning difficulties), children who have&#xD;
      been assessed at our Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic (CNC), and from the Habilitation Services,&#xD;
      Child Psychiatry Units or schools in the Göteborg region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Collaborative Problem Solving&quot; model was developed by Greene for the treatment of youth&#xD;
      with oppositional behavior, and is now called Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions (CPS). The&#xD;
      aim of CPS is to help caregivers and children practice and learn problem solving strategies&#xD;
      in collaboration. The theoretical base of the model is that problematic behavior is mainly&#xD;
      caused by lagging skills, especially regarding frustration tolerance, flexibility and problem&#xD;
      solving ability. The CPS model engages both the child and the parents in training, and may&#xD;
      therefore have potential to give long-term improvement of lagging skills in handling&#xD;
      problematic situations and to change the mindset towards strategies of mutual problem&#xD;
      solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPS model was evaluated in a United States trial comparing CPS to Barkley's Parent&#xD;
      Management Training program (PMT) in 47 children aged 4-12 years with ODD and affective&#xD;
      dysregulation. Outcomes were similar between the two methods in most measures post-treatment&#xD;
      and at 4 months follow-up. A recent larger randomized controlled US trial enrolled 134&#xD;
      children with ODD, aged 7 - 14 years, who were randomized to three groups (CPS, PMT or&#xD;
      Waitlist Control). Both treatment groups had equivalent results in treatment response and&#xD;
      remission of diagnostic status (50% were much to very much improved and no longer met&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria), and both were superior to the WLC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first Swedish study of CPS, published by our research team 2012, was a small open pilot&#xD;
      trial of 3 months CPS for 17 families and children aged 7-13 years, with ADHD, ODD and&#xD;
      explosive behavior, showed promising results. At post-treatment 53% of the children were much&#xD;
      or very much improved on global symptom and function ratings (Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression-Improvement; CGI-I rating 1-2), and after another 6 months when the children with&#xD;
      severe residual ADHD symptoms also had received stimulant medication, 81% reached CGI-I&#xD;
      levels of 1-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus previous research has suggested that CPS is an effective treatment for ODD in youth, but&#xD;
      effectiveness in samples of children with various neurodevelopmental disorders has not yet&#xD;
      been documented. Oppositional and explosive behavior is a major problem among youth with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders and the demand for treatment strategies is great.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiences from treatment of children with complex neurodevelopmental disorders - ESSENCE&#xD;
      (mainly including autism) have led the therapists in our team to make ESSENCE-adapted&#xD;
      modifications to the CPS model, particularly regarding communication, structure,&#xD;
      predictability, and focusing on the child's interests to facilitate interaction. We therefore&#xD;
      designed a new model, based on our CPS-experience, that we now refer to as PR-ESSENCE&#xD;
      (Problem Resolution in ESSENCE). During the early phases of this study, Dr. Greene gave&#xD;
      advice and supervision to our treatment team, and the whole PR-ESSENCE model would not have&#xD;
      been developed without this input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can the PR-ESSENCE model reduce problematic behaviors? Outcome measures are the rating&#xD;
           scales Swanson, Nolan and Pelham scale (SNAP-IV), Family Burden of Illness Module&#xD;
           (FBIM), Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), Clinical Global Impression-Severity&#xD;
           scale (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can the PR-ESSENCE model contribute to solve specific problem situations. Outcome&#xD;
           measure is a Problem Rating Scale developed for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can the PR-ESSENCE model improve psychiatric well-being and self-image in the&#xD;
           participants? Outcome measure is the Beck Youth Inventories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The present study is designed to investigate how well PR-ESSENCE works for challenging&#xD;
      behaviors in well-defined clinical samples of children with complex neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorders. Participants are children and adolescents aged 5-18 years, with any&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental diagnosis, and with intellectual level in the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After neuropsychiatric assessment and diagnosis at our centre or at the Child Psychiatry&#xD;
      Centres in Gothenburg 130 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years with complex&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e. autism, ADHD, learning disorders, dyslexia, tics, and&#xD;
      Conduct Disorder) and problematic behaviors are invited to participate in the trial. They are&#xD;
      randomized to a PR-ESSENCE treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives&#xD;
      PR-ESSENCE for 10 weeks. The control group receives 10 weeks of &quot;treatment as usual (TAU)&quot;&#xD;
      (that is the standard psychoeducation, support and treatment given to all youth after&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric assessment at our clinic), followed by 10 weeks of PR-ESSENCE. Outcome&#xD;
      measures are collected pre- and post-treatment, and after 6 months and one year. During the&#xD;
      PR-ESSENCE treatment period the parents and children meet the therapists at approximately 10&#xD;
      visits, at which they collaborate to find problem solving strategies, which they then&#xD;
      practice at home between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children and adolescents aged 5-18 years with neurodevelopmental disorders and serious&#xD;
           problematic behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intellectual function in the normal range, according to WISC-test and clinical judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants taking psychoactive medication can be included if the medication has been&#xD;
           unchanged for at least one month before baseline, and remains unchanged during the&#xD;
           treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bipolar disorder, psychosis, or other unstable psychiatric or medical disorder which in&#xD;
           the investigator's judgment makes participation in the trial unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The following measures are collected at baseline (pre-treatment), after the&#xD;
      treatment/TAU period (post-treatment), after 6 months (6-month follow-up) and 1 year&#xD;
      (one-year follow-up). To obtain results from different perspectives ratings from four sources&#xD;
      were used, i.e. ratings by independent blinded assessors, and by parents, children and&#xD;
      therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating of independent blinded assessor CGI-I: Scale for global rating of improvement or&#xD;
      deterioration of problems/symptoms (scale from 1-7; 1 very much improved, 7 very much worse)&#xD;
      CGI-S: Scale for global rating of problem/symptom severity (scale from 1-7; 1 no problems, 7&#xD;
      very severe problems)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent ratings SNAP-IV - rating scale for ADHD symptoms FBIM - rating scale of family&#xD;
      stress/burden ECBI - rating of behavior problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child self-rating Beck Youth Inventories: For rating of depression, anxiety, irritability,&#xD;
      externalizing behavior, and self image (child interviewed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist ratings Problem Rating Scale (in which the severity of the problematic situations&#xD;
      before and after treatment is rated)&#xD;
