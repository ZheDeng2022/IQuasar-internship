    <textblock>
      The proposed research, building on an ongoing AHRQ-funded research project to prevent&#xD;
      pediatric diagnostic errors in primary care (R01HS023608) and using a prospective,&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, stepped wedge design, will investigate whether 1) a quality improvement&#xD;
      collaborative (QIC) intervention without subspecialist involvement, 2) a QIC with&#xD;
      subspecialists and primary care physicians (PCPs) mutually engaged, and/or 3) a hub and spoke&#xD;
      co-diagnosis, co-management model where PCPs diagnose and manage pediatric hypertension (HTN)&#xD;
      with a supporting subspecialist advisor, reduce errors in pediatric HTN diagnosis and&#xD;
      management compared to each other and usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric HTN causes appreciable morbidity in pediatric patients and errors in diagnosis and&#xD;
      management are frequent and understudied, jeopardizing pediatric safety in ambulatory&#xD;
      settings. Additionally, the gap between the number of pediatric subspecialist providers and&#xD;
      the number needed for patient care continues to widen, and it is unclear how to best reduce&#xD;
      burden on subspecialists, improve PCP and subspecialist communication, and improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. This research team, with significant experience researching ambulatory pediatric&#xD;
      safety, conducting QICs and HTN interventions, identified six large pediatric practice groups&#xD;
      in rural, suburban and urban locations that are committed to reducing preventable HTN patient&#xD;
      harm, to testing the effectiveness of a QIC to improve PCP HTN diagnosis and management, and&#xD;
      to a hub and spoke HTN co-diagnosis and co-management model. The effect demonstrated by this&#xD;
      project using a rigorous research design and the new 2017 pediatric HTN guidelines, will&#xD;
      motivate pediatric clinics across the country to adopt these newly-identified best practices&#xD;
      to improve pediatric HTN care. Primary care pediatricians have an imperative to diagnose and&#xD;
      manage HTN and elevated BP (EBP) more accurately and earlier, and to improve interactions&#xD;
      with subspecialists to reduce the lifelong preventable harm that results from these chronic&#xD;
      conditions. This proposal, will identify a clear implementation strategy for rigorous,&#xD;
      evidenced-based pediatric HTN diagnosis and management, and highlight a model to increase&#xD;
      primary and subspecialty care integration that can be reproduced across other chronic&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary human subjects of this work are the physicians and staff within the primary care&#xD;
      pediatric practices and their associated pediatric hypertension subspecialists whose behavior&#xD;
      the QIC is attempting to change. In order to know if these practices and subspecialists have&#xD;
      changed their behaviors, we will look at patient data. To be included in the data cohort,&#xD;
      patients must have a blood pressure (BP) measurement that is elevated (&gt;= 90th percentile for&#xD;
      patient's sex, age, and height, or &gt;=120/80 (regardless of sex/age/ height) at a healthcare&#xD;
      maintenance visit or non-acute care visit (e.g. chronic disease follow-up visit). The&#xD;
      following patients would be excluded from the data cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior hypertension or elevated BP diagnosis. Patient can have prior elevated BP&#xD;
           measurements as long as no diagnosis has been made&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BP&gt;95th percentile + 30mm or &gt;180/120 or symptomatic patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior diagnosis of congenital heart disease, chronic kidney disease, urologic disease&#xD;
           (e.g. posterior urethral valve, vesicoureteral reflux) or organ transplant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously included in BP-CATCH data entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute care visit (e.g., fever, viral illness, asthma attack, pain in any body part,&#xD;
           etc.)&#xD;
