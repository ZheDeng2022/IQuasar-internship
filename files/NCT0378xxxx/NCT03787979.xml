  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of lumbopelvic stabilization on&#xD;
      hamstrings muscle stretching in individuals with history of low back pain suspected to have a&#xD;
      clinical lumbar instability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants between the age of 20 and 40 years with history of low back pain will be&#xD;
      recruited from Mahidol University using a poster posted at Faculty of Physical Therapy. All&#xD;
      participants will be explained the purposes, advantages, disadvantages and procedures of the&#xD;
      study by the researcher. The participant will be asked to sign an informed consent if the&#xD;
      participants are willing to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the written informed consent, the researcher, who works in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system including low back pain for 7 years and has received 3 training sessions on clinical&#xD;
      observation of aberrant movement, will perform 2 clinical tests including clinical&#xD;
      observation of aberrant movement patterns and passive straight leg raising test to identify&#xD;
      clinical lumbar instability, and measure hamstrings muscle length using clinical motion&#xD;
      analysis system. The researcher will also screen for exclusion criteria using a check list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who are qualified for the study, the participants will be asked to fill out the&#xD;
      demographic data and physical activity questionnaire. The researcher will perform additional&#xD;
      clinical examination including modified Thomas test, back extensor muscle strength test&#xD;
      assessed by a handheld dynamometer, Trendelenburg's test and lumbar stability test. After&#xD;
      clinical tests, lumbopelvic, pelvic, and lumbar range of motions during an active forward&#xD;
      bend task will be measured by using the clinical motion analysis system. These outcome&#xD;
      measures will be assessed for baseline (Pre-1). After baseline data collection, the&#xD;
      participants will be divided into 2 groups; lumbopelvic stiffening group (LS) or lumbopelvic&#xD;
      relaxing group (LR) by randomly generated code in a concealed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in LS group will stretch the hamstrings muscle in standing position with&#xD;
      lumbopelvic stabilization. Fifteen percent of the body weight will be used to standardize&#xD;
      stretching force. This force will be controlled by visual feedback from load cell. During&#xD;
      stretching protocol, the participants will be instructed to face the hydraulic table with the&#xD;
      hips square, maintain trunk straight up and look straight ahead. Researcher commands &quot;during&#xD;
      adjusting the bed up, please tense the lower back rigid&quot;. After that, hydraulic bed will be&#xD;
      lifted up until force reaches 15 percent of the body weight. Participant will perform 30&#xD;
      seconds/repetition for 4 repetitions with 15 seconds rest between repetitions. To ensure that&#xD;
      participant correctly performs lumbopelvic stabilization, the researcher will palpate at ASIS&#xD;
      and iliac crest to check pelvic motion during hamstrings muscle stretching. Pelvic motion&#xD;
      indicates loss of lumbopelvic stabilization. Participant will be asked to re-perform another&#xD;
      repetition. Our protocol is based on a previous study by DePino et al., 2000. Participant&#xD;
      will perform 30 seconds/repetition for 4 repetitions with 15 seconds rest between&#xD;
      repetitions. The investigators use 30 seconds because a systematic review suggests that 30&#xD;
      seconds is the most effective dose for hamstrings muscle stretching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the participants in LR group, the participants will be instructed to face the hydraulic&#xD;
      table with the hips square, maintain trunk straight up and look straight ahead. The&#xD;
      researcher commands &quot;During adjusting the bed up, please relax the lower back&quot;. The hydraulic&#xD;
      bed will be lifted up until force reaches 15 percent of the body weight. Participant will&#xD;
      perform 30 seconds/repetition for 4 repetitions with 15 seconds rest between repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, the participants will be reassessed for hamstrings muscle length&#xD;
      test, lumbar motion, pelvic motion and total lumbopelvic motion (Post-1). Because this study&#xD;
      uses a cross-over study design, participants will be asked to maintain the usual physical&#xD;
      activity for 2 days as a wash-out period. Then, the participants will be re-assessed for&#xD;
      baseline data (Pre-2), and cross-over to another stretching group (LS changes to LR, while LR&#xD;
      changes to LS). After completion of intervention, the participants will be re-assessed for&#xD;
      post-intervention (Post-2). These to determine the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stabilization&#xD;
      during hamstrings stretching in standing.&#xD;
