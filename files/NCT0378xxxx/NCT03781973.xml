  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with type 1 diabetes face particular challenges related to having a chronic&#xD;
      illness that requires daily intensive self-management and medical follow-up during a period&#xD;
      when their social, developmental, educational, and family situations are in flux. When&#xD;
      transitioning from pediatric to adult care, over a third of youth have a care gap of &gt;6&#xD;
      months. During this vulnerable period youth are at risk for acute life-threatening&#xD;
      complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, and for poor glycemic control, which confers an&#xD;
      increased risk of chronic diabetes complications. Gaps in care may be a result of&#xD;
      deficiencies in transition processes causing some young people to be poorly prepared for&#xD;
      adult care and dissatisfied with the transition process. Ineffective transition can lead to&#xD;
      decreased frequency of diabetes visits and an increased risk of adverse events in young&#xD;
      adulthood. Further, risk factors such as psychiatric comorbidity and behavioural problems in&#xD;
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes are associated with poor outcomes in early adulthood.&#xD;
      Quality improvement initiatives can be designed to optimize care processes such as referral&#xD;
      systems to adult diabetes providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall objective is to optimize care and outcomes for youth with diabetes as they&#xD;
      transition to adult care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To improve glycemic control in youth around the time of transition from&#xD;
      pediatric to adult diabetes care Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the fidelity and quality of a&#xD;
      quality improvement intervention designed to improve transition care processes and to&#xD;
      identify contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes.&#xD;

Data Platform: Medical record data abstracted from patient charts at the time of the final pediatric visit. .&#xD;
Quality performance feedback reports: We will generate centre-level performance reports. Centres will be able to compare their performance to that of all other centres and to achievable benchmarks.&#xD;
