  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral Raman data on the Investigational&#xD;
      Medical Device (IMD) compared with reference methods in terms of interstitial fluid samples&#xD;
      and capillary and venous references.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will visit the clinic for a baseline visit and two in-clinic visits. On in-clinic&#xD;
      days, subjects will attend the clinic in a fasting state. They will have inserted a Dexcom&#xD;
      and Freestyle Libre and a microdialysis catheter. At time = 0, subjects will be administered&#xD;
      a glucose rich drink and every 6. minut measurements will be performed. These include a&#xD;
      measurement on the IMD, microdialysate, FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom readings. Every 18. minut&#xD;
      a venous blood sample will be included and every 36. minut a capillary blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected. This continues until time = 180 minutes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Two in-clinic visits each of a duration of 5-6 hours are scheduled for each subject. Subjects will enter clinic in fasting state and will receive an oral glucose bolus. Glucose excursion is followed with frequent capillary and venous blood samples along with FGM and CGM readings and microdialysis. In parallel, optical glucose data from the investigational medical device will be collected.&#xD;
Optical glucose readings will be masked to the subjects.&#xD;
Collected data will be used to generate individual calibration models capable of predicting tissue glucose. Models will be validated on independent data sets using Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) endpoint measure.</description>
