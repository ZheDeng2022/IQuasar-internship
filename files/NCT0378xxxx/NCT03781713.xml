      This study evaluates the impact of prospective clinical surveillance with the use of triggers&#xD;
      to identify risk of adverse events with prompt adoption of interventions on the stabilization&#xD;
      time of critically ill patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 1999 landmark report, &quot;To Err is Human: Building a Safe Health System,&quot; the Institute&#xD;
      of Medicine estimated that avoidable errors in health contributed to 44 to 98,000 deaths and&#xD;
      more than 1 million injuries annually in the United States (1). Several years after the&#xD;
      publication of this study, numerous initiatives have emerged to improve patient safety in the&#xD;
      USA and the world (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important advance in the detection of adverse events is the use of triggers, algorithms&#xD;
      that use patient data to look for consistent patterns that predict the onset of an adverse&#xD;
      event (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institute for Health Care Improvement (IHI) has developed several tools with the use of&#xD;
      triggers. The Global Trigger Tool (GTT), developed in 2009, is a tool applied retrospectively&#xD;
      and proved to be effective in the detection of adverse events (4). It is an easily applicable&#xD;
      method for quantifying damage. Countries outside USA did not have the same result with their&#xD;
      application and questioned their benefit (5,6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective clinical surveillance tool, which consisted of direct observation by a&#xD;
      trained nurse, Forster et al (8) identified a high risk of adverse events and a significant&#xD;
      variation of risks and sub types between services. These results have suggested that&#xD;
      institutions will have to assess service-specific safety issues to define priorities and&#xD;
      improvement strategies in the design of care. This model was later used by Wong et al.(9),&#xD;
      who identified a wide range of factors contributing to adverse events. Despite the&#xD;
      prospective methodology, the impact of the actions instituted to prevent the events was not&#xD;
      identified in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective clinical surveillance with the use of triggers as a tool to identify the risk of&#xD;
      adverse events, with the prompt adoption of interventions and evaluation of the evidence of&#xD;
      the expected outcome may be the answer to improving patient safety, which remains a major&#xD;
      problem of public health 20 years after the publication of the reference &quot;To err is human&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of prospective trigger tools and near real time&#xD;
      interventions on the stabilization time of critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a surgical intensive care unit (13&#xD;
      beds), a medical intensive care unit (19 beds) and a surgical and trauma high complexity unit&#xD;
      (12 beds) of a tertiary hospital. The hospital São Domingos Ethics in Research Committee&#xD;
      approved the study (number 1.487.682).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients (18 years of age or older) who were admitted to one of the four intensive&#xD;
      care units were included in the study, in the period from November 1, 2017 to October 30,&#xD;
      2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are readmitted and those with length of ICU stay less than 48 hours were&#xD;
      excluded, since this is the minimum time required for the triggering of the trigger and its&#xD;
      corresponding intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once admitted to the ICU and meeting the inclusion criteria, patients were followed by the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary surveillance team composed of physicians, nurses, physiotherapists and&#xD;
      pharmacists. They conducted a daily active search for the triggers in the medical records. To&#xD;
      ensure the reliability of the data collected, each professional is responsible for a specific&#xD;
      trigger. If one of them is activated, the team member approaches the care team responsible&#xD;
      for the patient within 24 hours, and the data is also presented in the daily&#xD;
      multidisciplinary round. This moment is still used to solve all doubts regarding the&#xD;
      triggering of the trigger and its respective conduct or change in the therapeutic plan in&#xD;
      order to reach the expected result of each trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective trigger tool uses indicators that are capable of predicting serious&#xD;
      complications that increase the morbidity and mortality of ICU patients that could be&#xD;
      preventable. The triggers used were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute kidney injury (KDIGO) (10) - When triggered, the patient is classified as at risk&#xD;
           (1.5 to 1.9 x baseline creatinine or increase of 0.3 mg / dl), injury (2.0 to 2.9 x&#xD;
           baseline creatinine) or insufficiency (3 x basal creatinine). It is expected that the&#xD;
           risk can be identified early and that therapeutic interventions be undertaken in order&#xD;
           to prevent progression to renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delta SOFA (11)- The SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) of all patients are&#xD;
           calculated on the first and third days. The increase in this score on the third day&#xD;
           identify clinical worsening, triggering the trigger and requiring revision of the&#xD;
           initial therapeutic plan. The impact of this change is analyzed by calculating the fifth&#xD;
           day SOFA, which should be lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypoglycaemia (glycemia &lt;60 mg / dl) - Once this trigger is activated, it is expected&#xD;
           that the clinical intervention will be effective to prevent the recurrence of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia in the next 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Drug interaction risk D or X - When identifying a D or X risk interaction in the&#xD;
           patient's prescription, the assistant team is advised to make alterations in the&#xD;
           therapeutic plan in order to avoid adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Antimicrobial stewardship - Whenever an antimicrobial regimen is started or modified it&#xD;
           is assessed for its suitability through MALDI-TOF and sensitivity test. If there is no&#xD;
           microbiological identification, the clinical improvement, represented by at least two of&#xD;
           the three following parameters (leukocyte drop, absence of fever and improvement of CRP)&#xD;
           is taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data also were collected including age, gender, hospitalization category&#xD;
      (clinical or surgical), Charlson comorbidities index and score and SAPS 3 (Simplified Acute&#xD;
      Physiology Score 3) with its respective risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the tool on the time of stabilization of patients, two groups will&#xD;
      be compared: the first will be composed of patients who did not triggered triggers and the&#xD;
      second by patients who triggered triggers and had interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the stabilization time, the long-term risk rating of the Epimed&#xD;
      Performance software (Epimed solutions) will be used, which allows us to estimate the length&#xD;
      of ICU stay of the patients individually using more than 60 variables.&#xD;
