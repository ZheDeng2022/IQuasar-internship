  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease follicular lymphoma (FL) develops when the body makes abnormal B-cells. These&#xD;
      cells usually build up in the lymph nodes, but can also affect other parts of the body.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs can attack the cancer cells in people with&#xD;
      FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if copanlisib plus rituximab is effective at slowing the growth of FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with FL who have not had prior treatment for their disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of symptoms and ability to perform daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small amount of bone marrow removed by needle in the hip bone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Some scans will use a radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs in 28-day cycles for up to 13 cycles. Both are given as&#xD;
      an intravenous (IV) infusion. Copanlisib is given over about 1 hour. Rituximab is given over&#xD;
      several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 1 cycle, they will get 3 weekly doses of copanlisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next cycle, they will get 3 weekly doses of copanlisib and 4 weekly doses of&#xD;
           rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all other cycles, they will get 2-3 weekly doses of copanlisib and 1 dose of&#xD;
           rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat some screening tests during the cycles. They will give a cheek swab&#xD;
      and/or saliva sample and may have a tumor sample taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, some participants will have a few follow-up visits each year for 5 years,&#xD;
      then 1 each year. They will repeat screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other participants will be contacted by phone every few months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin s lymphoma (NHL) with a&#xD;
           highly variable clinical course across patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard frontline therapy for FL includes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with or&#xD;
           without chemotherapy that can induce durable remissions but is generally not curable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 20% of patients who relapse within 2 years of frontline chemotherapy have an&#xD;
           inferior overall survival; molecular profiles and gene-expression signatures can&#xD;
           identify patients at high-risk of early treatment failure but are incomplete and require&#xD;
           further validation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is critically important in FL; agents that&#xD;
           target PI3K show good clinical activity in patients who relapse early after chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copanlisib is an intravenous therapy targeting both PI3K-alpha and PI3K-delta isoforms&#xD;
           and is FDA-approved for use in adults with relapsed and refractory FL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab may produce deep and durable remissions&#xD;
           in patients with FL without the use of cytotoxic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising modality for monitoring therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the complete response (CR) rate after copanlisib and rituximab as induction&#xD;
      therapy for patients with untreated follicular lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically confirmed stage II-IV follicular lymphoma, grade 1-2 or 3a&#xD;
           that meet criteria for initiation of systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous systemic therapy; prior local radiation permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 study of up to 65 patients with untreated FL who meet standard criteria for&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will first be treated with a window of copanlisib monotherapy, followed by&#xD;
           induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who achieve a CR after 6 cycles of induction therapy will stop treatment and be&#xD;
           monitored with computed tomography (CT) scans and plasma assays for circulating tumor&#xD;
           DNA (ctDNA). Patients who relapse &gt; 6 months from the end of induction can be re-treated&#xD;
           with 6 additional cycles of copanlisib and rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who achieve a partial response after 6 cycles of induction therapy will receive&#xD;
           an additional 6 cycles of extended induction therapy with copanlisib and rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who do not achieve at least a partial response after 6 cycles of induction&#xD;
           therapy will stop treatment and be monitored with CT scans and peripheral blood assays&#xD;
           for ctDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who progress or relapse after induction therapy and meet criteria for salvage&#xD;
           therapy will be treated with standard chemotherapy and a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a confirmed histologic diagnosis of FL, grade 1-2 or 3a, according&#xD;
             to the criteria established by the most recent version of the World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) classification system. Pathologic diagnosis must be confirmed by&#xD;
             Laboratory of Pathology, NCI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage II-IV disease. NOTE: Patients with stage I FL who have been treated with&#xD;
             radiation therapy and have subsequently relapsed are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic treatment for FL with chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy,&#xD;
             or monoclonal antibody therapy prior to the first dose of copanlisib treatment.&#xD;
             Patients may have received prior radiation therapy only; radiation therapy must have&#xD;
             been completed &gt;12 weeks prior to the first dose of copanlisib. NOTE: Prior shortterm&#xD;
             (less than or equal to 7 days) use of corticosteroids for acute medical complications&#xD;
             related to sites of FL involvement is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet standard criteria for initiation of systemic therapy as evidenced&#xD;
             by presence of one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Development of symptomatic enlarged lymph nodes or spleen&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Development of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) or severe pruritus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Development of significant serous pleural or pericardial effusions (small&#xD;
                  effusions seen only on CT scans are not indications for systemic therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Development of bone marrow failure as a result of involvement by FL and not&#xD;
                  attributable to other causes; this would be manifest as a Hgb &lt; 9 g/dl, absolute&#xD;
                  neutrophil count &lt; 1 x 10^9/L, or platelet count &lt; 75 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Critical organ involvement, organ compression (e.g., ureteric obstruction or&#xD;
                  epidural compression), or significant risk of future organ compressions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increase in the size of lymph nodes on CT scans indicating progression of disease&#xD;
                  from previous CT scans&#xD;
&#xD;

             tumor sample (archival or fresh) must be available for performance of correlative&#xD;
             studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be greater than or equal to 8 years of age on day of signing informed consent. NOTE:&#xD;
             Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
             (copanlisib) in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): &gt;= 1,500 /mm^3 (unless due to involvement by&#xD;
                  lymphoma or benign ethnic neutropenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: &gt;=75,000 / mcL (unless due to involvement by lymphoma; transfusions&#xD;
                  not permitted)&#xD;

                  estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated&#xD;
                  formula. If not on target, a 24-hour urine creatinine clearance can be used to&#xD;
                  directly measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin: less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN OR (&lt; 3 x ULN for patients&#xD;
                  with Gilbert syndrome, patients with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies&#xD;
                  of the hepatic hilum or documented liver involvement or with biliary obstruction&#xD;

             of the informed consent form and 6 months (180 days) for WOCBP and for men after the&#xD;
             last administration of study treatment. NOTE: A woman is considered of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, (i.e., fertile), following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal&#xD;
             unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include but are not&#xD;
             limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A&#xD;
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for continuous 12 months without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using&#xD;
             hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. The investigator or a&#xD;
             designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly&#xD;
             effective birth control (failure rate of less than 1%), e.g., intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion,&#xD;
             vasectomized partner and sexual abstinence. The use of condoms by male patients is&#xD;
             required unless the female partner is permanently sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of patient to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known lymphomatous involvement of the central nervous system&#xD;

&#xD;
        NOTE: Subjects with positive hepatitis B serology (HbsAg or HbcAb) may be enrolled onto the&#xD;
        study but they must have a negative Hep B DNA Quantitative, HBV Viral Load result before&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 12&#xD;
                  months (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive drugs). NOTE: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of&#xD;
                  interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active hepatitis C infection. NOTE: Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
                  positive will need to have a negative HCV PCR result before enrollment. Those&#xD;
                  with a positive PCR for hepatitis C are excluded.&#xD;

                  requirements of the trial or confound the results or interpretation of the&#xD;
                  results of the trial and, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make&#xD;
                  the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement to continue on any of the medications that are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ compromise that, in the opinion of the PI, necessitates immediate cytoreductive&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
