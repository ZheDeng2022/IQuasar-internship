  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the landscape of gene mutation before and after endocrine therapy, to search for&#xD;
      molecular markers of endocrine therapy efficacy, and to explore the clinical value of using&#xD;
      NGS detection of ctDNA to guide precise endocrine therapy in patients with advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints included overall survival time (OS), adverse events (AE), and severe adverse events&#xD;
      (SAE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before treatment, the patients in the study group underwent NGS detection of ctDNA and&#xD;
      formulated treatment plan according to the test results: 1) those with ESR1 mutation and who&#xD;
      did not use fulvestrant before, preferred fulvestrant; 2) those with abnormal activation of&#xD;
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway signal, preferred mTOR inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy; 3)&#xD;
      those with HER-2 sensitive point mutation, preferred anti-HER-2 therapy combined with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy; 4) PDGFR mutation, preferential use of PDGFR inhibitors combined with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy; 5) no significant gene mutation, making endocrine therapy plan according&#xD;
      to the actual clinical situation. After 2 months of endocrine therapy, all patients underwent&#xD;
      NGS detection of ctDNA, and the efficacy was evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 standard. If&#xD;
      the efficacy evaluation is effective, continue the current treatment and re-evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy every two months; if the efficacy evaluation is ineffective (progress), then&#xD;
      withdraw from this study. The vital signs, blood routine, liver and kidney functions and&#xD;
      imaging examinations were examined at least every two months in the patients in the study&#xD;
      group, and the curative effect was evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 standard.&#xD;
