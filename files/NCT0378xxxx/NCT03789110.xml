    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for hypermutated HER2 negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab (Opdivo ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab (Yervoy ®)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is called an anti- PD-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor and is an antibody (a type of&#xD;
      human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to destroy tumors. Ipilimumab&#xD;
      is called an anti-CTLA-4 and is a type of antibody that works to prevent your body's immune&#xD;
      system from stopping to fight this specific cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses including but not limited to non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab may or may not increase anti-cancer activity by&#xD;
      further boosting the immune system. At this time, the FDA has not approved nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with ipilimumab for this specific disease although these drugs have been approved&#xD;
      for other uses such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how nivolumab together with ipilimumab,&#xD;
      works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The investigators&#xD;
      are also investigating whether there are certain DNA or protein markers in the blood or tumor&#xD;
      tissue that may indicate whether the combination will work in future patients&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer, with metastatic disease. Participants without pathologic or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from&#xD;
             physical examination or radiologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast cancer must be HER2-negative by IHC or non-amplified as determined by the&#xD;
             current ASCO-CAP criteria. If patient has more than one histological result, the most&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must harbor tumors with total mutational burden (TMB) of at least 9 mutations&#xD;
             per megabase assessed by a cancer-gene panel containing more than 300 genes, and&#xD;
             performed in a CLIA verified laboratory. Tests like Foundation One, Oncopanel (DFCI),&#xD;
             or IMPACT (MSKCC) are acceptable for including patients on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible,&#xD;
             at baseline and at day 29 cycle 1 (+14 scheduling window). Previously collected&#xD;
             archival tissue will be obtained on all participants. Participants for whom&#xD;
             newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety&#xD;
             concern) may submit an archived specimen (block or if not possible, 20 unstained&#xD;
             slides).&#xD;
&#xD;

             the metastatic or early-stage setting. Radiation therapy must be completed 14 days&#xD;
             prior to study treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In all cases, there must be no ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.&#xD;

                  participants with documented liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (using&#xD;
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula) for participants with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum&#xD;
             or urine) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause&#xD;
             other than menopause) and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries&#xD;
             and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female and male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception. For women, contraception is required starting with the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. For men who are sexuall active with women of childbearing potential,&#xD;
             contraception is required starting with the first dose of study medication for a&#xD;
             period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Examples of contraceptive methods&#xD;
             with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, established and proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit&#xD;
             ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
             The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during&#xD;
             study treatment. Initiation of bisphosphonate or RANKL agent is allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has&#xD;
             signed the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

             evidence of progression for ≥ 2 weeks after treatment, and no ongoing requirement for&#xD;
             corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging or CT scan) completed during screening. Subject must be either off&#xD;
             corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤ 10 mg daily (or equivalent)&#xD;
