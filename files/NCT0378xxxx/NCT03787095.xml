    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunotherapeutic activity of an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody (cemiplimab) in participants with HIV-1 on suppressive combination&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (cART).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunotherapeutic activity of an anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      (cemiplimab) in participants with HIV-1 on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) who have&#xD;
      plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts ≥350/mm^3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into three sequential dose-rising cohorts. Participants in each&#xD;
      cohort will receive infusions of either cemiplimab or placebo at study entry (Day 0) and Week&#xD;
      6, for a total of two infusions. All participants will also continue their non-study provided&#xD;
      ART regimen. Enrollment in the cohorts will be sequential, with the second and third cohorts&#xD;
      only opening after all participants in the previous cohort have reached week 12 and an&#xD;
      evaluation of safety outcomes has established that it is safe to dose escalate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend study visits on Day 0 and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20,&#xD;
      24, 28, 36, and 48. These visits may include a medical history, physical examination, urine&#xD;
      and blood collection, and adherence assessments. Participants will be followed for 48 weeks.&#xD;
