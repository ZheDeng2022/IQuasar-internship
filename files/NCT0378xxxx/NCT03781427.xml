      Aims: To explore the clinical effect on exercise tolerance and quality of life, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of pacing at higher outputs in patients with chronic heart failure and a&#xD;
      pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Heart failure (HF) is a very common condition of breathlessness or fatigue&#xD;
      associated with heart muscle weakness. In around 30% of people with HF, a pacemaker-based&#xD;
      treatment known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can improve symptoms and prognosis&#xD;
      by retuning the timing of the contraction of the heart. However, the effect of CRT is&#xD;
      variable and unpredictable, with around 1 in 3 of people obtaining no obvious symptomatic&#xD;
      benefit. One of the reasons for this might be that the pacemaker pulse does not activate all&#xD;
      of the heart muscle cells at the same time or at all. In order to provide the longest&#xD;
      possible battery life span, the default programming for all pacemakers is to provide a&#xD;
      stimulus at an arbitrary level above the capture threshold (at which the spike leads to&#xD;
      contraction). Whilst this is reasonable in a normal heart where the aim is to treat a slow&#xD;
      heart rate, in heart failure, where the aim is to retune all parts of the heart, it is&#xD;
      possible that this is not enough to provide consistent contraction of all heart muscle cells.&#xD;
      It is possible that providing a higher output electrical signal from the pacemaker will&#xD;
      activate more of the heart muscle cells immediately and thereby improve the contraction of&#xD;
      the heart. The investigators think that this might be important at rest, but even more&#xD;
      important during activity. This concept has never been tested before in a systematic manner&#xD;
      but could have large implications for people with heart failure and existing CRT devices&#xD;
      which could simply be reprogrammed to derive greater benefits for patients during everyday&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The proposed project has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 - 105 patients with a CRT pacemaker for heart failure but ongoing symptoms will be&#xD;
      invited to attend the National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Facility.&#xD;
      Symptoms, medication, hospitalisation information will be collected and a heart ultrasound&#xD;
      scan using the pacemaker to increase the heart rate will be done to describe the force&#xD;
      frequency relationship. Patients will perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of these patients, 40 will be invited to return for two further visits, to perform an&#xD;
      exercise test each time with the pacemaker programmed to its usual output or high output&#xD;
      pacing. At each visit, including the heart scans, the order of the programming will be&#xD;
      random, and neither the observer nor the patient will know how the device has been&#xD;
      programmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 - 70 patients will be invited to participate in a longer term study of whether high&#xD;
      output pacing is safe, well tolerated and has effects on walk time (on a treadmill) and heart&#xD;
      pumping function. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: high output&#xD;
      or standard pacemaker settings. In the high output group, the pacemaker will be programmed to&#xD;
      deliver the highest output possible or tolerated. In the standard care group patients will&#xD;
      have standard output settings.&#xD;

      ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS Increasing pacemaker left ventricular stimulation output is safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated, and increases acute and longer term exercise capacity and quality of life&#xD;
      through improved left ventricular function over a range of heart rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project consists of two closely related work packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS -WORK PACKAGE 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether high output pacing from the left ventricular (LV) lead in CRT&#xD;
           recipients acutely increases left ventricular contractility over a range of heart rates&#xD;
           and the baseline clinical features that predict this;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the proportion of patients in whom high output pacing is not possible due&#xD;
           to phrenic nerve stimulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether high output pacing acutely improves exercise time on a treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS -WORK PACKAGE 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether longer term (6 months) high output left ventricular pacing is&#xD;
           associated with patient orientated benefits on treadmill exercise time and quality of&#xD;
           life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether longer-term (6m) high output left ventricular pacing is safe and&#xD;
           tolerated and what effects this approach has on battery longevity&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Chronic heart failure and cardiac resynchronisation therapy Even when prescribed&#xD;
      optimal medical and device therapy, patients with chronic heart failure suffer a persistent&#xD;
      reduction in quality of life mainly due to breathlessness and fatigue on exercise. The origin&#xD;
      of these symptoms is multifactorial, but despite increasing appreciation of the influence of&#xD;
      peripheral adaptations on exercise tolerance the key factor in initiation and persistence of&#xD;
      the symptoms is impaired cardiac contractility both at rest and over the relevant heart rate&#xD;
      range. Whilst cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) provides a powerful adjunct to medical&#xD;
      therapy in the third of patients with dyssynchronous contraction, many patients remain&#xD;
      symptomatic despite CRT, prompting a series of pacing adaptations to try and improve the&#xD;
      technology further. Standard left ventricular leads now include four poles from which a&#xD;
      pacing stimulus can be delivered selectively or in parallel (multi-point pacing), and each of&#xD;
      the manufacturers includes automated software to adjust the intraventricular and&#xD;
      interventricular timing. Despite this, the 'response rate' in clinical practice, however&#xD;
      measured, remains solidly at around 30%. Although overall, these advances might be neutral,&#xD;
      more pacing electrodes, and automatic programs to measure and adjust timing come at a cost of&#xD;
      battery longevity. To counter this many systems now include automatic capture assessment&#xD;
      algorithyms that adjust the pacing stimulus downwards in response to successful LV capture&#xD;
      and upwards in its absence. These have demonstrated reduced average pacing stimulus&#xD;
      amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although device longevity is a key contributor to cost-effectiveness, battery longevity may&#xD;
      not be an important variable for people with heart failure, for whom the primary aim is to&#xD;
      maintain or improve their quality of life. Data from 76 consecutive patients implanted with a&#xD;
      CRT device between 2008-2010 demonstrate that over 60% did not survive long enough to require&#xD;
      a second device. Failure to survive to generator replacement was higher in people with worse&#xD;
      LV function, worse symptoms, and those in whom there was no symptomatic improvement. Our data&#xD;
      suggest therefore that in contrast to the situation for pacemakers implanted to treat&#xD;
      bradycardia, battery longevity might be less important in people with heart failure. Our&#xD;
      Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement group was indeed split along these lines.&#xD;
      People with a good quality of life want a long battery life, whereas those with persistent&#xD;
      symptoms were content to accept a reduced battery longevity if this would benefit their&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to determine force-frequency relationship in humans Most work on the Force Frequency&#xD;
      Relationship (FFR) including the expression and function of cellular mechanisms and&#xD;
      contractile responses has been done ex-vivo in myocardial strips either from explanted hearts&#xD;
      during transplantation, or from biopsy material. Assessment of contractility, and the FFR&#xD;
      specifically, in vivo requires a controlled increase in heart rate, and a reliable measure of&#xD;
      contractility which can be achieved non-invasively using cardiac ultrasound to measure LV&#xD;
      end-systolic pressure (LVESP) and end systolic LV volume (LVESV). These are divided by each&#xD;
      other (LVESP/LVESV) to give an end-systolic pressure volume ratio (LVESPVR). LVESP and LVESV&#xD;
      can be measured by invasive and estimated by non-invasive techniques. Following discussion&#xD;
      with our PPI forum to check acceptability, I selected an echocardiographic (cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound) approach. Using cardiac ultrasound, contractility can be estimated either from&#xD;
      2-dimensional images or by tissue Doppler imaging. Using 2D images to measure the&#xD;
      end-systolic volume index (LVESVi =LVESV/Body surface area (BSA)), and using SBP as a&#xD;
      surrogate of the LV end-systolic pressure one can then estimate contractility as SBP/LVESVi.&#xD;
      This surrogate of contractility has been validated against invasive methods. , Repeated&#xD;
      measurements can be taken and the slope of the FFR can then be calculated as the ratio&#xD;
      between SBP/LVESVi change from baseline / HR increase from baseline. Critical heart rate&#xD;
      (optimal heart rate) is the heart rate at which the SBP/LVESVi reaches the maximum value or&#xD;
      that at which beyond the SBP/LVESVi has declined by 5%. In a negative test, (one where there&#xD;
      is no increase in contractility with HR) the critical heart rate is the baseline heart rate.&#xD;
      Non-invasive methods require an assumption that LVESP is closely related to systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP). This introduces an approximation, especially in younger subjects, but mostly&#xD;
      there is a tight relationship between peripheral systolic and end-systolic LV pressure and it&#xD;
      will be assumed that any error is systematically distributed along the whole FFR within&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for increasing pacemaker output in people with heart failure Limited published data&#xD;
      suggest that higher output pacing can lead to improved timing of depolarization and better LV&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Whether this will translate into improved exercise tolerance or quality of life&#xD;
      with acceptable loss of battery longevity is unknown. This balance is likely to depend upon&#xD;
      individual patient factors and the degree of improvement seen within an individual. The&#xD;
      present project aims to provide information on efficacy in the whole population, and in&#xD;
      groups of individuals, whilst also allowing some description of the mechanisms of the effect&#xD;
      through examination of changes in cardiac function at rest and the force-frequency&#xD;
      relationship as a surrogate of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer several of these questions, and provide key pilot data for a larger&#xD;
      study that will explore the benefits of optimizing patients' pacemaker programming to their&#xD;
      individual situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Workpackage 1 Part A Introduction The present proposal will use&#xD;
      existing CRT pacemakers or defibrillators in patients with CHF to explore the clinical&#xD;
      effects of increased pacing output from the left ventricular lead on cardiac function and&#xD;
      exercise time on a treadmill and also to establish whether the changes in response to the&#xD;
      intervention relate to baseline clinical such as etiology, co-morbidities and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 105 patients with stable CHF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%and a CRT device will be invited to attend the&#xD;
      clinical research facility at Leeds General Infirmary, aiming for 90 full datasets. Each&#xD;
      patient will undergo and a resting echocardiogram pacemaker interrogation to check for&#xD;
      phrenic nerve stimulation and to establish options for pacing vectors. Demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data (including duration of heart failure symptoms), medical therapy, current&#xD;
      symptomatic status, resting HR and blood pressure will be recorded. Patients without a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test from &lt;6 months ago in their clinical record will then undergo&#xD;
      an exercise test to describe peak oxygen consumption and exercise time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy Medical therapy will be continued throughout. Although beta-blockers might&#xD;
      blunt the force frequency induced contractile response in the normal heart in CHF, HR&#xD;
      reduction might improve FFR counteracting the negative inotropic properties of ß-blockers.&#xD;
      Digitalis also has effects on the FFR by increasing intracellular sodium levels, which&#xD;
      enhances calcium influx, restoring the FFR. , which may explain the positive inotropic effect&#xD;
      of cardiac glycosides aside from their heart rate limiting properties. However, these agents&#xD;
      are essential in CHF and information gained in their absence would not reflect the usual&#xD;
      situation for most CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial rhythm Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia in CHF. Whether patients with&#xD;
      AF have an abnormal FFR is unknown. Patients with AF will not be excluded unless heart rate&#xD;
      is poorly controlled (&gt;80bts/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacing protocol Images will be collected at rest as described above, following which&#xD;
      randomisation will be undertaken by the Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit who will provide&#xD;
      a telephone service to determine the order of the programming. The unblinded cardiac&#xD;
      physiologist will then program the pacemaker device to a 'high' output setting (aiming to&#xD;
      extend the pulse width and increase the amplitude to the maximum tolerated) or a 'standard'&#xD;
      output setting (with no change to baseline settings). The patient and the echocardiographer&#xD;
      will be unaware of the allocation. Atrial pacing will be initiated in the AAI-mode at 45&#xD;
      beats/min (or the next highest 'round figure' above the baseline heart rate). After four&#xD;
      minutes, images will be recorded, and the pacing rate will then be increased in a stepwise&#xD;
      15-beat interval with images recorded after every four minutes. This step-wise increase will&#xD;
      be repeated until the maximum predicted heart rate as per the calculation by Astrand&#xD;
      (220-age) is reached. At this point peak data will be collected and pacing will then return&#xD;
      to baseline settings. Five minutes after the end of atrial pacing, a final set of images and&#xD;
      a blood pressure will be recorded. Angina pectoris will also stop the test and the heart rate&#xD;
      will be allowed to return to normal. After 10 minutes, this procedure will be repeated with&#xD;
      left ventricular lead output programmed to the other setting (either high output or standard&#xD;
      output).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP measurement Systolic pressure (SBP) measured using a manual blood pressure cuff and a&#xD;
      standard stethoscope will be used as a surrogate for end-systolic LV pressure. The SBP will&#xD;
      be recorded as the point where the first tapping sound occurs for 2 consecutive beats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image recording and image analysis Full baseline echocardiography will be carried out with&#xD;
      grey-scale and tissue Doppler images recorded in the two and four chamber views using&#xD;
      harmonics to improve border definition if necessary. Further images will be recorded at each&#xD;
      15 beat frequency increase during the protocol. Images will be stored in the 'echopac'&#xD;
      digital imaging system and analysed offline in an anonymous and randomised fashion (with HR&#xD;
      data removed). All echocardiographic analyses will be performed offline with the observer&#xD;
      blinded to the clinical status of the patient. This analysis will include a calculation of LV&#xD;
      end diastolic and end systolic volumes using the biplane discs (modified Simpson's) method by&#xD;
      tracing the endocardial border excluding the papillary muscles. An average of three&#xD;
      measurements will be used in the final analysis. The frame at the R-wave will be taken as end&#xD;
      diastole, and the frame with the smallest LV cavity, as end systole.61 The slope of the&#xD;
      exercise ejection fraction will be calculated with the linear best fit from the stress&#xD;
      ejection fraction values. The LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi) will be calculated at&#xD;
      each stage as LVESV/body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFR calculation The contractility at each HR will be calculated as previously described&#xD;
      using: [SBP/LVESVi] and a smoothed graph plotted for each patient to define peak&#xD;
      contractility, the slope of the FFR, and the optimal HR for contractility. The slope of the&#xD;
      FFR will then be calculated as the ratio between SBP/LVESVi increase (from baseline to&#xD;
      optimal heart rate)/HR increase (from baseline to optimal heart rate). FFR will be defined as&#xD;
      up-sloping when peak exercise SBP/LVESVi is higher than baseline at intermediate stress&#xD;
      values (Figure 2), and biphasic when an initial up-sloping is followed by a down-sloping&#xD;
      trend). In a biphasic pattern, the optimal heart rate will be the heart rate beyond which&#xD;
      SBP/LVESVi declines by 5%. The FFR slope will be classed as negative if the optimal heart&#xD;
      rate is the starting heart rate i.e. the slope is downgoing. The investigators expect&#xD;
      reproducibility to be satisfactory since this method of left ventricular volume calculation&#xD;
      during echo is widely used and accepted. In addition, the evaluation of end-systolic volume&#xD;
      has a higher reproducibility than end-diastolic volume from echo images, and only the former&#xD;
      will be used in the calculation. 10 randomly selected patients will be invited for a second&#xD;
      visit and image analysis will also be repeated in 10 further randomly selected patients to&#xD;
      document reproducibility of data collection and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Although the data collection is straightforward, the later stages&#xD;
      of the analysis will require complex statistical modelling. Pre-specified subgroups will be&#xD;
      patients with and without ischaemic heart disease, patients with and without type II diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, patients with and without an echocardiographic response since implant (improvement&#xD;
      in left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;5% OR improvement in left ventricular end systolic&#xD;
      volume index &gt;15%) and patients who do or do not feel themselves to have had a relevant&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms following their CRT implant. In this way it might be possible to&#xD;
      identify subgroups in whom the intervention might be most useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan As described, a measure of contractility will be collected at each heart&#xD;
      rate interval. These can be plotted against heart rate for each patient to achieve three&#xD;
      novel variables per patient (peak contractility, heart rate for peak contractility and the&#xD;
      slope of the FFR). A curve will be created for each individual with standard LV output and&#xD;
      then compare this with the same curve created from data collected during high output pacing.&#xD;
      The difference in the three key variables between the two curves will then be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further key secondary aim is to explore the relationship between key baseline clinical&#xD;
      variables: 1) heart failure aetiology (ischaemic/non-ischaemic), diabetes mellitus (Y/N), and&#xD;
      baseline ejection fraction (as a continuous variable) and the influence of high output left&#xD;
      ventricular pacing on cardiac contractility over the critical heart rate range that is&#xD;
      optimal for that individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a randomised placebo-controlled cross-over pilot study designed to&#xD;
      establish the relevance to patients of exercising with high output programming. The&#xD;
      randomisation order provided for the echocardiogram assessment (Part A) for this participant&#xD;
      will be used a second time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 40 consecutive attendees will be enrolled to provide 25 evaluable paired data sets&#xD;
      accepting up to a possible 35% drop-out rate from this part of the study due to intolerance&#xD;
      of the high-output setting. Patients will undergo two cardiopulmonary exercise tests one week&#xD;
      apart (but at the same time of the day) on the same protocol, during which their device will&#xD;
      be programmed in a random order to provide either high output pacing on the left ventricular&#xD;
      lead or normal settings. During the test, patients will score their symptoms. During each&#xD;
      exercise test the unblinded cardiac physiologist will monitor the electrocardiograph. Neither&#xD;
      the blinded observer nor the patient will have sight of the electrocardiograph. This&#xD;
      arrangement has worked well previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Data from the cardiopulmonary exercise tests regarding symptoms (from the&#xD;
      Borg scale) can be related to objective measures of ventilation, oxygen consumption and&#xD;
      workload. The difference in the force frequency relationship through high output pacing found&#xD;
      during echocardiography can then be related to the differences seen during the exercise&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: The primary aim of this work package is to determine the longer term effect of&#xD;
      high output pacing while also providing information on safety, tolerability and battery&#xD;
      longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a randomised, controlled parallel pilot study where the comparator&#xD;
      will be standard output programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 70 consecutive attendees will be enrolled to provide 50 evaluable paired data sets&#xD;
      (25 per group) accepting a possible 30% drop-out rate from this part of the study due to&#xD;
      intolerance of the high-output setting and longer follow-up period - lower because&#xD;
      participants in Workpackage 1 Part B that did not tolerate high-output pacing are less likely&#xD;
      to be asked to participate in Workpackage 2. Randomisation will be undertaken by the Leeds&#xD;
      CTRU after the baseline assessment, (echocardiography, exercise test, blood tests including&#xD;
      B-type natriuretic peptide, and pacemaker battery longevity), who will provide a telephone&#xD;
      service to determine allocation and balance critical baseline variables using minimization:&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (Y/N), aetiology (ischaemic/non-ischaemic). The unblinded cardiac&#xD;
      physiologist will program the pacemaker device to a 'high' output setting (aiming to extend&#xD;
      the pulse width and increase the amplitude to the maximum tolerated) or a 'low' output&#xD;
      setting (with no change to baseline settings). Patients will receive a telephone call at one&#xD;
      week to ask about angina and phrenic nerve stimulation and then again at 6 months when the&#xD;
      baseline assessments will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statisical considerations: While accounting for a drop out from the second test due to&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent of 30%, to achieve 25 paired evaluable datasets in each group, 70&#xD;
      patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: The primary analysis will focus on change in exercise time, with key&#xD;
      secondary endpoints of change in 1) quality of life 2) modified Packer score and 3) left&#xD;
      ventricular structure and function at 6 months. More complex analysis will assess whether&#xD;
      patients' response specifically to exercise time or left ventricular remodeling vary and&#xD;
      whether these relate to the degree of change of the force frequency relationship or&#xD;
      contractility measures. This will help to identify people who may benefit more from the&#xD;
      programming change. In this way additional information for the personalization of pacemaker&#xD;
      programming will be provided, since high output pacing might have an adverse effect on&#xD;
      battery longevity such that perhaps only patients with a clinically relevant improvement or&#xD;
      with persistent symptoms are put forward for such reprogramming.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Symptomatic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF&lt;50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CRT-D or CRT-P device in situ (&gt;6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Angina pectoris symptoms limiting exercise tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unstable heart failure symptoms (medical therapy changes in last three months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Poor imaging quality (details of patients excluded for this reason will be recorded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Calcium channel blocker use (these depress the force of contraction at all heart&#xD;
             rates)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled heart rate (either atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm (&gt;80bts/min))&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Co-morbidities significantly affecting exercise or symptoms such as severe chronic&#xD;
             airways disease or arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Haemodynamically significant aortic stenosis&#xD;
