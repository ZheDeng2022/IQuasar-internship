      In this feasibility study (non-randomized), the applicability of a new &quot;moving cell&quot; biliary&#xD;
      stents (by HILZO) in Klatskin tumors (bile duct obstruction) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HILZO Moving-Cell Stent to be examined here is a non-coated metal stent with a novelty.&#xD;
      The meshes have a diameter of 4 mm, which is rather small compared to most other stents. This&#xD;
      significantly increases the radial force and thus the stability of the stent. Furthermore,&#xD;
      ingrowth by tumors in the stent is difficult. The special feature is that the individual&#xD;
      meshes can easily be stretched to 10 mm without changing the stability of the stent. This&#xD;
      allows a second stent to pass through the first to another segment of liver.&#xD;

      ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is the standard method of treating&#xD;
      diseases in the biliopancreatic system and the treatment goal is achieved in a very high&#xD;
      proportion of the studies. The ERCP is based on the indirect imaging of the bile ducts by&#xD;
      injection of contrast medium, which is visualized in X-ray fluoroscopy. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      probing of the bile ducts by means of wire and direct interventions within the bile duct&#xD;
      system is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant biliary strictures are caused by various, usually cholangiocellular or pancreatic&#xD;
      tumors, whose surgical therapy is complex and often impossible due to advanced disease.&#xD;
      Tumors of the papillae, lymphomas and lymph node metastases can also lead to stenosis of the&#xD;
      extra hepatic bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of patients with malignant biliary strictures is poor, most are already&#xD;
      presenting with advanced disease because early symptoms are rare. In particular, the&#xD;
      above-mentioned cholangiocellular carcinomas and pancreatic carcinomas are often resectable&#xD;
      only in its early form with high recurrence rates. Furthermore, then only palliative concepts&#xD;
      are possible. Various studies have shown that stenting of the biliary tract with drainage of&#xD;
      more than 50% of the liver volume improves survival. Metal stents seem to be superior to&#xD;
      plastic stents at a slightly higher cholangitis rate. It is therefore considered standard&#xD;
      therapy to palliatively treat these patients with more than 3 months of life expectancy using&#xD;
      a metal stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of stents are currently in use, plastic stents and self-expanding metal stents&#xD;
      (SEMS). These in turn are coated (cSEMS) and uncoated (uSEMS). In distal malignant stenosis,&#xD;
      both cSEMS and uSEMS can be used, with a higher patency rate for cSEMS and a longer duration&#xD;
      of uSEMS retention. The disadvantage of the uSEMS is the tumor ingrowth in the stents and the&#xD;
      possibility of re-stenosis. Various studies have shown that metal stents are associated with&#xD;
      better bile duct drainage and better retention time compared to plastic stents and have fewer&#xD;
      early complications, however, a consensus regarding a survival advantage with metal stents&#xD;
      has not yet been substantiated, with the data showing a positive trend. Since metal stents,&#xD;
      unlike plastic stents, do not need to be changed, a significant advantage for the patient is&#xD;
      the significant reduction in endoscopic examinations and associated hospitalization and&#xD;
      complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HILZO Moving-Cell Stent to be examined here is a non-coated metal stent with a novelty.&#xD;
      The meshes have a diameter of 4 mm, which is rather small compared to most other stents. This&#xD;
      significantly increases the radial force and thus the stability of the stent. Furthermore,&#xD;
      ingrowth by tumors in the stent is difficult. The special feature is that the individual&#xD;
      meshes can easily be stretched to 10 mm without changing the stability of the stent. This&#xD;
      allows a second stent to pass through the first to another segment of liver. Previous metal&#xD;
      stents could previously only be placed side by side in the common bile duct, thereby limiting&#xD;
      the number of stents as a function of the gait and the stents can develop worse in the main&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
