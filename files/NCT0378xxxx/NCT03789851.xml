  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is widely used as an efficient breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
      Ideally, a pathological complete remission (pCR) can be achieved. With improvements in&#xD;
      molecular typing guided NAC and targeted therapies, there has been dramatic improvement in&#xD;
      pCR rates, especially among triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      positive breast cancers. Rates of pCR in these groups of patients can reach 60% or higher.&#xD;
      NAC has significantly promoted the loco-regional de-escalating treatment of breast cancer,&#xD;
      and the need for breast surgery in NAC cases with pCR has been questioned, especially in&#xD;
      patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with whole breast radiotherapy. The main&#xD;
      impediments for potential elimination of breast surgery have been the fact that conventional&#xD;
      and functional breast imaging techniques are incapable of accurate prediction of residual&#xD;
      disease. However, imaging-guided minimally invasive biopsy (MIB) techniques might have the&#xD;
      potential to overcome this impediment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design and begin a prospective one-armed clinical study to explore the&#xD;
      accuracy of MIB in predicting breast pCR after NAC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical routine surgical treatment follows the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However,&#xD;
      recent studies have demonstrated that shrinking tumors need less surgical treatment&#xD;
      indicating that patients with pCR could potentially be spared of surgery in the future.&#xD;
      However, up to now, prediction of pCR after NACT is only moderately accurate. This&#xD;
      prospective, monocenter diagnostic trial aims to explore if minimal invasive biopsies (MIB)&#xD;
      might overcome this diagnostic challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From June 1st, 2017 to June 15th, 2019 the investigators performed ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      multipoint core needle biopsy (CNB) on 50 breast cancer patients after NAC and directly after&#xD;
      surgery. To analyse CNB pathologically results were categorized as follows: residual vital&#xD;
      tumor cells (invasive, in situ, both, lymphangiosis carcinomatosous) present, (significant&#xD;
      parts of) the tumor bed present, neither vital tumor cells nor (significant parts of) the&#xD;
      tumor bed (indicating a non representative VAB). The results were compared to those of the&#xD;
      pathological examination of surgical specimen.&#xD;

    <description>The negative predictive value (NPV) will be calculated as the quotient of the number of cases with pCR in CNB and in surgical specimen (= true negative result), divided by the total number of cases with pCR in CNB. Residual tumor is defined as a positive result; in surgical specimen as well as in CNB.</description>

    <description>Because the ultrasound was unable to accurately position the marker clip, I125 coud be placed at the position of the marker clip under the guidance of preoperative mammography. The gamma detector was used to locate the tumor bed to guide the ultrasound-guided multi-point CNB. Ultrasound-guided multipoint CNB was used directly after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy. Centering on the marker clip, the range of 0.5 cm was the first area, and then the range of 0.5 cm was the second area, and so on, until the extent of the expansion reached the long diameter of the original tumor, and 4 pieces were uniformly taken in each area.</description>
