    <textblock>
      MULTISARC is a randomized multicenter study assessing whether high throughput molecular&#xD;
      analysis (next generation sequencing exome - NGS) is feasible in advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      soft-tissue sarcoma patients, that is, whether NGS can be conducted for a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients, with results available within reasonnable delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, MULTISARC aims to assess efficacy of an innovative treatment strategy guided by&#xD;
      high throughput molecular analysis (next generation sequencing exome, RNASeq [NGS]) in&#xD;
      patients with Advanced/metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas. At the end of first-line treatment,&#xD;
      participant's tumor profile of experimental Arm NGS (treatment strategy based on NGS results)&#xD;
      will be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board which aims at discussing the genomic&#xD;
      profiles and at providing a therapeutic decision for each participant. Participants for whom&#xD;
      a targetable genomic alteration has been identified will be proposed to enter in one of the&#xD;
      subsequent phase II single-arm sub-trial.&#xD;

      Screening phase: frozen tumor sample (archived or newly obtained) and blood sample will be&#xD;
      used for genetic profiling. Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the randomized&#xD;
      phase when all genetic material have been received by the Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization phase: the randomization will allocate the following arms with a ratio 1:1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  experimental Arm NGS : treatment strategy based on NGS results [exome, RNASeq]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard Arm No NGS: treatment strategy not based on NGS (Note that for these&#xD;
           participants and under specific conditions, subsequent NGS analyses may be allowed&#xD;
           within the scope of the trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-arm phase II sub-trial: at the end of the first-line treatment and regardless of tumor&#xD;
      response as per RECIST v1.1, patients randomized in Arm NGS and for whom a targetable&#xD;
      alteration has been identified by the Molecular Tumor Board will be considered as&#xD;
      pre-eligible for the targeted sub-study. The mandatory post-chemotherapy wash-out period of&#xD;
      21 days will provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations.&#xD;
