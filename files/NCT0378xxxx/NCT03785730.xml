  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies have questioned the necessity of restoring cavitated carious lesion on&#xD;
      primary teeth, once the control of biofilm is the most important factor to arrest these&#xD;
      lesions. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the survival of teeth treated with a&#xD;
      non-restorative cavity control (NRCC) compared to resin composite restorations (RCR) on&#xD;
      proximal carious lesion in anterior primary teeth, as well as the impact of these treatments&#xD;
      on patient-centered outcomes. Methods: A randomized clinical trial with two parallels arms&#xD;
      (1:1) will be conducted. Children between 3 and 6 years old will be selected from the Center&#xD;
      of Clinic Research of Pediatric Dentistry of Ibirapuera University (UNIB), a dental trailer&#xD;
      (FOUSP) located on Educational Complex Professor Carlos Osmarinho de Lima, the Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry Clinic of Santa Cecília University and from the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of&#xD;
      University Center UNINOVAFAPI. One hundred and forty-eight teeth will be randomly distributed&#xD;
      in two experimental groups: (1) Selective removal of carious tissue and RCR; or (2) NRCC&#xD;
      through cavity enlargement using metallic sandpaper. The primary outcome will be tooth&#xD;
      survival after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The duration and the cost of dental treatments will&#xD;
      be considered for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the evaluated treatments. The&#xD;
      discomfort reported by the participants will be measured after each treatment using the FIS&#xD;
      scale. The participants' satisfaction and perception of the parents/legal guardians will be&#xD;
      evaluated through questionnaires. For the primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier's survival and&#xD;
      Long-Rank test will be used for comparison between the two groups. All the variables will be&#xD;
      modeled by Cox regression with shared fragility. Significance will be considered at 5%.&#xD;

      This non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial, with two parallel groups with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio, was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Ibirapuera&#xD;
      (UNIB). The other centers involved are considered co-participants (Centro Universitário do&#xD;
      Norte - Uninorte , Centro Universitário Uninovafapi - UNINOVAFAPI, and School of Dentistry&#xD;
      from the University of Sao Paulo - FOUSP). Children aged 3 to 6 years with at least one&#xD;
      proximal cavitated lesion on anterior primary teeth will be selected from the Clinical&#xD;
      Pediatric Research Center. Teeth will be randomly allocated to selective removal of carious&#xD;
      tissue and resin composite restoration (RCR) or NRCC. Tooth survival after two years of&#xD;
      follow-up will be the primary outcome and cost-effectiveness, satisfaction, and discomfort&#xD;
      reported by participants and parents/guardians' perception will be the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Only patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be included in the study after the&#xD;
      legal guardians sign the informed consent form and the child consents to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Parents perception of the treatments will be evaluated through a questionnaire - &quot;Child's and parent's questionnaire about teeth appearance&quot; - with possible answers varying from very satisfied until insatisfied. After the questionnaire is applied for the parents/guardians, the anwsers will bem transformed in scores 1 to 5, in according the original paper that validated the questionnaire. Higher scores mean a worse perception.</description>
