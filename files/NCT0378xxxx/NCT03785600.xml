  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability in the Veteran population, often&#xD;
      resulting in chronic pain and sleep disturbances, among other issues. Extensive&#xD;
      rehabilitative efforts are usually required and often prevent return to the workforce and&#xD;
      community. Disturbed sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are among the most pervasive and&#xD;
      enduring problems after TBI, which the investigators hypothesize is a significant contributor&#xD;
      to these functional impairments and an impediment toward rehabilitation. Thus, this research&#xD;
      aims to enhance sleep quality as a means to reduce pain and improve quality of life and&#xD;
      functional outcome measures in Veterans with TBI. The investigators predict that the proposed&#xD;
      intervention, morning bright light therapy, if found effective, will be cost-effective,&#xD;
      rapidly deployable, and highly accepted by Veterans with TBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      On Administrative Hold - COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year ~2.5 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Also a prominent&#xD;
      general public health issue, TBI is particularly prevalent in Veterans, with 60-80% reporting&#xD;
      a history of TBI. Over 80% of all TBI are categorized as mild TBI (mTBI), which is associated&#xD;
      with a myriad of short- and long-term complications. Two of the principal complicating&#xD;
      factors associated with mTBI are sleep-wake disturbances (e.g., insomnia, excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders) and chronic pain, including headache and&#xD;
      diffuse/global pain. Sleep-wake disturbances and chronic pain have an independent prevalence&#xD;
      of ~70%, individually impair quality of life, impede effective rehabilitative therapies, and&#xD;
      have staggering functional and economic impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is a strong bidirectional relationship between sleep-wake disturbances and&#xD;
      pain such that impaired sleep exacerbates pain, which leads to greater impairments in sleep&#xD;
      and worse pain. This vicious cycle between sleep disturbances and pain, which is a&#xD;
      particularly prevalent and detrimental condition in Veterans with chronic mTBI, represents a&#xD;
      central challenge precluding effective treatment and ultimately, improving Veteran quality of&#xD;
      life. Although there are pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain,&#xD;
      the presence of TBI significantly complicates the effectiveness of these treatment options,&#xD;
      and have significant adverse effects (e.g., long-term prescription opioid dependence, misuse,&#xD;
      or overdose). The investigators believe there is profound potential to intervene at the sleep&#xD;
      level, and, by improving sleep quality, enable Veterans with chronic mTBI to better manage&#xD;
      their pain and end this vicious cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to apply a sleep intervention to improve chronic pain in Veterans with&#xD;
      mTBI. The investigators propose to use morning bright light therapy (MBLT), a readily&#xD;
      deployable, cost-effective, non-pharmacologic, and home-based sleep intervention, to improve&#xD;
      sleep-wake disturbances and therefore ameliorate chronic pain and improve quality of life in&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic mTBI. Outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up time point. The central hypothesis is that MBLT will improve sleep quality&#xD;
      and ameliorate pain, resulting in improved quality of life in Veterans with chronic mTBI.&#xD;
