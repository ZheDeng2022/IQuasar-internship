      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease Lassa fever mostly affects people in Western Africa. It is very similar to other&#xD;
      diseases that cause fever, like malaria and yellow fever. People get Lassa fever from mice&#xD;
      infected with Lassa virus. It can also be spread from body fluids of people with the disease.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about this virus in Mali so they can develop better tools to&#xD;
      diagnose and prevent it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out how many people in certain areas of southern Mali have ever had Lassa fever and&#xD;
      count how many people get the disease every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 6 months to 99 years who live in certain areas of Mali&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are could become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions about their age, if they have ever had a fever, and if&#xD;
      they have ever seen mice in or around their home. This will take about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample using a needle in a vein in the arm. Young children&#xD;
      will give it by pricking a finger or heel with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a fever illness will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give&#xD;
      blood and nasal swabs 3 times over 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to come back 1 time each year for up to 3 more years to take&#xD;
      another sample of blood and answer more questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In West Africa, as many as 300,000 people are infected annually with Lassa virus (LASV),&#xD;
      resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths. Most commonly, human infection comes from contact&#xD;
      with infected rodent hosts (Mastomys natalensis), or ingestion or inhalation of virus-laden&#xD;
      particles. Person-to-person transmission is also well documented and can cause outbreaks,&#xD;
      especially in nosocomial settings. Infection in pregnancy, especially the third trimester, is&#xD;
      particularly severe, with maternal mortality rates estimated at 20% and fetal mortality rates&#xD;
      nearing 100%. A survey of rodents captured in the village of Soromba (rural commune of&#xD;
      Sibirila, district of Bougouni, Mali) found that 25% of M. natalensis had evidence of LASV&#xD;
      infection. A 2015 study of LASV infection in the human populations of this region showed&#xD;
      seroprevalence of 33.2% and annual incidence rate of 6.3% in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this serosurvey study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of human&#xD;
      exposure to LASV in the administrative districts of Bougouni, Yanfolila, and Kolondieba in&#xD;
      southern Mali. The study involves 2 separate sub-studies. Study 1 is a cross-sectional&#xD;
      serosurvey of residents of the general population selected from a census. The study will&#xD;
      follow up to 500 participants at each of 4 study sites (Fakola, Bamba, Filamana, and&#xD;
      Guelelinkoro). Participants will be asked to give blood samples at baseline and annually for&#xD;
      3 years. Study 2 is a clinic-based serosurvey conducted at local health centers following up&#xD;
      to 500 participants per year at each of the 4 study sites (Fakola, Bamba, Filamana, and&#xD;
      Guelelinkoro). Patients who report with febrile illness suggestive of Lassa fever will be&#xD;
      asked to give blood and nasal swab samples, then return for follow-up visits 5 and 21 days&#xD;
      later for clinical consultation and additional blood and swab collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with free medical treatment according to local standard of&#xD;
      care as needed for the duration of the study. They will be followed passively between study&#xD;
      visits and instructed to report to their local health center if they have a fever. Individual&#xD;
      participation for both studies will last through a common end date, up to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and nasal swab samples will be used to identify history of or current LASV infection&#xD;
      and for exploratory studies into the biochemistry and pathophysiology of LASV infection.&#xD;
      Elucidating the prevalence of LASV infection in the populations of southern Mali may help&#xD;
      Malian authorities improve surveillance, and additional research may help develop diagnostics&#xD;
      and treatment.&#xD;
