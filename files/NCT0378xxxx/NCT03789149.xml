    <textblock>
      Brain metastases (BM) are the most prevalent tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), with&#xD;
      a ratio of 10: 1 in relation to primary tumors. In prospective studies, whole-brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy (WBRT) reduced the risk of local recurrence after resection of brain metastases&#xD;
      from 46-59% to 10-28%. Furthermore, WBRT reduces the incidence of new metastases and death&#xD;
      from disease, but no apparent improvement in overall survival (OS). Due to the potential&#xD;
      neurocognitive effects associated with WBRT compared to isolated focal approach, several&#xD;
      authors have suggested delaying WBRT and perform focal adjuvant RT after resection of&#xD;
      isolated BM. In this context, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in the cavity after&#xD;
      resection of BM may be an appealing option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate local control (LC) and the control of&#xD;
      brain disease (LC associated with the absence of new distant BM) after IORT for one&#xD;
      completely resected supratentorial BM in the presence of up to 10 lesions suggestive of BM.&#xD;

      Brain metastases (BM) are the most prevalent tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), with&#xD;
      a ratio of 10: 1 in relation to primary tumors. This type of metastasis occurs in 20-40% of&#xD;
      cancer patients and are related to significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prospective studies, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) reduced the risk of local recurrence&#xD;
      after resection of brain metastases from 46-59% to 10-28%. Furthermore, WBRT reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of new metastases and death from disease, but no apparent improvement in overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). Due to the potential neurocognitive effects associated with WBRT compared to&#xD;
      isolated focal approach, several authors have suggested delaying WBRT and perform focal&#xD;
      adjuvant RT after resection of isolated BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The utilization of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in the cavity after resection of&#xD;
      primary or BM has been described in the literature, the majority of reports describes&#xD;
      performing brachytherapy with iodine seeds or interstitial radiosurgery. However, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of information regarding the use of IORT with low energy X-ray for focal treatment&#xD;
      after resection of brain BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are evaluate local control (LC), the control of brain disease in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic brain disease (up to 10 lesions) submitted to focal IORT to an&#xD;
      isolated surgical cavity, evaluate overall survival (OS), evaluate the frequency of radiation&#xD;
      necrosis and correlate the prognostic factors related to the patient with OS and the&#xD;
      parameters of the treatment (dose, volume, lesion location) with the LC and radiation&#xD;
      necrosis.&#xD;

    <description>Intraoperative Radiotherapy with a mobile device (Intrabeam, Carl Zeiss AG) consisting of a small source of low energy x-rays (30-50 kV) mounted on a mechanical arm with six degrees of freedom. The resulting dose distribution is isotropic around the tip of the X-ray source. A set of spherical applicators with diameters ranging from 1.5 to 5 cm is available to connect to the source. The treatment time may vary from 20-30 minutes with the suggested dose of 18 Gy to the resection cavity to a depth of 1 mm.</description>
