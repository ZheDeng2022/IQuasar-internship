  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to study neonatal immune dysfunction associated to the risk of&#xD;
      newborn sepsis in a malaria endemic area in Benin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fetal immunological responses maturate gradually during the last 3 months of pregnancy.&#xD;
      To respond to pathogens, newborns depend essentially on their innate immune system. Premature&#xD;
      babies have a significant impairment of innate and immune regulatory functions, thus&#xD;
      promoting neonatal sepsis. In addition, chronic infections during pregnancy, including those&#xD;
      of parasitic origin, fetal immunity. In utero exposure to P. falciparum antigens impacts&#xD;
      particularly the newborn immune development and is a risk factor predisposing to malaria and&#xD;
      also to other infections during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major objectives are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relevance of a host biomarker driven diagnostic of sepsis in newborns,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relevance of immune markers as indicators of sepsis incidence, secondary infections&#xD;
           occurrence, and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The role of novel diagnostic techniques (FilmArray panels) as part of the&#xD;
           microbiological diagnostic,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunological profile of the infants in the 3 first months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted population is newborns with a high risk to develop sepsis recruited at delivery&#xD;
      compared to a control infant population with a low infection risk.&#xD;
