      This is a 3 arm, non-Interventional pilot single time point cross sectional study for the&#xD;
      duration of 1 year. Total of 30 candidates (10 in each Group) will be enrolled into three&#xD;
      different groups taking three different Antiretroviral regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current regimens that are commonly used (2017-2018 ART guidelines), our groups will&#xD;
      include NRTI such as TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) or TDF(tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus&#xD;
      one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: an NNRTI (Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Rilpivirine Group B a&#xD;
      boosted Protease Inhibitor: Prezcobix- [darunavir+cobicistat combination] Group C: an&#xD;
      Integrase inhibitor (dolutegravir)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once Informed Consent Process is obtained, blood will be drawn (55 ml) for stem/progenitor&#xD;
      cell harvest and 15-20mls for biochemistry analysis. The Investigators will also obtain&#xD;
      weight, waist-circumference, BP, pulse, BMI, Tanita body composition scale measures (which&#xD;
      gives us body habitus measurements) and arterial stiffness measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic and endocrine perturbations including insulin resistance, diabetes, and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia have been of significant concern in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected&#xD;
      individuals. HIV-infected individuals may be at risk of accelerated atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome. HIV infection itself and&#xD;
      first-generation antiretroviral (ART) therapies, have been associated with adipose tissue/&#xD;
      lipodystrophic changes and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. More recent data&#xD;
      suggest that immune activation and inflammation from chronic HIV infection may play an&#xD;
      important role in HIV-associated metabolic dysfunction. Given the recent advances in ART, an&#xD;
      increasing number of HIV-infected individuals are virologically controlled and living longer;&#xD;
      as such, the trajectory of HIV-associated morbidity has shifted from one of primarily acute&#xD;
      opportunistic infections and immune deficiency/dysfunction to one that includes chronic&#xD;
      metabolic complications such as CVD. It is therefore important to discern the effect of&#xD;
      current HIV medications on endothelial dysfunction and cardio-metabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), are an established biomarker for cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      outcome measures. EPCs have been defined as CD34+ cells thereby identifying a defined&#xD;
      homogenous population from heterogeneous peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells. We and&#xD;
      others have previously shown that EPCs can act as a cellular biomarker that is more reliable&#xD;
      than plasma-based markers for CVD risk estimation. Though these studies were not specifically&#xD;
      directed towards HIV positive population one can postulate that CD34+ cells will act as an&#xD;
      efficient biomarker for endothelial function in this population of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding treatment regimens for HIV, in general, the initial regimen for HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals usually includes two NRTIs plus an INSTI, an NNRTI, or a PI boosted with either&#xD;
      cobicistat or ritonavir. Previously, protease inhibitors such as indinavir, and reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT or d4t, have been implicated in mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction and oxidative stress, altered adipogenesis and differentiation, and impaired&#xD;
      glucose and lipid homeostasis. Newer ART agents have been suggested to have lesser impact on&#xD;
      metabolic parameters. However, these newer agents may trigger poorly understood processes&#xD;
      that may have a negative impact on endothelium and numerous metabolic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on current regimens that are commonly used (2017-2018 ART guidelines), our groups will&#xD;
      include NRTI such as TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) or TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus&#xD;
      one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: an NNRTI (Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Rilpivirine (Group A) 2. a&#xD;
      boosted Protease Inhibitor: Prezcobix- [darunavir+cobicistat combination] (Group B), and 3:&#xD;
      an Integrase inhibitor (dolutegravir) (Group C) We are including an integrase inhibitor&#xD;
      because these agents have become the most popular initial regimen for newly infected HIV&#xD;
      individuals. To avoid effect of medication within the three groups we have identified&#xD;
      specific drugs within each class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Although the etiology of metabolic/endocrine complications in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals despite viremic control is poorly understood, it is most likely related to the&#xD;
      interplay of host, viral, and ART factors and the complex interactions among the long-term&#xD;
      consequences of infection, chronic ART, and the underlying inflammatory process. As mentioned&#xD;
      before certain ARTs have raised concerns about metabolic dysfunction such as the PIs and it&#xD;
      is important to determine whether other combination medications promote or reduce the chances&#xD;
      of endothelial and metabolic dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pending a cure or vaccine to prevent HIV, a strong need exists to reduce long-term morbidity&#xD;
      in HIV-infected individuals both by achieving viral suppression and limiting HIV- and/or&#xD;
      ART-related complications, particularly since the current World Health Organization's&#xD;
      guidelines recommend treating all HIV-infected individuals with ART. ) To discern endothelial&#xD;
      function whole blood mononuclear cell derived EPC study is very appropriate. The Investigator&#xD;
      have demonstrated that gene expression in EPCs change within two weeks of an intervention&#xD;
      such as aerobic exercise. On the other-hand serum biomarkers usually take much longer time to&#xD;
      change secondary to an intervention. The paracrine effect of damaged endothelium is secondary&#xD;
      to gene expression changes that have been altered in the progenitor cells several months&#xD;
      ahead of discernable changes in serum based biomarkers such as endothelium based inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. When serum inflammatory markers are elevated that suggests that the endothelium is&#xD;
      already damaged/ inflamed, possibly irreversibly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPCs are the future endothelium, therefore studying EPCs helps the Investigators to predict&#xD;
      the effect of an intervention (such as a medication or exercise) on the future of endothelium&#xD;
      and endothelial function. Their prime function is to migrate in response to a chemotactic&#xD;
      factor such as SDF1 alpha, in order to repair the damaged or dysfunctional endothelium. In&#xD;
      the normal course of events, EPCs transition to mature endothelium and replace endothelial&#xD;
      cells after normal cell death cycle or programmed apoptosis. Unfortunately, obesity and HIV,&#xD;
      both being pro-inflammatory, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) disease processes,&#xD;
      chronically depletes the EPC population by up-regulating apoptotic pathways mediated by p53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to understand the cellular mechanism(s) of chronic metabolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      associated endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disease risk, in patients with&#xD;
      HIV, it will be useful to study the peripheral blood derived endothelial progenitor cells&#xD;
      (EPC, CD34+ cells) along with biochemistry, on three different treatment regimens and&#xD;
      establish their effects on endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators believe this study design allows to discern whether the medication regimens&#xD;
      have an effect on endothelium and biochemical parameters such as insulin, glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile and also appetite controlling hormones. The latter has been&#xD;
      particularly in focus lately with several diabetes medications, such as the incretins which&#xD;
      modify appetite management pathway to treat obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial stiffness measure is a non-invasive procedure which provides the Investigators&#xD;
      with important data on endothelial function and vascular health. Increased arterial stiffness&#xD;
      indicates presence of increased peripheral resistance and predicts development of overt&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that EPC function studies would bear a negative correlation with biochemistry&#xD;
      and arterial stiffness as demonstrated in other clinical trials. The biochemistry and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness data as secondary outcome measure would help validate results and&#xD;
      conclusions obtained from the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All together the Investigators have designed a study on HIV medication looking at their&#xD;
      effect on endothelial function that is largely non-invasive yet giving valuable information&#xD;
      on endothelial health, metabolic parameters and arterial stiffness. The study population is&#xD;
      HIV positive patients, 40-70 years, male subjects only (to avoid gender differences during&#xD;
      EPC based analysis), with a HbA1C less than 6.5% (subjects with no known history of&#xD;
      diabetes). The study team will enroll 10 subjects from each group (A,B,C) who have been on a&#xD;
      stable HIV regimen for at least one year. Total enrollment: 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This is an innovative study looking at different components of cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      disease in HIV subjects and the role that HIV medication regimens play. The NIH is interested&#xD;
      in this topic and has a current RFA out on this topic indicating lack of information. Our&#xD;
      study design is unique as it combines cellular, biochemical and bio-physical components as&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS The Investigators hypothesize that among these HIV regimens (A, B or C)&#xD;
      there will be differences in the degree of metabolic derangement and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
      The team plans to undertake a cross sectional study on HIV subjects on A, B or C regimens for&#xD;
      at least one year, without diabetes, with known cardio-metabolic disease predisposition such&#xD;
      as overweight and mild to moderate obesity (BMI 25.0- 39.9), but with no established coronary&#xD;
      or cerebrovascular event&#xD;
