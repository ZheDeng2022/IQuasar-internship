  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial intent of the study was to be a multi-center single-arm open-label Simon's&#xD;
      two-stage Phase II clinical trial of first-line mFOLFOX6 + trastuzumab + avelumab in&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-amplified gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual will halt after completion of Stage I (enrollment of 18 patients). This decision is&#xD;
      not due to safety issues. Subjects currently on treatment will continue until criteria as&#xD;
      defined in the protocol is met.&#xD;

             consent, the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator,&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
