  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm trial, comparing the effects of a virtual 12-week group-based&#xD;
      exercise intervention vs. control group on physical activity, physical fitness, and quality&#xD;
      of life in colorectal cancer survivors, and explore multi-level determinants of physical&#xD;
      activity maintenance, 6-months after intervention completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be prospectively assigned or allocated to either a the exercise&#xD;
      intervention or a control group for 12-weeks. The control group will be provided with an&#xD;
      informational handout from the American Cancer Society describing exercise recommendations&#xD;
      and guidelines for cancer survivors. At the end of the study, control group participants will&#xD;
      be offered compensation for participation in a community-based cancer specific exercise&#xD;
      program (e.g., BfitBwell, Fit Cancer, Livestrong at the YMCA). Supervised exercise sessions&#xD;
      will take place twice per week for approximately one hour, and include aerobic, muscular&#xD;
      strength and endurance, balance, and flexibility components. Sessions will be delivered&#xD;
      synchronously (i.e., in real-time/live) via Zoom. Exercise will be individualized based on&#xD;
      the results of baseline fitness assessments and medical history. The intervention will also&#xD;
      include virtual, group-based discussion sessions which operationalize behavior change&#xD;
      techniques to increase physical activity. Discussion sessions will take place in the same&#xD;
      groups, synchronously, via Zoom.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the effects of a 12-week physical activity intervention delivered in group versus control group, on physical activity. Physical activity will be measured with a self-report questionnaire (duration and frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity) and accelerometer.</description>

    <measure>Physical Fitness: Aerobic</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-weeks and 6-months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic fitness will be assessed with a submaximal, graded exercise test on a motorized, calibrated treadmill. Muscular Strength &amp; Endurance will be assessed by multiple repetition maximum (1RM) plate loaded seated bench press and leg press, and by the number of full stands from a chair, and the number of bicep curls (holding a hand weight of 5lbs) that can be completed in 30 seconds.</description>
