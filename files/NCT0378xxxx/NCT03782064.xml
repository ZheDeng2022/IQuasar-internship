  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a cancer vaccine called Dendritic Cell/MM Fusion vaccine&#xD;
      (DC/MM vaccine) in combination with nivolumab, as a possible treatment for multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dendritic Cell/MM Fusion vaccine (DC/MM vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/MM vaccine as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved nivolumab for multiple myeloma. A similar immunotherapy drug used in&#xD;
      combination with IMiDs (drugs that regulate or modify the immune system) was associated with&#xD;
      higher risk of death in another research trial in patients with multiple myeloma; however,&#xD;
      nivolumab has been approved for use in several other types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved the combination of nivolumab with the DC/MM vaccine as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators wish to determine whether nivolumab administered in&#xD;
      combination with the DC/MM vaccine will help promote an immune response against multiple&#xD;
      myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immune response is any reaction by the immune system. It helps the body distinguish itself&#xD;
      from substances foreign to it, such as infections and dangerous substances. Cancer cells have&#xD;
      unique markers that distinguish them from normal cells, which can potentially serve as&#xD;
      targets for the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DC/MM vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune system recognize&#xD;
      and fight against cancer cells, utilizing those unique markers. Unlike a standard vaccine&#xD;
      that is used to prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can&#xD;
      fight cancers that are already in the body. Laboratory studies suggest that when dendritic&#xD;
      cells (a type of immune cell that helps to tell your immune system what is good and what is&#xD;
      bad) and tumor cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses&#xD;
      against the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are part of your immune system; they are a&#xD;
      type of protein that protects the body against foreign invaders, called antigens, by grabbing&#xD;
      hold of antigens to stop them from invading your system. Monoclonal indicated that this&#xD;
      antibody was made in a lab. Nivolumab has been shown to react against cancer cells, including&#xD;
      MM cells. The investigators hope that the addition of nivolumab with the DC/MM vaccine will&#xD;
      help the body fight MM&#xD;
