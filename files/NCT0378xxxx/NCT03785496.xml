    <measure>To evaluate efficacy of PDR001 by Objective Response rate by RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors)</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated tumor imaging will be performed every 2 cycle (each cycle is 21 days) after baseline imaging</time_frame>
    <description>In the first stage of the trial, 22 patients will be recruited, and their tumor response will be assessed RECIST criteria, which is widely used tumor assessment criteria in immuno-oncology agent trials. The best response until 6 months according to irRECIST will be evaluated, and this trial will proceed to second stage if three or more respondents (irPR or irCR) are observed among 22 patients. The response (PR or CR) should be confirmed by next disease assessment(6 weeks/2cycles after initial response).&#xD;
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than recurrence will move into the Follow-Up Phase and should be assessed every 16 weeks (± 14 days) by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate antitumor efficacy of PDR001: PFS(Progression-Free Survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. Documentation of progression will be defined as per RECIST criteria based on investigator assessment. Patients without documented progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessments are performed after the baseline visit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate antitumor efficacy of PDR001: OS(Overall survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of death. Patients without documented death will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>

    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. RECIST will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or MRI may be utilized, as per RECIST, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.</description>

    <description>PDR001 will be administered once every 3 weeks via i.v. infusions over 30 minutes, respectively. Infusions of each antibody can be extended to up to 2 hours if clinically indicated. A scheduled dose of ongoing study drugs may be delayed by up to 7 days to recover from previous AEs or a missed visit. If a scheduled dose of ongoing study drugs is delayed longer than 7 days due to an unresolved AE, the administration should be skipped and treatment resumed at the next scheduled dose. The assessment schedule will be shifted accordingly.</description>

                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had over 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile age appropriate&#xD;

             absence of other medical justification or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 1.5&#xD;
             months ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
             the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she considered&#xD;
             not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking&#xD;
             treatment and for 150 days after the last dose of PDR001. A condom is required to be&#xD;
             used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal&#xD;
             fluid.&#xD;
