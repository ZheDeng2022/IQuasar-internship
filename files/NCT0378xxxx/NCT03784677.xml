  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of SOR-C13 in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SOR-C13, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13&#xD;
      (SOR-C13) in subjects with advanced solid tumor cancers of epithelial origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the safety profiles of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the treatment. II. To assess predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by comparing&#xD;
      molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have achieved&#xD;
      objective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on&#xD;
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
