    <textblock>
      Center for Disease Control (CDC) data reveal that after years of sustained decrease, the&#xD;
      incidence of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in the US has plateaued. Most of the cases&#xD;
      occur when Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) reactivates replication in people who have latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Only 5 to 10% of subjects with LTBI develop active TB&#xD;
      Infection over their lifetime. Current US guidelines recommend treating everyone with LTBI to&#xD;
      stop progression to active TB. As treatment is long, only about 45-55% of patients finish&#xD;
      treatment overall, regardless of whether the patients are at high (&gt;10%) or low lifetime risk&#xD;
      of reactivation. The investigator's study aims to test the efficacy of a combined approach of&#xD;
      first determining subjects at high risk of reactivation and then treating them with a CDC&#xD;
      approved once a week treatment regimen, directly observed by a nurse over video (video-based&#xD;
      Directly Observed Therapy, vDOT). Ensuring treatment of the high-risk group will eventually&#xD;
      decrease the community active TB burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) in the US: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis (Mtb), is a leading cause of mortality, killing more than a million people&#xD;
      worldwide^1. In the United States an important recent trend has been the plateauing of the&#xD;
      active TB disease incidence at 3.0 cases per 100,000 persons^2. Current US TB control&#xD;
      guidelines recommend treating all subjects with LTBI to prevent progression to active TB.&#xD;
      However, treatment is given with the antibiotic Isoniazid (INH) for 6-9 months, Rifampin and&#xD;
      Rifabutin for 4 months or INH with Rifapentine for 3 months and as subjects with LTBI are&#xD;
      asymptomatic, treatment default rates are understandably high (&gt;10% on average)^3-5. It is&#xD;
      well known that a subset of patients with LTBI have higher risk of progression to active TB.&#xD;
      Because of the high treatment default rate, a number of these &quot;high risk&quot; subjects receive&#xD;
      incomplete or no preventive therapy and contribute to the incidence of active TB cases in the&#xD;
      US. Currently, there are no strategies being implemented to identify those at highest risk&#xD;
      and consequently treatment approaches follow the &quot;one size fits all&quot; paradigm. In the&#xD;
      investigators preliminary study done at the Saint Louis University (SLU) Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      Clinic, the investigators used an online risk calculator (TSTin3D.com)^6 to retrospectively&#xD;
      determine the cumulative lifetime risk of progression to active TB for adults receiving&#xD;
      treatment for latent TB. The investigators found that current practice leads to equal rates&#xD;
      of treatment completion i.e. 57% in the high risk for active TB disease (TBhi) group (&gt;10%&#xD;
      cumulative risk of progression based on medical risk factors) compared to 59% for those at&#xD;
      lowest risk (TBlow, &lt;10% cumulative risk of progression). It is not standard of care to use a&#xD;
      scoring system like the TSTin3d.com to assess the risk. There are certain risk factors like&#xD;
      having HIV or being on immunosuppression that physicians ask about but most physicians do not&#xD;
      do a quantitative risk assessment. Treatment choices are usually based on convenience and&#xD;
      concern for side effects but the most common regimen is daily INH for 6-9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data implies that the current &quot;treat everyone and hope that therapy is completed&quot;&#xD;
      approach leads to a significant number of people in the TBhi group remaining untreated and at&#xD;
      high risk of progression to active TB. A recent advance has been a CDC approved regimen using&#xD;
      Isoniazid (INH) and Rifapentine given weekly as directly observed therapy (DOT) for 12 weeks&#xD;
      (known as the 3HP regimen). This regimen has shown lower toxicity, better adherence and&#xD;
      equivalent efficacy^7-12. INH + Rifapentine (3HP) is not currently used widely as DOT is&#xD;
      resource intensive. The investigators hypothesize that if providers use the calculator&#xD;
      (TSTin3d.com) to firstly determine risk and then select the once weekly DOT for the TBhi&#xD;
      group (12 doses total); the investigators can ensure that the TBhi group completes treatment.&#xD;
      Complete treatment of the TBhi group will have the highest impact in decreasing the community&#xD;
      burden of TB disease. The investigators propose the first US study to prospectively test the&#xD;
      efficacy of an approach which 1) defines the TBhi group using TSTin3d.com and 2) ensures&#xD;
      treatment completion in the TBhi group with weekly with video-based DOT (vDOT) with 3HP. Most&#xD;
      patients nowadays have access to a smartphone with video capabilities. A HIPAA approved video&#xD;
      application (Zoom) is already available through the Missouri Telehealth Network and can be&#xD;
      used by the patient to interface with the TB clinic nurse over a smartphone. The&#xD;
      investigators approach removes the need for the patients in the TBhi group to be physically&#xD;
      present in the TB clinic. All patients identified in the TBhi group can thus be safely&#xD;
      provided vDOT. The investigators pilot study has important implications for improving care&#xD;
      and patient treatment outcomes as it will identify the &quot;high risk&quot; subjects with latent TB&#xD;
      using tstin3d.com (Table 1), [a validated online calculator that combines TST or interferon&#xD;
      Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) screening results with clinical information obtained from the&#xD;
      patient, to generate an individual's cumulative risk of developing active TB disease, up to&#xD;
      age 80^11]. The investigators will then ensure that patients complete therapy under direct&#xD;
      observation by a nurse using video based Directly Observed Therapy (vDOT). vDOT also&#xD;
      eliminates the need for the patient to physically visit the clinic. All patients need is&#xD;
      access to a smartphone with video capabilities. HIPAA approved video based applications are&#xD;
      already available for vDOT and has already been implemented successfully.^13&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the drug options listed are standard of care currently in the US. It is currently not&#xD;
      standard of care to use a scoring system like tstin3d.com to assess risk. There are certain&#xD;
      risk factors like having HIV or being on immunosuppression that physicians routinely ask&#xD;
      about but most physicians do not do a quantitative risk assessment. Treatment choices are&#xD;
      usually based on convenience and concern for side effects but the most common regimen is&#xD;
      daily INH for 6 months or 9 months.&#xD;
