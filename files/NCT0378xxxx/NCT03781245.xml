  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;All the Right Moves for Subcontractors&quot; aims to improve safety, health and well-being,&#xD;
      through the development of a communication infrastructure with supplemental tools where&#xD;
      construction workers and company mangers (project, operations and safety) work together to&#xD;
      collaboratively identify problems and strategies to improve their conditions of work. The&#xD;
      intervention is grounded in the key characteristics of integrated organizational&#xD;
      interventions to improve workers' health safety and well-being detailed in Harvard Center for&#xD;
      Work, Health and Well-being's Implementation Guidelines (McLellan et al, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention involves a cyclical approach through which the research team facilitate a&#xD;
      participatory process to identify workers' health concerns, prioritize these concerns, use an&#xD;
      action planning process to identify and operationalize solutions, and develop a&#xD;
      company-specific evaluation plan to measure change. We will evaluate this program by&#xD;
      measuring safety climate, health climate, pain and injury and health behaviors.&#xD;
