  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney and liver transplantation are the treatment of choice and are often the last&#xD;
      therapeutic option offered to patients with chronic renal and liver failure. More than 70% of&#xD;
      kidneys and liver available for transplantation are obtained from donors following&#xD;
      neurological death. Unfortunately, compared to living donation, transplant function, graft&#xD;
      survival, and recipient survival are consistently inferior with kidneys and liver from&#xD;
      neurologically deceased donors. This difference lies with the exacerbated pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      state characteristic of deceased donors. Indeed, when neurologic death occurs, the immune&#xD;
      system releases substances in the blood that could harm organs and particularly the liver and&#xD;
      the kidneys. We believe that achieving a better understanding of the inflammatory processes&#xD;
      of organ donors could be greatly informative to design future randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      assessing the effect of personalized immunosuppressive therapy on organ donors to ultimately&#xD;
      improve the care provided to donors so as to increase the number of organs available for&#xD;
      transplantation and enhancing the survival of received grafts&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe neurological injuries, such as those observed in neurologically deceased donors,&#xD;
      trigger a pro-inflammatory state that activates the immune system, increases vascular&#xD;
      permeability, and recruits and activates immune cells in solid organs. The rapid and intense&#xD;
      increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) following&#xD;
      neurological death, has been referred to as the cytokine storm, one condition that is not&#xD;
      seen among living donors. Interestingly, increased expression of TNF-α in the kidney and&#xD;
      liver at the time of transplantation has been associated with reduced graft survival and&#xD;
      acute rejection. Moreover, numerous studies have suggested that miRNA biomarkers can be&#xD;
      targeted as diagnostic or therapeutic molecules in the field of organ transplantation.&#xD;
      However, current models of graft injury fail to consider the epigenetic effects of&#xD;
      physiological stressors that occurred in neurologically deceased donors. Although several&#xD;
      biomarkers have been associated with graft dysfunction, the changes within the donor's&#xD;
      inflammatory state, the mechanism underlying these events in donors, and the impacts on&#xD;
      recipients are only poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a multicenter prospective cohort study with the main objective of&#xD;
      assessing the pro-inflammatory status of neurologically deceased donors by examining both&#xD;
      miRNAs and circulatory cytokines and investigating its association with graft function in the&#xD;
      recipient. Blood specimens will be collected at various time points in neurologically&#xD;
      deceased liver and kidney donors in 5 organ recovery centres. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that in donors, Peak plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      inflammatory-associated miRNAs targets (between consent and recovery) are associated with an&#xD;
      increase in kidney delayed graft function and liver early graft dysfunction in the&#xD;
      recipients. Considering that there is a therapeutic arsenal for treating donor cytokine&#xD;
      storms( e.g., immunosuppressants) and that new targets based on a highly personalized&#xD;
      mechanism could be developed we believe that the knowledge acquired in this research program&#xD;
      will make it possible to improve the rate of livers and kidneys recovered from potential&#xD;
      donors as well as enhance graft function in recipients.&#xD;
