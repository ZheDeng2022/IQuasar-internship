  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the metabolic benefits of bitter melon seed oil (BMSO), overweight or obese&#xD;
      healthy Taiwanese adults (n=60) were randomly assigned to receive capsules containing either&#xD;
      olive oil (OO; placebo) or BMSO at 4.5 g/d dose for 12 week. Across intervention period, body&#xD;
      weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat mass were measured. Blood were collected before&#xD;
      and after intervention for measurements of blood lipid and inflammatory cytokines. The&#xD;
      anti-obesity effect of BMSO was further assessed by stratification of participants according&#xD;
      to UCP1 rs1800592 polymorphism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bitter melon is a common Asian vegetable. Its seed is not edible and discarded as a waste&#xD;
      product. However, the seed oil is enriched in cis9, trans11, trans13-conjugated linolenic&#xD;
      acid or alpha-eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA). Investigators previously demonstrated the&#xD;
      anti-obesity functions of bitter melon seed oil (BMSO) in animal trials. Herein, a RCT was&#xD;
      conducted to test the potential of BMSO in developing as a functional culinary oil for weight&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering UCP-1 played a pivotal role in anti-adiposity function of BMSO as demonstrated in&#xD;
      animal studies, the anti-obesity effect of BMSO was further assessed according to UCP1&#xD;
      rs1800592 polymorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Taiwanese adults with overweight or obesity were recruited by advertisement and were&#xD;
      assessed by a family medicine physician for eligibility. All participants signed the consent&#xD;
      form. Blocked randomization was used to randomly assign participants into one of two groups&#xD;
      to receive indicated supplement (BMSO or OO capsules with identical appearance; 4.5 g oil/d)&#xD;
      for 12 week. Subjects were requested to maintain their usual diet and physical activity&#xD;
      during the study period (0-12 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements were done on week 0, 4, 8 and 12. Three-day food records,&#xD;
      collection of blood samples and physical health check were conducted on week 0, 4 and 12.&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry was done on week 0 and 12. Questionnaires about self-reported side&#xD;
      effects, such as trouble sleeping, constipation, diarrhea, increased heartbeat, palpitations,&#xD;
      headache, anxiety, or dizziness, were collected in each visit. Group allocation was&#xD;
      concealed.&#xD;

    <description>BMSO was extracted from Hualien No. 4 cultivate of bitter melon seed. BMSO were incorporated into capsules containing 0.5 g of oil. All persons took 3 capsules after each meal, i.e. 9 capsules (4.5 g of oil) daily, resulting in daily consumption of 2.3 g alpha-ESA in the BMSO group.</description>
