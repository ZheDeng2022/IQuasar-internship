      This study evaluates the effect of aflibercept on the change of cytokines incluing sCD14,&#xD;
      MCP-1, IL-6, and ICAM-1 in the aqueous humor of DME patients. Additionally, changes of visual&#xD;
      acuity (ETDRS), optical coherence tomography parameters including hyperreflective foci and&#xD;
      thickness of macula are also investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular steroid agents have been shown to decrease inflammatory cytokines in diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema (DME) patients and thus have roles in the treatment of these patients. However,&#xD;
      I believe that anti-VEGF could effectively decrease intraocular inflammatory responses in&#xD;
      these patients with much fewer side effects than intraocular steroid agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since soluble CD14 (sCD14) is the known marker of inflammatory cells including microglia,&#xD;
      increased or decreased retinal inflammation accompanied by DME could be monitored using sCD14&#xD;
      in patients with DME. Recently, I published an article regarding the strong association of&#xD;
      increased sCD14 in the aqueous humor (AH) from DME patients, especially in increased inner&#xD;
      retinal edema as well as increased hyper reflective foci (HF) in optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT). This associated changes of sCD14 levels and HF in the retina suggested that the HF&#xD;
      might represent the activated microglia in DME. I also showed that the intravitreal&#xD;
      bevacizumab injection resulted in a reduction of sCD14 in the AH and HF in OCT. However, that&#xD;
      study was retrospective and I could not have many patients' follow-up data after bevacizumab&#xD;
      treatments and thus was not able to get conclusive results regarding decreased retinal&#xD;
      inflammation after anti-VEGF. Therefore, I believe that a well-desinged prospective study is&#xD;
      needed to clarify whether retinal inflammation is ameliorated after anti-VEGF treatment.&#xD;
      Moreover, I believe that aflibercept is more appropriate and better drug than bevacizumab to&#xD;
      investigate the changes in the cytokine levels along with the improvement of inflammatory&#xD;
      milieu in DME due to the following reasons. First, recent DRCR.net Protocol-T reported the&#xD;
      superior clinical outome of aflibercept compared to bevacizumab on DME. Second, aflibercept&#xD;
      has significantly higher binding affinity to VEGF-A compared to ranibizumab or bevacizumab.&#xD;
      Third, aflibercept also binds to VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF), unlike&#xD;
      ranibizumab or bevacizumab. PlGF-VEGFR1 pathway contributes to inflammation by triggering&#xD;
      production of proinflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, I would like to investigate the efficacy of aflibercept for reducing inflammation in&#xD;
      DME. Therapeutic effects of aflibercept on reduction of DME in the context of amelioration of&#xD;
      inflammation will be proved using sCD14 and HF as surrogate markers in this proposed study.&#xD;
      Besides sCD14, tracking the cytokines including MCP-1, IL-6, and ICAM-1 in the AH in a&#xD;
      well-controlled prospective setting of aflibercept treatments will enhance our understanding&#xD;
      regarding the role of inflammation on DME, and the importance of aflibercept for decreasing&#xD;
      ocular inflammation in DME patients.&#xD;
