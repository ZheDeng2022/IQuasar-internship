  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter, study. Individuals who are assessed for&#xD;
      microwave (MW) ablation of HCC in accordance with their institution's standard of care (SOC),&#xD;
      who meet study entry criteria and sign the informed consent, will be enrolled. The patients&#xD;
      will be treated with MW ablation and afterwards followed for up to 36 months after the&#xD;
      original ablation procedure to assess efficacy and safety. In addition to the final analysis&#xD;
      after all enrolled patients complete the 36-month observation period, a summary of selected&#xD;
      endpoints will be provided after all enrolled patients have completed each of the 1-month and&#xD;
      12-month visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide sites with an opportunity to get equal experience in the use of the Certus system,&#xD;
      there will 3 patients treated as part of a run-in phase. These patients will only be included&#xD;
      in the safety set.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a single HCC tumor up to 5 cm or a maximum of 3 HCC tumors of up to 3 cm&#xD;
      per tumor will receive the same procedure: microwave ablation using only the NeuWave Certus&#xD;
      Microwave Ablation System. Patients in this study will come to their study site for the&#xD;
      ablation procedure. After the ablation procedure, the patient will be observed, which in most&#xD;
      cases is expected to be 2 to 3 hours, and afterwards may return home. If the Study Doctor&#xD;
      decides it is warranted for patient safety, the patient will remain in the hospital longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of one MRI of the liver must be taken at Baseline/Screening to ascertain tumor&#xD;
      type, location, and size. (Tumor size will be measured in longest diameter and the diameter&#xD;
      that is perpendicular to this longest diameter; tumor size must be measured with at least 2D&#xD;
      imaging.) Physicians who are experienced with tumor ablation will do all ablations&#xD;
      percutaneously using only the NeuWave Certus Ablation System. During the ablation, patients&#xD;
      will be under an anesthesia method as per the institution's SOC. Ultrasound and/or CT scan&#xD;
      will be used to guide the probe to the tumor and confirm accurate placement of the probe&#xD;
      prior to emitting the microwaves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days after ablation, contrast-enhanced MRI will be done to confirm the completion of&#xD;
      the ablation procedure. According to the standard practice at each study site, ablation&#xD;
      confirmation will be classified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete tumor ablation with adequate margin (A0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete tumor ablation with insufficient margin (A1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incomplete tumor ablation (A2). Over the course of 3 years, patients will return to&#xD;
           their study site for post ablation follow-up visits, which will be carried out per the&#xD;
           Schedule of Activities (see Table 1 at the end of the Synopsis). The follow-up schedule&#xD;
           will be based on the original ablation procedure date. A re-ablation for any reason will&#xD;
           not re-start or change the follow-up visit schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every follow-up visit, every patient will be scanned with at least one MRI to see if there&#xD;
      are any tumor foci at the edge of the ablation zone, which indicates tumor progression.&#xD;
      Repeat microwave ablation (using the Certus Microwave Ablation System only) may be performed&#xD;
      for recurrence of target tumor(s) or to achieve complete tumor ablation with adequate margin&#xD;
      (A0) of the target tumor(s) if the initial ablation had an insufficient margin, if the&#xD;
      treating physician deems appropriate and necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While repeat ablations for a recurrence may be conducted at any point during the study&#xD;
      duration, repeat ablations to correct an ablative margin may only be performed within the&#xD;
      first 30 days of the original ablation (by Visit 3).&#xD;
