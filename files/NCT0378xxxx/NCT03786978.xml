  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the frequent use of polypharmacy at different times&#xD;
      of administration and requires special attention from the patient or caregivers in order to&#xD;
      properly treatment performed. The degree of Functional Literacy in Health is defined as the&#xD;
      ability to apply literacy skills to health-related materials, including prescriptions,&#xD;
      package inserts, and home care instructions. Several questionnaires are used in research and&#xD;
      clinical practice to assess the pronunciation and understanding of commonly used medical&#xD;
      terms, as the SAHLPA-18 (Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Portuguese Speaking Adults).&#xD;
      The Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) evaluates adherence to medication use from a&#xD;
      patient's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the basal visit, after the characterization of the sample (n= 100), inpatients from&#xD;
      Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) were randomized to interventional or comparator&#xD;
      group. The interventional group was follow up during a year after basal discharge. Comparator&#xD;
      group received only a phone call, 30 days after the basal discharge, to question how was&#xD;
      their healthy status. Readmission rates were evaluated for both groups. Also, a economic&#xD;
      evaluation was made to measure the readmission rates in terms of costs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first outcome of the clinical study was to measure the readmission rate through a&#xD;
      structured pharmaceutical care model after basal hospital discharge and measure the effect of&#xD;
      this intervention in terms of readmission reduction in a short term period of 30 days,&#xD;
      regardless of the hospitalization reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcomes the investigators measured the readmission rates after basal hospital&#xD;
      discharge and the effect of the intervention in terms of readmission reduction in 60, 90,180&#xD;
      and 365 days after basal hospital discharge. Also, the readmission costs in terms of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness were evaluate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample consisted of 100 patients with DM associated with other comorbidities,&#xD;
      hospitalized for any reason in the HCPA, of both sexes, older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent, demographic and validated questionnaires data were collected in the basal&#xD;
      visit. After that, patients were randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: comparator; Group 2: structured pharmaceutical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after basal hospital discharge, drugs adherence was verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional group received pharmaceutical care at basal hospitalization stay, after&#xD;
      randomization, have their prescription reviewed until 7 days after discharge of basal&#xD;
      hospitalization and also received structured phone calls and mobile SMS (Short Message&#xD;
      Service) during one year follow up (30, 60, 180 and 365 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic medical records of the included patients (intervention and comparator groups) were&#xD;
      reviewed monthly for 12 months, aiming to identify access to emergency services or hospital&#xD;
      readmissions at the HCPA and, consequently, the reasons for readmissions and outcomes.&#xD;
