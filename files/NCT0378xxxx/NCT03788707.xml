    <textblock>
      Predicting fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients is of paramount importance. It can&#xD;
      help define an adequate fluid balance. Overzealous fluid administration is poorly tolerated&#xD;
      and has been associated with poor outcomes but so has insufficient administration. Currently&#xD;
      available predictors of fluid responsiveness rely on invasive monitors and require patients&#xD;
      to be on mechanical ventilation. It is thus important to develop non invasive novel methods&#xD;
      to assess fluid responsiveness to provide an accurate management for a favorable outcome. We&#xD;
      propose a readily available non-invasive method that relies on improvement of the ventilation&#xD;
      perfusion mismatch as recorded by end tidal CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation of physiologic dead space is part of a spectrum of mismatch between ventilation&#xD;
      and perfusion of the lungs. The extent of pulmonary dead space varies depending on factors&#xD;
      affecting pulmonary perfusion (e.g. pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure) and alveolar&#xD;
      pressure (e.g. positive pressure ventilation). Compromised pulmonary capillary perfusion can&#xD;
      lead to ventilation-perfusion mismatch in a patient with clear conductive airway and adequate&#xD;
      alveolar oxygen pressure. Alveolar dead space results in decreased CO2 exchange that&#xD;
      translates into lower levels of expired CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke volume of the right ventricle is a major determinant of the pulmonary capillary&#xD;
      perfusion. Right ventricular cardiac output can be increased by passive lower limb elevation&#xD;
      maneuver, which ultimately results in improvement of the ventilation to perfusion ratio. This&#xD;
      effect leads to a higher participation of perfused (and ventilated) alveolar units in gas&#xD;
      exchange and narrowing of the gradient between arterial and expired CO2 concentration.&#xD;
      Performing a passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver leads to stroke volume enhancement in both&#xD;
      healthy patients and in those experiencing hemodynamic instability. Responsiveness to PLR can&#xD;
      be assessed by different methods including echocardiography and pulse pressure variation.&#xD;
      Left ventricular cardiac output (LVCO) can be easily measured by transthoracic echo and be&#xD;
      used as a surrogate of right ventricular preload changes. LVCO can thus be used to assess the&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness of PLR and the effects of on end tidal CO2 that ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose this study to test the hypothesis that expired CO2 is a reliable predictor of&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness after performance of the PLR maneuver, based on the assumption that&#xD;
      increasing right ventricular output causes a reduction of the ventilation to perfusion ratio,&#xD;
      leading to increased levels of expired CO2. T&#xD;
