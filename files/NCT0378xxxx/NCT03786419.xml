  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, single arm, phase II trial in patients with diagnosis of unresectable or&#xD;
      advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma who experienced progression after platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a screening period a treatment period, a termination treatment visit ≤30&#xD;
      days following the last dose of the study drug, and a follow-up period. Day 1 is defined as&#xD;
      the first day in which patients receive atezolizumab. The study is expected to enroll 36&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive a fixed dose of atezolizumab 1200 mg administered&#xD;
      intravenously the first day of each cycle. A treatment cycle will last 21 days (± 3 days).&#xD;
      Treatment with atezolizumab will continue until investigator-assessed loss of clinical&#xD;
      benefit, unacceptable toxicity, investigator or participant's decision to withdraw from&#xD;
      therapy, or death (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with atezolizumab may continue while patients experience clinical benefit based on&#xD;
      the investigator's assessment (absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration&#xD;
      attributable to disease progression, at the discretion of the investigator after evaluating&#xD;
      radiographic data, biopsy results [if available], and clinical status), or until unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, patients treated with atezolizumab, who demonstrate evidence of clinical&#xD;
      benefit may continue treatment with atezolizumab after meeting disease progression criteria,&#xD;
      based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The following need&#xD;
      to be met, as specified by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must undergo tumor assessments at baseline and every 9 weeks (± 7 days)&#xD;
      following cycle 1, day 1, regardless of treatment delays, until radiographic disease&#xD;
      progression, as per RECIST v1.1 modified for mesothelioma, or loss of clinical benefit in&#xD;
      patients treated with atezolizumab, who continue treatment beyond disease progression, as per&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1, withdrawal of consent, death or study termination by principal investigator,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end if all enrolled patients die, withdraw their consent, become lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, or have been monitored during 12 months from the enrollment of the last patient,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
