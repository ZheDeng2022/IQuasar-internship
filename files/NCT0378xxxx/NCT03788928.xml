  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis (AP) is inflammation of the pancreas that can become a fatal disease or&#xD;
      lead to severe complications . It is characterized clinically by abdominal pain and by&#xD;
      increased pancreatic enzyme levels in the blood or urine. Gallstone migration and alcohol&#xD;
      abuse are the two major risk factors for AP in humans . According to the updated Atlanta&#xD;
      classification, AP is generally divided into mild, moderate or severe pancreatitis according&#xD;
      to the presence or absence of multiple organ failure (MOF) or local or systemic complications&#xD;
      . Mild pancreatitis has a good prognosis with rapid recovery. The late consequences of AP&#xD;
      include impaired pancreatic exocrine function and glucose tolerance, diabetes and development&#xD;
      of chronic pancreatitis . Moderately severe AP is characterized by the presence of transient&#xD;
      organ failure, local complications or exacerbation of comorbid disease . About one-third of&#xD;
      patients with AP develop severe necrotizing pancreatitis with persistent MOF and a high&#xD;
      mortality rate. The main goals in the clinical management of AP are adequate fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation and the prevention of MOF . Both genetic and environmental factors affect the&#xD;
      development and severity of pancreatitis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown, increasing evidence suggests that&#xD;
      damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) play a central role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of AP. DAMPs link local tissue damage to systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS),&#xD;
      which, if severe or sustained, can lead to subsequent MOF and even death . Most DAMPs are&#xD;
      recognized by membrane-bound and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by&#xD;
      both immune and nonimmune cell types. This triggers downstream signaling and manifests as&#xD;
      sterile inflammation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of AP involves a complex cascade of events , which start with injury or&#xD;
      disruption of the pancreatic acini, which then permits the leakage of active pancreatic&#xD;
      enzymes including amylolytic, lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes that destroy local tissues.&#xD;
      This results in edema, vascular damage, hemorrhage and cell death . In addition to oxidative&#xD;
      stress and calcium overload , hypotension and low acinar pH contribute to these initiation&#xD;
      processes. After initial production of active pancreatic enzymes, local cell death and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria, the energy factories of cells, regulate pancreatic cell death through control&#xD;
      of the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well&#xD;
      as calcium . Dysfunction of mitochondrial calcium uptake and efflux, including elevation of&#xD;
      cytosolic calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, can cause mitochondrial calcium overload,&#xD;
      which leads to enhanced generation of mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial membrane&#xD;
      permeabilization. Mitochondria dysfunction-mediated oxidative injury results in endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum stress, lysosomal damage and the release of proteases (for example, cathepsin and&#xD;
      trypsin) to degrade cytosolic proteins that cause pancreatic acinar cell death . Dead, dying&#xD;
      and injured pancreatic acinar cells release intra-cellular contents, including DAMPs (for&#xD;
      example, high mobility group box 1 [HMGB1], DNA, histones and ATP), which in turn promote&#xD;
      infiltration of various immune cells (for example, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages)&#xD;
      and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of experimental AP correlates with the extent and type of cell injury and death.&#xD;
      Although multiple forms of cell death exist in physiological and pathological conditions ,&#xD;
      necrosis and apoptosis are the most widely studied types in both clinical and experimental AP&#xD;
      . Necrotic cells are capable of activating proinflammatory and immunostimulatory responses by&#xD;
      releasing DAMPs and other molecules, whereas apoptosis is usually considered immunologically&#xD;
      silent because the cytoplasmic content is packaged in apoptotic bodies and these&#xD;
      membrane-bound cell fragments are rapidly taken up and degraded by phagocytes or autophagy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is the immune system so concerned with cell death? The current notion is that DAMPs&#xD;
      released or exposed from dying or dead cells contribute to inflammatory and immune responses&#xD;
      to remove dead cells and initiate tissue healing . Failure of this control mechanism can lead&#xD;
      to uncontrolled inflammation and serious diseases such as sepsis, arthritis, atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      lupus and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria are now recognized not only as central players in cell death but also as an&#xD;
      important source of DAMPs. mit-DAMPs, including mitDNA, N-formyl peptides, transcription&#xD;
      factor A (TFAM, a mitochondrial HMGB1 homologue) and ROS, play emerging roles in inflammation&#xD;
      by the activation of neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical course of AP is generally mild; however, nearly 25% of patients progress into&#xD;
      severeAP (SAP) which consists of organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis (PNec) . Although&#xD;
      advances in the diagnosis and management have been made, AP remains a major healthissue to&#xD;
      the society, PNec is a major complication of AP which manifests as non-opacified parenchyma&#xD;
      with intravenous contrast, as identified via contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scan. Patients with&#xD;
      PNec are more likely to develop pancreatic infection and suffer a greater risk for mortality&#xD;
      . Currently,CECT scans remain the &quot;gold standard&quot; to diagnosis PNec clinically . However, the&#xD;
      extent of PNec is best seen about 3 days after the presentation of disease and may be missed&#xD;
      in early CT scan. In addition, repeated CT scanningis not convenient to monitor changes in&#xD;
      necrosis, most not ably for those who are receiving mechanical ventilation or hemofiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple predictors have alternatively been used for early PNec prediction, detection, and&#xD;
      monitoring. These include clinical score systems and circulating biomarkers. Ranson and&#xD;
      APACHE II score systems are widely used albeit complex and time-consuming. Recently, the role&#xD;
      of circulating biomarkers, such as peak creatinine levels, C-reactive protein(CRP), and&#xD;
      leptin, has been investigated . Of these novel biomarkers, only CRP has been used routinely&#xD;
      in casesof PNec prediction. It is reported that CRP levels higher than 150 mg/l were 86%&#xD;
      sensitive, but only 46% specific for pancreatic necrosis . Thus, additional investigationof&#xD;
      these novel biomarkers is necessary to further improve PNec prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an extrachromosomal genome occurring in the mitochondria of&#xD;
      eukaryotic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally, it is strictly contained in mitochondria and notexposed to the innate immune system&#xD;
      even following cellapoptosis. However, in times of cell death elicited bystress (e.g., trauma&#xD;
      and sepsis), mtDNA is released into systemic circulation and leads to an array of&#xD;
      inflammatory reactions . Elevated mtDNA levels have been reported in a variety of clinical&#xD;
      situations, including trauma,severe sepsis , and cancer . As PNec is caused by intracellular&#xD;
      activation of digestive enzymes and autodigestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New therapeutic methods targeting PNec such as endoscopic ultrasound guided transmural&#xD;
      drainage and necrosectomy are being tested. Early identification of PNec will be helpful for&#xD;
      early treatment. High levels of mtDNA suggest the presence of PNec and close observation&#xD;
      should be given to avoid the developmentof SAP and pancreatitis infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrotic substances released into the blood stimulate the production of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and mediators, trigger an inflammatory cascade and eventually lead to the SIRS or&#xD;
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.&#xD;
