      This study aimed to assess and compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of LLLT&#xD;
      and FC for pulpotomy in human primary teeth. One hundred and six primary molars from 36&#xD;
      children aging five to eight years were included and randomly assigned into two equal groups;&#xD;
      LLLT group and FC group. Teeth were evaluated clinically and radiographically at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Background: Various agents are available to dress the remaining pulp tissue after pulpotomy&#xD;
      procedure with the formocresol (FC) being the gold standard for the last 60 years. Nowadays,&#xD;
      low-level laser therapy (LLLT) becomes a technique of interest, due to its many&#xD;
      characteristics. However, the literature available on its success in pulpotomy is limited and&#xD;
      reported conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: To assess and compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of LLLT&#xD;
      and FC for pulpotomy in human primary teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Utilizing split-mouth technique, the sample consisted of 106 primary&#xD;
      molars from 36 children aging five to eight years. The teeth were selected based on specific&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic inclusion criteria and randomly assigned into two equal groups;&#xD;
      LLLT group and FC group. All the 106 primary molars were indicated for pulpotomy, where 53&#xD;
      teeth were treated using FC and 53 teeth were treated with LLLT. Teeth were evaluated&#xD;
      clinically and radiographically at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
