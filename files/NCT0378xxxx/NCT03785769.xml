  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the survival of restoration&#xD;
      with high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) with pre-etching with polyacrilic acid&#xD;
      compared with no pre-etching in order to treat occlusoproximais caries lesion in primary&#xD;
      molars, as well as the impact of those treatments in the caries lesion progression, the&#xD;
      cost-efficacy of the procedures and the discomfort reported by the patient. Children of 4 to&#xD;
      8 years will be selected in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of Universidade Ibirapuera. 192&#xD;
      teeth will be randomized in 2 experimental groups: (1) HVGIC restoration with pre-etching and&#xD;
      (2) HVGIC restoration with no pre-etching. Will be considered as primary outcome the survival&#xD;
      of the restoration evaluated after 6, 12, and 24 months by two trained examiners. The carious&#xD;
      lesions progression will be evaluated after 24 months of follow-up. The time of the&#xD;
      treatments and the cost of the materials will be considered to estimate the cost-efficacy of&#xD;
      each treatment. The discomfort reported by the participant will be measured after each&#xD;
      procedure following the Wong-Baker scale. For the primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier survival and&#xD;
      the Long-Rank test will be used in order to compare the two groups. Cox regression will be&#xD;
      performed in order to evaluate thee influence of explanatory variables on the outcome.&#xD;
