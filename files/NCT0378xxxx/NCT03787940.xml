    <textblock>
      The genetically polymorphic N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) is responsible for isoniazid&#xD;
      metabolism, and rapid acetylators were associated with low concentrations of isoniazid based&#xD;
      on previous studies. The investigators hypothesize that among rapid acetylators high dose&#xD;
      isoniazid would result in lower rates of death and disability in patients with tuberculous&#xD;
      meningitis than the rates with the standard regimen. The investigators recruited patients&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed TBM, then NAT2 genotype will be&#xD;
      characterized by using High-Resolution Melting Kit (Zeesan Company, Xiamen). Participants&#xD;
      with slow or intermediate acetylators will be administered with standard chemotherapy. For&#xD;
      participants with rapid acetylators, patients were stratified at study entry according to the&#xD;
      modified British Medical Research Council criteria (MRC grade), then randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive either standard or with high dose isoniazid treatment. All patients&#xD;
      received antituberculosis treatment, which consisted of isoniazid (standard dose or high&#xD;
      dose), rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 3 months, followed by isoniazid, rifampin and&#xD;
      ethambutol at the same doses for an additional 9 months. All patients received adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment with dexamethasone for the first 6 to 8 weeks of treatment. 338 participants with&#xD;
      rapid acetylators were randomly assigned to group B (standard treatment) and group C (high&#xD;
      dose isoniazid), respectively. At the same time, 338 participants with slow or intermediate&#xD;
      acetylators were recruited to group A (standard treatment). The primary outcome was death or&#xD;
      severe disability 12 months after enrollment. Secondary outcome measures were coma-clearance&#xD;
      time, fever-clearance time, and difference of laboratory examination (protein concentration,&#xD;
      chloride, glucose and white cell counts) of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most lethal form of tuberculosis, causing death or severe&#xD;
      neurologic deficits in more than half of those affected in spite of antituberculosis&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Among the first line drugs, isoniazid is the only bactericidal agent that&#xD;
      easily crossed blood-brain barrier, achieving concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      similar to those in serum. The genetically polymorphic N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) is&#xD;
      responsible for isoniazid metabolism, and individuals can be classified as &quot;rapid&#xD;
      acetylators&quot;, &quot;intermediate acetylators&quot; or &quot;slow acetylators&quot; based on NAT2 genotyping.&#xD;
      Rapid acetylators were associated with low concentrations of isoniazid based on previous&#xD;
      studies. The investigators hypothesize that among rapid acetylators high dose isoniazid would&#xD;
      result in lower rates of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis than&#xD;
      the rates with the standard regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recruited patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      TBM. Patients could not enter the trial if they have been using any other second line&#xD;
      antituberculosis drug; if they had received anti-tuberculosis therapy in the past 3 years；if&#xD;
      they have positive CSF Gram or India ink stain; if they have received more than 14 days of&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis drugs for the current infection; if they were known or suspected&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to or unacceptable side effects from any oral first line antituberculosis&#xD;
      drug; if the plasma creatinine concentration was more than the upper limit of the normal&#xD;
      range, if the plasma bilirubin concentration was more than 2 times the upper limit of the&#xD;
      normal range, or if the plasma alanine aminotransferase level was more than three times the&#xD;
      upper limit of the normal range; if they were known or suspected pregnancy; if they were&#xD;
      known or suspected isoniazid and/or rifampin resistant; if they were lack of consent； if they&#xD;
      were any participant for whom investigators judge this study is not appropriated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from four sites in China, including Beijing Chest Hospital&#xD;
      affiliated to Capital Medical University, Zunyi Medical College affiliated Hospital, Jiangxi&#xD;
      Provincial Chest Hospital and Jiamusi Infectious Disease Hospital. All hospitals serve the&#xD;
      local community and act as tertiary referral centers for patients with severe tuberculosis or&#xD;
      infectious diseases in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all patients. Then&#xD;
      NAT2 genotype will be characterized by using High-Resolution Melting Kit (Zeesan Company,&#xD;
      Xiamen). Participants with slow or intermediate acetylators will be administered with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (3 months HRZE followed by 9 months HRE). For participants with rapid&#xD;
      acetylators, patients were stratified at study entry according to the modified British&#xD;
      Medical Research Council criteria (MRC grade), then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either standard or high dose isoniazid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received antituberculosis treatment, which consisted of isoniazid (300 mg for&#xD;
      standard treatment and 900 mg for high dose treatment), rifampin (450 mg for weight no more&#xD;
      than 50 kg, 600 mg for weight more than 50 kg), pyrazinamide (1500 mg for weight no more than&#xD;
      50 kg, 1750 mg for weight more than 50 kg), ethambutol (750 mg for weight no more than 50 kg,&#xD;
      1000 mg for weight more than 50 kg) for 3 months, followed by isoniazid, rifampin and&#xD;
      ethambutol at the same doses for an additional 9 months. All patients received adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment with dexamethasone for the first 6 to 8 weeks of treatment, as recommend by British&#xD;
      Infection Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      338 participants with rapid acetylators will be randomly assigned to group B (standard&#xD;
      treatment) and group C (high dose isoniazid), respectively. The calculation assumes an&#xD;
      overall mortality and severe disability of 50% vs. 70 % in the two arms, a power of 80% and a&#xD;
      two-sided significance level of 5%. Randomization ration is 1:1. At the same time, 338&#xD;
      participants with slow or intermediate acetylators were recruited to group A (standard&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was death or severe disability 12 months after enrollment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures were coma-clearance time, fever-clearance time, and difference of CSF&#xD;
      laboratory examination (protein concentration, chloride, glucose and white cell counts) of&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid after 3 months treatment.&#xD;
