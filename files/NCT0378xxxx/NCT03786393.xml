      Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder accompanied by diffuse body&#xD;
      pain, increased fatigue and tenderness in specific anatomical regions, and sleep disturbance.&#xD;
      The higher prevalence of FMS in women and the observation of it from young adulthood suggest&#xD;
      the effect of sex hormones on the pathophysiology of this condition. Steroid hormones,&#xD;
      especially estrogen, have effects on both the peripheral and central nervous system receptors&#xD;
      (estrogen receptor-a [ERa] and estrogen receptor-b [ERb]), on the inflammatory process, and&#xD;
      on central pain delivery. However, the mechanism of action of these hormonal effects is still&#xD;
      unknown and is a matter of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that fibromyalgia syndrome and migraine are more common in women of reproductive age&#xD;
      and their incidence is higher than other populations suggests that these two diseases may&#xD;
      have a common genetic basis. Previous studies have shown that ESR-1 594G&gt; A (rs2228480),&#xD;
      ESR-1 325C&gt; G (rs2295190) polymorphisms significantly increase the risk of migraine&#xD;
      occurrence. However, there are no studies investigating these polymorphisms in FMS. In this&#xD;
      study, it was aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between ESR-1 594G&gt; A&#xD;
      (rs2228480) and ESR-1 325C&gt; G (rs2295190) polymorphisms and fibromyalgia disease.&#xD;

      Objective: The fact that fibromyalgia and migraine are more common in women of reproductive&#xD;
      age and their incidence are higher than other populations suggests that these three diseases&#xD;
      may have a common genetic basis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between ESR-1 594G&gt; A (rs2228480), ESR-1 325C&gt; G (rs2295190) polymorphisms and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), diffuse body pain, chronic musculoskeletal disease&#xD;
      with increased fatigue and tenderness and sleep disorder in specific anatomical regions . The&#xD;
      FMS diagnosis is based on American College of Rheumatology(ACR) 1990 classification criteria.&#xD;
      FM frequently affects women between 30 and 50 years of age and its prevalence is between 1%&#xD;
      and 4% of the whole population, 0-4% in men and 2.5-10.5% in women. Researchers have found&#xD;
      that the strong familial tendency in FM has a risk of developing FM in first-degree relatives&#xD;
      of patients with FM, 8 times more than in the general population. Family members of FM&#xD;
      patients are more susceptible to pain and are more likely to develop conditions such as&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), temporomandibular disorder (TMD), headache-migraine, restless&#xD;
      leg syndrome, and other regional pain syndromes . Several studies have been conducted to&#xD;
      demonstrate specific genetic polymorphism in FM. To date, polymorphisms in the serotonin&#xD;
      receptor, serotonin transporter, dopamine D4 receptor and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes&#xD;
      have been found to be high . All these identified polymorphisms are responsible for the&#xD;
      metabolism and transport of monoamines; These are compounds that play a critical role in the&#xD;
      human stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more frequent occurrence of FMS in women is observed in young adults, indicating the&#xD;
      effect of sex hormones on the pathophysiology of this condition. However, the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of these hormonal effects is still unknown and is a matter of debate. Steroid&#xD;
      hormones, in particular estrogen, affect both peripheral and central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      receptors (Estrogen Receptor-1; estrogen receptor-a [Era] and Estrogen Receptor-2;estrogen&#xD;
      receptor-b [ERb]), the inflammatory process and the transmission of central pain. For&#xD;
      example, estrogen may directly affect monocytes and macrophages to regulate the production of&#xD;
      cytokines (eg, Interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by episodes of hemicranial pain&#xD;
      characterized by attacks. one-year prevalence of migraine in the general population in Turkey&#xD;
      16.4%, while the proportion of patients with FM were significantly lower (9). The incidence&#xD;
      of headache increased in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. Migraine and non-migraine&#xD;
      headaches have been reported in patients with FM between 28% and 58% . Similarly, in a study&#xD;
      conducted on 33 FM patients, the current migraine was present at 45% and the lifetime&#xD;
      migraine history was 55% . The prevalence of migraine has been reported to be approximately&#xD;
      2-fold (reproductive period) and the severity of migraine attacks in women compared to men .&#xD;
      Studies investigating the relationship between sex hormone levels and polymorphisms due to&#xD;
      more frequent reproductive states have shown that they are associated with estrogen&#xD;
      receptor-alpha (ERa 594G&gt; A (rs2228480), ERa 325C&gt; G (rs2295190) polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Establishment of study groups: 100 patients diagnosed as Fibromyalgia syndrome&#xD;
      according to the criteria of ACR 1990, 18-65 years old, and having similar sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics. 100 control patients will be taken. As the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      patients; Being between 18 and 60 years of age, taking the diagnosis of primary FMS according&#xD;
      to ACR 1990 diagnostic criteria, accepting to participate in the study, lack of any sex&#xD;
      hormone disease. The control group will be composed of volunteers with similar age and gender&#xD;
      characteristics. The volunteers taken into the control group will have no sex hormone. The&#xD;
      participants will be informed about the subject before being taken into the study and the&#xD;
      necessary permits will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured sociodemographic information form prepared by us will be used in accordance&#xD;
      with the clinical experience and the information obtained from the scanned sources and the&#xD;
      aims of the study (ANNEX-1) Age, gender, education level, marital status, BMI, family history&#xD;
      of fibromyalgia diseases and accompanying symptoms. Accompanied by the symptoms; TMD symptoms&#xD;
      such as migraine type headache, jaw pain and locking, sleep disorder, dry mouth, dry eyes,&#xD;
      irritable bowel symptoms, restless leg symptoms, soft tissue swelling, fatigue, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms or depression history will be questioned. Patients with headache will be evaluated&#xD;
      by a neurologist in terms of the diagnosis of migraine. Pain evaluation of the cases will be&#xD;
      done by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). A 10 cm ruler will be used for this. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated once and the appropriate amount of blood samples will be collected from the&#xD;
      patients after the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Blood Samples: 5 mL blood samples from the control and patient groups will be&#xD;
      taken into sterile, citrate tubes. The blood in the tubes will be stored at -80 ° C until&#xD;
      isolation of the DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation of Genomic DNA: Genomic DNA will be isolated from the blood using a DNA isolation&#xD;
      kit. DNA purity will be determined by spectrophotometric method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping: Genotyping of ESR-1 325 C&gt; G and 594 G&gt; A polymorphisms in the study group will&#xD;
      be performed by using single nucleotide polymorphism analysis kit and sequence-specific&#xD;
      double-dye hydrolysis probes and allelic segregation analysis in real-time polimerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (RT-PCR) using primers. Genotyping of each patient and control will be repeated 3&#xD;
      times to ensure the reliability of the analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: The number of individuals to be included in the study was determined by&#xD;
      Statistical Power Analysis. In this study, when α = 0.05, β = 0.10, 1- β = 0.90, it was&#xD;
      decided to take 100 individuals to each patient and control groups, and the strength of the&#xD;
      test was found to be p = 0.9072. All data obtained from the study will be evaluated with SPSS&#xD;
      18 program. The χ2 test and Student-t and Mann-Whitney tests will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      suitability of nominal and continuous variables.&#xD;
