      This is a single centre, randomised, double blind, double-dummy, parallel group ,&#xD;
      multiple-dose, active and placebo controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ibuprofen 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets in subjects with postoperative dental pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will complete all screening procedures within 28 days before the surgery&#xD;
      and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening, subjects will provide written informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
      before any protocol specified procedures or assessments are completed. On Day 1, subjects who&#xD;
      continue to be eligible for study participation after completing screening procedures and&#xD;
      assessments will undergo extraction of 2 or more third molars. At least 1 of the third molars&#xD;
      must be a fully or partially bone impacted mandibular molar. If only 2 molars are removed,&#xD;
      then they must be ipsilateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine).&#xD;
      Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects who experience&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain intensity (a score of ≥ 5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0-10&#xD;
      where 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain ever) within 6 hours after surgery and who continue to&#xD;
      meet all study entry criteria will be randomised in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300 mg&#xD;
      ibuprofen PR tablets every 12 hours (Q12h), 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours&#xD;
      (Q8h), or placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by baseline pain category (moderate&#xD;
      or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the categories of none (0), mild (1-4),&#xD;
      moderate (5-7), and severe (8-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will re-assess their baseline pain intensity using the NRS immediately before&#xD;
      receiving study drug (pre-dose, Time 0) and their pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5&#xD;
      point categorical scale) at the following time points (pre-dose, if at one of the dosing&#xD;
      timepoints of 0, 8, 12 and/or 16 hours): 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&#xD;
      7, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after Time 0; and immediately before each dose of rescue&#xD;
      medication, if any. For assessments less than 1 hour apart a window of +/-2 min is allowable&#xD;
      whilst for assessments at least 1 hour apart a +/-5 min window is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The double stopwatch method will be used to record the time to perceptible pain relief and&#xD;
      time to meaningful pain relief during the 8 hours following the first dose or until subject&#xD;
      takes rescue medication. Subjects will complete a global evaluation of study drug 24 hours&#xD;
      (+/- 5 minutes) after Time 0 or immediately before the first dose of rescue medication&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first). Vital signs will be recorded after the subject has been in a&#xD;
      sitting position for 3 minutes at the following times: before surgery, within 30 minutes&#xD;
      before Time 0, 12 and 24 hours after Time 0, and/or immediately before the first dose of&#xD;
      rescue medication. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored and recorded from the time of&#xD;
      signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the Follow up Visit (or Early Termination&#xD;
      Visit). During the 24 hours following Time 0, subjects will complete efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments. Subjects will remain at the study site overnight and will be discharged on Day&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol / acetaminophen (1000 mg) will be permitted as the initial rescue medication.&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 60 minutes after receiving study drug before&#xD;
      taking rescue medication. If acetaminophen rescue medication is not effective in relieving&#xD;
      the subject's pain, 5 mg oxycodone rescue medication may be administered at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are not permitted to take any concomitant medications that might confound&#xD;
      assessments of pain relief, such as psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics&#xD;
      (other than those permitted for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five&#xD;
      times of their elimination half-lives (other than those used at the surgery). Selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior&#xD;
      to Visit 1 (screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other restrictions include the following: alcohol use is prohibited from 24 hours before&#xD;
      surgery until discharge on Day 2; nothing by mouth from midnight before surgery until 1 hour&#xD;
      after surgery; clear liquids only are allowed starting 1 hour after surgery until 1 hour&#xD;
      after dosing; 1 hour after dosing, the subject's diet may be advanced according to standard&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain medication for use at&#xD;
      home according to the standard practice of the study site. On Day 8 (± 2 days), subjects will&#xD;
      return to the study site for an abbreviated confirmatory physical assessment and AE&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The dental pain model used in this study is a robust and well established postsurgical pain model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity. The model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active drugs from each other, as well as from placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to other general pain conditions.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
          -  Requires extraction of 2 or more third molars. At least 1 of the third molars must be&#xD;
             a fully or partially bone impacted mandibular molar. If only 2 molars are removed,&#xD;
             then they must be ipsilateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experiences moderate to severe pain intensity within 6 hours after surgery, as&#xD;
             measured by a numeric rating scale (NRS) score of ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective&#xD;
             method of contraception throughout the study. A highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) when used consistently and correctly, such as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. surgical sterilisation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. contraceptive implants or injectables&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. combined oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. some intrauterine devices (IUDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. true sexual abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the&#xD;
                  duration of the trial; or withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. vasectomised partner. To be considered not of child-bearing potential, females&#xD;
                  must be surgically sterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or post-menopausal (defined as no menses for 12&#xD;
                  months in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy,&#xD;
                  confirmed by a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal&#xD;
                  range at Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of clinically significant abnormal findings as determined by medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests and ECG.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity reactions or allergy (e.g., asthma, rhinitis, angioedema or&#xD;
             urticaria) in response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including&#xD;
             ibuprofen), acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), ingredients of the study drug, or any&#xD;
             other drugs used in the study, including anaesthetics and antibiotics that may be&#xD;
             required on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If female, has a positive pregnancy test at screening (serum) or on the day of surgery&#xD;
             prior to surgery (urine), or is lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known or suspected, (in the opinion of the investigator), history of alcoholism or&#xD;
             drug abuse within 2 years of screening or evidence of tolerance or physical dependence&#xD;
             before dosing with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

             such as psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics (other than those&#xD;
             permitted for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five times of&#xD;
             their elimination half-lives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and&#xD;
             serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject&#xD;
             has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Visit 1 (screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is considered by the investigator, for any reason (including, but not limited to the&#xD;
             risks described as precautions, warnings and contraindications in the current version&#xD;
             of the investigator's brochure (IB) for 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets), to be an&#xD;
             unsuitable candidate to receive the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of chronic use (defined as daily use for &gt; 2 weeks) of nonsteroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs), opiates, or glucocorticoids (except inhaled nasal steroids&#xD;
             and topical corticosteroids), for any condition within 6 months before dosing with&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has significant difficulties swallowing capsules or tablets or is unable to tolerate&#xD;
             oral medication.&#xD;
