      This study is a phase II study of AZD6738 in combination with durvalumab in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumor (cohort A (N=30): GC who have failed secondary chemotherapy treatments regimen;&#xD;
      cohort B (B=30): melanoma patients who have failed to IO). Patients will receive AZD6738 plus&#xD;
      durvalumab combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD6738 will be administered at 240 mg twice daily on days 1 to 7 in Cycle 0 (lead-in period)&#xD;
      and therafter at 240 mg BD on days 22 to 28 in a 28-day cycle. Durvalumab will be&#xD;
      administered at 1500 mg every 4 weeks from cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation using modified RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days&#xD;
      prior to first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40,&#xD;
      then every 12 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the&#xD;
      scheduled date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive treatment with AZD6738 and durvalumab provided that the&#xD;
      treatment is tolerable and there is evidence of clinical benefit (as judged by the&#xD;
      investigator) and secure supply of medication. Upon confirmation of objective disease&#xD;
      progression, or treatment disconiutation criteria are met, both durvalumab and AZD6738 must&#xD;
      be discontinued. Patients may continue with AZD6738/durvalumab beyond objective disease&#xD;
      progression (determined by modified RECIST 1.1) at the discretion of the investigator if they&#xD;
      are clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If either durvalumab and/or AZD6738 are deemed intolerable (as judged by the investigator) so&#xD;
      that discontinuation of either agent is deemed in the patient's best interest despite dose&#xD;
      interruptions, dose modification and initiation of supportive treatments, both durvalumab and&#xD;
      AZD6738 must be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from the study. Patients are not&#xD;
      permitted to continue either AZD6738 or durvalumab as monotherapy. There is no maximum&#xD;
      duration of treatment with AZD6738 and durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities used for modified RECIST 1.1 assessment will be CT or MRI scans of&#xD;
      chest,abdomen and pelvis. modified RECIST 1.1 scans will be analysed by the investigator on&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be requested to provide tumour samples from the primary or metastatic&#xD;
      tumours pre-study and on progression. Sample provision is mandatory, subject to aspecific&#xD;
      consent, and will aid understanding of resistance mechanisms. However, if biopsy site is not&#xD;
      feasible, the protocol will allow waiving the rebiopsy procedure.&#xD;

      Target subject population&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two cohorts for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Patients with refractory gastric cancer who have failed secondary chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments for advanced disease will be enrolled. Patients must have imaging confirmed&#xD;
      progression on previous chemotherapy for gastric cancer treatment with at least one&#xD;
      measurable lesion per modified RECIST 1.1. GC patients must not have received previous&#xD;
      therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Prior exposure to AZD6738 is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients with metastatic melanoma patients who have failed prior anti-PD(L)1 will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Anti-PD(L)1 therapy should be the immediate prior regimen before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment Patients will continue to receive treatment with AZD6738 and durvalumab&#xD;
      provided that the treatment is tolerable and there is evidence of clinical benefit (as judged&#xD;
      by the investigator) and secure supply of medication. Upon confirmation of objective disease&#xD;
      progression, or treatment disconiutation criteria are met, both durvalumab and AZD6738 must&#xD;
      be discontinued. Patients may continue with AZD6738/durvalumab beyond objective disease&#xD;
      progression (determined by RECIST 1.1) at the discretion of the investigator if they are&#xD;
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If either durvalumab and/or AZD6738 are deemed intolerable (as judged by the investigator) so&#xD;
      that discontinuation of either agent is deemed in the patient's best interest despite dose&#xD;
      interruptions, dose modification and initiation of supportive treatments, both durvalumab and&#xD;
      AZD6738 must be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from the study. Pateints are not&#xD;
      permitted to continue either AZD6738 or durvalumab as monotherapy. There is no maximum&#xD;
      duration of treatment with AZD6738 and durvalumab.&#xD;
