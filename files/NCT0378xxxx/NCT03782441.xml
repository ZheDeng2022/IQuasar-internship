      This explorative clinical study has been launched to collect spectral Raman data paired with&#xD;
      validated glucose reference values in diabetic patients.&#xD;

      The Investigational Medical Device (IMD) for this investigation is the Prototype 0.5 (P0.5)&#xD;
      developed and manufactured by RSP Systems (RSP). The device is intended for non-invasive&#xD;
      interstitial intermittent glucose monitoring in persons (age 18 and older) with diabetes. The&#xD;
      technology relies on the well-established capacities of Raman spectroscopy for directly&#xD;
      detecting glucose subcutaneously. The Raman spectroscopy physical principle relies on the&#xD;
      fact that when laser light of a given wavelength interferes with a molecule, a small fraction&#xD;
      of the incident light will interact with the vibrational states of the molecule, causing the&#xD;
      photons to lose a portion of their energy which will change the wavelength of the light. The&#xD;
      scattered light will be collected by the optical probe head and analyzed with advanced&#xD;
      algorithms to correlate the signal to glucose concentrations. Data collected from the IMD&#xD;
      will be paired with validated glucose reference values collected by the finger sticking&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
