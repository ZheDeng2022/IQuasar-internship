  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exploiting recent methodological advancements, several neuroimaging studies suggested that&#xD;
      multisensory integration emerges from a dynamic interplay of distributed regions operating in&#xD;
      large-scale networks. Nonetheless, the cortical structures and neuronal networks underlying&#xD;
      the development of multisensory perception and plasticity, throughout the life span, have not&#xD;
      yet been studied in detail. A special case of multisensory training is musical training,&#xD;
      which utilizes stimulus' structural complexity, as well as the emotional drive that music is&#xD;
      generating to the subjects, in order to induce augmented neuroplastic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retaining the extensive neuroplastic characteristics of music training, MUSICPLAST will&#xD;
      develop, investigate and deliver a computer provided multisensory training protocol that aims&#xD;
      to induce neuroplastic changes in frontotemporal cortical areas. More specifically, the goal&#xD;
      of the proposed project is threefold: (a) The in-depth understanding and modeling of the&#xD;
      developmental trajectory of the cortical networks underlying multisensory perception, (b) the&#xD;
      modeling of the developmental trajectory of the cortical networks underlying multisensory&#xD;
      plasticity throughout the life span of healthy subjects; and (c) the translation of this&#xD;
      model in a computer provided multisensory training intervention protocol, which will cause&#xD;
      beneficial neuroplastic changes in pathological populations. Electroencephalographic,&#xD;
      behavioral and neuropsychological measurements, and advanced data analysis procedures, pre-&#xD;
      and post the training application are going to be employed in order to evaluate the resulting&#xD;
      neuroplasticity holistically. The proposed protocol will also be translated into an applied&#xD;
      intervention for 2 groups of pathological population, for which there are strong evidence&#xD;
      that a multisensory cognitive training based on music may provide beneficial neuroplastic&#xD;
      changes: elderlies suffering from mild cognitive Impairment and adolescents with dyslexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is performed in the Laboratory of Medical Physics of the Aristotle University of&#xD;
      Thessaloniki. It takes advantage of the extensive background of the laboratory in music and&#xD;
      neuroscience, in multisensory perception and in applications that translate basic&#xD;
      neuroscientific knowledge into computer based interventions for young adults and elderlies,&#xD;
      building up a solid neuroscientific ground on which multidisciplinary characteristics of the&#xD;
      project stand.&#xD;

      Goals and research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal of MUSICPLAST is to explore in-depth the development of audiovisual perception&#xD;
      in the healthy human brain describing in detail the corresponding cortical networks involved.&#xD;
      High density EEG measurements (128 channels) are going to be employed for the realization of&#xD;
      this goal following a stimulation protocol which incorporates auditory, visual and&#xD;
      audiovisual correspondences in a unified multisensory oddball paradigm. Behavioral and&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation of the multisensory perceptual abilities of the subjects will&#xD;
      be performed in order to achieve a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. The within&#xD;
      subjects comparison of the different conditions will reveal the corresponding network, while&#xD;
      the between subjects, its developmental trajectory. The hypothesis of this experiment, is&#xD;
      that the network underlying audiovisual perception will be comprised from cortical areas&#xD;
      connecting widespread regions including dorsolateral regions of the frontal cortex. Regarding&#xD;
      its development, and based on the fact that behaviorally multisensory integration continues&#xD;
      to improve in healthy aging, it is hypothesized that the network will be reorganized showing&#xD;
      enhanced density and efficiency as the age progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal of MUSICPLAST is to explore in-depth the plasticity of the cortical network&#xD;
      underlying audiovisual perception in the healthy human brain, as induced via a computer&#xD;
      provided short-term musical reading training. Pre- and post- training high-density EEG,&#xD;
      behavioral and neuropsychological measurements are going to be employed for the realization&#xD;
      of this goal following the same stimulation paradigm as for the previously mentioned goal.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this experiment, is that the network underlying audiovisual perception will&#xD;
      be reorganized showing enhanced global density and efficiency, greater connectivity between&#xD;
      temporal and frontopolar regions and a gradual decline of the amount of plasticity as a&#xD;
      result of the age increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third goal of MUSICPLAST is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed computerized&#xD;
      music reading training protocol as a tool that will promote beneficial neuroplastic changes&#xD;
      in pathological populations and specifically, dyslectic adolescents and elderlies. Pre- and&#xD;
      post- training high-density EEG, behavioral and neuropsychological measurements are going to&#xD;
      be employed for the realization of this goal following the same stimulation paradigm as for&#xD;
      the previously mentioned goals. The hypothesis of this experiment, is that the network&#xD;
      underlying audiovisual perception will be beneficially reorganized due to the training&#xD;
      showing enhanced global density and efficiency, greater connectivity between temporal and&#xD;
      frontopolar regions and that these changes will be accompanied from improvement in the&#xD;
      corresponding behavioral and neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design and methodology Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size analysis was conducted via G-Power based on the data from a previous relevant&#xD;
      study of the PI and indicated that the desired sample size in order to reach a power of 0.8&#xD;
      and a two sided significance level of a = 0.05 is 13 subjects in each group. In order to&#xD;
      account for possible dropouts, MUSICPLAST will include 20 subjects in each group [adolescents&#xD;
      (n = 20), young adults (n = 20), elderlies (n = 20) and controls (n=20)]. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki with regard to the participation of human&#xD;
      subjects in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG and behavioral measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the beginning of the training and after its completion, the participants will be&#xD;
      subjected into 2 electroencephalographic measurements. The recordings will be performed in an&#xD;
      electromagnetically shielded room located in the Medical Physics Laboratory of AUTH using a&#xD;
      Nihon Kohden EEG-1200 system with 128 active electrodes. The first measurement will be of&#xD;
      resting state activity, allowing a network analysis of resting state cortical connectivity&#xD;
      while the second will record Event Potentials via a multisensory oddball paradigm which is&#xD;
      appropriately adjusted for audiovisual perception, as it incorporates audiovisual, auditory&#xD;
      and visual mismatches within one run. This paradigm has been proposed and successfully&#xD;
      applied in a series of studies by the PI and it allows both a spatiotemporal analysis of the&#xD;
      cortical activity as well as a functional connectivity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrently to the EEG measurements the subjects will respond behaviorally via button&#xD;
      presses to an audiovisual congruency task on which they have to evaluate whether the images&#xD;
      presented correspond to the tones they hear based on the rule &quot;the higher the pitch of the&#xD;
      tone - the higher the position of the circle&quot;. This measurement will allow the behavioral&#xD;
      evaluation of the discrimination accuracy of congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the beginning of the training and after its completion, the participants will be&#xD;
      subjected into a neuropsychological evaluation, which will consist of a battery including the&#xD;
      following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroop Test Trail A and B Digit Span Test Performance Subtest of Wechsler Intelligence Scale&#xD;
      Children III or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale according to the age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderlies only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslectics only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Word and nonword reading Word and nonword spelling Phonological ability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - MUSICPLAST training protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive 20 sessions of the computerized training based on a simplified&#xD;
      music reading within a period of 4 weeks. The training will be provided via a smartphone or a&#xD;
      tablet. The application will record a log file for each training session, which will last for&#xD;
      20 minutes and the log file will be directly available to the researcher, allowing him/her to&#xD;
      follow the timely participation and commitment of the subject. The stimuli used in the&#xD;
      training protocol will be constructed along the same principles of the audiovisual stimulus&#xD;
      patterns used in the EEG recordings: a visual image will show a circle on top of a background&#xD;
      of 5 horizontal lines. The duration of the patterns will be of a mean duration of 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position of the circle within the five lines will either follow the rule &quot;the higher the&#xD;
      pitch of the tone, the higher the position of the circle&quot; or it will violate the above rule.&#xD;
      This rule was in principle followed also in previous studies conducted by the PI with&#xD;
      positive results regarding the induced neuroplasticity. The visual images will only represent&#xD;
      the frequency of the pitch and not the rhythmical pattern. The participant will have to&#xD;
      respond at the end of each trial via a button press whether the audiovisual input confirmed&#xD;
      or violated the above presented rule. A feedback image of a smiling face for the correct&#xD;
      responses or a not smiling face for the incorrect responses will be provided for each trial.&#xD;
      The protocol will be of adjusted difficulty, having 5 levels of difficulty which will be&#xD;
      based on 2 different factors: the presentation speed, and the difficulty of the musical&#xD;
      pattern. In contrast to the EEG measurement procedure, during which the melodic patterns will&#xD;
      be unknown to the subjects, the melodic patterns used in the training will be comprised of&#xD;
      short but identifiable parts of known musical pieces in order to engage the participants and&#xD;
      to provoke emotional response. The training will be improved in comparison to the&#xD;
      corresponding previous studies of the PI by providing feedback and by the use of known&#xD;
      musical pieces which will induce an emotional response to the trainees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG data analysis and statistical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG data collected will be pre-processed using the Brain Electrical Source Analysis&#xD;
      software (BESA research, version 6, Megis Software, Heidelberg, Germany). The recorded data&#xD;
      will be separated in epochs of 1000 ms including a pre-stimulus interval of 200 ms. Epochs&#xD;
      will be baseline corrected using the interval from -100 to 0 ms. Current Density&#xD;
      Reconstructions (CDRs) will be calculated on the neural responses of each subject and each&#xD;
      condition using the sLORETA method55 as provided by BESA. The Matlab ® (The MathWorks, Inc.,&#xD;
      Natick, Massachusetts, United States.) toolbox HERMES56 will be used for calculating the&#xD;
      adjacency matrix from the voxel time-series. The toolbox Network Based Statistic (NBS) will&#xD;
      be used to statistically identify significant connections in the graphs, using a General&#xD;
      Linear Model approach. For the statistical analysis of the data a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 mixed model&#xD;
      ANOVA design will be followed, with 3 within subjects factors: condition (congruent and&#xD;
      incongruent), modality (audiovisual, auditory, and visual) and time (pre- and post- training)&#xD;
      and one between subjects: (age group). The significance level will be set to p &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      corrected for multiple comparisons via Family Wise Error correction.&#xD;
