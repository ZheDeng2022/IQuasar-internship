      The purpose of our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large number of coagulability tests done before a number of surgeries, specially&#xD;
      otolaryngology procedures, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, as well as a part of&#xD;
      epistaxis workup, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were checked,&#xD;
      and it was found that in some people there is an isolated elongated PT, a low level of factor&#xD;
      VII was found in these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to find a correlation between the value of PT\INR and the&#xD;
      level of factor VII, we tried to do so by a retro-prospective study on patients known to have&#xD;
      a factor VII deficiency at Laniado hospital, such a correlation could make both the diagnosis&#xD;
      and the management of people with factor VII deficiency easier and more accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collection : On the children's population who are known for their lack of Factor&#xD;
           VII, we will check PT levels, we will concentrate the data in the table, along with&#xD;
           personal information such as age and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Processing : We will try to conduct a statistical relationship between the PT&#xD;
           values and Factor VII levels, to look for statistical significance, we will try to find&#xD;
           a model for predicting the level of factor VII based on PT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ages of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0-18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sexes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A participant who is 0-18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A participant who is, except for bleeding tendency, healthy in general&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A participant who has elongated PT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A participant who has normal PTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of anti coagulation drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is of a retrospective type, we already have a number of subjects, we need more as&#xD;
      to reach statistical significance, so the expectation is two to three months&#xD;

      Factor VII is one of the main components of the coagulation process. It belongs to the serine&#xD;
      proteases and it dependents on vitamin K in order to function. Its primary function is to&#xD;
      initiate the clotting process itself, along with tissue factor: Following a vascular&#xD;
      endothelial injury, there is a response of vasoconstriction, the blood flow in contact with&#xD;
      the subendothelial matrix, at that time, TF, a protein in the same matrix, binds to and&#xD;
      activates the VII coagulation factor, then, FVIIa-TF complex begins the coagulation cascade,&#xD;
      at the end of that cascade, fibrin is formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factor VII gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13, sized 12 kD, contains 12&#xD;
      axons that encode a protein composed of 406 amino acids, it's located at a distance of 2.8 kD&#xD;
      from the gene of factor X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 120 mutations have been found in factor VII gene to date, the association between&#xD;
      genotype and phenotypes is unclear in most cases however. Seligsohn and his colleagues&#xD;
      described one of the mutations in Factor VII, 5-Ser339Phe, which was found in three Tunisian&#xD;
      families and caused a tendency to bleed through a mechanism of reduced factor X activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it comes to Factor VII deficiency, the missing is never hermetic as such condition is&#xD;
      not compatible with life as seen from work on knockout mice. Partially missing factor VII is&#xD;
      the most common of all rare coagulation problems. Clinically, these are usually epistaxis,&#xD;
      easy bruising, gum bleeding, muscle hematoma, hamarhtrosis, hematuria, postoperative&#xD;
      bleeding, although there may also be conditions of life threatening blood in the nervous&#xD;
      system and in the gastrointestinal tract. Except for increased menstruation that occurs in&#xD;
      about 70% of the women with factor VII deficiency, there is no gender difference in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspicion of Factor VII deficiency is usually done in the course of screening in family&#xD;
      members with a known deficiency or on tests following an episode of bleeding, such as&#xD;
      epistaxis or surgery in areas with a tendency to bleed (nose, throat or teeth) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An abnormal PT test indicates a lack of factor VII. An elongated PTT test can suggest&#xD;
      hemophilia A and B (missing factors VIII and IX, respectively), lack of factor XI, incomplete&#xD;
      factor XII or von disease willebrand / VWF . The extension of PT also implies a deficiency in&#xD;
      the factors X, V, II and fibrinogen, and the result is represented by a percentage relative&#xD;
      to normal people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Factor VII deficiency is laboratory. The initial laboratory tests are PT,&#xD;
      aPTT and platelet count, followed by a FVII coagulant activity test for prolonged PT states.&#xD;
      In order to confirm the result, the FVII assay is performed again&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prothrombin time is typically analyzed by a laboratory technologist on an automated&#xD;
      instrument at 37 Â°C. Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid sodium citrate, which&#xD;
      acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then&#xD;
      centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as prothrombin time is most commonly&#xD;
      measured using blood plasma). A sample of the plasma is extracted from the test tube and&#xD;
      placed into a measuring test tube Next an excess of calcium is added to the test tube,&#xD;
      thereby reversing the effects of citrate and enabling the blood to clot again. Finally, in&#xD;
      order to activate the extrinsic / tissue factor clotting cascade pathway, tissue factor is&#xD;
      added and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. The prothrombin ratio&#xD;
      (INR) is the prothrombin time for a patient sample divided by the result for control plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of Factor VII deficiency. The first is a quantitative with both a lack of&#xD;
      FVII coagulant activity and with a low level of FVII antigen, the second one is qualitative&#xD;
      with a low FVII coagulant activity but a normal level of FVII antigen. In fact, the&#xD;
      examination of the antigen distinguishes between these two missing types, but does not&#xD;
      predict the tendency to bleed, and it is not recommended to diagnose Factor VII deficiency on&#xD;
      the basis of the antigen test. However, for known patients receiving a recombinant factor it&#xD;
      can be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no clear guidelines for the treatment of hereditary deficiency VII. Recombinant&#xD;
      factor VII is a choice in many cases for both children and adults, but there are other&#xD;
      treatment options as discussed in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to find a correlation between the value of PT\INR and the&#xD;
      level of factor VII, we tried to do so by a retro-prospective study on patients known to have&#xD;
      a factor VII deficiency at Laniado hospital, such a correlation could make both the diagnosis&#xD;
      and the management of people with factor VII deficiency easier and more accessible.&#xD;
