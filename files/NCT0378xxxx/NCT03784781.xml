      The main objectives of this study are to show that the number of type 2 innate lymphoid cells&#xD;
      (ILC2) of the bronchial mucosa and in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) are higher in asthmatic&#xD;
      children than in non-asthmatics, that the number of ILC2 of the bronchial mucosa and in BAL&#xD;
      correlate with the number of bronchial and BAL eosinophils, and to determine whether there is&#xD;
      a correlation between plasma and bronchial and BAL ILC2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma of the child is characterized by chronic eosinophilic infiltration of the&#xD;
      bronchial mucosa associated with bronchial remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for these phenomena are still misunderstood. Animal models suggest&#xD;
      that type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) may be responsible for inflammation and bronchial&#xD;
      remodeling in asthma. In mice, ILC2 stimulated by the pulmonary epithelium by viral&#xD;
      aggression or allergenic exposure release cytokines of the TH2 type such as IL-5 and IL-13&#xD;
      and amphiregulin, involved in the recruitment and differentiation of eosinophils,&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion and the restoration of epithelial integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, ILC2 would be more abundant in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral&#xD;
      blood of asthmatic patients compared to control subjects. However, the presence of ILC2 in&#xD;
      the bronchial mucosa of asthmatic patients has never been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis tested is that ILC2 are more abundant in bronchial mucosa, BAL, and blood in&#xD;
      children with severe asthma than in non-asthmatics. The results of this study would improve&#xD;
      the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for bronchial inflammation in asthma, consider&#xD;
      therapies to prevent its development and modify the natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to show that the number of ILC2 in bronchial mucosa and&#xD;
      BAL is higher in asthmatic children than in non-asthmatics, that the number of ILC2 in the&#xD;
      bronchial mucosa and BAL is correlated with the number of eosinophils in bronchial mucosa and&#xD;
      BAL, to determine whether the number of ILC2 in lungs correlate with asthma symptoms, and to&#xD;
      determine whether there is a correlation between plasma and bronchial ILC2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy with BAL and bronchial mucosal biopsies will be performed in 20 children with&#xD;
      severe asthma and 20 control subjects in the department of pediatric pulmonology and allergy&#xD;
      of Necker Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILC2 will be identified in the BAL, in the bronchial mucosa and peripheral blood by flow&#xD;
      cytometry. The median values of the number of ILC2 will be compared between asthmatic and&#xD;
      non-asthmatic patients by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. The correlations will be&#xD;
      established by the Spearman rank test. A value of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
