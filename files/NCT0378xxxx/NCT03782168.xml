  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study conducted on women with a suspected/confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      placental abruption. Maternal blood samples will be taken at various points during the&#xD;
      peripartum period. A healthy group of women admitted for delivery will act as a matched&#xD;
      control and will have their blood sampled at similar time points. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variables will include the total number of micro-particles, the number of micro-particles&#xD;
      from each cell line (platelet, placental, endothelial etc.), and protein markers&#xD;
      (specifically; placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1),&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble endoglin (sEng)). Secondary outcomes if&#xD;
      will examine the correlation between placental micro-particles, biomarkers, and extent of&#xD;
      placental abruption.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine how well maternal serum biomarkers and placental&#xD;
      micro-particles (MP) correlate with PA. The sensitivity and specificity of these proteins&#xD;
      will be analyzed to further increase our understanding of the pathological mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in PA. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential to develop a&#xD;
      diagnostic test for PA with the ability to improve outcomes for mother and baby through&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis and targeted therapy.&#xD;
