      The aim:1) To test the correlation of pCLE-obtained features with histological findings in&#xD;
      UC; comparing the real-time conventional colonoscopy Baron score with CLE assessment. 2) To&#xD;
      test the accuracy of the investigators previously proposed simplified four-grade&#xD;
      classification system of crypt architecture in evaluating inflammation activity in UC by&#xD;
      pCLE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with acute inflammatory infiltrates seen on histological assessment are more likely&#xD;
      to experience relapse than are those without infiltrates,studies suggest that severity of&#xD;
      inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of inflammation activity by conventional colonoscopy is inaccurate in the&#xD;
      prediction of acute inflammation in some cases. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows&#xD;
      for real-time endoscopy and histological diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. In our&#xD;
      previous study, we confirmed a simplified four-grade classification system of crypt&#xD;
      architecture(Grade A :normal; Grade B: an irregular arrangement of colonic crypts with normal&#xD;
      size and shape, and enlarged spaces between crypts; Type C: an enlarged crypt opening and a&#xD;
      more irregular crypt arrangement than type B; Type D: crypt destruction and / or crypt&#xD;
      abscess) by eCLE in predicting acute inflammation, and found a good correlation with&#xD;
      histology. In this study, the investigators aimed to test the accuracy of the proposed tne&#xD;
      four-grade classification system in evaluating inflammation activity in UC by pCLE.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A valuable realtime- and offline- diagnosis of pCLE in evaluating the inflammation activity in UC.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Recruited more than 100 UC patients,pCLE diagnostic criteria was the four-grades crypt architecture classification system ( inactive cases with Grade A or B, active with Grade C or D), histological assessment according to the Geboes Index ( inactive disease with Geboes index â‰¤ 3.0; active disease with a index &gt; 3.0). Using Spearman's text, calculating the corelation between pCLE real-time finding and the Geboes index, if p&lt;0.05, it means a strong corelation,vice versa. Also for the offline diagnosis.&#xD;
Also calculate the corelation between white-light colonoscopy (Baron Score) and histopathology.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Good or Excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement of pCLE diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of interobserver variability of pCLE was conducted in a randomized pCLE videos' order by two independent investigators. After a 2-week interval, all pCLE videos were reassessed by the two investigators to evaluate the intraobserver agreement.</description>
