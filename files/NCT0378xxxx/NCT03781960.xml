    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of&#xD;
      nivolumab and abemaciclib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Other goals of this&#xD;
      study are to learn about the side effects that this combination of drugs may cause and to&#xD;
      learn more about how these drugs work by studying blood and tissue.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is inoperable (where surgery is&#xD;
             not indicated due to disease extent, co-morbidities, or other technical reasons)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologic confirmation of HCC is not required for screening but is required prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study treatment. Subjects with hepatocholangiocarcinoma or&#xD;
             cholangiocarcinoma are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tumor must be positive for retinoblastoma (RB) expression by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;

             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Childs-Pugh score of &lt;7&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Local or loco-regional therapy to the liver (i.e. surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic&#xD;
             arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous&#xD;
             ethanol injection, or cryoablation) must have been completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must be willing to undergo a pretreatment and on-treatment biopsy and have a tumor&#xD;
             site that is accessible for core needle biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Measurable or evaluable disease as defined by RECIST v. 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed&#xD;
             within 7 days of the first dose of abemaciclib (see Appendix A for definition of&#xD;
             childbearing potential). Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an&#xD;
             approved contraceptive method (detailed in Appendix A) for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and an additional 3 weeks after the final dose of abemaciclib.&#xD;

             screening&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             subject from signing the informed consent form 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Use of&#xD;
             any chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to the first study treatment date 4. Use of any&#xD;
             experimental therapy within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the&#xD;

             topical skin, nasal, and/or ophthalmic corticosteroids). All other systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids above physiologic replacement dosing must be discontinued at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to first study treatment 15. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence as&#xD;

             therapy at the start of protocol treatment 17. A second primary malignancy that, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, may affect the interpretation of results 18. Any&#xD;
             illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the safety of&#xD;
             the subject or the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. interstitial lung disease,&#xD;
             severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen therapy, history of major surgical&#xD;
             resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline Grade 2 or&#xD;
             higher diarrhea) 19. Personal history of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation, or sudden cardiac arrest 20. Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone&#xD;
             marrow transplantation 21. Pre-existing thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that&#xD;
             cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication 22. Active autoimmune&#xD;
             disease, except for vitiligo, type 1 diabetes mellitus, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or&#xD;
             endocrinopathies manageable by hormone replacement; other autoimmune conditions may be&#xD;
             allowable at the discretion of the Principal Investigator 23. Any other conditions&#xD;
