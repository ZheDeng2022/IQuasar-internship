    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a useful tool used in modern medicine and it is increasingly being employed&#xD;
      for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. PEG is very often used for bowel preparation.&#xD;
      PEG solutions clean the bowel with less water and electrolyte shifts, primarily by causing&#xD;
      mechanical effect of large-volume lavage 1. However, there are some cases of hyponatremia&#xD;
      reported due to the use of PEG. Life-threatening fluid and electrolyte disturbances are more&#xD;
      likely to occur in patients with risk factors, such as old age, use of SSRIs and thiazide&#xD;
      diuretics, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure or with a history of electrolyte&#xD;
      abnormalities 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although sporadic case reports of hyponatremia and other electrolyte imbalances after bowel&#xD;
      preparation have been reported, but well-designed studies are lacking on this subject.&#xD;
      Literature search did not reveal any local studies on this subject. This study was designed&#xD;
      to find frequency of sodium disorders after bowel cleansing by Polyethylene glycol solution&#xD;
      for colonoscopies in Dr. Ruth K.M. Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi.&#xD;
