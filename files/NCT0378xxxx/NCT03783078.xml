  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, efficacy, and safety study of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      adult and pediatric participants with previously untreated advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
      (MCC). The primary objective of the trial is to assess the objective response rate, as&#xD;
      assessed by blinded independent central review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a&#xD;
      maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, following administration of pembrolizumab.&#xD;

    <description>The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). A CR is the disappearance of all target lesions; a PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; taking as reference the baseline sum diameters per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).</description>
