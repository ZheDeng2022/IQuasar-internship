  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will examine cooking as an intervention target for weight control in&#xD;
      overweight adults. The study will also examine whether interventions designed to promote&#xD;
      cooking at home can increase participants' sense of food agency, and overcome common barriers&#xD;
      to cooking at home such as time scarcity and budget constrictions. The study will utilize a&#xD;
      cooking pedagogy designed to not just teach participants the basics of cooking different&#xD;
      foods, but how to be efficient, mindful cooks. If cooking class participation positively&#xD;
      impacts diet and health outcomes, it will bolster the case for promoting cooking at home as a&#xD;
      health behavior for multiple populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      A two arm randomized control trial will examine whether the addition of an active cooking&#xD;
      lesson versus a passive observed lesson to a behavioral weight loss intervention results in&#xD;
      significantly greater weight loss. Additionally, the study will examine whether interventions&#xD;
      designed to promote cooking at home can increase participants' sense of food agency, and&#xD;
      overcome common barriers to cooking at home such as time scarcity and budget constrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants (n=64) will be recruited. Recruitment&#xD;
      and study initiation will occur in two waves. Wave 1 aims to recruit 32 individuals who will&#xD;
      then be randomized to 1) a 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight loss intervention with&#xD;
      12 bi-weekly cooking lessons; or, 2) the same 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight&#xD;
      loss intervention with 12 bi-weekly cooking demonstrations. Both groups get the same&#xD;
      intervention and the same counselor delivered intervention elements; the presence of active&#xD;
      cooking lessons vs. passive observed cooking demonstrations is the only difference between&#xD;
      conditions. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3 and 6 months. Wave 2 (n=32) will follow the&#xD;
      same process as Wave 1 approximately two months after Wave 1 is initiated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Behavioral Weight Loss Program: Investigators have developed and implemented a theory-based group-delivered behavioral weight control program in two previous studies that incorporates the elements of current thinking and empirical data on successful weight loss programs, including restricted calorie intake and increased physical activity. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track their food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on progress.&#xD;
The Cooking Program Active Intervention. Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings.&#xD;
Demonstrations. The demonstration condition will serve as an &quot;attention only&quot; control. All participants will have an opportunity to sample the prepared food at the end of class.

    <description>Difference in diet quality change between groups across assessments. Measured by Healthy Eating Index scores.&#xD;
The HEI includes 13 components that capture recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. There are two groupings of components:&#xD;
Adequacy components are encouraged. Higher scores reflect higher intakes.&#xD;
Moderation components should be limited. Higher scores reflect lower intakes. A higher total HEI score reflects higher diet quality as defined by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
Components are weighted equally and assigned a score of either 5 or 10. Scores as summed to determine total score. The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible is 100.&#xD;
Adequacy Components:&#xD;

    <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the Nutrition and Food Sciences (NFS) foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.</description>

            <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the NFS foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.&#xD;
Active Intervention - Cooking: Key behavioral strategies to facilitate making sustained changes in dietary habits and activity patterns are introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. In-person sessions facilitated by an interventionist provide the group meetings. The program provides 24 weekly facilitated group sessions over 6 months. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on individual progress.&#xD;

        <description>Difference in diet quality change between groups across assessments. Measured by Healthy Eating Index scores.&#xD;
The HEI includes 13 components that capture recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. There are two groupings of components:&#xD;
Adequacy components are encouraged. Higher scores reflect higher intakes.&#xD;
Moderation components should be limited. Higher scores reflect lower intakes. A higher total HEI score reflects higher diet quality as defined by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
Components are weighted equally and assigned a score of either 5 or 10. Scores as summed to determine total score. The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible is 100.&#xD;

            <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the NFS foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.&#xD;
Active Intervention - Cooking: Key behavioral strategies to facilitate making sustained changes in dietary habits and activity patterns are introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. In-person sessions facilitated by an interventionist provide the group meetings. The program provides 24 weekly facilitated group sessions over 6 months. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on individual progress.&#xD;

            <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the NFS foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.&#xD;
Active Intervention - Cooking: Key behavioral strategies to facilitate making sustained changes in dietary habits and activity patterns are introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. In-person sessions facilitated by an interventionist provide the group meetings. The program provides 24 weekly facilitated group sessions over 6 months. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on individual progress.&#xD;

        <title>Cooking Frequency Change - Dinner</title>
        <description>Dinner cooking frequency was assessed at baseline and 24 weeks using the cooking frequency subscale from the Cooking Perceptions/Attitudes/Confidence/Behaviors Survey. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7 meals cooked during a one week period.</description>

            <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the NFS foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.&#xD;
Active Intervention - Cooking: Key behavioral strategies to facilitate making sustained changes in dietary habits and activity patterns are introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. In-person sessions facilitated by an interventionist provide the group meetings. The program provides 24 weekly facilitated group sessions over 6 months. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on individual progress.&#xD;

Previous research suggests that demonstrations of cooking have little to no impact on cooking behavior, therefore, cooking demonstrations can be used to &quot;even out&quot; the time and attention devoted to the active cooking participants without introducing bias into the study design. Subjects in the demonstration condition will also begin with a brief lecture on the day's lesson followed by a cooking demonstration that covers the same topics as the active intervention group. All participants will receive the same printed information and also have an opportunity to sample the prepared food at the end of class.
