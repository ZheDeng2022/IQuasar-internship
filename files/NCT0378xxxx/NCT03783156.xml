    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the technique of choice for the diagnosis and prevention of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC). The identification and extirpation of adenomas decreases the incidence of CRC by up to&#xD;
      76%. More than 70% of the excised lesions are less than 10 mm. There is controversy about the&#xD;
      technique to be used (resection with cold vs hot snare) in lesions of 5-9mm. Both use a&#xD;
      polypectomy snare. The cold snare cuts by friction, while the hot snare uses electrical&#xD;
      current. We propose a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing both endoscopic&#xD;
      techniques. At least 394 injuries per group will be included, randomizing patients to whom a&#xD;
      diagnostic colonoscopy is requested for symptoms, screening or revision protocols.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed stratified by center. The primary objective is the proportion&#xD;
      of incomplete polypectomies, which will be analyzed centrally from random biopsies of the&#xD;
      edges of the lesion. As secondary objectives, we will compare the proportion of immediate and&#xD;
      delayed hemorrhagic complications, the evolution of postprocedural abdominal pain and the&#xD;
      factors associated with incomplete excision in each group and the factors associated with a&#xD;
      failed cold polypectomy. The analysis of the primary objective will be carried out by means&#xD;
      of the z test of homogeneity without using the correction of Yates, estimating the confidence&#xD;
      interval of the difference between both groups. The analysis will be carried out by intention&#xD;
      to treat and per protocol.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is&#xD;
           estimated that in 2008, 1233,000 new cases were diagnosed and more than 600,000 people&#xD;
           died for this reason throughout the world. Colonoscopy is the technique of choice for&#xD;
           both diagnosis and prevention, since the identification and removal of colonic adenomas&#xD;
           reduces the incidence of CRC by up to 76%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Different endoscopic techniques have been developed for the removal of adenomas; The&#xD;
           choice of some over others is made according to the size, morphology and location of the&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conceptual hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cold snare polypectomy presents a proportion of incomplete polypectomies similar to&#xD;
           polypectomy with hot snare.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Operational hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two endoscopic techniques will be compared from two groups created by a random&#xD;
           assignment to one or another type of polypectomy, evaluating the proportion of&#xD;
           non-excised polypoid tissue after it. This will be done from random biopsies of the&#xD;
           edges of the lesion and possible macroscopic remnants&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the proportion of incomplete polypectomies in both types of polypectomy (cold&#xD;
           snare vs. hot snare).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparing the proportion of immediate and delayed bleeding complications, total and&#xD;
           according to the severity that they present according to the American Society of&#xD;
           Gastroenterology (ASGE) classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparing the evolution of abdominal pain in the 5 hours postprocedure between both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluating factors associated with an incomplete extirpation in each group. Evaluating&#xD;
           factors associated with a failed cold polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multicenter randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy in a non-urgent setting.&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate before performing the colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization It will be done once the patient agrees to participate in the work and the&#xD;
      first candidate polyp has been identified. Each patient will be randomized (regardless of the&#xD;
      number of lesions per patient) so all lesions of each patient will be removed in the same&#xD;
      way. It will be stratified by center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not present any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria (pre-endoscopic) will be invited to participate in the study. The informed consent&#xD;
      will be completed according to the Spanish law 41/2002 of autonomy of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endoscopic procedure The interventions will be carried out in each of the participating&#xD;
           centers. The examinations will be performed under sedation according to the protocols&#xD;
           established in each center. Once the first lesion is identified, the method of&#xD;
           extirpation of the lesion will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cold Group: polypectomy with a cold snare will be carried out according to the&#xD;
                usual standards recommended by international societies. The lesion should be placed&#xD;
                if possible in the position equivalent to 5 o'clock on the dial, the end of the&#xD;
                snare will be placed several millimeters from the lesion and the tip of the&#xD;
                catheter will be angled downwards, without aspiration at any time to avoid&#xD;
                entrapment of the submucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hot Group: polypectomy with snare connected to the electrosurgical unit according&#xD;
                to the standards recommended by international societies, using a mixed current&#xD;
                (cut-coagulation). Once the lesion is captured, the snare is pulled up to slightly&#xD;
                separate it from the surrounding mucosa before polypectomy. Elevation of the lesion&#xD;
                prior to polypectomy will not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Common evaluation: once the polypectomies are completed, the base of the&#xD;
                polypectomies will be evaluated, taking biopsies from any suggestive area and also&#xD;
                2 random biopsies at the base of the polypectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postendoscopic follow-up After a minimum of 21 days and a maximum of 28 days from the&#xD;
           endoscopic examination, the patient will be contacted by telephone to collect the form&#xD;
           about the evolution of the abdominal symptoms and to collect data about the appearance&#xD;
           of complications (questions will be asked about visits to the hospital and in a targeted&#xD;
           manner about the most frequent symptoms of the usual complications (fever, hemorrhage,&#xD;
           abdominal pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Histological analysis The analysis of the specimens of the polypectomies will be carried&#xD;
           out in each center according to their usual protocol. The analysis of the biopsies of&#xD;
           the base of the polyp will be carried out centrally by a pathologist with more than 5&#xD;
           years of experience in digestive pathology. Samples from the base of the polyp will be&#xD;
           sent periodically from each center to the Salamanca university hospital through a&#xD;
           messenger service. The pathologist will be blinded regarding the histological diagnosis&#xD;
           of the excised polyp and the type of polypectomy (although it is true that it is&#xD;
           difficult to blind this last point since the presence of heat artifacts in those removed&#xD;
           with a hot handle is very frequent). The samples sent for centralized analysis will not&#xD;
           be stored, but will be destroyed once the study is completed according to standard&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming a proportion of incomplete polypectomies in both groups of 10% (using&#xD;
      the taking of biopsies as a diagnostic pattern) and setting an equivalence limit of 7%, a&#xD;
      total of 315 lesions per group are estimated to have an α risk of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
      Assuming a proportion of losses (polyps not recovered for histological study, polypectomies&#xD;
      of the failed Cold group of 20%), an estimated 394 lesions per group are needed, with a total&#xD;
      of 788 lesions in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection All the variables concerning the characteristics of the endoscopist, the&#xD;
      patient and the injuries included will be collected in each center. The variables related to&#xD;
      the histological diagnosis will be collected in the same way in the respective center. The&#xD;
      variables concerning the follow-up will be collected in a centralized manner, through a&#xD;
      telephone call that will be made between 3 and 4 weeks from the procedure. The variable&#xD;
      related to the histological study of the base of the polyp will be collected in a centralized&#xD;
      manner by the pathologist in charge of the analysis of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the data collection notebooks will be merged by the main researcher or&#xD;
      collaborating researchers anonymously, encrypted and dissociated from the clinical&#xD;
      information by means of a patient identification code (ID), in an online database. A copy of&#xD;
      the database will be used in each participating center, which will be merged after completing&#xD;
      the data collection. The responsible researcher will define an ID for each participant. The&#xD;
      data entered in the database will be anonymous and the database will be protected with a&#xD;
      password to which only the researchers will have access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unified file will be kept at the Río Hortega University Hospital and will be maintained&#xD;
      until the end of the study. Regarding the application of the Organic Law on Data Protection&#xD;
      15/1999 and 1720/2007 that develops it, it should be noted that the protocol defined in the&#xD;
      project oriented to epidemiological analysis, determines that the files will record&#xD;
      information completely anonymized&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Access program (Microsoft Corporation, Edmond, USA) will be used for the realization of&#xD;
      the database and the statistical analysis of them will be carried out through the STATA&#xD;
      program (StataCorp, 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, StataCorp&#xD;
      LP). In the quantitative variables, the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation will be&#xD;
      calculated (variables that do not follow a normal distribution according to the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be described with median, minimum, maximum and interquartile&#xD;
      range), and the qualitative ones will be expressed as percentages and your 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the primary objective, the proportion of incomplete polypectomies in both&#xD;
      groups will be compared by means of the z test of homogeneity without using the correction of&#xD;
      Yates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidence interval of the difference between the two groups will also be estimated. The&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out by intention to treat, regardless of the type of polypectomy&#xD;
      performed and per protocol (assigning the lesions assigned to the group Cold that are&#xD;
      extirpated with hot snare to the Hot group). To evaluate possible confounding factors&#xD;
      (endoscopist, nurse, snare type, location ...), the STATA confound user command will be used,&#xD;
      defining as a significant change that which conditions a change in the odds ratio greater&#xD;
      than 10% with respect to the one obtained with the complete model. In case several models do&#xD;
      not present differences greater than 10%, the most parsimonious will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the secondary objectives, the proportion of complications in both groups will be&#xD;
      verified by the de2 test. To evaluate the factors associated with incomplete polypectomies&#xD;
      and those associated with failed cold polypectomy, multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      techniques will be used.&#xD;
