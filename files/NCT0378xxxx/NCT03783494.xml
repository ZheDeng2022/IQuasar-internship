    <textblock>
      Procedural sedation is an emergency medicine technique that provides a brief, deep sedation&#xD;
      in order to perform very painful emergency emergent procedures such as displaced fracture or&#xD;
      dislocated joints reduction. Propofol is recommended for this purpose, injected administered&#xD;
      in slow IV bolus injections according to the technique known as manual titration. But despite&#xD;
      this precaution, temporarily excessive sedation can happen, and a side effect can appear&#xD;
      (arterial hypotension or respiratory depression). Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is an&#xD;
      anesthesia technique that permits to obtain a precise constant and stable concentration of&#xD;
      medication, boluses volumes of injection being calculated and delivered automatically by an&#xD;
      electric syringe equipped with a software obedient to existing pharmacokinetic models. In the&#xD;
      operating room, Ffor anesthetic induction, maintenance and awakening, respectively, in the&#xD;
      operating room, the brain concentrations of propofol range respectively from 2 to 6 μg/mL, 2&#xD;
      to 4 μg/mL, and between 0.8 and 1.2 μg/mL, respectively. Since TCI has never been used in&#xD;
      emergency departments (ED), the brain propofol concentrations which are necessary for&#xD;
      sedation and awakening of the patient are not known and must be determined experimentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-center, prospective, interventional study, safety and feasibility of TCI will&#xD;
      be studied in one ED with the primary objective of determining the brain propofol&#xD;
      concentrations necessary to reach the an optimal sedation in for patients with indications of&#xD;
      sustaining very painful orthopedic emergency emergent procedures&#xD;

      Procedural sedation is an emergency medicine technique that provides a brief, deep sedation&#xD;
      in order to perform very painful emergency emergent procedures such as displaced fracture or&#xD;
      dislocated joints reduction. For this purpose, propofol is a remarkable sedative agent for&#xD;
      its very short elimination half-life, antiemetic property and myorelaxant effects. It is&#xD;
      recommended to inject administer it in slow IV boluses injections according to the technique&#xD;
      known as manual titration, but despite this precaution, temporarily excessive sedation can&#xD;
      happen, and a side effect appear (arterial hypotension or respiratory depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is an anesthesia technique that permits to obtain a precise&#xD;
      constant and stable concentration of medication, boluses volumes of injection being&#xD;
      calculated and delivered automatically by an electric syringe equipped with a software&#xD;
      obedient to existing pharmacokinetic models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age, size and weight of the patient are filledentered, then the syringe delivers the&#xD;
      volume which is necessary and sufficient to reach and maintain the target concentration&#xD;
      chosen by the practitioner. For anesthetic induction in the operating room, the brain&#xD;
      concentrations of propofol used range from 2 to 6 μg/mL, then the general anesthesia&#xD;
      maintenance is obtained with 2 to 4 μg/mL, and the patient awakening usually happens between&#xD;
      0.8 and 1.2 μg/mL. Since TCI has never been used in emergency departments (ED), the brain&#xD;
      propofol concentrations which are necessary for sedation and awakening of the patient are not&#xD;
      known and must be determined experimentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-center, prospective, interventional study, safety and feasibility of TCI will&#xD;
      be studied in an ED with the primary objective of determining the brain propofol&#xD;
      concentrations necessary to reach the an optimal sedation in for patients with indications&#xD;
      ofsustaining very painful orthopedic emergency emergent procedures. As secondary objectives,&#xD;
      we will study the characteristics of sedations obtained (level, delays, lengths); the Delays,&#xD;
      lengths and levels of sedation obtained, overall delivered doses of propofol administered;&#xD;
      the , nature, appearance delays and lengths of potential adverse events (AE) related to&#xD;
      procedural sedation, particularly complications related to procedural sedation, and necessary&#xD;
      interventions necessary to handle these AE., will be studied as secondary objectives&#xD;
