    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single arm open label study, designed to test the to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and safety outcome of newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with NovoTTF-200A&#xD;
      concomitant to Radiotherapy/Temozolomide followed by Temozolomide. The device is a portable,&#xD;
      battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed&#xD;
      TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated&#xD;
      electrode arrays.&#xD;

      PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active chemotherapy in&#xD;
      extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life, and activity&#xD;
      within the brain (14% response rate). In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® combined with&#xD;
      maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance temozolomide alone has shown that combined&#xD;
      therapy led to a significant improvement in both progression free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without the addition of high grade&#xD;
      toxicity and without decline in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this trial are newly diagnosed GBM patients who underwent a biopsy&#xD;
      or surgery. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled to receive Radiotherapy(RT)/Temozolomide/NovoTTF-200A&#xD;
      followed by maintenance TMZ and NovoTTF-200A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline tests will be performed, The patients will be treated continuously with the device&#xD;
      until second progression. They will possibly receive a second line treatment that can be one&#xD;
      of the following: re-operation, local radiotherapy (gamma-knife), a second line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy or a combination of the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays&#xD;
      on the head. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the scalp before and&#xD;
      frequently during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for training and&#xD;
      monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain&#xD;
      their regular daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During RT, patients will be seen twice a week and the arrays will be removed to inspect the&#xD;
      skin condition. In addition during the trial, patients will need to return once every month&#xD;
      to the clinic where an examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will&#xD;
      be done. These routine visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not&#xD;
      progressing for the second time under the study treatment. If such occurs, patients will need&#xD;
      to return once per month for two more months to the clinic for similar follow up&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits to the clinic patients will be examined physically and neurologically.&#xD;
      Additionally, routine blood tests will be performed. A routine MRI of the head will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and every second month thereafter, until second progression. After this&#xD;
      follow up plan, patients will be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic&#xD;
      questions about their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on&#xD;
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of&#xD;
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic&#xD;
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change&#xD;
      their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately&#xD;
      leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which&#xD;
      act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields&#xD;
      interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular&#xD;
      components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects,&#xD;
      tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous&#xD;
      exposure to TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells&#xD;
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to&#xD;
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the&#xD;
      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally&#xD;
      dividing cells in healthy tissues.&#xD;

Maintenance treatment is to begin about 4 weeks after the end of TMZ/RT/NovoTTF-200A. TMZ is administered at the conventional dosing regimen for 5 days, every 28 days (i.e. 5 days of therapy, 23 days of rest). Cycle 1 is to be given at a dose of 150 mg/m^2 p.o. daily x 5 days, dose to be escalated to 200 mg/m^2 in the absence of toxicity.</description>
