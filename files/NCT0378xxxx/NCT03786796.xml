      Single arm, single site, open-label Phase II study of the effects of oral olaparib in&#xD;
      participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that harbor an inactivating mutation in&#xD;
      BAP-1, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, BRIP1, RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCL, PP2R2A,&#xD;
      RAD51B, RAD51D, or RAD54L who have had prior treatment with at least one immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor or anti-VEGF therapy. Must have measurable disease on CT imaging per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 20 participants. Following enrollment, participants will be&#xD;
      initially treated with olaparib 150mg by mouth twice daily for one month. After one month of&#xD;
      therapy, the dose of olaparib will be increased to 300mg by mouth twice daily provided there&#xD;
      are no grade 3 or greater adverse events experienced. All participants will be reassessed at&#xD;
      least monthly for toxicity, including laboratory investigations. Radiological scans will be&#xD;
      performed approximately every 3 months to assess for disease response. Treatment will be&#xD;
      continued until clinical and/or radiographic progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or&#xD;
      unmanageable toxicity requiring cessation.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Olaparib</intervention_name>
    <description>Olaparib is a crystalline solid, is non-chiral and shows pH-independent solubility of approximately 0.1 mg/mL across the physiological range. Olaparib is presented for oral administration as a green, film-coated tablet containing 25 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of drug substance. The 100 mg strength is also available as a yellow, film-coated tablet. The 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg strengths of olaparib tablets are composed of the same constituents. The tablet cores comprise: olaparib, copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, mannitol and sodium stearyl fumarate. The composition of the green tablet film coating is: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose), macrogol 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow and iron oxide black. The yellow tablet film coating only differs from the green film coating with the omission of iron oxide black.</description>

             registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence&#xD;
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to&#xD;

             reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment.&#xD;

             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. During the study, if co-administration&#xD;
             of a strong or moderate inhibitor is required because there is no suitable alternative&#xD;
             medication, exception to this criterion may be allowed with a suitable dose reduction&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant&#xD;
             systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
