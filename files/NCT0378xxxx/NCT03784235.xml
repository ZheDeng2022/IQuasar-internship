  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether individuals with unilateral patellofemoral pain (PFP) have&#xD;
      increased subchondral bone remodelling and thus increased 18F Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF)&#xD;
      uptake in the painful knee compared to the opposite knee measured by simultaneous positron&#xD;
      emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) and to examine whether the increased&#xD;
      uptake is associated with pain intensity, with patient-reported function and with pain&#xD;
      localization. Furthermore we aim to investigate the effect of an acute patellofemoral loading&#xD;
      bout on the bone remodelling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition mainly affecting&#xD;
      younger people, causing pain, physical disability, and reduced quality of life. The cause of&#xD;
      PFP is still unknown. It is, i.e., unclear whether there is a link between PFP and changes in&#xD;
      the cartilaginous (subchondral) bone in the joint between the patella and the femur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goals are to use 18F NaF PET/CT to evaluate whether subjects with unilateral&#xD;
      patellofemoral pain exhibit elevated bone metabolic activity in the painful knee compared to&#xD;
      the pain free knee and to determine whether bone metabolic activity correlates with pain&#xD;
      intensity and location of pain. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the effects of acute&#xD;
      loading on the bone metabolic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to assess whether patients with&#xD;
      unilateral PFP have increased bone metabolic activity in the painful knee compared to the&#xD;
      pain free knee. We will assess quantitative parameters indicative of bone metabolic activity&#xD;
      (Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) and kinetic data) and compare values between the painful&#xD;
      knee and the pain free knee. The secondary objectives are to 1) determine whether a bout of&#xD;
      single leg weight bearing knee bends standing on a wedge result in increased bone metabolic&#xD;
      activity acutely in the painful knee compared to the pain free knee, and 2) identify &quot;hot&quot;&#xD;
      regions of abnormal tracer uptake and compare area and SUV values between the painful knee&#xD;
      and the pain free knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An explorative objective is to determine the correlation between bone metabolic activity and&#xD;
      pain intensity and location of pain.&#xD;
