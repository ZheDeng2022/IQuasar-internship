  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, 2-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical feasibility trial design&#xD;
      is planned. Forty CCI survivors will be randomized (1:1) to either the PS-PICS (peer support)&#xD;
      intervention or usual care (control) group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized participants will complete 4 study assessments: 1) baseline data at hospital&#xD;
      discharge; 2) baseline data post-hospital discharge and before the start of the weekly peer&#xD;
      support intervention; 3) post-intervention at the conclusion of the 90-day weekly peer&#xD;
      support intervention; and 4) follow-up at 6-months post-hospital discharge. The weekly peer&#xD;
      support intervention will be delivered by a small pool of critical illness survivor peers&#xD;
      (mentors) recruited from the study site from previous research. Peer support mentors will be&#xD;
      trained in peer support and MI, and will deliver 3 months of weekly MI interventions&#xD;
      (phone-based) to CCI survivors randomized to the intervention group. Participants randomized&#xD;
      to the usual care group will not receive the weekly peer support/MI intervention but will&#xD;
      receive the usual discharge planning services currently provided at hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be contacted by the research team for 4 telephone-based&#xD;
      assessments. The design will allow us to test the feasibility and potential impact of the&#xD;
      PS-PICS intervention on social relationship measures, depression and self-management. Data&#xD;
      collection and analyses are guided by the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory. The&#xD;
      Individual and Family Self-Management Theory illustrates the interaction of the process of&#xD;
      self-management with risk and protective factors, and short-term and long-term outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The Measure includes a scale. Please provide the following scale information:&#xD;
Specify the full (unabbreviated) scale name and construct (i.e., indicate what the scale measures if not clear from name).&#xD;
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Scale Include all scale ranges (i.e., minimum and maximum scores) required to interpret any values. For example, if the *total* score is reported, the *total* range should be provided. If *subscale* scores are reported, the range for each *subscale* should be provided.&#xD;
The scale range is 0-65. The total score will be reported. For each scale range provided, specify which values are considered to be a better or worse outcome (e.g., Do higher values represent a better or worse outcome?).&#xD;
The maximum total score is 65. Higher values represent higher levels of fatigue.&#xD;
If subscales are combined to compute a total score, consider indicating how subscales are combined (summed, averaged, etc.).&#xD;
