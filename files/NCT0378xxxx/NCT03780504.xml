      Following the evidence from the controlled clinical trial setting on the significant clinical&#xD;
      benefits of apremilast in the treatment of active PsA, there is a scarcity of real-life&#xD;
      evidence on the effectiveness and the beneficial role of apremilast in PsA in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice. The present study primarily aims to generate real-world evidence on the&#xD;
      impact of apremilast treatment on a broad population of biologic-naïve PsA patients in terms&#xD;
      of its clinical effectiveness across the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, as well as&#xD;
      its impact on disease burden and HRQoL, in the routine primary care settings of Greece.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite tremendous progress achieved in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over the past 15 years, its&#xD;
      management remains challenging due to the clinical heterogeneity and multifaceted nature of&#xD;
      the disease. Currently available recommended algorithms for PsA treatment guide clinicians&#xD;
      through treatment choices, beginning with conventional synthetic DMARDs after failure of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local therapy for active disease,&#xD;
      followed, if necessary, by a biological DMARD or a targeted synthetic (ts) DMARD. The latter&#xD;
      novel category of DMARDs represents recent advances in the treatment options of PsA that aim&#xD;
      to overcome the limitations of biological agents that stem by the fact that they have to be&#xD;
      administered intravenously or subcutaneously, are very cost intensive for both the patients&#xD;
      and the health system, while among them, the immunosuppressive biological agents are also&#xD;
      associated with increased risks for infections and certain malignancies. The first approved&#xD;
      tsDMARD for the treatment of PsA is apremilast which with an alternative mechanism of action,&#xD;
      oral route of administration and favorable safety profile, presents a novel treatment option&#xD;
      for PsA that may be appropriate for use early in the treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is evidence from the controlled clinical trial setting on the significant&#xD;
      clinical benefits of apremilast in the treatment of active PsA, and despite the increasing&#xD;
      recognition of the value of real-world data as a complementary source to randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials, there is a scarcity of real-life evidence on the effectiveness and the beneficial&#xD;
      role of apremilast in PsA in routine clinical practice which is partially attributed to the&#xD;
      relatively recent advent of apremilast in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the above, the present study primarily aims to generate real-world evidence on&#xD;
      the impact of apremilast treatment on a broad population of biologic-naïve PsA patients in&#xD;
      terms of its clinical effectiveness across the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, as&#xD;
      well as its impact on disease burden and HRQoL, in the routine primary care settings of&#xD;
      Greece. This information alongside with collected evidence regarding drug utilisation and&#xD;
      safety profile under real-world conditions will strengthen the current state of knowledge in&#xD;
      regards to the optimal use of apremilast in this population.&#xD;
