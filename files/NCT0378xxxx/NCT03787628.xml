  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to determine the effects and safety of cannabidiol (CBD) as an adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy for patients, who have Opioid Use Disorder and are taking buprenorphine + naloxone.&#xD;
      Buprenorphine + naloxone is an approved treatment for Opioid Use Disorder, but relapse to&#xD;
      opioid misuse is common among patients who receive this treatment. Finding an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment that does not have abuse liability and reduces relapse for these patients would be&#xD;
      helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit participants from the Tarzana Treatment Center in Los Angeles.&#xD;
      They will be receiving buprenorphine + naloxone as part of residential therapy. Potential&#xD;
      participants who pass initial screening and wish to continue in the study will provide&#xD;
      written, informed consent and will complete a screening evaluation, including blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, questionnaires about their mood, medical, psychiatric and drug use history and a&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be invited to complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments (blood and urine tests, questionnaires), and will be assigned randomly to receive&#xD;
      CBD or placebo in each of three cohorts, corresponding to two dose groups of 20 participants&#xD;
      per cohort (CBD 600, 1200mg/day). Within each cohort, 20 participants will receive CBD and 10&#xD;
      will receive placebo. The cohorts will be studied in ascending dose order to ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day, participants will take the study medication twice daily under supervision.&#xD;
      Questionnaires on opioid craving, withdrawal, and mood symptoms will be administered daily&#xD;
      during the treatment period. Cue-induced craving will be assessed at 3 timepoints (days 0, 7&#xD;
      and 28). PK samples will be assessed at multiple time-points during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 28-day intervention, participants will complete questionnaires and undergo urine&#xD;
      drug tests in weekly follow-up visits (days 29-56). PK samples will be assessed at multiple&#xD;
      time-points during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last ~9 weeks, comprising three periods: a screening period (~7 days during&#xD;
      which participants are stabilized on buprenorphine + naloxone in residential treatment at&#xD;
      Tarzana Treatment Center), a treatment period (4 weeks when study CBD or placebo is&#xD;
      administered at UCLA), and a follow-up period (4 weeks after termination of the test&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, sequential, dose-ranging study&#xD;
      of Cannabidiol (CBD) (600, 1200 mg/day) as an adjunctive therapy to buprenorphine + naloxone&#xD;
      in patients who have Opioid Use Disorder and are receiving residential behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      including cognitive behavioral therapy. The primary endpoint will be safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of CBD in these patients, and it will be assessed via measurement of cardiovascular&#xD;
      parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm and conduction on EKG), other&#xD;
      vital signs, liver enzymes, pulse oximetry, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. Secondary&#xD;
      measures will include cue-induced craving, reductions in spontaneous craving, opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal, negative affective states, and relapse, as well as retention in treatment with&#xD;
      buprenorphine + naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Tarzana Treatment Center (TTC) in the San Fernando&#xD;
      Valley, where buprenorphine (as part of their treatment) and CBD (as part of this protocol)&#xD;
      will be administered. Tarzana Treatment Centers, Inc. is a community-based, private&#xD;
      non-profit behavioral healthcare organization located in Southern California with several&#xD;
      agency sites, including the one in the San Fernando Valley, where this protocol will be&#xD;
      conducted. TTC delivers drug and alcohol use treatment, has been accredited by the Joint&#xD;
      Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) since 1987, and has a&#xD;
      workforce that includes physicians, psychologists, and nurses. TTC's substance use treatment&#xD;
      approach includes residential programs that are overseen by a Program Director and are&#xD;
      staffed by a clinical supervisor, operations supervisor, counselors, interns, nursing staff&#xD;
      and 24/7 technicians. Groups and services include education group, process group, 12-step,&#xD;
      family group, mental health services and recreation skills. Cognitive-behavioral treatment is&#xD;
      used in both individual and group therapy to address craving and relapse issues and in the&#xD;
      treatment of mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be invited to complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments (blood and urine tests, questionnaires), and will be assigned randomly to receive&#xD;
      CBD or placebo in each of three cohorts, corresponding to two dose groups of 20 participants&#xD;
      per cohort (CBD 600, 1200mg/day). Within each cohort, 20 participants will receive CBD and 10&#xD;
      will receive placebo. The cohorts will be studied in ascending dose order to ensure safety.&#xD;
      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized by baseline buprenorphine plasma level&#xD;
      (either below or ≥ 2 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise three periods: a multi (~7)-day screening period while participants&#xD;
      are stabilized on buprenorphine + naloxone), a 4-week treatment period when study medication&#xD;
      will be administered, and a 4-week follow-up period after termination of treatment with&#xD;
      medication. Cue-induced craving sessions will be conducted at three times: Day 0 (baseline),&#xD;
      Day 7(when a steady state of CBD should have been reached; half-life of CBD after oral&#xD;
      administration is 18-32 h),and Day 28 (end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to medication in the trial will be assured as the participant will take the test&#xD;
      medication (CBD or placebo) under supervision daily. Blood samples will be collected to&#xD;
      determine plasma concentrations of CBD, buprenorphine and its metabolites as well as the&#xD;
      endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG, which may contribute to the response to CBD, laboratory&#xD;
      assessments of safety. Retention in treatment (this trial plus buprenorphine +naloxone) will&#xD;
      be assessed over the 28-day medication (CBD or placebo) period and weekly follow-up&#xD;
      assessments for the subsequent month (28-day follow-up period).&#xD;

    <measure>Safety will also be assessed via measurement of plasma levels of buprenorphine and metabolites (norbuprenorphine and buprenorphine glucuronide).</measure>
    <time_frame>Before dosing (day 0) and during the treatment (days 3,7,14,21 and 28) and during the follow-up period (days 35,42,49 and 56).</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will evaluate whether CBD might pose potential safety concerns associated with buprenorphine treatment. This study will seek to understand the drug-drug interaction for safe and effective treatment of Opioid Use Disorder and to identify an optimal adjunctive dose of CBD for patients receiving buprenorphine + naloxone treatment. Investigators predict a drug-drug interaction between CBD and buprenorphine, in which CBD will dose-dependently inhibit buprenorphine metabolism and therefore increase the ratio of buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine concentrations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety will also be assessed via measurement of plasma levels of anandamide and 2 AG.</measure>
    <time_frame>Before dosing (day 0) and during the treatment (days 3,7,14,21 and 28) and during the follow-up period (days 35,42,49 and 56).</time_frame>
    <description>Because CBD is an inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the principal enzyme catalyzing the catabolism of the major endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), administration of CBD may affect plasma concentrations of these endocannabinoids. Plasma levels of anandamide and 2-AG will be determined in order to obtain preliminary data on the extent to which CBD effects on the primary endpoints in the study reflect actions to increase anandamide and 2-AG concentrations. It is predicted that high baseline endocannabinoids will be associated with a smaller overall CBD effect and/or a maximum CBD effect at a lower dose.</description>

    <time_frame>During the laboratory session before dosing on Day 0 (baseline without CBD) and on Days 7 and 28 after adjunctive treatment with CBD.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be presented with 90 images, which consist of 40 heroin-related, 40 prescription-opioid-related and 10 neutral pictures. After the presentation of each cue, patients will rate their opioid craving by responding to 7 items derived from the Desire for Drug Questionnaire (DDQ).Each item is measured on a 7-point Likert scale, so that the craving score may range from 7 to 49. The primary outcome will be quantified as the change in craving response in the context of opioid cue-induced craving from the laboratory session before dosing on Day 0 (baseline without CBD) to Days 7 and 28 (after adjunctive treatment with CBD).</description>
