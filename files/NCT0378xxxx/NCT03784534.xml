  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As with other real=world connected systems, studying the network structure of multiple&#xD;
      interactions in the brain (holism versus reductionism) has profound implications in the&#xD;
      comprehension of emergent complex phenomena like, for example, the capability to functionally&#xD;
      reorganize after cerebrovascular &quot;attacks&quot; or stroke. This dynamic skill, which is known in&#xD;
      neuroscience as brain plasticity, is not only interesting from a network perspective, but it&#xD;
      also plays a crucial role in determining the motor/cognitive recovery of patients who survive&#xD;
      a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Network analysis of functional connectivity (FC) patterns estimated from neuroimaging&#xD;
      techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed a major breakthrough in the understanding of&#xD;
      physiopathology of stroke from a system perspective. Recent evidence from cross=sectional&#xD;
      studies1,2 highlights that stroke lesions generally induce i) critical deviation from optimal&#xD;
      (i.e. small=world) network topologies supporting both segregated and integrated information&#xD;
      processing, ii) altered inter=hemispheric connectivity and modularity, iii) and abnormal&#xD;
      region centrality in the ipsilesional hemisphere as well as in the contralesional hemisphere.&#xD;
      While these findings provide new descriptors on how stroke lesions affect the functional&#xD;
      brain network organization and how this correlates with the resulting behavioral impairment&#xD;
      (e.g. hemiplegia, aphasia), they only represent a static picture of the brain plasticity,&#xD;
      which is instead intrinsically dynamic, and partially inform on the chances of single&#xD;
      patients to recover their motor/cognitive functions. These aspects dramatically limit the&#xD;
      investigator's ability to fully understand the brain organizational mechanisms after stroke&#xD;
      and to probe the predictive power of possible network=based neuromarkers of recovery. The&#xD;
      ATTACK project aims to overcome these technological and methodological barriers by&#xD;
      implementing the following three=fold strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. acquiring a longitudinal dataset of brain and behavioral data in stroke patients and&#xD;
           healthy controls,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. developing new analytic tools to characterize and generate temporally dynamic brain&#xD;
           networks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. building network=based models of functional recovery after stroke, accounting for&#xD;
           individual patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major thrust of this project is to develop a fundamentally new technology that overpasses&#xD;
      current views in brain network analysis in an effort to i) identify the organizational&#xD;
      mechanisms of brain plasticity underlying recovery in stroke patients and ii) exploit this&#xD;
      information to design new diagnostic and prognostic neuromarkers of motor recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATTACK focuses on the acquisition of a longitudinal dataset (15 patients and 15 age=matched&#xD;
      healthy controls). Multimodal data (clinical/functional scales, behavioral measures, brain&#xD;
      activity EEG) will be collected from each patient at different phases after stroke across a&#xD;
      series of consecutive recording sessions, i.e. +10 days, +1 month, +3 months, +6 months, +12&#xD;
      months after the first stroke event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected with the following inclusion criteria: first=ever infarct lesion,&#xD;
      with hand motor impairment. Exclusion criteria will be aged 18 to 85 years, inability to&#xD;
      understand the task or perform motor tasks, contraindication to MRI. In each session,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to perform several trials of resting state and hand grasping tasks&#xD;
      (imagery and execution) in order to study also the intra=session brain changes occurring at&#xD;
      short=time scales. Differently from current approaches focusing on fMRI changes, the present&#xD;
      project focuses on high= density (64 sensors) EEG data in order to exploit the higher&#xD;
      temporal resolution (in the order of ms) and have a much clearer understanding of the motor&#xD;
      processes occurring at rapid oscillatory ranges (e.g. ERD/ERS). Furthermore, the high&#xD;
      portability of EEG systems has the advantage to perform recording sessions at the patient's&#xD;
      bedside, or even at home, in a totally non=invasive way, thus decreasing the impact on&#xD;
      patient life in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and behavioral data will be also collected from each patient to assess their motor&#xD;
      recovery progress. Different scores include the ARAT, hand grip strength, NIHSS with motor&#xD;
      subitems and Rankin score. Finally, anatomical MRI (T1 and tensor imaging) scan will be&#xD;
      acquired for each patient after the subacute phase (+3 months) in order to locate and assess&#xD;
      the severity/size of the lesion. These scores and data will be eventually used as covariates&#xD;
      for the brain network topological changes. The first recording session will be performed at&#xD;
      the Stroke unit of the Hospital Pitié_Salpêtrière. Subsequent sessions will be performed at&#xD;
      the ICM, operated by the Centre EEG/MEG (CENIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same data will be also collected at the ICM from the group of age-matched healthy&#xD;
      subjects according to the same protocols and timing. This data are crucial in that they will&#xD;
      be used to assess the statistical significance of the changes observed in the stroke&#xD;
      patients. Recording sessions will be conducted in compliance with French regulations,&#xD;
      including provisions relating to biomedical research in the Public Health Code, the French&#xD;
      Bioethics law, the French Data Protection Act, and the World Medical Association Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki.&#xD;
