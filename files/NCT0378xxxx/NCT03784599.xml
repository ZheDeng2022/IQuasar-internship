      This is a single arm open-label multi-center phase II study, investigating disease control&#xD;
      rate after 3 months of treatment with trastuzumab-emtansine/osimertinib combination therapy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with HER2&#xD;
      bypass track resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter single arm phase II study with a phase I run in to study the&#xD;
      toxicity and efficacy of T-DM1 and osimertinib combination treatment in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutated NSCLC and HER2 bypass track activation (HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) ≥2+ and/or&#xD;
      HER2 amplification) after progression on an EGFR TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I run in, study safety will be assessed in a classical 3+3 design. Because of&#xD;
      potential for overlapping hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (AE), the first 3&#xD;
      patients will receive a reduced dose of T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks combined with&#xD;
      osimertinib 80 mg once daily. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a grade 3 AE&#xD;
      toxicity according to CTC AE 4.03 that does not recover to grade ≤2 before the next cycle of&#xD;
      T-DM1. DLT's will be collected up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation (2 T-DM1 cycles).&#xD;
      Dose escalation within patients is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 patient develops a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 3 more will be included and treated&#xD;
      with T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg. If ≥2 of the 6 patients develop a DLT, further study of the combination&#xD;
      will be halted. Otherwise, T-DM1 3.0 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks combined with osimertinib 80 mg&#xD;
      once daily will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to put forward in the phase II part of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the first three patients develops a DLT, the T-DM1 dose will be escalated to the&#xD;
      standard dose of 3.6 mg/kg. If ≤1 patient experiences a DLT in 6 patients (3+3), T-DM1 3.6&#xD;
      mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and osimertinib 80 mg once daily will be the MTD. If ≥2 patients&#xD;
      develop a DLT, the T-DM1 will be lowered to 3.0 mg/kg and three more patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this dose cohort. When ≤1 of these patients develops a DLT, this will be the MTD.&#xD;

             compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C&#xD;
             and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not&#xD;
