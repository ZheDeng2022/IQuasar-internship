  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism, or clots blocking the blood vessels of the lungs, is a common clinical&#xD;
      condition requiring treatment with blood thinners. In most patients, recovery is complete. A&#xD;
      small proportion of patients, however, develop complications (high blood pressure in the lung&#xD;
      circulation, i.e. pulmonary hypertension). Persisting breathlessness during activity is a&#xD;
      common symptom in many of these patients and leads to a reduced ability to engage in daily&#xD;
      physical activity. The reason for this activity-related breathlessness remains uncertain and&#xD;
      is the main question of the proposed study. Using new sophisticated technology, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine the root causes of perceived breathing difficulty. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the idea that breathlessness is fundamentally the result of increased&#xD;
      drive to breathe from control centers in the brain. The investigators will measure drive to&#xD;
      breathe by measuring the electrical activity descending from the brain to the main muscle of&#xD;
      breathing - the diaphragm. The investigators will discover if the increased drive to breathe&#xD;
      is due to accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood as a result of poor blood perfusion of&#xD;
      areas of the lung due to the effects of blockage by clots. The investigators also will&#xD;
      investigate whether weakness and fatigue of the muscles of breathing, as a result of the high&#xD;
      breathing demands that are present in patients with blood clots in the lungs, contribute to&#xD;
      breathlessness. With this information it is hopeful that better treatment options will be&#xD;
      developed to relieve this distressing symptom.&#xD;

      Rationale: In patients with pulmonary embolism, most assessments of the burden of blood clots&#xD;
      and possible related complications, currently rely on chest imaging and heart ultrasound.&#xD;
      While these tests are useful in charting the course of the disease, they offer little about&#xD;
      how the function of the heart and lungs is altered by the disease or the cause of common&#xD;
      symptoms such as breathlessness during exercise. To better understand the reasons for&#xD;
      persistent activity- related breathlessness in patients with a history of clots to the lungs,&#xD;
      the investigators will undertake detailed assessment of breathlessness using validated scales&#xD;
      and questionnaires during standardized exercise testing. At the same time the investigators&#xD;
      will also measure a broad range of physiological tests that will indirectly measure how much&#xD;
      blood perfusion of the lungs is reduced, how much the drive to breathe is increased, and&#xD;
      whether there is additional strain and weakness of the muscles of breathing, particularly the&#xD;
      diaphragm. This will allow the investigators to identify the main factors contributing to&#xD;
      breathlessness in this population and will help to guide management. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      development of simple new physiological markers or tests obtained during the stress of&#xD;
      exercise can, in addition to conventional imaging, be used to monitor the course of the&#xD;
      disease and response to treatment. In particular, the investigators hope that these new tests&#xD;
      will help clinicians recognize at an early stage of the disease individuals more likely to&#xD;
      develop progressive heart disease and breathing problems as a result of blood clots to the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design/methodology: This will be a single-centre, cross-sectional study observing the&#xD;
      effect of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) on exertional dyspnea and&#xD;
      physiological responses to a standardized exercise task. After giving written informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will complete 2 visits, each conducted in the morning 2-7 days apart.&#xD;
      Visit 1 (screening for eligibility): medical history, symptom evaluation, complete pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing, a symptom-limited incremental exercise test for familiarization of dyspnea&#xD;
      assessments during exercise. Visits 2: pulmonary function testing (spirometry,) and a&#xD;
      symptom-limited incremental exercise test to tolerance including detailed measurements of&#xD;
      dyspnea (intensity, quality, affective dimensions), EMGdi and pressure-derived respiratory&#xD;
      mechanical measurements. EMGdi will be used as an observational tool to measure inspiratory&#xD;
      neural drive. An esophageal electrode-balloon catheter consisting of 5 electrode pairs will&#xD;
      be inserted nasally and carefully positioned based on the strength of the EMGdi signal. EMGdi&#xD;
      will be recorded continuously at rest and during exercise. The raw EMGdi signal will be&#xD;
      sampled at 2000 Hz, band-pass filtered and converted to a root mean square (RMS) using&#xD;
      computer software (LabChart). Maximal EMGdi (EMGdi,max) will be measured during inspiratory&#xD;
      capacity (IC) maneuvers. EMGdi/EMGdi,max will be used as an index of the inspiratory neural&#xD;
      drive to the crural diaphragm. Esophageal (Pes) and gastric pressures (Pga) will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously at a rate of 200 Hz (PowerLab) using balloons mounted on the electrode catheter.&#xD;
      Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) will be recorded as the difference between Pga and Pes&#xD;
      signals. The continuous flow signal from the Vmax229d system will be input into the PowerLab&#xD;
      system for offline analysis. Pre- and post-exercise inspiratory sniffs will be performed to&#xD;
      obtain maximum Pes (Pes,sn) and Pdi (Pdi,sn). IC maneuvers at rest and throughout exercise&#xD;
      will be used to obtain dynamic peak inspiratory Pes (Pes,IC) and Pdi (Pdi,IC). Pre- and&#xD;
      post-exercise FVC maneuvers will also performed to obtain dynamic peak expiratory Pes&#xD;
      (Pes,FVC). Respiratory mechanics will be analyzed as previously described (see reference).&#xD;
      Vital signs will be monitored throughout exercise. Subjects will avoid caffeine, heavy meals,&#xD;
      alcohol and major physical exertion prior to visits.&#xD;
