  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to measure (residual) beta cell mass in type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D) patients with stable near-normal and unstable glucose control using PET/CT imaging, to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of the relation between beta cell mass and glycemic control in T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by a progressive decrease in beta cell function due to&#xD;
      an autoimmune attack on the beta cells, which will lead to a reduction in insulin secretion.&#xD;
      Endogenous insulin secretion can be determined measuring C-peptide, which is secreted in&#xD;
      equal amounts to insulin. The loss of insulin secretion, indicated by an immeasurable&#xD;
      C-peptide level, will hamper glycemic control which results in increased glycated haemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c) levels. Also, hypoglycemic events can occur more frequently. Initially, the belief&#xD;
      was that this could be explained by the loss of all pancreatic beta cells due to the&#xD;
      autoimmune attack. However, recent literature suggests that a considerable number of beta&#xD;
      cells can survive this attack. This could mean that certain beta cells survived, but have&#xD;
      lost their function. The ratio of functional and non-functional residual beta cells might&#xD;
      play an important role in the degree of glycemic control. It would therefore be of great&#xD;
      interest to study residual beta cell mass in two types of T1D patients that differ in&#xD;
      glycemic control. Although both types of patients receive treatment, one group of patients is&#xD;
      characterized by a stable near-normal glucose control while the second group is characterized&#xD;
      by an unstable glucose control. In case glycemic control mostly depends on beta cell function&#xD;
      and less on beta cell mass, novel therapies could focus on the functional reactivation of&#xD;
      these non-functional beta cells to restore overall beta cell function. This could especially&#xD;
      be in favour of patients with an unstable glucose control. Beta cell mass will be determined&#xD;
      using Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography (PET), which allows visualization&#xD;
      of pancreatic beta cells as well as absolute quantification of tracer uptake, providing a&#xD;
      measure for the pancreatic beta cell mass. The outcome of this study will lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the relation between the amount of residual beta cells, beta cell function&#xD;
      and the influence of glycemic control. This could provide new insights regarding the&#xD;
      development of new therapies to improve beta cell function and glycemic control, which could&#xD;
      lower disease burden and improve the patient's quality of life.&#xD;

        The study population will include 18 individuals with T1D for at least 1 year with a&#xD;
        minimum age of 18 years. This population consists of two groups that include 9 subjects&#xD;
        with stable near-normal glucose control and 9 individuals with unstable glucose control.&#xD;
        The differentiation between T1D patients with stable near-normal and unstable glucose&#xD;
        control will be based on their HbA1c value, the number of severe hypoglycemic events and&#xD;
        the patient's hypoglycaemic awareness.&#xD;
