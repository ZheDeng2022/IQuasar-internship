  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators are going to investigate the improvement of cognitive brain&#xD;
      domains after ingestion of omega 3 products that have high concentrations of DHA,&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid, and EPA, Eicosapentaenoic acid, in comparison to control group young&#xD;
      healthy adults. The study will assess the improvement by computerized testing by their&#xD;
      reaction time before and after the intervention. The researchers will follow the scientific&#xD;
      and ethical regulations prevent any harmful effect on recruited subjects.&#xD;

      Research Question :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Will daily consumption of omega-3 fish oil improve brain cognitive&#xD;
      domains?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo-controlled, double-blinded, 3-armed randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Sample :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our target population will be young, healthy adults, educated academic students which are the&#xD;
      students of Sulaiman Alrajhi Colleges in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the sample size, the investigators will put into consideration the confidence level&#xD;
      of 95%. Also, the investigators will take into account the size of our population which is&#xD;
      the number of students in Sulaiman Al-Rajhi Colleges. In addition to that, the investigators&#xD;
      will consider the margin of error to be around 10%. Taking these variables together will give&#xD;
      us an estimated sample size of about 66 students which the investigators will reduce to 60&#xD;
      due to financial limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit the participants from the students of Suliman Alrajhi Colleges&#xD;
      by announcing through the emails and by spreading paper announcements in the campus and the&#xD;
      housing for volunteering in the research as subjects and the investigators will try to give&#xD;
      the participants activity points after coordinating with the students' affairs department. If&#xD;
      more than 60 students volunteered for the trial, then the investigators will choose 60 of&#xD;
      them based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria and by random sequence generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of subjects' recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit our subjects from the students of Suliman Al-Rajhi Colleges,&#xD;
      both males and females sectors. The sample size will be 60 students in 3 arms (20 control, 20&#xD;
      high doses of Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, and 20 high doses of Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,).&#xD;
      The investigators will take the baseline characteristics and do the preliminary cognitive&#xD;
      testing using Psytest, (TAP 2.3.1) software. Recruiting the subjects will be according to the&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria mentioned below. After collecting the sample, the&#xD;
      investigators will enroll the subjects in the study 6 students a day. So that the&#xD;
      investigators will do the preliminary testing and take the baseline characteristics for 6&#xD;
      students at day 1 and then the day after the same group will start taking the intervention&#xD;
      (either high dose DHA or high dose EPA or placebo) and another 6 students will be enrolled&#xD;
      and so on. Hence day 10 will be the last day of enrollment and the process of enrollment will&#xD;
      take 10 days. So, the investigators are going to have ten groups of subjects allocated&#xD;
      randomly to the three arms of the study. After 90 days from the date of the enrollment, each&#xD;
      group will be assessed, and the post-intervention testing will be carried out. The&#xD;
      investigators will take the informed consent from all participant after explaining everything&#xD;
      about the study and the potential side effects of supplements, in addition, to take their&#xD;
      written agreement after explaining all their inquiries about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of data collectors' recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators need the data collectors to help to keep an updated information on the&#xD;
      subjects and assisting in the process of distributing the pills and their regular intake and&#xD;
      also they will ensure quick communication. The investigators will need ten data collectors so&#xD;
      that each data collector will supervise a group of six subjects, and these six students will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned as mentioned before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do Block randomization in order to have equal numbers in the three&#xD;
      arms of the study. Computer-generated random allocation sequences will be used,&#xD;
      www.randomizer.org, and when carried out the randomization will help us avoiding selection&#xD;
      bias so that no systematic differences exist. Then, the investigators will distribute the&#xD;
      subjects in the three arms of the study randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will make sure that the soft-gels of the DHA group, EPA group, and placebo&#xD;
      group will look the same and taste the same so that blinding is not broken and allocation&#xD;
      concealment is ensured. The investigators will also try to make the study double blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements and placebo groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will divide randomly the participants to three main groups who will take&#xD;
      two softgels of different supplements which are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EPA-high-concentrated fish oil softgels that will provide 1374 mg of EPA and 500 DHA&#xD;
           fatty acids per day out of 2500 mg total fat. The chosen product for this concentration&#xD;
           is :&#xD;
&#xD;
           , Sports Research, Omega-3 Fish Oil, Triple Strength, 1250 mg, 180 Softgels,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DHA-high-concentrated fish oil softgels that will provide 1400 mg of DHA fatty acids per&#xD;
           day out of 2000 mg of total fat. The chosen product for this concentration is :&#xD;
&#xD;
           , DHA 700 Fish Oil,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Olive oil softgels as a placebo that will be totally 2500 mg of fat The chosen product&#xD;
           for this is :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Healthy Origin, Extra Virgin Olive Oil softgels,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The softgels will be taken every day by oral administration for 60 days and the participants&#xD;
      will be instructed and followed by the investigators to take them after the meal and roughly&#xD;
      in the same time to unify any possible factor during taking it. The investigators suggest&#xD;
      taking it after launch meal immediately. The supplements will be stored in a healthy, cold,&#xD;
      and safe environment to guarantee the bioavailability of the products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to ensure that all supplements capsules have the same out-shape&#xD;
      characteristics like color, shape, and size to enhance the double blinding that the&#xD;
      investigators put in our research criteria. In addition, the investigators will bring&#xD;
      uniformed containers to store the soft-gels and distribute the soft-gels among them to&#xD;
      maintain blinding for researchers. That will be the same during distributing the capsules to&#xD;
      the participants and it will be in a good-saving uniformed container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many supplements of omega-3 are US FDA and Saudi FDA approved and can be found in the&#xD;
      approved drugs list of each organization). According to the European Food Safety Authority in&#xD;
      2012 , long-term consumption of EPA and DHA supplements at combined doses of up to about 5&#xD;
      g/day, or EPA alone up to 1.8 g/day appear to be safe for the adult population and does not&#xD;
      increase the risk of spontaneous bleeding episodes, or affect glucose homeostasis, immune&#xD;
      function or lipid peroxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and communication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will distribute a limited amount of softgels every week and check for&#xD;
      taking softgels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for stopping follow-up and intervention in the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic reaction or exacerbated side effects that cannot be afforded Failure to daily&#xD;
      follow-up and compliance to take the supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication use :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoimmune disease Significant changes in lifestyle throughout the supplementation interval&#xD;
      Including a 6.8 kg weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the data using the SPSS software program. Descriptive analysis&#xD;
      and statistical Drop-outs from the study will be excluded from the analysis, so the analysis&#xD;
      type will be, per protocol analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Incompatibility occurs in a conflict situation in which divergent stimulus information has to be processed in parallel, thus triggering different reaction tendencies. The Simon and the Stroop effects (in the Colour-Word Interference Test) are classic examples of this effect.&#xD;
The present procedure tests the interference tendency in terms of stimulus-reaction incompatibility (Simon effect) . For this test, arrows that are directed to the left or the right are presented on the left or the right of a fixation point. Depending on the direction of the arrow, the test person should respond with the right or left hand irrespective of the side on which the arrow is presented.</description>
