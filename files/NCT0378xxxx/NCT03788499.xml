  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 160 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who met the inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group was given massage of maxillofacial&#xD;
      and oral cavity plus routine oral care and functional exercise. The control group was given&#xD;
      routine oral care and functional exercise. Analyze the difference of incidence of severe&#xD;
      acute radioactive oral mucositis in these two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      160 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. The experimental group was given massage of maxillofacial and oral cavity plus&#xD;
      routine oral care and functional exercise, the control group was only given routine oral care&#xD;
      and functional exercise. Assess the condition of oral mucosa, according to the grading&#xD;
      standard of RTOG acute radiation injury, everyday during radiotherapy. After radiotherapy,&#xD;
      follow up the condition of oral mucosa one time per month for a total three times. Then&#xD;
      analyze the incidence difference between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      massage method：The duration of the massage lasts from the first day of radiotherapy to three&#xD;
      months after the end of radiotherapy，5 times a day（After getting up, before breakfast, lunch,&#xD;
      dinner and going to bed). massage of maxillofacial includes the left and right cheeks, the&#xD;
      upper jaw, the lower jaw, and around the mouth. Oral Massage includes the tongue, hard&#xD;
      palate, the gums, and the bucca. Each part lasts 1-2min，repeating 3 cycles each time.&#xD;
      Patients who could finished at least 75% are included in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
