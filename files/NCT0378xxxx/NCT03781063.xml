      This is an open label, randomized, multicenter study evaluating the activity of lasofoxifene&#xD;
      relative to fulvestrant for the treatment of pre- and postmenopausal women with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer with an acquired ESR1 mutation and who have&#xD;
      disease progression on an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in combination with a cyclin dependent&#xD;
      kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of 5 mg lasofoxifene&#xD;
      relative to fulvestrant for the treatment of pre- and postmenopausal women with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor 2&#xD;
      negative (HER2-) breast cancer with an estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time to response&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pharmacokinetics of lasofoxifene&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life (QoL): Quality of Life (QoL): vaginal assessment scale (VAS) and vulvar&#xD;
           assessment scale (VuAS) questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety of lasofoxifene&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Response to various ESR1 mutation (Y537S, Y537C, D538G, E380Q, S463P, V534E, P535H,&#xD;
           L536H, L536P, L536R, L536Q, or Y537N).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lasofoxifene is a potent SERM that has demonstrated in non-clinical models to prevent and&#xD;
      treat breast cancer. In a large clinical osteoporosis trial, lasofoxifene reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of ER+ breast cancer, which most likely represents a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      clinically undetectable breast cancer. The clinical and non-clinical results are not&#xD;
      unexpected based on the results seen with tamoxifen and fulvestrant as the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action are similar. Moreover, the safety profile of lasofoxifene is well established in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women and therefore a clinical trial investigating lasofoxifene for the&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer is scientifically justifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with ESR1 mutations have endocrine resistance and shorter time to progression when&#xD;
      treated with currently approved endocrine therapy. There is an unmet medical need for&#xD;
      endocrine agents that can provide greater efficacy in this population. Non-clinical in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo studies with lasofoxifene have demonstrated efficacy. If this benefit translates&#xD;
      to subjects with ESR1 mutated breast cancer cells, an important treatment option beyond&#xD;
      fulvestrant will be available. The population being recruited in this trial are subjects with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer who have been treated with an AI in combination with a&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor and who have an ESR1 mutation. The efficacy of&#xD;
      endocrine agents in this population has never been prospectively studied. For this reason,&#xD;
      this study will evaluate lasofoxifene in a randomized Phase 2 trial against a comparator to&#xD;
      better evaluate the magnitude of the effect as well as to provide data to estimate the Phase&#xD;
      3 sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both non-clinical and clinical studies, fulvestrant has shown activity in ESR1 mutated&#xD;
      breast cancer cells and will be used as the comparator in this Phase 2 study to better&#xD;
      determine the relative clinical efficacy of lasofoxifene. The FDA approved fulvestrant dose&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major limiting factor in the administration of fulvestrant is its poor solubility requiring&#xD;
      IM injection. The volume of administration limits the dose that can be administered. Initial&#xD;
      clinical trials administered 250 mg of fulvestrant in 5 cc of castor oil as a single&#xD;
      injection once monthly. Because the IM injections were well tolerated, loading and higher&#xD;
      doses were investigated. This was found to have acceptable tolerability and resulted in&#xD;
      greater efficacy. Limited by the volume of administration higher doses of fulvestrant cannot&#xD;
      be investigated further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject has consented to participate in the study, screening tests will be performed&#xD;
      within 30 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be first stratified into those with&#xD;
      visceral metastasis and those without visceral metastasis. Each of these stratified groups&#xD;
      will then be further stratified into those with the Y537S ESR1 mutation and those without&#xD;
      this particular mutation. Each of the stratified groups will then be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive either 5 mg/d of oral lasofoxifene or fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscular (IM) on Days&#xD;
      1, 15, and 29, then every 4 weeks thereafter. Treatment will continue until radiographic or&#xD;
      clinical evidence of disease progression. Enrolled subjects will be seen every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      the first month of treatment and then monthly until progression. Efficacy assessments will be&#xD;
      done every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects randomized to lasofoxifene, blood samples will be drawn to assess the population&#xD;
      PK. Serum samples will be collected at each visit starting at Visit 0 (Day 1) through&#xD;
      Final/ET visit to measure serum lasofoxifene concentration at time points outlined below.&#xD;
      Serum samples for PK analysis will be collected before the time that the next lasofoxifene&#xD;
      dose is ingested. The actual time and date of dosing on the previous day as well as dosing on&#xD;
      the visit day, and the PK blood sampling time/date must be recorded for all subjects.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic samples are to be collected before clinical lab blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 100 subjects will be randomized and it is expected that all subjects enrolled in&#xD;
      the study will be treated until documented disease progression. It is estimated that full&#xD;
      recruitment into the study will occur within 12 to 18 months with another 12 months of follow&#xD;
      up before the primary outcome measure is analyzed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pre- or postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Postmenopausal women are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥60 years of age with no vaginal bleeding over the prior year, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &lt;60 years with &quot;premature menopause&quot; or &quot;premature ovarian failure&quot; manifest&#xD;
                  itself with secondary amenorrhea for at least 1 year and follicle stimulating&#xD;
                  hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range according to&#xD;
                  institutional standards, or&#xD;

                  meet all of the other entry criteria must be maintained on ovarian suppression&#xD;
                  (such as Lupron) during the study and subjects counseled to use appropriate&#xD;
                  contraception to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If possible, a biopsy of metastatic breast cancer tissue will be obtained to provide&#xD;
             histological or cytological confirmation of ER+ and HER2- disease as assessed by a&#xD;
             local laboratory, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of&#xD;
             American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines, using slides, paraffin blocks, or&#xD;
             paraffin samples. If a biopsy is not possible, the ER and HER2 status from the tissue&#xD;
             obtained at the time of the original diagnosis must confirm that the subject's cancer&#xD;
             is ER+ and HER2-.&#xD;

             progression on an AI in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for advanced breast&#xD;
             cancer with demonstrated prior sensitivity to endocrine therapy (recurrence or&#xD;
             progression after at least 12 months of treatment in the metastatic setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with either measurable (according to&#xD;

             ctDNA sample collection must be obtained within 30 days prior to randomization to&#xD;
             determine eligibility and baseline. Note: a prior genomic test confirming that the&#xD;
             subject has an ESR1 mutation can be used to determine eligibility; however, an ESR1&#xD;
             sample must also be collected within 30 days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have not received cytotoxic chemotherapy or those who have received one&#xD;
