  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating acupuncture, a medical therapy in which hair-thin,&#xD;
      stainless steel needles are shallowly inserted into specific points to help the body's&#xD;
      natural healing process, as a possible treatment to reduce hot flashes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes are a sensation of sudden onset of body warmth, flushing and sweating. Hot&#xD;
      flashes are common side effects of breast cancer treatments and can affect mood and daily&#xD;
      life. Medications can help ease hot flashes, but many patients continue to experience&#xD;
      symptoms despite these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is a complementary therapy in which, hair-thin, sterile disposable needles are&#xD;
      inserted into various spots on the skin, with the goal of affecting body's natural healing&#xD;
      system. Acupuncture has been tested in clinical trials in cancer patients and has been shown&#xD;
      to be helpful in treating a number of side effects of cancer treatment, such as nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting from chemotherapy. A few early studies have suggested that acupuncture may help to&#xD;
      lessen hot flashes, but more information is needed about the benefits of acupuncture in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to test whether acupuncture can help to reduce the number and&#xD;
      intensity of hot flashes in breast cancer patients who are being treated with mediations such&#xD;
      as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin),&#xD;
      and letrozole (Femara).&#xD;
