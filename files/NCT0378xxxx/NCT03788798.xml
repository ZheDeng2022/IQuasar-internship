  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging population, the needs for total joint replacement are increasing. A successful&#xD;
      recovery after joint replacement surgery depends on timely and active physical therapy in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period. To accomplish it, an integrated care model based on clinical&#xD;
      pathway has been implemented to secure the medical quality and patient safety. Recently, the&#xD;
      emerging technology of electronic medical record and medical informatics have made challenges&#xD;
      to the traditional health care models such as the clinical pathway. As a matter of fact, the&#xD;
      integration of informatics technology also provides an opportunity to modernize the clinical&#xD;
      pathway and make it smarter. By bridging the HIS system and the medical cloud of a virtual&#xD;
      platform of interactive clinical pathway, the quality of care and patient safety can be&#xD;
      better secured and the performance can be stored for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project &quot; The effects of intelligent clinical pathway for total joint replacement&quot; is a&#xD;
      subproject of the integrated project &quot; An integrated model of intelligent medical service for&#xD;
      total joint replacement&quot;. It will be carried out in a facility built with intelligent&#xD;
      environment (Kaohsiung CGMH) and the data will be stored and computed in the medical care&#xD;
      cloud and specialist system server. Collaborating with subproject 2 and 4 (smart wearing&#xD;
      device) and subproject 3 (total nursing care), this project is intended to set the milestones&#xD;
      for the postoperative recovery after total joint replacement. Supplemented with the&#xD;
      specialist system and interactive programs, it will be implemented in total joint replacement&#xD;
      patients as an vehicle for perioperative assessment, follow-up, monitoring, and instruction.&#xD;
      The big data of the objective analytic results and feedback from the patients will be the&#xD;
      important reference for medical and health promotion.&#xD;

      With the aging population, the needs for total joint replacement are increasing. On the basis&#xD;
      of 2000-to-2014 data from National Inpatient Sample (NIS), primary total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) is projected to grow by 85% to 1.26 million procedures in the United States by 2030. In&#xD;
      a 2012 report of Orthopaedic Industry, and the global sales of joint replacement products&#xD;
      exceeded $49.3 billion, with knees taking about half of them. The high financial burden of&#xD;
      joint replacement surgery on health care system highlights the importance of cost containment&#xD;
      without compromising the quality of patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical pathways for total joint arthroplasty can reduce care variability and improve the&#xD;
      quality of care. Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) has initiated a&#xD;
      prospective payment system for TKA under diagnosis-related group (DRG) since 1997. It was&#xD;
      found the length of hospital stay, and the medical expenditure could be reduced because&#xD;
      standard clinical pathways were implemented in most hospitals. However, to optimize the&#xD;
      results and meet with patients' expectation are more challenging currently than before&#xD;
      because the length of hospitalization is markedly reduced and the standard care processes are&#xD;
      accelerated. The accelerated programs for total joint arthroplasty are revolutionizing the&#xD;
      standard clinical pathways. Patients can even be discharged from the hospital within one day&#xD;
      after the surgery. While a successful joint replacement surgery depends on well-practiced&#xD;
      clinical pathways delivered in a timely manner, patient's medical literacy should also have a&#xD;
      significant impact for his or her recovery. Unfortunately, patients may acquire incorrect&#xD;
      information from the internet or have unrealistic expectations before or during the&#xD;
      hospitalization that may compromise the decision making and clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the emerging technologies of the electronic medical record and medical informatics&#xD;
      have made challenges to the traditional healthcare models such as the clinical pathways. The&#xD;
      integration of informatics technology also provides an opportunity to modernize the clinical&#xD;
      pathways. But the effect of an interactive infotainment system on TKA is unknown. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to analyze whether the implementation of an interactive infotainment system&#xD;
      into a standard clinical pathway of TKA could influence the hospital course and the medical&#xD;
      quality in an arthroplasty specialty ward.&#xD;

    <description>A standard clinical pathway for TKA has been compulsively implemented for medical cost containment and quality assurance to meet with the Taiwan Diagnosis-Related Groups (TW-DRGs) payment system since 1997. The clinical pathway for TKA undertakes with preadmissions, anesthetic, surgery, and physiotherapy assessment. Medical, nursing, and physiotherapy assessment were put down for each postadmission day. The time from admission to surgery, the use of intravenous antibiotics injection and intravenous fluid were all assessed. Discharge criteria were active knee flexion to 90 degrees, having the ability to walk with aids and clean wound condition with any infection sign. The pathway was initially set for a 6-day postoperative length of stay.</description>
