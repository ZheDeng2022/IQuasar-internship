  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II trial to evaluate the efficacy of APG-115 +/- Carboplatin for the&#xD;
      treatment p53 wild-type malignant salivary gland cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 consisted of 2 arms, arm A (APG-115 monotherapy) and arm B (APG-115 + Carboplatin) and&#xD;
      was terminated early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a single arm study (APG-115 monotherapy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current single arm study design was originally part of a study with a parallel arm given&#xD;
      combination APG-115 + Carboplatin. In the initial phase of that previous iteration, the&#xD;
      combination arm was closed early for issues related to tolerability of the combination&#xD;
      therapy. This study will continue as a single arm, monotherapy alone, Phase I/II study as&#xD;
      approved by the UM Institutional Review Board as of June 2021.&#xD;

    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5 adverse events experienced within the first 6 weeks (2 cycles) of study treatment. These will be assessed via CTCAE version 5.0</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximally tolerated dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of patients achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response will be assessed via RECIST v1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate by tumor histology</measure>
    <time_frame>Until death or end of study; up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of patients achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), assessed via RECIST v1.1 and reported separately for those with histologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) versus other malignant salivary gland tumors (non-ACC)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Until death or end of study; up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Until death or end of study; up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever is earlier.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Until death or end of study; up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Until death or end of study; up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
