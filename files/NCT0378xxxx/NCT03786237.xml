  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heritable skin disease characterized by marked fragility of&#xD;
      epithelialized tissue with blistering in skin and mucous membranes following the slightest&#xD;
      mechanical trauma. Eighty percent of all patients suffering from recessive dystrophic EB&#xD;
      (RDEB), a subtype originating from mutations in the COL7A1 gene, develop squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (SCC). In RDEB patients SCC presents early (most patients are in their 20s or 30s)&#xD;
      and shows a highly aggressive metastatic course which often leads to premature death at this&#xD;
      young age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of scarce data on the efficacy and safety of systemic treatment regimens for&#xD;
      advanced SCC, the investigators propose to perform a small, &quot;first in EB &quot; trial of an&#xD;
      experimental drug called rigosertib for the treatment of EB cancer. The trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in two study centres, in London and Salzburg, and will last approximately 2.5 years&#xD;
      with each patient recruited being in the study for 1 year. The drug is a polo-like kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor interfering with different molecular pathways that are essential for cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. Rigosertib was developed by Onconova Therapeutics and is currently tested in several&#xD;
      clinical trials for a number of other cancers including myelodysplastic syndrome (a cancer of&#xD;
      the blood). The investigators have identified that rigosertib most selectively kills EB&#xD;
      cancer cells in vitro while leaving normal EB skin cells unaffected. This project will&#xD;
      evaluate whether rigosertib is capable of inducing an anti-cancer response in EB patients and&#xD;
      whether the drug is well-tolerated. Mechanisms of molecular targeting of squamous cancer&#xD;
      cells by rigosertib will further be investigated in EB patients, also aiming at the&#xD;
      identification of biomarkers that may allow the predictive identification of best responders.&#xD;
