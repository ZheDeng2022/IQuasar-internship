  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to gather information about knowledge of pediatric dentistry interns&#xD;
      towards infection control procedures in pediatric dental clinics, also about their attitude&#xD;
      towards the rules and guidelines of infection control, and finally their practice to these&#xD;
      guidelines to achieve the ultimate infection control in pediatric dental clinics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patient's safety is considered a very important medical protocol which aims at improving&#xD;
      quality of patient's care, minimizing treatment mistakes and improving safety to the maximum&#xD;
      extent that can be reached. On this approach infection is one of the most critical issues in&#xD;
      healthcare service worldwide, where it can be transmitted during dental procedures through&#xD;
      direct and indirect contact , in addition to high risk blood borne infections , and nowadays&#xD;
      we are facing global emergence and re-emergence of many communicable diseases that can also&#xD;
      be transmitted during dental practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the high risk of transmission of the above infections, high standard&#xD;
      precautions must be implemented for all patients attending dental clinics regardless of their&#xD;
      infection status , because those patients could be in the prodromal phase or carriers without&#xD;
      even knowing. In addition, some infectious diseases have prolonged incubation periods during&#xD;
      which antibodies can't be detected , So in order to avoid infection transmission hazards and&#xD;
      to achieve patient's safety, infection prevention and control of cross-contamination are our&#xD;
      goal in providing a secure environment for patients and healthcare workers within healthcare&#xD;
      settings in general and more specifically in dental practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission of infectious agents among patients and dental health care personnel (DHCP) in&#xD;
      dental settings is rare. However, transmissions in dental settings, including&#xD;
      patient-to-patient transmissions, have been documented. In most cases, investigators failed&#xD;
      to link a specific lapse of infection prevention and control with a particular transmission.&#xD;
      However, reported breakdowns in basic infection prevention procedures included unsafe&#xD;
      injection practices, failure to heat sterilize dental handpieces between patients, and&#xD;
      failure to monitor autoclaves by conducting spore tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, Concerns have increased considerably by a report about the transmission of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from an American dentist to five of his patients. With the&#xD;
      presence of people infected with hepatitis B and C and the HIV viruses, cross infection has&#xD;
      become a major concern for dentists, dental personnel and patients. On the other hand,&#xD;
      developing countries including Egypt showed the increased prevalence of transmission of&#xD;
      infection among dental clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, Universal precautions should be followed considering all patients as infectious.&#xD;
      However, Most hospitals have no infection control programs due to the lack of awareness of&#xD;
      the problem or absence of properly trained personnel. This highlight the need for training to&#xD;
      improve understanding of principles, practices, and implementation, in addition to the&#xD;
      conditions that cause disease transmission, So all dental settings, regardless of the level&#xD;
      of care provided, must make infection prevention a priority and should be equipped to observe&#xD;
      Standard Precautions and other infection prevention recommendations contained in CDC's&#xD;
      Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings - 2003.&#xD;
