      Contusive cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) impairs upper limb function (reach-and-grasp)&#xD;
      which limits daily-life activities and thus decreases the quality of life. Promoting&#xD;
      neuroplasticity may support upper limb recovery after SCI. Repetitive exposure to acute&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxia (rAIH) combined with motor training promotes recovery of motor function&#xD;
      after SCI; however, the overall effects of rAIH/training are limited. The investigators will&#xD;
      use an adult rat model of long-term contusive cSCI to study novel approaches to enhance the&#xD;
      effect of rAIH/training on forelimb function and study the neuronal substrate underlying the&#xD;
      effects. The findings will be used to direct the development of more effective rAIH/training&#xD;
      approaches for people with contusive, functionally incomplete, cSCI. Because deficits in&#xD;
      upper limb function are a major problem after stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, and other motor disorders, this work may also be relevant for patients with other&#xD;
      types of central nervous system (CNS) lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to develop effective, clinically applicable, approaches to restore upper&#xD;
      limb function (reach-and-grasp) after chronic contusive cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI).&#xD;
      Impairments in upper limb function significantly reduce the quality of life for people with&#xD;
      cSCI. Reach-and-grasp actions in animals and humans are largely controlled by the&#xD;
      corticospinal tract (CST). The investigators argue that promoting plasticity within the CST&#xD;
      may support the recovery of upper limb function after cSCI. Repetitive exposure to acute&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxia (rAIH) combined with motor training is a safe, minimally invasive,&#xD;
      treatment that elicits neuroplasticity resulting in improved recovery after cSCI, but its&#xD;
      overall effects remain limited. The main goals are to: 1) enhance rAIH/training-induced&#xD;
      aftereffects on forelimb function and increase the understanding of the neuronal substrates&#xD;
      in an adult rat model of chronic contusive cSCI, and 2) use this knowledge to guide the&#xD;
      development of more effective rAIH/training approaches to improve upper limb function in&#xD;
      humans with chronic contusive cSCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Specific Aim 1, using an adult rat model of chronic contusive cSCI, the investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the effects of rAIH frequency and dose on rAIH/training-mediated functional&#xD;
      recovery of the impaired forelimb. Also, the investigators will combine rAIH/training with&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-mediated synaptic plasticity through D-cycloserine&#xD;
      treatment and study the effects on recovery of forelimb function. Immunocytochemistry with&#xD;
      imaging techniques will be used to assess structural neuronal plasticity in the CST after&#xD;
      rAIH/training. In Specific Aim 2, in people with chronic incomplete cSCI, guided by the&#xD;
      findings in Specific Aim 1, the investigators will study the effects of rAIH frequency and&#xD;
      concurrent D-cycloserine treatment on rAIH/training-mediated upper limb function recovery.&#xD;
      The investigators will comprehensively analyze the effects of rAIH on the strength of&#xD;
      electrophysiological and functional aftereffects in the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will provide new knowledge on rAIH/training-mediated functional and&#xD;
      anatomical aftereffects (Specific Aim 1), which will be used to develop effective&#xD;
      rAIH/training protocols for people with contusive, functionally incomplete, cSCI (Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2). The data from the investigators' experiments may lead to clinically applicable&#xD;
      approaches that improve arm and hand function recovery after chronic contusive cSCI, which&#xD;
      would positively impact the quality of life of Veterans with cSCI. The relevance of this&#xD;
      proposal is emphasized by the limited efficacy of current strategies to improve upper limb&#xD;
      function after cSCI.&#xD;
