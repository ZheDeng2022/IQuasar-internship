    <textblock>
      Background: The current study aimed to explore the possible effect of stimulants on oxytocin&#xD;
      (OT), a neuropeptide found to regulate social behavior, as a mediator of the pro-social&#xD;
      effect of methylphenidate (MPH) in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) compared to healthy controls (HCs). Methods: In a double-blind manner the&#xD;
      investigators compared the performance of 50 children with ADHD and 40 HCs in &quot;theory of&#xD;
      mind&quot; (ToM) tasks and examined the effect of a single dose of MPH/placebo on ToM and salivary&#xD;
      OT levels in children with ADHD at baseline and following an interpersonal interaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting&#xD;
      approximately 7% of children and adolescents, is associated with considerable impairments in&#xD;
      social functioning. Children with ADHD, in comparison to healthy children, suffer from more&#xD;
      social rejection and problems in reciprocal relationships. Deficits in interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning in children with ADHD have been attributed in previous studies to, among other&#xD;
      things, impairments in theory of mind (ToM) - the ability to attribute mental states,&#xD;
      beliefs, and intentions to self and to others. For example, some studies have shown deficits&#xD;
      in the ability to recognize facial expressions among children with ADHD. Other studies have&#xD;
      found impairments in first- and second-order ToM tests. There is also evidence showing that&#xD;
      empathic functions in children with ADHD are impaired. However, small sample sizes, as well&#xD;
      as high percentages of comorbid disruptive disorders, served as limitations in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One's ToM ability depends on, among other things, the integrity of dopaminergic and&#xD;
      serotonergic systems, as well as on their interaction with other neurotransmitters and&#xD;
      neurohormones (e.g., acetylcholine, oxytocin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide found to accelerate the formation of social relationships,&#xD;
      the expression of behaviors of closeness, and the recognition of affect in the facial&#xD;
      expressions of others. Oxytocin has been hypothesized to raise the salience of social cues by&#xD;
      modulating attention-orienting responses to external contextual social cues. Its secretion&#xD;
      increases in response to interpersonal interactions. Studies found connections between blood&#xD;
      and saliva OT levels, OT receptor gene polymorphism, and the strength of social relationships&#xD;
      and behaviors in healthy individuals, as well as in patients suffering from mental disorders.&#xD;
      Oxytocin reciprocally interacts with dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic tract. Anatomical&#xD;
      and immonucytochemical studies have found that neuronal fibers and receptor binding-sites of&#xD;
      OT and dopamine are located in the same areas in the central nervous system (CNS), sometimes&#xD;
      in very close proximity to one another. Oxytocin-secreting cells in the hypothalamus carry&#xD;
      dopamine receptors. Indeed, patients with mental disorders related to dysregulation of&#xD;
      dopamine (e.g., autistic spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, depression) show changes in their&#xD;
      CNS and peripheral OT levels. Given the fact that injury of dopaminergic transporters and&#xD;
      receptors is a central component in the etiology of ADHD, it is also possible that OT plays a&#xD;
      role as a mediator of social deficits, and mainly in ToM impairment in children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only a few studies have shown decreased OT levels in children with ADHD when&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls. These studies found a negative correlation between serum OT&#xD;
      levels and ADHD rating scale total scores, and aggression scores, and a positive correlation&#xD;
      between the serum OT level and empathy scores in patients with ADHD. However, in both&#xD;
      studies, only baseline OT levels were assessed; therefore, changes in OT levels following an&#xD;
      interpersonal interaction were not measured. This is an important point, as social abilities&#xD;
      are dynamic and interaction-related; the reactivity of the OT system to interpersonal&#xD;
      interaction is thus probably highly relevant to the understanding of social difficulties in&#xD;
      ADHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulants reduce negative social interactions and improve social and behavioral functioning&#xD;
      in children with ADHD, and also improve empathy scores. In a previous study, the&#xD;
      investigators showed that a single dose of methylphenidate (MPH) improved the performance of&#xD;
      children with ADHD on ToM tests. To date, no study examined a possible effect of stimulants&#xD;
      on OT levels in children with ADHD. This is a pivotal issue in the understanding of the&#xD;
      neurobiological underpinnings of improvement in social cognition measures among children with&#xD;
      ADHD who are treated with stimulants, given that OT might have a role in mediating this&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the investigators hypothesized that dysfunction in the OT system may&#xD;
      account for the social difficulties of children suffering from ADHD and that the dynamics in&#xD;
      the OT system may explain the pro-social effect of stimulants on these children. Thus, the&#xD;
      objectives of the current study were 1) to compare ToM measures and salivary OT levels&#xD;
      between children with ADHD and healthy controls (HCs), and 2) to examine the effect of a&#xD;
      single dose of MPH on ToM and salivary OT levels in children with ADHD following an&#xD;
      interpersonal interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Subjects Fifty children aged 6-12 diagnosed with ADHD and 40 HCs were recruited.&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from the ADHD clinic and the outpatient clinic of the Shalvata Mental&#xD;
      Health Center, School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University. The HCs subjects were recruited from&#xD;
      the community via the internet and social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD was diagnosed by child and adolescent psychiatrists using the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth or fifth edition (DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5). The investigators&#xD;
      excluded children with a past or current affective disorder, psychosis, substance abuse,&#xD;
      conduct disorder or any medical or neurological condition or medication-taking that might&#xD;
      affect the child's participation in the study. The investigators also excluded children who&#xD;
      had a first-degree relative with a major psychiatric diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the control group were the same as those of the ADHD group but with no&#xD;
      diagnosis of ADHD or a first-degree relative with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were reimbursed for their expanses in participation and received a small present&#xD;
      as appreciation. The IRB approved the study. Both parents of all participants signed a&#xD;
      consent form and the children gave their consent verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Apart from the initial clinical assessment at the clinic, all assessments were&#xD;
      performed in the children's homes. Children with ADHD participated in two sessions: one&#xD;
      session an hour after taking a short-acting MPH (in an adjusted dosage of 0.3-0.5mg/kg) and&#xD;
      one session an hour after taking a placebo (PLC). Children routinely prescribed with MPH&#xD;
      treatment were asked not to take the medicine 48 hours before the examination, since the&#xD;
      clinical effect of the long-acting MPH is no longer than 12 hours. The study was&#xD;
      randomized-controlled, such that children were assigned to the sessions randomly in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner. Each session lasted about 60-90 minutes. In order to lessen a possible&#xD;
      learning effect of the computerized tasks (to be elaborated upon forthwith), the sessions&#xD;
      were performed at least two weeks apart. Control subjects participated in only one session&#xD;
      and did not take any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents completed questionnaires regarding demographics and general information about the&#xD;
      child's academic and social functioning. In addition, parents completed the Swanson, Nolan&#xD;
      and Pelham Questionnaire-IV (SNAP-IV). This instrument contains subscales for inattention,&#xD;
      hyperactive/impulsive behavior, and oppositional behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents also filled out the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a screening&#xD;
      inventory composed of five distinct dimensions: conduct problems, emotional symptoms,&#xD;
      hyperactivity, peer problems, and pro-social behavior. Intelligence was measured using the&#xD;
      similarities subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children version IV (WISC-IV).&#xD;
      Self-reported anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a 40-item&#xD;
      questionnaire scored by a Likert scale. State anxiety represents a transient emotional status&#xD;
      that results from situational stress; trait anxiety represents a predisposition to react with&#xD;
      anxiety in stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators measured ToM performance using the ToM test, which test consists of&#xD;
      vignettes, stories, and drawings about which the child has to answer a number of questions.&#xD;
      Results are given on three subscales: ToM1 - precursors of ToM (i.e., recognition of&#xD;
      emotions); ToM2 - first manifestations of a real ToM (first-order belief, understanding of&#xD;
      false belief); and ToM3 - more advanced aspects of ToM (second-order belief, understanding of&#xD;
      humor). The second ToM task was the Faux Pas Recognition task (FPR), designed by Baron-Cohen&#xD;
      et al.. This task is designated to evaluate the ability of participants to recognize social&#xD;
      &quot;faux pas&quot; - social situations in which a speaker says something without understanding that&#xD;
      there might be a difference between his/her state of knowledge and that of the listener&#xD;
      (&quot;cognitive&quot; ToM), and should recognize the potential emotional impact of a statement on the&#xD;
      listener (&quot;affective&quot; ToM). At each session, participants were given 10 short stories, five&#xD;
      of which contained faux pas situations to be identified. After hearing every story,&#xD;
      participants were asked ToM questions. The score consisted of the total number of all correct&#xD;
      identifications of a faux pas situation. The Hebrew version of the FPR was employed after&#xD;
      validation by a group of normative subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive functions and attention were tested via the cognition module in the NIH Toolbox for&#xD;
      the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIH-TB). The investigators used the&#xD;
      Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCS) and the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention&#xD;
      Test, which measure cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary OT levels were measured at three time points: at the beginning of each session&#xD;
      (&quot;T1&quot;), 40 minutes after the administration of MPH/PLC (&quot;T2&quot;; only for the ADHD group), and&#xD;
      15 minutes after a &quot;positive social interaction&quot; in which the child and the parent were asked&#xD;
      to plan a &quot;fun day&quot; that would include both of them, and to talk about it for five minutes&#xD;
      (&quot;T3&quot;). Participants were asked to avoid drinking and eating an hour before the test and to&#xD;
      avoid caffeine three hours before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples were collected by passive drool. In order to precipitate the mucus, samples&#xD;
      underwent three freeze-thaw cycles: freeze at -70°C and thaw at 4°C. After the forth cycle&#xD;
      the tubes were centrifuged twice at 1500 x g (4000 rpm) for 30 minutes. Supernatants were&#xD;
      collected and stored at -20°C until assayed. Determination of OT from saliva samples was&#xD;
      performed using a commercial OT ELISA kit (ENZO, NY, USA). Measurements were performed in&#xD;
      duplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrations of samples were&#xD;
      calculated using MatLab-7 according to relevant standard curves. The intra-assay and&#xD;
      inter-assay coefficients of samples were 14.7 and 22.7 percent, respectively. The intra-assay&#xD;
      and inter-assay coefficients of controls were 4.9 and 13.2 percent, respectively.&#xD;
