      Oxygen therapy is first-line treatment in the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF).&#xD;
      Different oxygen devices have become available over recent decades, such as low-flow systems&#xD;
      (nasal cannula, simple facemask, non-rebreathing reservoir mask) and high-flow systems&#xD;
      (Venturi mask) . Since the 90's, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been largely used with&#xD;
      strong level of evidence in cardiogenic pulmonary edema and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) exacerbation. NIV improves gas exchange and reduces inspiratory effort through&#xD;
      positive pressure. However, good tolerance to NIV is sometimes difficult to achieve due to&#xD;
      frequent leaks around the mask, possibly leading to patient-ventilator asynchrony and even to&#xD;
      intubation . High-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) is an innovative high-flow system that&#xD;
      allows for delivering up to 60 liters\ min of heated and fully humidified gas with a FIO2&#xD;
      ranging between 21% and 100% . It is a new method of respiratory support in adults that has&#xD;
      been used in neonatal ARF for some years. The reason this study is necessary is because, even&#xD;
      though NIV has been demonstrated to prevent endotracheal intubation (and its associated&#xD;
      complications) in a broad range of ARF patients, HFNC has been proposed to have the same&#xD;
      effect as NIV while being easier tolerated, more physiological , allowing patients to&#xD;
      continue to talk, eat and drink through mouth while on HFNC&#xD;

      Oxygen therapy is the first-line treatment in management of acute respiratory failure (ARF).&#xD;
      Different oxygen delivery devices have become available over recent decades, either low-flow&#xD;
      systems (nasal cannula, simple facemask, non-rebreathing reservoir mask) or high-flow systems&#xD;
      (Venturi mask) . The choice of a specific device in management of ARF is based on the&#xD;
      severity of hypoxemia, the underlying mechanisms, the patient's breathing pattern and&#xD;
      tolerance .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients often require high-flow devices to meet their oxygen needs .&#xD;
      Tachypneic patients with ARF, have a peak inspiratory flow rate that is usually high and&#xD;
      often exceeds the oxygen flow delivered by the traditional oxygen devices . Using&#xD;
      conventional devices, oxygen flow is limited to no more than 15 L/min. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      required inspiratory flow for patients with respiratory failure varies widely in a range from&#xD;
      30 to120 L/min. The difference between patient inspiratory flow and delivered flow is large&#xD;
      with conventional oxygen devices leading to patient discomfort . Moreover; high respiratory&#xD;
      rate can generate significant entrainment of room air in the mask and dilution of the&#xD;
      inspired oxygen with an insufficient oxygen concentration. The suboptimal humidification of&#xD;
      the inhaled oxygen provided by standard bubble humidifiers and the limited and unknown&#xD;
      inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) delivery are additional drawbacks of these devices .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 90's, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been largely used with strong level of&#xD;
      evidence in cardiogenic pulmonary edema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      exacerbation. NIV improves gas exchange and reduces inspiratory effort through positive&#xD;
      pressure. However, good tolerance to NIV is sometimes difficult to achieve due to frequent&#xD;
      leaks around the mask, possibly leading to patient-ventilator asynchrony and even to&#xD;
      intubation. It may have other deleterious effects such as delayed intubation by masking signs&#xD;
      of respiratory distress, or barotrauma by the high tidal volume potentially generated under&#xD;
      positive pressure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure good results, an appropriate interface is more important than the ventilation mode&#xD;
      . Oronasal masks, nasal masks, and hoods are most commonly used for NIV. Oronasal masks are&#xD;
      usually tried first because they ensure the effects of NIV better than other interfaces.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is not comfortable, and many patients find it hard to tolerate. It is also&#xD;
      associated with a relatively high incidence of air leakage. Also, skin lesions at the nose&#xD;
      induced by long-term use of this device may result in frequent treatment interruptions and&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) is an innovative high-flow system that allows for&#xD;
      delivering up to 60 liters/ min of heated and fully humidified gas with a FIO2 ranging&#xD;
      between 21% and 100% [.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HFNO delivery systems: main technical characteristics: - The administration of HFNO&#xD;
           requires the following: high pressure sources of oxygen and air, an air-oxygen blender&#xD;
           or a high-flow 'Venturi' system (which permits delivery of an accurate FIO2 between 21%&#xD;
           and 100%), a humidifying and heating system for conditioning the gas to optimal&#xD;
           temperature (37 ÂºC) and humidity (44mg H2O/ liters), a sterile water reservoir, a&#xD;
           non-condensing circuitry, and an interface . The two most widely marketed HFNO systems&#xD;
           are the Precision Flow by Vapotherm and Optiflow by Fisher &amp; Pykel Healthcare Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological effects of HFNC: - Gas from an air/oxygen blender that can generate a&#xD;
           total flow of up to 60 L/min is heated and humidified with an active humidifier and&#xD;
           subsequently delivered through a heated circuit. High flow of adequately heated and&#xD;
           humidified gas is considered to have a number of physiological effects&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Washout of nasopharyngeal dead space: Washout of upper airway dead space from the&#xD;
                delivery of a large amount of oxygen can improve the efficiency of ventilation and&#xD;
                enhance oxygen delivery . HFNC is the only noninvasive respiratory support that&#xD;
                does not increase dead space. With an oxygen mask, especially at low flow, carbon&#xD;
                dioxide is rebreathed .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Warming and humidification of secretions: Warming of inspired oxygen and heating it&#xD;
                to core temperature is more effective at high flow rates (typically &gt;40 L/minute)&#xD;
                than low flow rates. Thus, HFNC is better at heating and humidifying inspired&#xD;
                oxygen than conventional high-flow systems such as Venturi masks or nonrebreathers&#xD;
                (flow rate typically 10 to 15 L/minute) or low-flow systems (flow rates typically&#xD;
                &lt;10 L/minute) . Increased humidification results in increased water content in&#xD;
                mucous, which can facilitate secretion removal and may also decrease the work of&#xD;
                breathing and avoid airway desiccation and epithelial injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effect: Several studies in adults have&#xD;
                shown that, similar to infants and neonates, HFNC increases nasopharyngeal airway&#xD;
                pressure that peaks at the end of expiration (ie, &quot;PEEP effect&quot;) . This &quot;PEEP&#xD;
                effect&quot; can potentially unload auto-PEEP, decrease work of breathing, and enhance&#xD;
                oxygenation in patients with alveolar filling diseases such as congestive heart&#xD;
                failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As flow increases,&#xD;
                nasopharyngeal pressure increases (ie, a dose effect) . The CPAP effect is greatest&#xD;
                with the mouth closed. In general, every increase of 10 L/minute of flow yields&#xD;
                approximately 0.7 cm H2O of airway pressure when the mouth is closed and 0.35 cm of&#xD;
                H2O when the mouth is open.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Small pliable nasal prongs: HFNC nasal prongs are generally soft and pliable.&#xD;
                Consequently, several studies have reported improved patient comfort with HFNC when&#xD;
                compared with conventional low-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula or&#xD;
                high-flow oxygen delivered through a face mask .&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. High flow rates: High flow rates result in minimal entrainment of room air when&#xD;
                HFNC is used; this results in more accurate delivery of oxygen. Patients in&#xD;
                respiratory distress generate high inspiratory flow rates that exceed flow rates of&#xD;
                standard oxygen equipment, resulting in entrainment of room air and a reduction in&#xD;
                the delivery of the set FIO2. The rate of flow in HFNC generally exceeds that of&#xD;
                the patient, entraining very little room air and resulting in an FIO2 that is more&#xD;
                reliably delivered . High flow rates have also been shown to result in an improved&#xD;
                breathing pattern by increasing tidal volume and decreasing respiratory rate .&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Reduction of work of breathing: The HFNO system may significantly reduce the energy&#xD;
                requirement (metabolic work) associated with gas conditioning. By providing high&#xD;
                gas flows, HFNO reduces the resistance of the upper airway and then decreases the&#xD;
                resistive breathing effort .&#xD;
