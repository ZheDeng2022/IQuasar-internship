  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney function in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is tending to decline over a time&#xD;
      which is clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Renal impairment is a risk factor for&#xD;
      stroke, its progression is associated with unfavorable prognosis. So preserving kidney&#xD;
      function should be considered as a one of priorities when choosing treatment strategies which&#xD;
      is especially important in patients with existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or in patients&#xD;
      who have risk of its development. This is especially relevant for the patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with CKD who can be considered as a group of risk for rapid&#xD;
      kidney function decline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is suggested that the decline in renal function may occur more slowly in patients&#xD;
      receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) compared to patients taking warfarin. The planned&#xD;
      trial is a prospective phase IV randomized trial in which patients with AF, T2DM and CKD will&#xD;
      be randomized to groups receiving either dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin. The main&#xD;
      goal of the study is to assess the differences in annual eGFR reduction between patients&#xD;
      receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin for 24 months. The difference in annual&#xD;
      eGFR reduction will be estimated using the SMPI parameters (mixed model of repeated&#xD;
      measurements). Secondary goals are as follows: - to evaluate the progression of albuminuria&#xD;
      during treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin based on the combined&#xD;
      endpoint; - to evaluate the dynamics of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine during 2&#xD;
      years of treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin; - to evaluate bleeding&#xD;
      episodes, acute cerebrovascular accident, and systemic embolism in the dabigatran etexilate&#xD;
      (Pradaxa) and warfarin groups; - to compare glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients receiving&#xD;
      dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) and warfarin&#xD;
