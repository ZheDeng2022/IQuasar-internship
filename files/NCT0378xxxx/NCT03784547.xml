      It has been almost 25 years since the publication of the pivotal trial results for the first&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for RRMS. Currently disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS&#xD;
      approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include&#xD;
      interferon beta (IFNβ) 1-a and 1-b, glatiramer acetate (GA), mitoxantrone, natalizumab,&#xD;
      fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab and ocrelizumab.&#xD;
      Despite evidence about ocrelizumab exist in many patients from eurpe and North America,&#xD;
      scarce real world evidence exists about epidemiolofcal aspects of patients that used&#xD;
      ocrelizumab in Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate patient profiles and persistence to treatment&#xD;
      during follow up in a retrospective study of patients who had been prescribed ocrelizumab for&#xD;
      the treatment of MS in Latin America (LATAM). The investigators will include MS patients that&#xD;
      received ocrelizumab in Latin America and describe epidemiological aspects and persistence to&#xD;
      treatment during the last 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS that leads to focal plaques&#xD;
      of primary demyelination and diffuse neurodegeneration in the grey and white matter of the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord 1. In most patients, the disease starts with a relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      course (RRMS), which is followed several years by a secondary progressive phase (SPMS).&#xD;
      Patients with primary progressive disease (PPMS) miss the relapsing and remitting stage and&#xD;
      start with uninterrupted progression from disease onset 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been almost 25 years since the publication of the pivotal trial results for the first&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for RRMS 4. Currently disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for&#xD;
      MS approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      include interferon beta (IFNβ) 1-a and 1-b, glatiramer acetate (GA), mitoxantrone,&#xD;
      natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab and&#xD;
      ocrelizumab 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocrelizumab was approved in March 2017 for the treatment of relapsing or primary progressive&#xD;
      MS 8. A phase II trial established 600 mg intravenously every 6 months as the preferred&#xD;
      dosing schedule. Two phase III trials evaluated the efficacy of ocrelizumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsing remitting MS, and individual and pooled analysis demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      reduction in annualized relapse rate (P &lt; 0.001 pooled), disability progression at 12 weeks (&#xD;
      P &lt; 0.001 pooled), and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; P &lt;&#xD;
      0.001) 8. Patients with PPMS were evaluated in a third phase III trial, which showed a&#xD;
      significant decrease in disease progression at 12 weeks ( P = 0.03) and volume of T2-weighted&#xD;
      lesions on MRI ( P &lt; 0.001) 8. As with other monoclonal antibodies, adverse effects seen with&#xD;
      ocrelizumab were primarily infusion-related reactions and infection8. Despite much&#xD;
      information exists about efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in phase III clinical trials,&#xD;
      scarce evidence exists regarding real world patients profile and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate patient profiles and persistence to treatment&#xD;
      during follow up in a retrospective study of patients who had been prescribed ocrelizumab for&#xD;
      the treatment of MS in Latin America (LATAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal/written consent from patient only if any site's Ethic Committee requests it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers involved in the study will be from Mexico, Chile, Argentina Number of centers &amp;&#xD;
      patients Two centers in Argentina, two centers in Chile, and two centers in Mexico. Total: 6&#xD;
      centers and Approx 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study overview Patients that accept to participate and fulfill all inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none exclusion criteria will be included. All information will be extracted from the medical&#xD;
      charts Data Source Information related to the study population will be extracted from the&#xD;
      patient medical chart review (secondary data use) and will cover a period up to protocol&#xD;
      regulatory approval. Patient identity will be coded and anonymized in the study data base so&#xD;
      only each investigator will know the identity of each patient. Local legislation regarding&#xD;
      patient data protection will be followed strictly in this study. All study data will be&#xD;
      entered in a predefined electronic Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an NIS involving the use of secondary data and the reporting of adverse reactions in&#xD;
      the form of ICSRs is not required. The study will not extract safety information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is identified and consented to participate (if needed based on local&#xD;
      regulatory aspects), data from patient's chart will be transferred into the specifically&#xD;
      designed platform. The platform on which variables will be transferred, will be on a web&#xD;
      platform with restricted access by user and password specific to each researcher. When&#xD;
      sharing the data, it will be anonymized and only data related to the demographics and clinic&#xD;
      will be accessible, and patient data such as name, surname and ID will not be visible to&#xD;
      analysts if it is loaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regulatory requirements and protection of personal data must be completed according to&#xD;
      the regulations corresponding to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each researcher in the study should explain in detail to each potential participant the&#xD;
      record consists. Every patient who wishes to participate in the project must consent,&#xD;
      according to each regulation, authorizing that their information, codified and anonymized, be&#xD;
      shared with other records for analysis and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An institutional ethics committee must approve the registration or declare that it is exempt&#xD;
      from the need for approval as well as its informed consent (IC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be uploaded by the physician of each participating center. The different&#xD;
      variables will be obtained from the daily clinical practice of each professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Confidentiality As mentioned in the previous point, the patient's name, address, date&#xD;
      of birth, ID or telephone number will only be left in the personal registry and at the moment&#xD;
      of sharing the registration to the central registry will not be entered. The records will&#xD;
      then be identified by a unique code generated by the initials of the IP and the registration&#xD;
      number of that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each registry should include baseline clinical and demographic data as well as the study&#xD;
      project data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all times, the protection of the patient's identity and data will be observed in&#xD;
      accordance with the legal regulations in force national law of protection of personal data&#xD;
      25.326 (Habeas Data), in accordance with the international legislation on registration of&#xD;
      diseases and protection of personal data and private, according to the 18th World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly of Helsinki (1964) when applicable. The right to non-participation in the study will&#xD;
      be respected always without this implying in any case any type of discrimination,&#xD;
      differential treatment or mistreatment towards the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective observational study, which does not plan any type of intervention or&#xD;
      differential treatment in patients included or excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan This is descriptive study and sample size is not based on&#xD;
      statistical considerations. A descriptive analysis is the main objective of the study&#xD;
      regarding demographic, clinical aspects, disease activity and persistence to treatment of&#xD;
      patients that received ocrelizumab to treat their MS disease.&#xD;
