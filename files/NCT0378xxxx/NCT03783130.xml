  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes AIDS. There is&#xD;
      currently no licensed vaccine to prevent HIV infection. Researchers want to test a vaccine&#xD;
      called Trimer 4571 for the first time. It was made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      and contains no HIV. The vaccine is mixed with a substance called alum and injected in the&#xD;
      arm. Alum is included to boost the body's immune response to the vaccine. It has been used in&#xD;
      licensed vaccines for over 60 years and has been found to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the vaccine Trimer 4571 is safe, well-tolerated, and to study immune responses to&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were screened with a physical exam and blood tests. They agreed to not become&#xD;
      pregnant and to avoid behavior that would put them at high-risk for HIV infection during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants had about 15 study visits over about 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 participants received a low dose of the vaccine mixed with alum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the low dose was deemed safe, 10 new participants were allocated to receive a higher&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were randomly assigned to get the vaccine by injection in a muscle or under&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants received a total of 3 vaccine injections over 20 weeks. Each visit where&#xD;
      participants received the vaccine lasted about 5 hours. Participants were watched after each&#xD;
      injection. Participants who were able to get pregnant would have a pregnancy test before each&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received a thermometer and recorded their temperature and symptoms every day for&#xD;
      1 week after each injection. The injection site was checked for redness, swelling, or&#xD;
      bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up visits, participants had blood drawn and checked for health changes or problems.&#xD;
      Follow up visits lasted about 1-2 hours.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with aluminum hydroxide&#xD;
      suspension (alum) as adjuvant in a three-injection regimen. The hypotheses were that the&#xD;
      vaccine will be safe and tolerable and will induce detectable immune responses. The primary&#xD;
      objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at three&#xD;
      doses administered with alum. Secondary objectives were to evaluate humoral and cellular&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) was developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC),&#xD;
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The soluble HIV-1 envelope&#xD;
      product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain&#xD;
      BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by&#xD;
      broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4&#xD;
      binding. Injections were administered intramuscularly (IM) and subcutaneously (SC) in a 1 mL&#xD;
      volume by needle and syringe. The product was provided at a 500 mcg/mL concentration in 3 mL&#xD;
      glass vials filled to 1.2 +/- 0.10 mL. Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum)&#xD;
      provided in a sterile, pyrogen-free suspension at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass&#xD;
      vials filled to 0.7 +/- 0.10 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 to 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP at doses of 100 mcg or 500 mcg, both with 500 mcg&#xD;
      alum field mixed, administered via IM or SC injections. A dose escalation evaluation occurred&#xD;
      to ensure the safety data supported proceeding to the higher dose. Participants were&#xD;
      evaluated for safety and immune responses through blood collection at specified timepoints&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schema is below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Participants = 3; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Participants = 3; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Participants = 5; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Participants = 5; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total = 16 Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      **500 mcg of alum was mixed with Trimer 4571 for all groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were followed for 40 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through 40 weeks after the first study product administration</time_frame>
    <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited adverse events (AEs) are summarized. Labs included hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, creatine and ALT results were collected at screening, Day 0 prior to the first study product administration (baseline), and Weeks 1-2 after the 1st administration, Week 8 (2nd product administration), and Weeks 9-10 after the 2nd administration, Week 20 (3rd product administration), and Weeks 21-22 after the 3rd administration. Institutional laboratory normal ranges as well as the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1 were used.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Unsolicited Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 28 days after each study product administration, up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AEs and attribution assessments were recorded in the study database from receipt of each study product administration through the visit scheduled at 28 days (or 4 weeks) after each study product administration. At other time periods greater than the 28-day (or 4-week) post product administration visit, only serious AEs (SAEs reported as a separate outcome and in the AE module), and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit. The relationship between an AE and the study product was assessed by the investigator based on clinical judgment and the definitions outlined in the protocol. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.&#xD;
If a participant had several AEs and some were evaluated as related and some as unrelated to study product, the participant is counted once as having the related event.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antibody Response to Adjuvanted Trimer 4571 at 2 Weeks After the Final Study Product Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Study Week 22, at 14 days after the final study product administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Trimer 4571-specific antibody titers were measured by Electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Serum samples collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after the third product administration were tested in the assay. Since there is no standard/calibration curve available for interpolation of this raw response, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each serum sample tested in the 8-fold serial dilutions. The AUC measurement is calculated for each single timepoint sample (baseline or week 22, 2 weeks after the final vaccination). The AUC is calculated with Graphpad Prism™ using the trapezoid rule from the raw sample response (ECL response) over an 8-fold dilution series (Dilution Factor) for each sample. Group geometric mean AUCs and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms For 7 Days After Each Product Administration</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after each study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1.</description>

        <population>Population included all enrolled participants who received at least one study product administration and provided safety data (via diary card and/or laboratory results) following study product administration.

VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP: Trimer 4571 drug product is an investigational HIV vaccine which mimics the native HIV-1 envelope complex. This soluble HIV-1 envelope product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4 binding.&#xD;
Alum Adjuvant: Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) mixed with Trimer 4571 to improve the immune response to the investigational vaccine.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms for 7 Days After Each Product Administration</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 7 days after the study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1.</description>

VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP: Trimer 4571 drug product is an investigational HIV vaccine which mimics the native HIV-1 envelope complex. This soluble HIV-1 envelope product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4 binding.&#xD;
Alum Adjuvant: Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) mixed with Trimer 4571 to improve the immune response to the investigational vaccine.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Measures of Safety</title>
        <description>Any abnormal laboratory results recorded as unsolicited adverse events (AEs) are summarized. Labs included hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, creatine and ALT results were collected at screening, Day 0 prior to the first study product administration (baseline), and Weeks 1-2 after the 1st administration, Week 8 (2nd product administration), and Weeks 9-10 after the 2nd administration, Week 20 (3rd product administration), and Weeks 21-22 after the 3rd administration. Institutional laboratory normal ranges as well as the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1 were used.</description>

VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP: Trimer 4571 drug product is an investigational HIV vaccine which mimics the native HIV-1 envelope complex. This soluble HIV-1 envelope product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4 binding.&#xD;
Alum Adjuvant: Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) mixed with Trimer 4571 to improve the immune response to the investigational vaccine.</description>

        <title>Antibody Response to Adjuvanted Trimer 4571 at 2 Weeks After the Final Study Product Administration</title>
        <description>Trimer 4571-specific antibody titers were measured by Electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Serum samples collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after the third product administration were tested in the assay. Since there is no standard/calibration curve available for interpolation of this raw response, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each serum sample tested in the 8-fold serial dilutions. The AUC measurement is calculated for each single timepoint sample (baseline or week 22, 2 weeks after the final vaccination). The AUC is calculated with Graphpad Prism™ using the trapezoid rule from the raw sample response (ECL response) over an 8-fold dilution series (Dilution Factor) for each sample. Group geometric mean AUCs and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported.</description>

          <title>Antibody Response to Adjuvanted Trimer 4571 at 2 Weeks After the Final Study Product Administration</title>
          <description>Trimer 4571-specific antibody titers were measured by Electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Serum samples collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after the third product administration were tested in the assay. Since there is no standard/calibration curve available for interpolation of this raw response, area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each serum sample tested in the 8-fold serial dilutions. The AUC measurement is calculated for each single timepoint sample (baseline or week 22, 2 weeks after the final vaccination). The AUC is calculated with Graphpad Prism™ using the trapezoid rule from the raw sample response (ECL response) over an 8-fold dilution series (Dilution Factor) for each sample. Group geometric mean AUCs and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported.</description>

Unsolicited AEs were recorded from receipt of each study product administration through the visit scheduled at 28 days (or 4 weeks) after each study product administration. At other time periods greater than the 28-day (or 4-week) post product administration visit, only serious AEs and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AEs recorded on the study were reported. Solicited AEs collected through systematic assessment and unsolicited AEs collected through non-systematic assessment are reported for participants who received study product and had safety data collected following the product administration. Data represent the number and percentage of participants experiencing the event. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</desc>
