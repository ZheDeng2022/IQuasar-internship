  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicentric phase I (dose escalation plus expansion) clinical trial of PBF-999 in patients&#xD;
      with immunotherapy naïve and pretreated solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the compound&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I dose escalations will be conducted utilizing the standard 3+3 dose escalation&#xD;
      method. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be obtained for PBF-999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I dose expansion will consist of 1 group including immunotherapy naïve and&#xD;
      pretreated (previous immune checkpoint inhibitors; anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and/or&#xD;
      combinations) solid tumors cancer patients. Pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be obtained for&#xD;
      potential biomarker analysis with pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Dose Escalation (3+3 Design):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which less than 2 out of 6 patients&#xD;
      (&lt;33%) experience DLT in Cycle 1 (first 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Safety Expansion Once RP2D has been declared for PBF-999 using the standard 3+3&#xD;
      design, up to 20 additional solid tumor cancer patients may be treated at the RP2D to further&#xD;
      explore safety and tolerability of the selected PBF-999 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will be males or females 18 years of age or older. Patients must have&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer with at least one measurable lesion, with&#xD;
      adequate organ and marrow function, and with ECOG performance status of 0-1. Eligible&#xD;
      patients must have received at least one prior line of therapy for their disease.&#xD;
