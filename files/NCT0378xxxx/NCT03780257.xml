      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR-421a administered&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR-421a administered&#xD;
      via IVT in subjects with RP due to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive one single IVT injection of QR-421a or sham-procedure in one eye (subject's worse&#xD;
      eye) and will be followed up for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose levels of QR-421a will be evaluated: 50, 100, and 200 µg. Additional dose levels&#xD;
      (eg, 25 or 400 µg) may be evaluated based on ongoing safety and efficacy data monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial dose cohorts will include subjects randomized to sham-procedure or treatment with&#xD;
      QR-421a. Additional subjects may be allocated to treatment with QR-421a in subsequent or&#xD;
      initial dose cohorts.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Willing and able to comply with the protocol, follow study instructions, attend study&#xD;
             visits as required and complete all study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to provide informed consent for participation prior to performing any&#xD;
             study related procedures, and suitable verbal, auditory, written and/or tactile sign&#xD;
             language communication as to allow informed consent to be obtained, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No limitations to SD-OCT image collection that would prevent high quality, reliable&#xD;
             images from being obtained in both eyes as determined by the investigator.&#xD;

          8. Reliable perimetry measurements in both eyes, as described in the Imaging Manual and&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator.&#xD;

             imaging, as assessed by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of additional non-exon 13 USH2A pathogenic mutation(s) on the USH2A allele&#xD;
             carrying the exon 13 mutation in subjects who are compound heterozygous for mutations&#xD;
             in exon 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of non-exon 13 USH2A pathogenic mutation(s) on both USH2A alleles in subjects&#xD;
             who are homozygous for mutations in exon 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of pathogenic mutations in genes (other than the USH2A gene) associated with&#xD;
             Usher syndrome Type 2 or NSRP, or other inherited retinal degenerative diseases or&#xD;
             syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of any significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder (or medication&#xD;
             and/or laboratory test abnormalities) which, in the opinion of the Investigator and&#xD;
             with concurrence of the Medical Monitor, may either put the subject at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study, may influence the results of the study, or the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to a subject&#xD;

             1) clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator, 2) would adequately&#xD;
             prevent clinical and photographic evaluation of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of amblyopia in the treatment eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Worse than 6 diopters myopia in the treatment eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt within 3 months prior to Screening of any intraocular or periocular surgery&#xD;
             (including refractive surgery), or an IVT injection or planned intraocular surgery or&#xD;
             procedure during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Current treatment or treatment within the past 12 months with therapies known to&#xD;
             influence the immune system (including but not limited to steroid implants,&#xD;
             cytostatics, interferons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-binding proteins, drugs acting&#xD;
             on immunophilins, or antibodies with known impact on the immune system). Subjects that&#xD;
             have been treated with systemic steroids within the past 12 months or that require&#xD;
             intermittent use of topical steroids may be considered for inclusion following&#xD;
             approval by the Medical Monitor.&#xD;

             controlled with medication or surgery at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of any investigational drug or device within 90 days or 5 half-lives preceding the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication, whichever is longer, or plans to participate in&#xD;
             another study of an investigational drug or device during the PQ-421a-001 study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any prior treatment with genetic or stem-cell therapy for ocular or non-ocular&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Screening, except adequately treated&#xD;
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that&#xD;

         16. Known hypersensitivity to antisense oligonucleotides or any constituents of the&#xD;
             injection.&#xD;
