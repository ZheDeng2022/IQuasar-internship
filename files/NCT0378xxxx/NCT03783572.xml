    <textblock>
      This study in an observational, prospective and longitudinal study. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin type A (BTX) injections into the elbow flexors on&#xD;
      the reduction of spastic co-contractions (spastic co-contraction index, SCCI) during an&#xD;
      active elbow extension in chronic post-stroke patients.TBA injections are performed as part&#xD;
      of routine care&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BTX is a valuable treatment in the management of the focal muscle overactivity (spasticity)&#xD;
      following acquired brain injury. If BTX injections reduce spasticity, few studies have&#xD;
      examined its effect on the improvement of active function of the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor task involves the muscles agonists and antagonists by phenomena of muscular&#xD;
      coactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post-stroke patients, functional cortical reorganization secondary to the phenomena of&#xD;
      plasticity leads to a reduced motor selectivity. The increase of muscular coactivation&#xD;
      correspond to the spastic cocontraction, which are a little evaluated in clinical practice&#xD;
      and research, whereas they appear to have a greater impact than spasticity on limitation of&#xD;
      active movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not evaluate the efficacy of treatment (BTX injection) but the effect of this&#xD;
      treatment on a component of muscle hyperactivity, the spastic cocontraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the 5 follow-up visits, patients have 6 intercurrent visits. These visits are&#xD;
      less invasive and include only a clinical assessment with surface EMG registration. These&#xD;
      evaluations will evaluate the efficacy and harm effect of BTX on clinical parameters and on&#xD;
      the spastic co-contraction index. Five intercurrent visits I1, I2, I3, I4, I5 are perform&#xD;
      respectively 2 weeks after T1 and, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks after T2.&#xD;

    <description>Cortico-spinal excitability of the motor cortex assessed with TMS : TMS is a non-invasive magnetic stimulation technique that evaluates the integrity of the corticospinal tract. One of the measures used in current practice is that of the amplitude variations of a EMF collected by EMG of the surface elbow flexors as a function of stimulation intensity. The intensity curve is an index of cortical excitability.</description>
