      Before recruitment of the patients, they will be subjected to detailed history taking and&#xD;
      full ear nose throat examination. Body mass index and neck circumference will be measured.&#xD;
      All the patients will undergo sleep study and the following parameters will be documented:&#xD;
      Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), lowest O2 saturation index (LSO2), mean O2 saturation and&#xD;
      percentage of sleep time with O2 saturation below 90% (CT90%). Day time sleepiness will be&#xD;
      assessed using Epworth sleepiness score (ESS), we will use the Arabic translated version of&#xD;
      ESS translated and validated after a multicentric study. All the patients will be examined by&#xD;
      flexible fiber optic nasopharyngoscopy to determine the level of obstruction using Muller's&#xD;
      maneuver. All the patients will be subjected to Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) to&#xD;
      confirm the level of obstruction and the surgeon will comment on the lateral wall collapse at&#xD;
      the level of oropharynx and hypopharynx. All the patients will be counseled about the other&#xD;
      options of non-invasive treatment and importance of weight reduction. All the patients will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step was bilateral tonsillectomy with identification and meticulous sparing of the&#xD;
      palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus muscles; the most important trick was to spare as much as&#xD;
      possible the mucosal covering of both anterior and posterior pillars. Two weakening or&#xD;
      releasing partial incisions were done by a pinpoint bowie (Colorado) at the inferior (caudal)&#xD;
      part of the palatopharyngeal muscle. A full thickness (mucosa and muscle) triangle was&#xD;
      removed at the superolateral corner of the tonsil to obtain a wider and most squared&#xD;
      oropharyngeal inlet. The center of the palate was marked at palatal spine also the&#xD;
      pterygomandibular raphe in both sides were located by digital palpation and marked. We used a&#xD;
      single barbed suture, bidirectional polydioxanone absorbable monofilament, size 0, with&#xD;
      transition zone in the middle. One needle was introduced at the center point then passed&#xD;
      laterally within the palate, turning around pterygomandibular raphe till it comes out at the&#xD;
      most superior part of the raphe at one side; the thread is pulled until it hangs at the&#xD;
      central transition zone which is a free zone present between the two directions of the&#xD;
      thread. The needle again is re-introduced close to point of exit, passing around the&#xD;
      pterygomandibular raphe, till it comes out into the tonsillectomy bed, then through the upper&#xD;
      part of the palatopharyngeus muscle and comes out near to mucosa of posterior pillar not&#xD;
      through it. The posterior pillar is entered at the junction between the upper third and the&#xD;
      lower two-thirds. Then, again the needle is passed back through the tonsillectomy bed and&#xD;
      then this suture will be suspended around the raphe again; a gentle traction is then applied&#xD;
      on the thread only and no knots are taken. This leads to a stable re-positioning of the&#xD;
      posterior pillar to more lateral and anterior location without any knot, then Marking the&#xD;
      center of palate, pterygomandibular raphe and squaring of anterior pillars. The barbed suture&#xD;
      around the upper part of the right raphe and it hangs at the central transition zone. c The&#xD;
      needle is passed through the upper part of the palatopharyngeus muscle and comes out near to&#xD;
      mucosa of posterior pillar not through it. The needle is passed through the upper pole and&#xD;
      suspended around the raphe, pulling of barbed suture without taking of knots this stitch is&#xD;
      repeated at least three times between raphe and muscle till the lower pole of the muscle is&#xD;
      reached. The opposite side is done by the same way. Finally, each thread comes out at the&#xD;
      raphe of the same side, for locking of the stitches and looseness prevention; a superficial&#xD;
      stitch in the opposite direction is taken, and then the thread is cut while bushing the&#xD;
      tissue downward for more traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyoid suspension (Thyro-hyoid-pexy) will be done. The hyoid suspension procedure will be&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in supine position with the neck&#xD;
      extended. Skin marks over the mandibular margin, hyoid bone, thyroid notch and sternal notch.&#xD;
      The skin incision followed a horizontal skin crease between the body of the hyoid bone and&#xD;
      the thyroid notch. The incision will be carefully extended through the subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
      and platysma muscle, as the muscle is less defined in the midline. Upper and lower&#xD;
      subplatysmal flaps will be elevated to expose the strap muscles, which will be separated in&#xD;
      the midline. The plane of the thyroid cartilage and the surface of the hyoid bone will be&#xD;
      exposed and the thyrohyoid membrane was clearly defined. Vicryl 0 will be wrapped around the&#xD;
      body of the hyoid bone on each side of the midline with a sharp needle and then directed to&#xD;
      the thyroid lamina of the same side piercing it from the lateral to the medial surface, about&#xD;
      Â½ cm from the upper border of the cartilage. Two sutures will be performed on each side. The&#xD;
      sutures will be tied steadily and gently,with the neck in neutral position. The wound will be&#xD;
      closed in layers. A suction drainage will be placed for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, 31 patients will be included and will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups. Sample size calculation was done using sample size calculator software on&#xD;
      ww.calculator.net website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in two groups; Group (A) will undergo Barbed Reposition&#xD;
      pharyngoplasty only and group (B) will under go Barbed Reposition pharyngoplasty and hyoid&#xD;
      suspension. Simple randomization will be done by allowing the patients to choose between two&#xD;
      sealed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the pulmonologist or the phoniatricians or the surgeon who will perform post&#xD;
      operative sleep study, post operative nasopharyngoscopy and post operative sleep endoscopy&#xD;
      will know the type of operation performed to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be subjected to another sleep study, flexible fiber optic nasopharyngoscopy,&#xD;
      drug induced sleep endoscopy and day time sleepiness evaluation using (ESS) 4 months after&#xD;
      the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and for homogeneity&#xD;
      variances prior to further statistical analysis. Chi-square and fisher exact tests will be&#xD;
      used to compare between categorical variables. Unpaired t-test will be used to compare&#xD;
      between continuous variables for normally distributed data and Mann Whitney U for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data. A two-tailed p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. All analyses were performed with the International Business Machines Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences International Business Machines 20.0 software.&#xD;
