    <textblock>
      The study is a 2-phase, prospective, open-label, comparative (phase II) study design that was&#xD;
      chosen for the purpose of optimizing the Cheetah settings (phase I), and evaluating the&#xD;
      Cheetah system quality of LASIK flap (phase II).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 3-month, 2-phase, prospective, multicenter, open-label, comparative (phase&#xD;
      II), randomized (phase II, 1:1 ratio for right and left eyes) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at up to 5 sites and will include up to 30 treated subjects in&#xD;
      phase I and up to 150 treated subjects in phase II to achieve minimum 40 eyes with optimized&#xD;
      settings and additional eye data for further device experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled in phase I until Cheetah setting optimization is achieved. After&#xD;
      setting optimization, and upon medical monitor and principal investigator consensus, phase II&#xD;
      of the study may begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For phase I, one eye of each subject will be included (worst seeing eye should be preferred).&#xD;
      The investigational Cheetah femtosecond laser and Cheetah patient interface (PI) will be used&#xD;
      on one eye to create a LASIK flap. Refractive correction via corneal ablation with a&#xD;
      commercial excimer laser will be performed at the investigator's discretion, provided there&#xD;
      is at least 1.00 D SE of refractive error. If refractive correction is performed on the study&#xD;
      eye, the fellow eye may receive standard LASIK treatment, otherwise, fellow eye will remain&#xD;
      untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once five consecutive phase I subjects show good flap lift, per investigator's evaluation,&#xD;
      central flap thickness within ±10 µm of planned thickness, flap diameter within ±0.5 mm of&#xD;
      planned diameter, and upon medical monitor and principal investigator consensus, phase II may&#xD;
      begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II both eyes of each subject will be treated. The investigational Cheetah&#xD;
      femtosecond laser and Cheetah PI will be used on one eye, and commercial iFS femtosecond&#xD;
      laser and PI on the other eye to create a LASIK flap on subjects' corneas. Flap parameters&#xD;
      (such as flap depth, flap diameter, and hinge angle) should be the same for both eyes. The&#xD;
      eye to receive Cheetah flap will be randomized (ratio of 1:1 for right eye and left eye) and&#xD;
      will be considered the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in phase II will undergo refractive correction via corneal ablation on both eyes&#xD;
      using a commercial excimer laser for vision correction (same excimer laser system shall be&#xD;
      used on both eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study, minor prototype device settings/improvements (with no safety&#xD;
      implications and without compromising the clinical validity of the study) may be performed to&#xD;
      optimize the quality of flap.&#xD;
