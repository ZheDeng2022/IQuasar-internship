  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to use an asynchronous remote communities (ARC) approach both to discover&#xD;
      the design requirements for adapting Behavioral Activation (BA) to ARC as well as&#xD;
      design/build an ARC platform for administering BA. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of our approach in a small feasibility observational study with clinicians and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 3.1 million adolescents are diagnosed with depression (MDD) each year (SAMHSA,&#xD;
      2016), and adolescent onset MDD is associated with chronic physical, mental and psychosocial&#xD;
      disability (Birmaher et al., 1996). However, over 60% of adolescents with MDD do not receive&#xD;
      mental health care, and, among those who do, treatment engagement is low (SAMHSA, 2016;&#xD;
      Olfson et al., 2003). Behavioral Activation (BA) is an evidence-based psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention (EBPI) for individuals with MDD (Dimidjian et al., 2006). While BA holds promise&#xD;
      as an effective treatment with adolescents (McCauley et al., 2015, 2016), previous research&#xD;
      approaches have found that adolescents may be better reached and engaged through social&#xD;
      media, mobile technologies, and other technology platforms (Boyd, 2007; Park &amp; Calamaro,&#xD;
      2013). In addition, BA requires frequent interaction from patients over time, which can be&#xD;
      difficult and costly for clinicians to administer directly. Thus, there is an opportunity to&#xD;
      improve usability and engagement of EBPIs via new technology-based tools. Asynchronous Remote&#xD;
      Communities (ARC) is a promising technology-based approach for engaging adolescents that&#xD;
      capitalizes on the reach of technology while also providing support, social interactions, and&#xD;
      motivation to engage. ARCs are technology-mediated groups that use private online platforms&#xD;
      to deliver weekly tasks to participants and gather information about perceptions in a format&#xD;
      that is lightweight, accessible, usable, and low burden. The investigators aim to use ARC&#xD;
      both to discover the design requirements for adapting BA to ARC as well as design/build an&#xD;
      ARC platform for administering BA. The investigators will test the feasibility of our&#xD;
      approach in a small feasibility study with clinicians and adolescents. The investigators&#xD;
      propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Use the ARC approach with adolescents, primary care physicians, and mental health&#xD;
      specialists to discover target user needs, design constraints and to observe their experience&#xD;
      with ARC: The investigators will first use ARC to collect target user (i.e., primary care&#xD;
      providers (PCP) and mental health specialists, adolescents at risk for depression) data to&#xD;
      understand their needs and the facilitators and barriers to adapting BA to ARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Design &amp; build an ARC platform for BA delivery with adolescents: Once the&#xD;
      investigators have a strong understanding of the facilitators and barriers, the investigators&#xD;
      will design a platform to use the ARC approach for BA delivery via Slack. The investigators&#xD;
      will use an iterative design approach to understand the technical feasibility of the&#xD;
      approach, whether and how to automate parts of the BA intervention using chatbots and other&#xD;
      custom applications within Slack. The investigators will conduct small, informal usability&#xD;
      testing with target users during this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test feasibility and usability with small pilot groups of adolescent and clinician&#xD;
      target users: Once the investigators have a robust enough prototype of the ARC delivery&#xD;
      platform for BA, the investigators will conduct a small pilot study with adolescents at-risk&#xD;
      for depression and clinicians to assess the feasibility and usability of the approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect data on the feasibility, usability, user burden, acceptability,&#xD;
      and symptom outcomes.&#xD;

Thus, the SHAPS was scored as the sum of the 14 items so that total scores ranged from 0 to 14. A higher total SHAPS score indicated higher levels of present state of anhedonia.</description>

    <intervention_name>Behavioral Activation</intervention_name>
    <description>Intervention: Behavioral Activation (BA) therapy is based on a functional analytic model of depression that highlights the need for increased positive reinforcement (rewards) and decreased anhedonia, or diminished motivation to seek rewards, to maintain normal mood. BA is significantly more effective than Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and comparable to antidepressant medication in reducing depressive symptoms among depressed adults (Dimidjian et al., 2006). McCauley (senior mentor) et al. (2016) adapted BA for adolescents to target anhedonia, effective problem solving and avoidant behaviors with peers, family, and school. McCauley's findings and others show BA is a promising intervention for adolescent MDD (Chu et al., 2009; Cuijpers et al.,, 2007; McCauley et al., 2015; Ritschel et al., 2011). BA focuses on targeting ideographically identified avoidant behaviors and rewarding experiences that affect mood.</description>
