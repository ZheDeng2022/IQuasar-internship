  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to explore emotional processing and regulation in individuals with Bulimia&#xD;
      Nervosa (BN) with a view to better understand its underlying causes. Previous research&#xD;
      suggests that binge eating and purging behaviours may be linked to difficulties with emotions&#xD;
      and impulses. However, most of the research has been conducted using self-report methods,&#xD;
      despite the fact that these individuals have difficulties identifying and describing their&#xD;
      emotions (known as alexithymia), making the use of self-report questionable. This project is&#xD;
      the first to use electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective method to disentangle emotional&#xD;
      processing and regulation in these individuals. A combination of three tasks and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used to measure various aspects of an emotional response and its link&#xD;
      to impulsive behaviours in individuals with BN (N=35) and healthy controls (N=35). This study&#xD;
      has the potential to inform future treatment for these individuals.&#xD;

      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and approximately 40% of&#xD;
      these - 640,000 - suffer from bulimia nervosa (BN). Research shows that at 10 years after&#xD;
      diagnosis, only about half the people with BN will have recovered fully, demonstrating the&#xD;
      importance of developing new and more effective treatment. A recently published study&#xD;
      suggests that training emotion regulation skills may work as an alternative treatment. This&#xD;
      is because difficulties with emotions have been shown to contribute to eating disorder&#xD;
      pathologies. However, most studies looking at emotional difficulties in this population have&#xD;
      used self-report methods, despite the fact that high levels of alexithymia (difficulties with&#xD;
      identifying and describing emotions) characterise this population, indicating that these&#xD;
      findings are potentially flawed. In addition, self-report data show that two processes seem&#xD;
      involved in eating disorders, namely emotional intensity and emotional dysregulation.&#xD;
      However, experiencing emotions with higher intensity also makes it harder to reappraise&#xD;
      emotions so it is not clear whether individuals with BN actually have a real deficit in&#xD;
      emotion regulation, because self-reports cannot distinguish the two. The current project is&#xD;
      proposing to use an objective way to disentangle these aspects of emotional processing by&#xD;
      looking at two brain activities. The first is called the N1 because it appears about 100 ms&#xD;
      after the presentation of a stimulus and is of negative amplitude; the second is called the&#xD;
      LPP for Late Positive Potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal also aims to investigate the mechanisms behind the observed link between&#xD;
      negative urgency (acting impulsively under distress) and binge eating by exploring the&#xD;
      brain's ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli in the environment -also called sensory&#xD;
      gating. Whilst individuals are constantly being stimulated by information, the brain usually&#xD;
      filters irrelevant information to prevent the cortex from being overloaded. However, if too&#xD;
      much attention is directed towards a stimulus (such as a negative event or food stimuli),&#xD;
      sensory gating deficits may occur, which could lead to cognitive deficits such as negative&#xD;
      urgency. In a previous study, the investigators have shown impaired sensory gating in bipolar&#xD;
      disorders and due to similarities in affective processing between bipolar disorder and BN as&#xD;
      well as high comorbidity between these disorders, the investigators suggest similar&#xD;
      mechanisms may be in place in BN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has strong implications for treatment, because different approaches could be&#xD;
      used depending on what processes are affected (e.g. training to reallocate attention vs&#xD;
      helping with emotion regulation strategies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to answer the following four research questions using three tasks to&#xD;
      measure emotional processing and regulation (Task 1), emotional sensory gating (Task 2), and&#xD;
      negative urgency (Task 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is binge eating associated with higher emotional intensity, as indicated by larger N1&#xD;
           amplitudes in BN compared to controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do individuals with BN show poor emotion regulation skills, as indicated by larger LPP&#xD;
           amplitudes in the reappraisal condition compared to controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do individuals with BN show impaired emotional sensory gating, as indicated by lower P50&#xD;
           ratio compared to controls? 3.1. If so, can deficits in emotional sensory gating explain&#xD;
           the emotional difficulties seen in BN, including negative urgency?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To what extent do emotional intensity, emotion regulation deficits and emotional sensory&#xD;
           gating deficits predict binge eating in BN?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant selection Since there are no similar studies conducted in participants with&#xD;
      Bulimia Nervosa, the investigators calculated our sample size based on power analysis from&#xD;
      other studies. Sample size varied between 13 and 33 participants to have an 80% chance of&#xD;
      finding an effect and a level of significance of 5%. The investigators will recruit 35&#xD;
      participants in each group. Thirty five control participants will be recruited through a&#xD;
      mailing list available at Bournemouth University (which includes students as well as&#xD;
      non-students).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty five female participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) will be recruited from Kimmeridge&#xD;
      Court in Bournemouth. Dr Ciaran Newell (Consultant Nurse Eating Disorders) will advertise our&#xD;
      study to new patients diagnosed with BN. When patients are referred to Kimmeridge court, they&#xD;
      will be told about the current study. It will be emphasised that taking part in the study is&#xD;
      completely separate from their treatment and that whether or not they decide to participate&#xD;
      will not have any influence on their treatment. If participants decide to participate they&#xD;
      will be told to contact the PI (Dr Laura Vuillier) who will give them more information over&#xD;
      the phone or face to face, depending on their preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design If participants do agree to participate, participants will be sent a survey via&#xD;
      email. At the start of the study, participants will see a participant information sheet&#xD;
      detailing the study. Participants will then be asked to sign an electronic consent form if&#xD;
      they agree to participate. This survey will ask questions about their emotions and their&#xD;
      eating patterns. This survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Their response&#xD;
      will be pseudonymous as participants will be asked to enter a pseudonymous code. At the end&#xD;
      of the survey participants will be asked to contact the experimenter to arrange a convenient&#xD;
      time for the laboratory session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory session will take about 3 hours, including breaks and will take place in the&#xD;
      premises of Bournemouth University (Talbot campus). Thereparticipants will be given another&#xD;
      information sheet detailing this next part of the study. Participants will be asked to sign&#xD;
      another consent form before they can proceed. If participants agree to participate, the&#xD;
      researcher will administrate a structural interview (using the SCID short version) to confirm&#xD;
      their eating disorder diagnosis. After this, the electroencephalography (EEG) experiment will&#xD;
      start. All parts of the experiment (including the survey, the SCID and the three tasks) will&#xD;
      be pseudonymous and participants will not have to give any personal detail such as their&#xD;
      name. The only place the investigators will ask for their name is when participants sign the&#xD;
      consent form. However, these will be stored in a separate location and it will not be&#xD;
      possible to link these with their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the experiment, a cap with electrodes will be placed on their head to&#xD;
      record their brain activity. This will take about 30 minutes to set up. Then, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete 3 computer tasks: an emotion regulation task (task 1), a sensory&#xD;
      gating task (task 2) and a GoNogo task (task 3, all three are defined below). Each task will&#xD;
      take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Participants will be told they can take a break&#xD;
      during each task and also between tasks. Then the investigators will remove the cap with the&#xD;
      electrodes and the participants will be able to wash their hair (some gel is used on the&#xD;
      electrodes) before they leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: Emotional processing and regulation This task will show 50 emotional pictures from a&#xD;
      picture library accompanied by a neutral or negative description. For instance, a picture of&#xD;
      a woman dying will be either preceded by a neutral description (These doctors will save the&#xD;
      woman's life) or negative description (These workers have found a war victim). Reappraisal is&#xD;
      measured with the neutral description as participants will interpret the picture in a less&#xD;
      negative way. Previous work conducted in healthy participants show a reduction in one brain&#xD;
      activity (the LPP, or Late Positive Potential) in the reappraisal condition, and larger&#xD;
      amplitudes for another brain activity (the N1, for Negative activity appearing 100ms after a&#xD;
      stimulus) for stimuli with a negative valence reflecting higher attentional processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: Sensory gating The sensory gating deficit hypothesis will be tested in a paired-click&#xD;
      paradigm using 40 pictures of negative valence, 40 pictures of food, and 40 neutral pictures&#xD;
      from an affective picture library. Participants will be asked to passively watch the 120&#xD;
      pictures while the participants hear two clicks. Sensory gating will be measured as the&#xD;
      difference in amplitude in one brain activity (called the P50) between the first and second&#xD;
      click in all three conditions. This difference in amplitude shows that the brain filtered the&#xD;
      second stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3: Negative urgency Negative urgency will be measured with our GoNogo task. This task&#xD;
      requires participants to 'go' (e.g. key press) when viewing a specific stimulus, but to 'not&#xD;
      go' (e.g. not key press) when viewing a different stimulus. To provide the emotional context&#xD;
      to our paradigm the task will use 50 negative emotional and 50 neutral pictorial stimuli. The&#xD;
      percentage of false alarms is considered an index of negative urgency, since it represents an&#xD;
      unsuccessful attempt at controlling an impulsive action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use validated questionnaires including the Eating Disorder Examination&#xD;
      Questionnaire, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale,&#xD;
      and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale to correlate self-report data with brain activity and&#xD;
      understand how these levels of explanation are related.&#xD;
