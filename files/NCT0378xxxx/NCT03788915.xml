      Background: Systematic reviews conclude that Internet and mobile interventions can&#xD;
      significantly change lifestyle in a short time span. The applicant has developed a&#xD;
      collaborative eHealth tool (LIVA) that has led to a significant and clinically relevant&#xD;
      weight loss of 5.4 to 7.0 kg over 12 to 20 months in primary care settings. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to develop and evaluate a model targeting long-term effects using eHealth&#xD;
      coaching assisted by machine learning-generated advice intervention for overweight patients&#xD;
      at risk of developing diabetes as well as current type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients in a primary&#xD;
      care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Randomized controlled trial with 1-year intervention and 1-year&#xD;
      maintenance. The primary outcome is weight loss and the secondary outcome is reduced HbA1c&#xD;
      level. The study will comprise 340 overweight patients of which 170 will have T2D. Individual&#xD;
      data will be obtained from clinical measurements, questionnaire data, registered from the&#xD;
      collaborative eHealth tool, as well as other registry data at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months. The core of the intervention is the establishment of an empathic relationship and&#xD;
      ongoing real-life coaching using the LIVA app (working together with native iOS and Android)&#xD;
      and Internet for patients combined with an effective coaching module supported by machine&#xD;
      learning methods. The intervention will be compared with usual care.&#xD;

      1. Introduction With diseases such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D), adiposity and cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases rapidly increasing, cost effective management is needed (World Health&#xD;
           Organization, 2017). Lifestyle improvements such as weight loss, diet and exercise&#xD;
           managed in a primary care setting has shown significant impact on reduced risk of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease and reversing T2D for 46-56% of patients with T2D (Lean et al.,&#xD;
           2017, Johansen et al., 2017). Based on these findings, weight loss among overweight&#xD;
           patients with T2D and patients at risk of developing T2D has important clinical and&#xD;
           societal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Traditional lifestyle interventions are mostly ineffective and expensive long-term.&#xD;
           Internet and mobile technology-based interventions aiming at promoting healthy&#xD;
           lifestyles have shown potential for scalability, accessibility, and cost effective use&#xD;
           in primary care settings both for overweight patients and T2D patients (Brandt et al,&#xD;
           2011, Haste et al., 2017, Komkova et al 2018). However, there is only sparse knowledge&#xD;
           about whether the beneficial effects are long-term (Afshin et al., 2016, Levine et al.,&#xD;
           2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative research studies comprising patients, general practitioners and the&#xD;
           healthcare professionals' perspectives suggest that the establishment of an empathic&#xD;
           relationship is key to long-term lifestyle change (Brandt et al., 2018a, 2018b and&#xD;
           2018c). An observational study among 103 diabetes patients using the collaborative&#xD;
           eHealth tool (LIVA) demonstrated a clinically significant self-reported weight loss of&#xD;
           4.7 kg among users who had been on the platform for 90+ days (Komkova et al., 2018).&#xD;
           Modelling the association between weight reduction and decreased health care costs, the&#xD;
           same study estimated that the program will save 2,667€ annually for every patient and be&#xD;
           cost effective from a municipal perspective even with only 1 year of implementation data&#xD;
           for T2D patients (Mukherjee et al., 2016, Nichols et al., 2016, Bell et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present study, the model to be tested is a lifestyle intervention using a&#xD;
           cost-effective eHealth coaching tool (LIVA) model: following an initial meeting,&#xD;
           frequent digital communication is established between health coach and patient,&#xD;
           supplemented by machine learning. Machine learning is performed using data automatically&#xD;
           gathered from patients' relevant daily lifestyle registrations such as activity level,&#xD;
           step count, diet goals fulfilment, sleep, etc. Data will be analysed to predict&#xD;
           attrition and outcome. The developed algorithms and models will then be used to increase&#xD;
           outcome and decrease dropout by supporting the health coaches with information and&#xD;
           guidance how to deliver better coaching directly and indirectly. This intervention will&#xD;
           be compared with standard lifestyle interventions in a municipality setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study objectives and hypothesis The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
           efficacy of the LIVA intervention for overweight patients at risk of developing a&#xD;
           chronic disease and overweight type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care setting. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that the LIVA intervention will lead to significant weight loss, reduced&#xD;
           HbA1C, and reduced need for medication compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods and analysis Study design and setting The study is a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           with one year of intervention and one year of subsequent maintenance, with continued&#xD;
           collection of clinical and questionnaire data, where the primary endpoint is weight loss&#xD;
           and the secondary endpoint is HbA1c. The intervention is conducted in a real life&#xD;
           setting; all data management will be at the Research Unit for General Practice,&#xD;
           Department of Public Health, Primary trial sponsor, J.B. Winsløwsvej 9A, 5000 Odense C,&#xD;
           Denmark. Recruitment of patients to the study is in 8-10 municipalities within the&#xD;
           Region of Southern Denmark and the Capitol Region of Denmark. The study has been&#xD;
           registered at https://register.clinicaltrials.gov. On-boarding of patients began in&#xD;
           March 2018 and the results are expected to be accessible during 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population and inclusion criteria Flow of patients is described in figure 1. In&#xD;
           each municipality, advertising through social media will be used to recruit eligible&#xD;
           patients for municipal preventive offers, fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the study&#xD;
           (Table 1). These patients will be contacted by phone and/ or email, and informed about&#xD;
           the study and asked to register if they accept the offer to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           BMI 45 ≥ 30 kg/m2 Aged 18 -70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fails to provide informed consent Fails to complete the initial questionnaire or&#xD;
           understand Danish No Internet access in own home through computer or smartphone Is&#xD;
           pregnant or actively trying to get pregnant Experiences mental or serious&#xD;
           life-threatening disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 340 eligible patients will be invited to an introduction meeting with an healthcare&#xD;
           professional with a master's in human nutrition or a clinical dietician. This&#xD;
           introductory appointment is scheduled within 7-14 days after the information material is&#xD;
           received by the patient. The patient is weighed and measured according to defined&#xD;
           clinical indicators. Blood indicators are measured through a finger prick blood sample.&#xD;
           The patient is then instructed to use a web link to complete a standard quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire (SF-12) combined with registration of medication intake and questions&#xD;
           concerning the patient's sociodemographic characteristics, such as educational level,&#xD;
           labour market affiliation, questions concerning work performance, and disease history.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After patients have successfully completed the web questionnaire, they will be&#xD;
           randomized via an automated computer algorithm. This procedure ensures that drop-out&#xD;
           characteristics can be recorded. Patients are randomized in a 60:40 sequencing, where&#xD;
           60% of recruited patients are randomized for the intervention group while the remaining&#xD;
           40% will constitute the control group, based on sample size calculations (Please see&#xD;
           Sample size calculations, below). Randomization is controlled to ensure that 50% of&#xD;
           intervention group and controls will be overweight patients at risk of developing&#xD;
           chronic disease and the other 50% of intervention group and controls will be overweight&#xD;
           diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention is summarised in Table 2. Based on results in the applicant's PhD&#xD;
           thesis, the core of the intervention is the initial establishment of an empathic&#xD;
           relationship with a healthcare professional who is a clinical dietician by profession&#xD;
           and has been working with eHealth lifestyle coaching for more than 2 years (referred to&#xD;
           as the health coach) and who delivers effective remote and/or digital coaching&#xD;
           responsive to the users' own data registrations (Brandt et al, 2018a). Patients in the&#xD;
           intervention group receive a login to the eHealth tool at a personal meeting (either&#xD;
           physical or digital) during which the health coach introduces the program. Together, the&#xD;
           patient and the health coach agree on goals for diet, physical exercise, sleep, etc.&#xD;
           (Brandt et al, 2018b). Using the app, patients fill in a daily record as well as their&#xD;
           comments, concerns and questions for the health coach, who will have access to patient&#xD;
           profiles. The health coach provides individual asynchronous advice according to the&#xD;
           patients' needs based on the patients' own real-time registrations (Brandt et al,&#xD;
           2018c); the health coach's advice is supported by artificial intelligence predictions&#xD;
           using machine learning (Holzinger A. et al, 2017). The coach advises on goal setting&#xD;
           based on the SMART model: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely, and&#xD;
           according to a predefined guideline structure (Ryan et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Asynchronous advice will be provided on a weekly basis during the first 6 months.&#xD;
           Subsequently, advice will be given monthly for 6 months. After 12 months, the&#xD;
           participant enters maintenance for 12 months, where the coach will still follow&#xD;
           patients' registrations and may give four to twelve coaching sessions during that year.&#xD;
           Patients can also participate in usual municipally provided preventive medicine&#xD;
           offerings, such as &quot;diabetes school&quot;, to the extent that the municipalities normally&#xD;
           provide such offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conventional care (control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients randomized to the control group will be offered standard municipal secondary or&#xD;
           tertiary preventive offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study endpoints and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement of endpoints (weight, HbA1c etc.) will be conducted by the health coach at&#xD;
           baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months' follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weight loss from baseline to 12 months' follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome Reduction in HbA1c for all patients from baseline to 12 months for&#xD;
           patients with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following tertiary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 12 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Retention rates among users&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and TG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients' quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in patterns of medication Apart from these outcomes, patient demographic&#xD;
                characteristics (gender, age, highest educational level) will be measured at&#xD;
                baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis strategy Primary analyses will be performed blinded by statisticians and&#xD;
           comprise subgroup analyses based on stratification according to patient characteristics&#xD;
           and experiences. Statistical significance will be inferred at a two-tailed and p&lt;0.05&#xD;
           significance level. All data will be accessible on the Internet in anonymised form to&#xD;
           allow full peer scrutiny and facilitate secondary research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculations The primary objective of this study is measurement of changes&#xD;
           in body weight and waist circumference. Weight loss in the intervention group and&#xD;
           control group will be analysed using appropriate statistical procedures. Based on a&#xD;
           recent study by Haste and colleagues evaluating a web-based weight loss intervention&#xD;
           among men with diabetes, we expect a weight loss of at least 4.5 kg at 12 months in the&#xD;
           intervention group, compared to 2.5 kg in the control group, as well as dropout rates of&#xD;
           39% among the intervention group and 57% among control group at 12 months (Haste et al.,&#xD;
           2017). A power calculation based on the standard deviations observed in the study&#xD;
           performed by Haste et al shows that to detect a difference in weight loss of 2 kg with a&#xD;
           power of 0.95% requires 55 patients in the intervention group and 32 in the control&#xD;
           group. To be able to stratify analyses according to overweight patients at risk of&#xD;
           developing chronic disease and overweight diabetes patients we will therefore recruit&#xD;
           200 (100+100) in the intervention groups and 140 (70+70) controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethics The intervention is not expected to cause any side effects or discomfort except&#xD;
           for the ones a change in lifestyle can bring. The only recognized risk is in relation to&#xD;
           eating disorders (pre-existing or developing during the study) and the dieticians and&#xD;
           nurses involved in the study will specifically look out for indications of this. The&#xD;
           Regional Ethical Committee (Regional Videnskabsetisk Komité) have accepted the study in&#xD;
           according to Danish law. Participant data will be handled and stored in accordance with&#xD;
           rules approved by the Danish Data Inspectorate (Datatilsynet). Permission to handle&#xD;
           individual patient data from the national registries will be obtained from patients and&#xD;
           the Danish Data Inspectorate. All data will be analysed in anonymous form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Publication The results of the studies will be published in international journals in&#xD;
           accordance with the Vancouver rules. Furthermore, participants will be invited to a&#xD;
           presentation of results at the end of the study and news media will be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Conflict of Interests Carl J. Brandt has co-founded and works as a medical consultant&#xD;
           for LIVA Healthcare A/S, the company that has developed parts of the technical platform&#xD;
           and will host some of it during the study. Carl J. Brandt works at the Research Unit for&#xD;
           General Practice and CIMT at SDU. Camilla Sortsø is working for LIVA Healthcare A/S,&#xD;
           Jens Søndergaard, Jesper B. Nielsen and Jørgen T. Lauridsen have no financial interest&#xD;
           in LIVA Healthcare A/S or any other aspects of this study.&#xD;
