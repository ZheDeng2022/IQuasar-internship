  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy. The compression of the&#xD;
      median nerve occurs in the carpal tunnel and results in pain and other unpleasant sensations&#xD;
      in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other&#xD;
      muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual&#xD;
      performance. The Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) is one of the most commonly used&#xD;
      tools for monitoring of the disease progression and of the effect of therapy. Originally&#xD;
      created in English, it has been translated into many languages and subsequently validated.&#xD;
      Recently the Polish version has been created and the purpose of this study is to validate it.&#xD;

      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy. The compression of&#xD;
      the median nerve occurs in the carpal tunnel and results in pain and other unpleasant&#xD;
      sensations in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and&#xD;
      other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of&#xD;
      manual performance. The Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) (Levine et al. 1993) is one&#xD;
      of the most commonly used tools for monitoring of the disease progression and of the effect&#xD;
      of therapy. It is a self administered questionnaire, which consists of two subscales, the&#xD;
      Symptom severity scale and the Functional status scale. In the first one, the severity of&#xD;
      particular symptoms is rated between none or never to very severe or continuous where&#xD;
      appropriate. In the second one, the difficulties in performing several typical daily tasks,&#xD;
      requiring manual activity is rated between &quot;no difficulty&quot; to &quot;cannot perform activity at all&#xD;
      due to hands and wrists symptoms&quot;. Originally created in English, it has been translated into&#xD;
      many languages and subsequently validated. Recently the Polish version has been created&#xD;
      (Polish version of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire - pBCTQ) and the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to validate it. The translation from English to Polish has been independently made&#xD;
      by two health professionals, native Polish speakers with good acquired knowledge of English.&#xD;
      Next, both Polish versions were independently backward-translated to English, by two native&#xD;
      English speakers with good acquired knowledge of Polish. Finally, all translators met&#xD;
      together and all translations were presented to everyone of them. Possible mistakes in&#xD;
      translations from original version into Polish, which might led to discrepancies between&#xD;
      backwardly translated versions (from Polish to English) and the original version were&#xD;
      discussed and the final version was created. The first step of the study on validation of the&#xD;
      Polish version will be the pre-testing. In this step, pBCTQ will be administered to small&#xD;
      sample of patients (ten in this study) and the investigators will interview in detail how&#xD;
      these participants understand each question of the questionnaire. If pre-testing reveals that&#xD;
      patients may understand any question differently from its meaning in the original version,&#xD;
      final adjustments will be discussed among the translators and possibly introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final pBCTQ will be administered before and after surgical treatment to the convenience&#xD;
      group of 120 patients with electrodiagnostically confirmed CTS. Moreover, 30 randomly&#xD;
      selected patients will be asked to fill out pBCTQ additionally, two weeks after first&#xD;
      administration but before surgical treatment. Data from this subgroup will serve to assess&#xD;
      the test-retest reliability. pBCTQ will be tested also regarding its consistency, validity&#xD;
      and reactivity.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited from the patients referred to Krakowska Akademia Neurologii&#xD;
        Centrum Neurologii Klinicznej for electrohysiologic verification of their initial, clinical&#xD;
        diagnosis of CTS. After the electrophysiology confirms the CTS, the patient will be asked&#xD;
        if she/he would like to take part in the study.&#xD;
