      This is a qualitative study of local organizational and provider practice norms, and how&#xD;
      these norms influence patient and family expectations and provider decision-making heuristics&#xD;
      for minority patients with advanced cancer at major US cancer centers. Outpatient visits with&#xD;
      oncologists will be observed and documented via hand-written field notes. Semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with selected participating clinicians, patients, caregivers, and other informants&#xD;
      will follow the initial observation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify organizational and provider practice norms at major&#xD;
      US cancer centers, and how these norms influence patient and family expectations and provider&#xD;
      decision-making heuristics for later-line chemotherapy, hospice, and ICU admission among&#xD;
      minority patients with advanced cancer. Norms are rules about which there is at least some&#xD;
      degree of consensus, enforced through social sanctions. Heuristics are unconscious judgments&#xD;
      or rules of thumb.The study team will collect direct observation data from outpatient clinic&#xD;
      visits, and semi-structured interview data from selected participating providers, patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and other informants following the initial observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will perform 2-week, qualitative case studies of 3 theoretically sampled&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Oncology&#xD;
      practice managers' nominations of providers with particular cancer focuses, high volumes, and&#xD;
      high peer influence will be used to sample oncologic clinicians to shadow in outpatient&#xD;
      clinic settings. Observations will be hand-written during the clinic visit, and later&#xD;
      dictated and transcribed. Observed providers will be invited to be interviewed. Select&#xD;
      patients and caregivers will also be invited to be interviewed following initial clinic&#xD;
      observation. Other informants will be invited to be interviewed on an ad hoc basis. All&#xD;
      interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and interviews will be semi-structured to&#xD;
      allow for natural flow of conversation. Observations and interviews will all be done by the&#xD;
      study PI, project coordinator, and/or another research team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical observations and semi-structured interviews will assess the following outcomes: 1)&#xD;
      formal and informal organizational norms influencing provider decision-making, 2) provider&#xD;
      decision-making heuristics, and 3) patient and caregiver expectations. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed regarding receipt of chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life, intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) admission in the last 30 days of life, and non or late hospice referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also aim to to explore the how COVID-19 intersects with organizational and provider norms,&#xD;
      practices, and service delivery for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
