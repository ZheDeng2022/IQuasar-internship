  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main OBJECTIVE of this proposal is to extend our preclinical findings on the role of DNA&#xD;
      damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibition as a therapy for a devastating&#xD;
      disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to early-phase clinical trials. We, and&#xD;
      others, have published strong evidence that DNA damage accounts for disease progression in&#xD;
      PAH and showed that PARP1 inhibition can reverse PAH in several animal models1.&#xD;
      Interestingly, PARP1 inhibition is also cardioprotective. Olaparib, an orally available PARP1&#xD;
      inhibitor, can reverse cancer growth in animals and humans with a good safety profile, and is&#xD;
      now approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in Canada, Europe and the USA. The time is&#xD;
      thus right to translate our findings in human PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Phase 1B study is to confirm the safety of using olaparib in&#xD;
      PAH patients, and precise the sample size of a future Phase 2 trial. In addition to safety,&#xD;
      efficacy signals will thus be assessed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall, 20 well-characterized PAH patients that have been stable for &gt;4 months on standard&#xD;
      PAH-therapies, as per guidelines will be recruited. The initial Health Canada approval will&#xD;
      be obtained. Olaparib will be provided by AstraZeneca Canada, but AZ had no input into the&#xD;
      trial design and will not be involved in the conduct of the trial, analysis, interpretation&#xD;
      of the results or the final manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-week pre-treatment phase will allow ensuring that patients are on stable doses of PAH&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that PAH is a chronic disease and that patients may be at higher risk for drug-related&#xD;
      adverse events (e.g. anemia), olaparib will be started at low-dose (100mg BID), then&#xD;
      up-titrated weekly by 100mg BID up to 200mg BID (n=5, group 1) or 300mg BID (n=15, group 2)&#xD;
      for a total treatment duration (including the up-titration phase) of 24 weeks. Using 100mg&#xD;
      and 150mg tablets will allow minimizing the number of tablets taken (e.g. 2 x 150mg tablets&#xD;
      BID) or adjusting the dose in case of drug-related adverse events (e.g. 250mg BID using 100mg&#xD;
      and 150mg tablets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be regularly followed to assess whether side effects are observed and whether&#xD;
      olaparib can be up-titrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and week 24, a cardiac catheterization will assess changes in pulmonary&#xD;
      hemodynamics and RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end-of-study visit is planned at week 28 week.&#xD;

                  combination. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent and&#xD;
                  continue throughout the period of taking study treatment and for at least 1 month&#xD;
                  after last dose of study drug(s), or they must totally/truly abstain from any&#xD;
                  form of sexual intercourse.&#xD;

        olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of&#xD;
        childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective&#xD;
        form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Male patients should not&#xD;
        donate sperm throughout the period of taking olaparib and for 3 months following the last&#xD;
