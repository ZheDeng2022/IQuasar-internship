  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether cold-stored platelets (CSP) are equally, more effective,&#xD;
      or uniquely effective at reversing the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in healthy human&#xD;
      subjects compared to room-temperature-stored platelets (RTP). The investigators plan to&#xD;
      enroll healthy human subjects without risk factors for bleeding to achieve 60 complete data&#xD;
      sets. Each subject will donate two apheresis platelet units. One platelet unit will be stored&#xD;
      in the cold (CSP) and one platelet unit will be stored at room temperature (RTP). Subjects&#xD;
      will be given dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) prior to autologous&#xD;
      transfusion of each unit. Platelet function testing will be performed before and after&#xD;
      transfusion to measure reversal of the antiplatelet drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject is in good health, is taking no excluded medications and meets platelet donor&#xD;
        suitability requirements aimed at assuring donor safety.&#xD;

          1. Subject self-reports that he or she feels well and healthy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be 18-59 years old, of either sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Temperature: less than or equal to 99.5 F&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Resting blood pressure: systolic less than or equal to 180 mmHg, diastolic less than&#xD;
             or equal to100 mmHg&#xD;

          5. Resting heart rate: 40 to 100 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Weight: greater than or equal to110 pounds,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hematocrit: greater than or equal to 35 percent for females, greater than or equal to&#xD;
             38 percent for males, but not greater than 55 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Platelet count able to achieve target platelet yield per apheresis machine&#xD;
             configuration parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must be able to read, understand and sign the informed consent document and&#xD;
             commit to the study follow-up schedule. The ability to read and speak English is&#xD;
             required for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject must agree to avoid taking any aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs (e.g.,&#xD;
             Alka-Seltzer, Bufferin, Excedrin) or NSAIDs (e.g.,Feldene, Motrin, Aleve, Advil) or&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Current drug or alcohol dependence by subject's declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Currently pregnant or nursing as assessed during interview. A urine pregnancy test&#xD;
