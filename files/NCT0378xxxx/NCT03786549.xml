  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background The pediatric-adult care transition is a risk-disrupting time for patients with&#xD;
      chronic disease. This care transition takes place during adolescence; a period of&#xD;
      psychological upheavals and adaptations of family roles. During this period, medication&#xD;
      adherence is non-optimal and absenteeism at medical appointments is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the first genetic disease detected in France. It is chronic&#xD;
      disease characterized by frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring emergency&#xD;
      hospitalization when they are severe. Other serious complications are acute chest syndromes&#xD;
      (ACS) and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve the health status of teenagers with sickle cell disease, it is necessary&#xD;
      to anticipate this care transition and to involve the pediatric and adult sectors. The&#xD;
      biopsychosocial health approach and the Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult&#xD;
      Readiness to Transition (SMART) describe a care transition integrating bioclinical and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors such as integration of the patient's family, education on disease and&#xD;
      therapeutics, psychological management of pain and medico-social orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pediatric-adult transition program proposed is based on this biopsychosocial approach. It&#xD;
      aims to improve the health status of adolescents with SCD, their quality of life and the use&#xD;
      of health care service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study To assess the impact of a pediatric-adult transition program on the&#xD;
      incidence of sickle-cell-related complications leading to hospitalization on 24-months after&#xD;
      transfer to the adult sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation focuses on severe complications leading to hospitalization, such as VOC, ACS,&#xD;
      and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Multicenter Open-label individual Randomized Controlled Trial Population :&#xD;
      Patients aged at least 16 years old with sickle cell disease, and their parents (or legal&#xD;
      representatives Number of subject : 196 patients (98 patients by arm) The study will last 24&#xD;
      months Expected results For patients and families Better health and quality of life for&#xD;
      patients is expected, including better use of medical care after the transition program. It&#xD;
      is also expected a better experience of the pediatric-adult care transition and indirectly a&#xD;
      better experience of intrafamilial relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For health professionals This project is expected to provide solutions to improve the&#xD;
      pediatric-adult care transition of patients with chronic disease. Indeed, the methodological&#xD;
      quality of the study will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed&#xD;
      program, to possibly adapt it and test it to other chronic diseases presenting the same care&#xD;
      transition problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of public health SCD mainly affects populations of sub-Saharan origin, with low&#xD;
      visibility and high social vulnerability. By focusing on this population, this project will&#xD;
      reduce the social inequalities in health, experienced by patients with SCD and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By improving the health, quality of life and care of patients with SCD, this project is&#xD;
      expected to decrease the cost of the pediatric-adult care transition period.&#xD;
