      The aim of this registry to understand the natural history and disease progression in ALD and&#xD;
      potentially develop bio-markers using the biospecimens collected using this registry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, non-therapeutic protocol designed to create and maintain a registry of&#xD;
      participants with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and known/presumed mutation for ALD. This study&#xD;
      also involves maintaining a prospective biorepository to collect and store buccal swab,&#xD;
      blood, stool and urine samples as well. In this protocol, pediatric (including infants),&#xD;
      adolescents and adult patients with confirmed or presumed ALD (based on positive VLCFA&#xD;
      testing and/or confirmed mutation) will be offered potential study participation.&#xD;
      Additionally, presumed mutation for ALD (based on pedigree or confirmed mutation) will be&#xD;
      offered potential study participation. After appropriate consent (online or in-person),&#xD;
      subjects will be requested to provide a medical history (with authorization of release of&#xD;
      medical records), longitudinal biospecimens, and permission to perform laboratory analyses on&#xD;
      these samples. The overall goal is to understand the natural disease course in affected and&#xD;
      unaffected patients (identified patients and relatives with a diagnosis of ALD), as well as&#xD;
      women with ALD to assemble a resource of clinical, medical, and biological data from the&#xD;
      participants. This study also aims to understand the outcomes of this disease, as well as&#xD;
      possibly develop biomarkers to identify prognostic markers for disease progression, which may&#xD;
      help develop effective interventions. The biospecimen bank and registry will provide access&#xD;
      to samples and data for the ongoing studies as well as will provide an important resource for&#xD;
      the future research.&#xD;
