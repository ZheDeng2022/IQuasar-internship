      this study investigator will resaearsh about the efficacy of addition of ketorlac or&#xD;
      dexamethasone to alcohol in ablation of ganglion impar in pelvic tumour to asses thier&#xD;
      efficacy in increasing the intensity or the duration of the block&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of administration of ketorolac versus&#xD;
      dexamethasone on CT guided ganglion impar block with ethyl alcohol in patients with pelvic&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the onset of sensory block, patient satisfaction measured by&#xD;
      patient satisfaction score ( Jones KD, Sutton C., 2003), intensity of pain measured by a&#xD;
      linear visual analogue scale (VAS) (Bourdel, N. et al., 2014) and incidence of early&#xD;
      complications and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will include the duration of sensory block, the time and the amount of&#xD;
      post-procedure analgesic requirement, itching and any associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that CT guided ganglion impar block will be a good choice in pain reduction&#xD;
      in patients with chronic pelvic pain. Pain reduction will be greater in dexamethasone and&#xD;
      ketorolac group compared to alcohol group.Preinterventional assessment includes general, pain&#xD;
      specific history taking (location, quality, intensity, relieving and provoking incidences)&#xD;
      and pain in specific physical examination (inspection and palpation) will be carried out.&#xD;
      Type of pelvic tumor, investigation related to tumor, previous operations, chemotherapy,&#xD;
      basic demographic variables including age, sex and body mass index will be recorded. Routine&#xD;
      investigations include bleeding profiles (bleeding time, clotting time, INR), blood picture,&#xD;
      liver and kidney function tests will be carried out. A linear visual analogue scale (VAS) on&#xD;
      a scale of 0-10 mm (where 0 for no pain and 10 for worst pain) will be explained to each&#xD;
      patient. Written informed consent will be obtained, detailed information on risks and&#xD;
      complications will be provided.The vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, spo2) will be&#xD;
      recorded. After establishing an access to peripheral venous line, 500 ml normal saline will&#xD;
      be given to the patient, the patient will be in the prone position with a pillow under the&#xD;
      abdomen to allow flexion of the lumbo-sacral spine with internal rotation of the lower&#xD;
      extremities.All patients will be asked to empty the bladder and rectum before the start of&#xD;
      the procedure to facilitate needle placement and avoid inadvertent injection. The&#xD;
      pre-injection planning images will be obtained using CT with 2 mm axial section thickness. A&#xD;
      needle localizer will be placed on the skin surface to identify and mark the sacro-coccygeal&#xD;
      disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterilization of The patient's sacral and gluteal areas will be provided with povidone iodine&#xD;
      antiseptic solution and this area was circumferentially draped with sterile towels. Under&#xD;
      aseptic technique, a skin wheal will be raised with 2 ml lignocaine 0.5% using 23 G needle&#xD;
      either in midline or paramedian approach. After identifying the ganglion impar, usually at&#xD;
      the level of the sacro-coccygeal disc, a 25 G, 9 cm long spinal needle will be introduced at&#xD;
      approximately 6-9 cm from midline and a small amount of non-ionic contrast medium (0.5 ml&#xD;
      iopamidol; 300 mg/ml) will be injected. The midline approach may be selected according to&#xD;
      patient position and operative condition. In the midline approach the sacro-coccygeal disc is&#xD;
      identified and needle will be introduced perpendicular through the disc and just encroaching&#xD;
      upon presacro-coccygeal space. The patient will be rescanned to confirm the position of the&#xD;
      tip of the spinal needle at the anterior aspect of the sacro-coccygeal junction in the&#xD;
      retroperitoneal space (Datir A and Connell D., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, 3 ml lidocaine 2% will be injected, three minutes later 5 ml absolute alcohol 95%&#xD;
      ± 8 mg dexamethasone or (15 mg ketorolac) will be slowly injected for therapeutic chemical&#xD;
      neurolysis.&#xD;
