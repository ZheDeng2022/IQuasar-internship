  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin B12 plays a key role in the development and normal functioning of the brain and&#xD;
      nervous system. Unborn and new-born infants derive their vitamin B12 stores almost entirely&#xD;
      from maternal B12 stores. As such, infants who are born to vegetarian mothers and exclusively&#xD;
      breast fed are at a high-risk of B12 deficiency. This is because the best sources of vitamin&#xD;
      B12 are found in animal based or fortified foods (e.g. cheese, milk and eggs). Vitamin B12&#xD;
      deficiency is widely reported among antenatal mothers and children, particularly in Low and&#xD;
      Middle Income Countries (LMICs) where these food sources are uncommon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, studies have shown that antenatal vitamin B12 deficiency in mothers may be associated&#xD;
      with poorer neurodevelopment in their children. Furthermore, vitamin B12 supplementation&#xD;
      during pregnancy and early lactation has been shown to increase maternal, breast milk, and&#xD;
      infant levels of vitamin B12. Although existing literature documents several studies on&#xD;
      maternal vitamin B12 supplementation, there is a lack of research on the causative effect of&#xD;
      maternal vitamin B12 supplementation on infant development. This project, funded by the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC), will undertake a multi-centric nutritional trial in Nepal and&#xD;
      India, as these are two LMICs where high incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency is reported.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a multi-centric, double-blind and parallel two-armed randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial divided into two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 720 recruited mothers across India and Nepal will be randomly allocated to 2 equal&#xD;
      groups (360 each). The patients, recruiters, developmental therapists, the laboratory and the&#xD;
      data analyst will be blinded to the randomization code for the duration of the trial. To&#xD;
      ensure blinding and allocation concealment, maternal supplements will be numbered&#xD;
      sequentially outside the trial sites by a neutral party using the randomization code supplied&#xD;
      by an offsite statistician. Group 1 (Intervention) will receive 250μg of vitamin B12&#xD;
      supplementation delivered daily to the mother from 12-weeks' gestation up to 6-months&#xD;
      post-partum. Group 2 (Control) will receive 50μg of vitamin B12 supplementation delivered&#xD;
      daily to the mother from 12-weeks' gestation up to 6- months post-partum. The mother's&#xD;
      profile will be recorded, including information on: age, height, weight, ethnicity,&#xD;
      education, socioeconomic status, maternal dietary assessment and intake of any supplements.&#xD;
      Mother's blood levels for vitamin B12 status and other deficiencies will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 48 hours enrolment women will be contacted as a part of follow-up. Relevant elements&#xD;
      of the clinical records including maternal weight, blood pressure, foetal growth and position&#xD;
      and reports of any screening tests for congenital infections/ chromosomal anomalies will be&#xD;
      recorded. Any acquired morbidity (including gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced&#xD;
      hypertension, and hypothyroidism) during the period from the last visit will be noted. Any&#xD;
      drugs or medicines started by the mother will be recorded. Both study sites will promote&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding by preparing the mothers for breastfeeding in the antenatal period&#xD;
      using structured counselling sessions led by an obstetrician or a specified health educator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The birth and post-delivery course of the new-born during hospital stay will be assessed by&#xD;
      the medical officer and/or paediatrician for any morbidity potentially influencing&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, such as growth retardation, congenital anomalies, seizures, neurological&#xD;
      problems, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hearing deficits, vision and heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, all neonates will be routinely followed with preventive and vaccination care&#xD;
      as per standard protocols. As part of routine care, all new-borns will be screened for&#xD;
      metabolic disorders at 7-14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine visits, anthropometric measurements including weight, length and head&#xD;
      circumference will be recorded and signs of micronutrient deficiency (especially anaemia and&#xD;
      rickets) will be noted. The child care teams at both sites will encourage the initiation and&#xD;
      establishment of exclusive breastfeeding while minimizing the use of formula feeds by&#xD;
      providing support and counselling during hospital stay. Maternal and infant tolerance for the&#xD;
      supplementation including any gastrointestinal symptoms will be recorded at each visit.&#xD;
      Supplementation of the mother in both groups will be stopped at 6 months after childbirth. At&#xD;
      9 months, the neurodevelopmental, complementary feeding practices and home environment will&#xD;
      be assessed and infant vitamin B12 status will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be checked and encrypted after removing any &quot;patient identifiable information&quot;.&#xD;
      These data will be sent with the group coding sheet to a statistician blinded to intervention&#xD;
      or control grouping. Data will be analysed using the neurodevelopmental scores at 9 months as&#xD;
      the primary efficacy outcome variable. Biochemical prevalence of B12 deficiency in mothers&#xD;
      during the first and third trimesters and infants after 9 months of birth will be analysed as&#xD;
      the secondary outcome variables. Although no safety issues are expected, infant linear growth&#xD;
      and incidence of adverse events will be the mainly safety outcomes. Data on maternal&#xD;
      tolerance of B12 supplementation will also be collected. All primary analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
