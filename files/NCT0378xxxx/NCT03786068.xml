  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAH) are a particularly severe type of stroke with a&#xD;
      tendency to affect younger individuals than other types of stroke. The condition is time&#xD;
      critical as early neurosurgical treatment is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the delay from when a patient with SAH calls the&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to they are admitted to a neurosurgical department. Further,&#xD;
      it is the aim to determine predictors for increased delay and to examine the accuracy of the&#xD;
      triage tool used by the EMS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous (non-traumatic) subarachnoid haemorrhage (sSAH) is rare but timely detection is&#xD;
      critical. A feared complication is rebleeding, with an overall risk around 4% in the first 24&#xD;
      hours. Early specialized medical, neurosurgical or neuroradiological interventions are&#xD;
      required. A Danish study of pre-hospital delay was made in 2010. In this, a median delay of&#xD;
      60 minutes in a pooled population of patients having contacted general practitioners, the&#xD;
      emergency phone number or presented directly to the emergency room. Total time from symptom&#xD;
      onset to neurosurgical admission was 5 hours 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reorganizations have since been made in the pre-hospital system to optimize correct and fast&#xD;
      triage. A criteria-based dispatch (CBD) system, the Danish Index for Emergency Care (Danish&#xD;
      Index), is now used in the Danish Emergency Medical Communications Centers (EMCC). The&#xD;
      dispatcher is guided through a list of questions to ask the caller. An algorithm then&#xD;
      suggests a prehospital response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Index contains 37 main symptom categories, each divided into five degrees of&#xD;
      urgency, which again are subdivided into specific symptoms. Headache is a main category with&#xD;
      ´acute severe headache´ resulting in the most urgent response; level A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark there is one national emergency phone number, ´112´. Depending on your location,&#xD;
      your call will be directed to one of the five EMCCs. At the EMCC in the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark the Danish Index was introduced in May 2011. In January 2012 an additional phone&#xD;
      line, ´1813´, was opened for non-urgent contacts out of general practice (GP) opening hours.&#xD;
      At this non-urgent phone-line the Danish Index is used as well. By January 1, 2014, ´112´ and&#xD;
      ´1813´ became the only out-of-hours entry points to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even when aided by a decision support tool telephone triage lacks the nonverbal information&#xD;
      obtained through visual cues, vital signs and physical exam findings of a face-to-face&#xD;
      consultation. This has been argued to lead to poor agreement between telephone triage&#xD;
      decisions and face-to-face triage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review concluded that 10% of telephone-triage contacts were &quot;unsafe&quot;. This&#xD;
      proportion was increased to 50% if including only studies using simulated high-risk patients.&#xD;
      Likewise, inappropriate response decisions at telephone triage leads to significantly&#xD;
      increased time to reperfusion therapy for patients with myocardial infarction, illustrating&#xD;
      the direct negative consequence of incorrect triage. Twelve to nineteen percent of patients&#xD;
      with sSAH have been found to be misdiagnosed on their first face-to-face contact with a&#xD;
      health care professional. Initial misdiagnosis of sSAH has also been found to result in&#xD;
      delayed specialized treatment and neurologic deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to being rare, the clinical presentation of sSAH may vary. Some studies report as&#xD;
      little as 40% of patients to have presented with classic textbook symptoms. Half are&#xD;
      initially in an intact neurological state, and only 7-12% of those actually presenting with&#xD;
      thunderclap headache have sSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, an electronic decision support tools such as the Danish Index may be of good use in&#xD;
      telephone visitation of patients with sSAH, but the association between symptoms and time to&#xD;
      neurosurgical admission remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to describe time from first contact to the Copenhagen&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Communications Center to admission to a neurosurgical department in&#xD;
      patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage. Further, to identify predictors for short&#xD;
      time to neurosurgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients with ´acute severe headache´, that are admitted to a&#xD;
           neurosurgical department within four hours of initial contact to the EMCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the Danish Index category ´acute&#xD;
           severe headache´ for sSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity and PPV for sSAH of symptoms other than ´acute severe headache´ in the&#xD;
           Danish Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of emergency calls from sSAH-patients, that trigger a level A response,&#xD;
           regardless of which symptom category it is triggered by.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that less severe symptoms are associated with longer delay to&#xD;
      neurosurgical admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register-based retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Existing local sSAH-database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients registered with sSAH (International Classification of Disease version 10&#xD;
      diagnoses DI60-DI60.9) in the Danish National Patient Register, admitted to a hospital in the&#xD;
      Capital Region of Denmark between 1 May 2011 - 31 December 2014, aged ≥18 years on admission&#xD;
      are registered in this database. Patients diagnoses were double-validated by medical record&#xD;
      review. Admission date and -time was recorded arrival at a neurosurgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copenhagen Emergency Medical Service, Emergency Medical Communications Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At both ´112´ and ´1813´ the Danish Index is used. Data on date, time, type of incident&#xD;
      (sickness, trauma, assault etc.) and activated response are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may have been admitted via general practitioners (GP). In the EMCC database&#xD;
      these will appear if an ambulance has been requested, but no data on symptoms are registered&#xD;
      in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data correctness from ´112´ and ´1813´ are expected to be high. The same is expected for data&#xD;
      on ambulance requests from GPs. Data may not be complete for ´112´ and ´1813´ due to missing&#xD;
      Central Person Register numbers (CPR-numbers), but the extend is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linking data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone born in, or immigrated to, Denmark are given a unique identification number in the&#xD;
      Central Person Register; a CPR-number. CPR-numbers are used as identification throughout the&#xD;
      public sector and in all health care registers. This allows data from multiple sources to be&#xD;
      linked on an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the CPR-numbers from the local sSAH-database, emergency phone calls to the EMCC&#xD;
      (both ´112´ and ´1813´) leading up to admission are identified. From 1 May 2011 data is&#xD;
      extracted from calls to ´112´ and from January 30, 2012 data from ´1813 ´ is extracted. The&#xD;
      inclusion period ends on 31 December 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables are collected from calls to the Copenhagen EMCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main complaint/ the complaint that determined the initiated response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any supplementary/ secondary complaints registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of calls within the last four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date, time and primary complaint of previous calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For ambulance requests from GP´s: Date and time. All these variables are routinely&#xD;
           collected from each call. To determine the sensitivity and the PPV of symptoms the total&#xD;
           number of callers with the respective primary complaint within the study period is&#xD;
           extracted. No data on individuals are extracted for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 10% of data are missing a strategy for imputation will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally distributed data will be reported as means with 95% confidence intervals, skewed&#xD;
      data as median values with range and inter-quartile-range (IQR); proportions are reported&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals. Comparisons are made using chi-square, Mann-Whitney's or&#xD;
      Fisher´s test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis, time from EMCC-contact to neurosurgical admission will be presented&#xD;
      as median (range, IQR). The following variables will be tested as predictors in a logistic&#xD;
      regression model with time &gt;/&lt;4hrs as the dependent variable: symptoms (classical acute&#xD;
      headache yes/no), age (years), gender (m/f), person who is calling in (patient vs bystander).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity for sSAH of ´acute severe headache´ will be reported as a percentage with the&#xD;
      numerator being sSAH-positive registered at the EMCC with ´acute severe headache´ as the&#xD;
      primary symptom, and the denominator being all sSAH-positive with a contact to the EMCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPV of ´acute severe headache´ in the Danish Index is calculated as the number of&#xD;
      sSAH-patients with this registered complaint in the numerator and the total number of&#xD;
      contacts from sSAH-patients in the denominator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity for sSAH of symptoms other than ´acute severe headache´ will be calculated&#xD;
      for each symptom registered as the primary complaint in a patient. Numerators being the&#xD;
      number of sSAH-patients presenting with the respective primary complaint and the denominator&#xD;
      being all sSAH-positive patients contacting the EMCC with the respective complaint within the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPV for sSAH of other symptoms than ´acute severe headache´ is calculated as the number&#xD;
      of sSAH-patients with the respective complaint in the numerator and all patients contacting&#xD;
      the EMCC with the complaint within the study period in the denominator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of emergency calls from sSAH-patients, that trigger a level A response,&#xD;
      regardless of which symptom category it is triggered by, is calculated as the number of&#xD;
      sSAH-patients triggering an A-response over the total number of sSAH-patients that contacted&#xD;
      the EMCC.&#xD;
