      A two-period, two-treatment, crossover study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 2-treatment, crossover,&#xD;
      outpatient study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      amifampridine phosphate in ambulatory patients diagnosed with SMA Type 3. The study is&#xD;
      planned to include approximately 12 male and female SMA Type 3 patients. The planned duration&#xD;
      of participation for each patient is approximately 2 months, based upon length of dose&#xD;
      titration and excluding the screening period, which can last up to 14 days. Patients should&#xD;
      only be taking the assigned investigational product (amifampridine phosphate 10 mg tablets or&#xD;
      matching placebo tablets), no new therapies are permitted during the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Screening, the first (Day 1) and last day (Day 0) of the Run-in period, during Period 1 at Day 7 and Day 14, and during Period 2 at Day 21 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) assesses motor function by functional item in order of progressive difficulty, with higher values showing higher function abilities. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-2 with 2 representing item achieved unaided and 0 representing inability to achieve item. Each item was assessed by the patient at Screening, the first (Day 1) and last day (Day 0) of the Run-in period, during Period 1 at Day 7 and Day 14, and during Period 2 at Day 21 and Day 28. The total HFMSE score was calculated as the sum of each item score, with a maximum score of 66 (all items achieved unaided) and minimum score of 0 (all items failed). Change from baseline (CFB) will be assessed from Day 0 to Day 28. A mixed effects liner model was fit with the HFMSE change from baseline (CFB) scores at Day 28 as a response and treatment, sequence, and treatment by sequence as fixed effect terms and patient as a random effect.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A screening visit was conducted to ensure that each patient met inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. Those patients successfully completing screening had procedures/assessments conducted at the start of the Run-in period (Day 1, before starting study medication) and during Run-in, until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine was established for at least 7 days, and at least a 3-point improvement in HFMSE score was achieved from start of Run-in to be eligible for randomization (Day 0).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) Summary Statistics and Mixed Model Analysis</title>
        <description>Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) assesses motor function by functional item in order of progressive difficulty, with higher values showing higher function abilities. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-2 with 2 representing item achieved unaided and 0 representing inability to achieve item. Each item was assessed by the patient at Screening, the first (Day 1) and last day (Day 0) of the Run-in period, during Period 1 at Day 7 and Day 14, and during Period 2 at Day 21 and Day 28. The total HFMSE score was calculated as the sum of each item score, with a maximum score of 66 (all items achieved unaided) and minimum score of 0 (all items failed). Change from baseline (CFB) will be assessed from Day 0 to Day 28. A mixed effects liner model was fit with the HFMSE change from baseline (CFB) scores at Day 28 as a response and treatment, sequence, and treatment by sequence as fixed effect terms and patient as a random effect.</description>

        <population>The analysis of primary outcome data was based on the Full Analysis Set population, which included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication (amifampridine or placebo) and had at least one post-treatment efficacy assessment.

            <description>Each patient will participate in an open-label unblinded drug escalation/treatment run-in phase for up to 4 weeks until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate is achieved for 7 days. After this phase, half of the subjects were randomized to receive amifampridine in Period 1 and then crossed over to receive placebo in Period 2 and the other were randomized to receive placebo in Period 1 and then crossed over to receive amifampridine in Period 2.&#xD;
Each randomized treatment period is 14 days in duration.&#xD;
Dosing was up to 80 mg per day and frequency was between 3-4 times per day.&#xD;
Amifampridine Phosphate: Amifampridine phosphate tablets 10 mg were provided in round, white-scored tablets, and contained amifampridine phosphate formulated to be the equivalent of 10 mg amifampridine base per tablet.&#xD;
Placebo: A placebo equivalent was provided as tablets indistinguishable from the amifampridine phosphate tablets. The placebo was administered consistent with the dose and dose regimen of amifampridine phosphate.&#xD;
The Amifampridine study arm includes all patients in the FAS population who received Amifampridine during the treatment period, regardless of which Period the treatment was administered.</description>
