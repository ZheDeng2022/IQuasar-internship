  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study addresses one of the most controversial topics in the treatment of&#xD;
      cervical spine trauma: the management of type II odontoid process fractures in the elderly.&#xD;
      It is the hypothesis that surgical treatment will result in improved functional outcome&#xD;
      measures, neck pain and mortality rates as compared with nonsurgical management. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that surgical treatment of odontoid process fractures will limit hospital&#xD;
      re-admissions and development of medical complications secondary to prolonged immobilization&#xD;
      in a cervical orthosis and delayed surgery related to late fracture displacement, which are&#xD;
      often associated with non-operative care. Additionally, data from this study will be useful&#xD;
      in identifying patient-specific predictors of improved outcome which can be used to optimize&#xD;
      treatment algorithms and more effectively counsel patients who sustain these injuries.&#xD;

             centers;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. deemed appropriate by the attending surgeon involved for C1-2 posterior cervical&#xD;
             fusion procedure if surgical management were to be indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. able to independently cooperate in the completion of all study consents, forms and&#xD;
             documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. able to speak, read and write English at an elementary school level&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients to be excluded from trial enrolment include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. those with previously documented type II odontoid fracture;&#xD;
&#xD;
