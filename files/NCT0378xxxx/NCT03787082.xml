      This is an open-label, single-center study to examine distinguishing features of the&#xD;
      structure and function of the oral and gut microbiome in volunteers with PH in the breakdown&#xD;
      of oral nitrate and effect on hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 40 PH patients over three years. 5 healthy participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled as controls. Participants will receive a single dose of the study drug,:14N Sodium&#xD;
      Nitrate(1000mg): standard sodium nitrate, and all will receive one dose of CLA 3g. CLA will&#xD;
      be obtained from GNC (General Nutrition Corporation) and given once. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% (15mL) or placebo to rinse their mouth&#xD;
      with for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral samples will be collected pre- and post-chlorhexidine treatments and stool samples will&#xD;
      be collected post-chlorhexidine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right heart catheterization will be performed for clinical or research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RHC done (in the last 5 years) that establishes inclusion is not the same RHC done as&#xD;
      part of the study in most cases. If there is a strong suspicion of PH based on&#xD;
      echocardiography in a patient who has not had a clinical RHC, the first hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements obtained in the clinical RHC will establish inclusion and the RHC study&#xD;
      procedures will be performed following confirmation of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for whom the RHC done in the study is considered a clinical RHC will be&#xD;
      participants who do have an additional follow up RHC scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for whom the RHC done in the study is considered a research RHC will be those&#xD;
      who do not have an additional follow RHC scheduled or who are considered healthy and have not&#xD;
      had an RHC before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheterization will generally be performed via the right internal jugular vein access with&#xD;
      the assistance of fluoroscopy, if needed. Once the pulmonary arterial (PA) catheter has been&#xD;
      placed in proper position, measured values will be obtained. The investigators often perform&#xD;
      simultaneous measurement of right atrial pressure and distal pressure (PAP/PAWP) using two&#xD;
      transducers in order to assess both pressures during vasodilator challenge, or other&#xD;
      confrontational testing. An initial hemodynamic profile will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the right heart catheter still in place, participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash or placebo, then after 30 minutes, all will receive 14N oral nitrate&#xD;
      and CLA. A repeat hemodynamic profile will be performed after two hours. Nitrate metabolites&#xD;
      in plasma will be measured at time 0, 2, and 6 hrs after 14N nitrate dose. Urine nitrite and&#xD;
      nitrate will be measured at 0 and 6 hours. Participants will be monitored with continuous&#xD;
      pulse oximetry and EKG monitoring. Blood pressure measurements will be performed every 15&#xD;
      minutes during the catheterization. Pressure-volume loop and impedance analysis will be&#xD;
      performed at the time of the right heart catheterization (RHC) using the micromanometer&#xD;
      catheter technique to simultaneously measure RV pressure and pulmonary blood flow.&#xD;
