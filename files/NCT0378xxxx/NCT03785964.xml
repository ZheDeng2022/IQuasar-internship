  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates nirogacestat in the treatment of desmoid tumor/aggressive fibromatosis&#xD;
      (DT/AF). Half of the participants will receive nirogacestat while the other half will receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Desmoid tumors, also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis, are rare, locally invasive, slow&#xD;
      growing soft tissue tumors. Although considered benign because of their inability to&#xD;
      metastasize, desmoid tumors can cause significant morbidity and occasionally mortality in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nirogacestat (PF-03084014) is a potent, small molecule, selective, reversible, noncompetitive&#xD;
      inhibitor of Î³-secretase (GS) with a potential antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nirogacestat is being investigated for the treatment of desmoid tumors due to its ability to&#xD;
      bind to GS, blocking proteolytic activation of Notch receptors. Previous clinical study data&#xD;
      have shown that Notch signaling plays an important role in cancer development. Hence,&#xD;
      inhibition of Notch signaling is an important strategy for therapeutic treatment.&#xD;
