      The present study is a multi-center, single-arm, open, phase I/IIa clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of EBViNT Cell when administered to patients with Epstein-Barr (EBV)&#xD;
      positive tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      After proving the safety through Part 1 and part 2, the efficacy and safety would be studied&#xD;
      through part 3~5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If CTCAE grade 3 or higher adverse drug events (ADR) do not occur in the three subjects:&#xD;
           Begin enrollment for phase IIa&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in one of the three subjects: Enroll three more&#xD;
           subjects (up to six subjects in total) and assess whether any CTCAE grade 3 or higher&#xD;
           ADR occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR does not occur in the three additional subjects&#xD;
                (1/6): Begin enrollment for phase IIa&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in at least one of the three additional&#xD;
                subjects (more than 2/6): Begin enrollment for phase IIa at 7.0x10^8 cells, the&#xD;
                maximum dose from phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in two of the three subjects: Begin enrollment&#xD;
           for phase IIa at 7.0x10^8 cells, the maximum dose from phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in the present study will undergo 1) an EBV epitope screening test&#xD;
      followed by 2) an eligibility assessment for clinical trial enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are administered with the investigational product will be monitored until&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) is confirmed or for 24 weeks (main observation period of 4 weeks +&#xD;
      monitoring for 20 weeks) to evaluate the product's safety and efficacy, and will undergo&#xD;
      immunological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological tests for tumor assessment will be conducted at the enrollment visit, 4 weeks, 8&#xD;
      weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks and assessed by the Independent Radiology Review Committee&#xD;
      (IRRC) using the Lugano criteria. To eliminate pseudo-progression, progressive disease (PD)&#xD;
      will be determined by considering immunological tests, a quantitative EBV DNA assay, and&#xD;
      intermediate response (IR) under LYRIC. Biopsies may be performed to achieve this.&#xD;
