      The purpose of the investigators' study is to determine the clinical utility of a&#xD;
      warfarin-dosing algorithm that incorporates genetic information (VKORC1 and CYP2C9 alleles)&#xD;
      for adult patients initiating warfarin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 20 million prescriptions are written for warfarin each year in the US and yet it is&#xD;
      one of the most problematic drugs in the modern medical formulary. Warfarin has a narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic window and the hemorrhagic or thrombotic implications of modest over- or&#xD;
      under-dosing can be devastating. Warfarin is one of the leading causes of emergency&#xD;
      department visits and hospitalizations due to adverse drug events worldwide. Adverse events&#xD;
      from warfarin are more common during the initial months of treatment before the optimal dose&#xD;
      is determined. Moreover, there is substantial individual variation in response to warfarin&#xD;
      necessitating frequent monitoring and dosage adjustments. The monitoring and dosing of&#xD;
      warfarin is so problematic that many primary care physicians have abdicated this role to&#xD;
      specialized &quot;warfarin clinics&quot; which are devoted solely to following patients on this agent.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no good alternatives to warfarin exist for the common indications requiring&#xD;
      chronic anticoagulation such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, and artificial heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenomics offers substantial hope for improved care of patients taking warfarin. One&#xD;
      group estimated that formally integrating genetic testing into routine warfarin therapy in&#xD;
      the US could result in the avoidance of 85,000 serious bleeding events and 17,000 strokes&#xD;
      annually with a cost savings of over $1 billion annually. Common single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase (VKOR) substantially&#xD;
      affect one's sensitivity to warfarin, mediating a doubling or halving of the dose required&#xD;
      for optimal anticoagulation. Warfarin inhibits clotting by inhibiting the enzyme VKOR, and&#xD;
      thus inhibiting vitamin K dependent clotting factors. A number of recent retrospective&#xD;
      studies have shown that polymorphisms in the VKOR gene may account for 20-30% of the variance&#xD;
      in warfarin dose seen in patients on stable, long-term warfarin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another genetic determinant of variance in warfarin dose is the cytochrome p450 2C9 enzyme&#xD;
      CYP2C9. It is almost wholly responsible for metabolism of the more active S-enantiomer of&#xD;
      warfarin. The 2C9*2 and 2C9*3 polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene are associated with reduced&#xD;
      warfarin metabolism, and a number of retrospective studies have shown that these&#xD;
      polymorphisms may account for 10-15% of the variance in warfarin dosage in patients on&#xD;
      stable, long-term warfarin therapy. In addition, the variant CYP2C9 alleles have been&#xD;
      associated with longer times to stabilization of INR and a higher risk for bleeding events.&#xD;
      These polymorphisms are seen in ~20-30% of the Caucasian population, but are rare in African&#xD;
      Americans and Asians. Together, known VKOR and CYP2C9 variants may account for 40% of the&#xD;
      variability in warfarin dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By combining clinical information such as weight, height, and concomitant medications with&#xD;
      VKOR and CYP2C9 genotypic information, several algorithms have been devised that calculate&#xD;
      warfarin doses. These algorithms have been shown to accurately predict warfarin doses in&#xD;
      retrospective studies of patients already on long-term stable warfarin doses. Some small,&#xD;
      pilot studies in orthopedic patients suggest that prospective genetic-based dosing is&#xD;
      feasible and may result in achieving stable doses sooner in patients with certain genetic&#xD;
      variants. However, the prospective studies are small, pilot studies limited to orthopedic&#xD;
      patients that did not include medical patients with common indications requiring chronic oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation. They are also limited by study designs that include only historical&#xD;
      controls. No RCTs have been reported in the literature and further evaluation is needed to&#xD;
      determine the utility and cost-effectiveness of genetic-based algorithms. The NHLBI is&#xD;
      planning a double-blind, randomized three-arm trial, but the trial will not begin enrolling&#xD;
      subjects until 2008 at the earliest and data analysis and dissemination is planned to begin&#xD;
      beyond 2011.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are beginning warfarin for a variety of diseases or conditions that&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects that will be following up in UNC anticoagulation clinics at the Ambulatory&#xD;
             Care Center or the Family Medicine Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to complete the study materials (questionnaires) with or&#xD;
             without assistance (for example, those with dementia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being started on anticoagulation intended to last &lt; 3 months or whose&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of treatment with warfarin and a known dose requirement&#xD;
             will be excluded (as they should be restarted on the previous dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will be excluded because warfarin is a teratogen and pregnant women&#xD;
             should not take the medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if their treating physician does not agree to use the&#xD;
             recommended INR dose or feels that the patient should not be enrolled in the study&#xD;
