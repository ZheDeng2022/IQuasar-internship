      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem&#xD;
      cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them&#xD;
      or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy&#xD;
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow&#xD;
      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the&#xD;
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.&#xD;
      Giving cyclosporine before and after the transplant may stop this from happening. Once the&#xD;
      donated stem cells begin working, the patient's immune system may see the remaining cancer&#xD;
      cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them (called graft-versus-tumor&#xD;
      effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's white blood cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) may&#xD;
      boost this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving carmustine together with&#xD;
      etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab followed by donor stem cell transplant and&#xD;
      to see how well it works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the toxicity and feasibility of reduced-intensity conditioning regimen&#xD;
           comprising carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab followed by&#xD;
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with primary refractory&#xD;
           or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV over 2&#xD;
           hours on day -6, etoposide IV over ≥ 1 hour on days -5 to -2, cytarabine IV over 15&#xD;
           minutes twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients also receive&#xD;
           alemtuzumab IV on days -5 to -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic&#xD;
           HSCT on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV (or&#xD;
           orally once tolerable) beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 60, followed by a&#xD;
           taper in the absence of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI): Patients with mixed chimerism or stable residual&#xD;
           disease at 6 months after HSCT or disease progression or relapse at any time after HSCT&#xD;
           may receive DLI in the absence of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.&#xD;
