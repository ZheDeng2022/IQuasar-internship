      The increasing prevalence of childhood overweight has been found to be related to decreased&#xD;
      levels of physical activity (PA) and increased energy content of the diet. Childhood offers&#xD;
      an opportunity to develop and support health-promoting behaviors. Pacific Kids DASH for&#xD;
      Health (PacDASH) is a community-based intervention that links food, PA, and health, and&#xD;
      targets overweight children in Hawaii with a goal of preventing further weight gain.&#xD;
      Components of the intervention include a food and PA prescription delivered by physicians at&#xD;
      community-based health centers complemented with a toolbox of activities, behaviorally&#xD;
      tailored messages, and PacDASH educational materials. This project will extend and apply the&#xD;
      nationally recommended DASH eating pattern to children and the growing population of Asians&#xD;
      and Pacific Islanders. The investigators will incorporate culturally preferred foods,&#xD;
      recipes, and PA messages that meet DASH and other national guidelines. The approach will&#xD;
      target child food behaviors and social and environmental cues that are important to making&#xD;
      healthy food and PA choices and will provide steps to behavior change. Farmers markets at&#xD;
      participating health centers are a support resource for activities. Providing access to,&#xD;
      coupons for, and guidance about selecting and preparing fresh fruits and vegetables at a&#xD;
      convenient health center farmers market will support increased intake of nutrient-rich foods&#xD;
      among these children who are overweight and at risk for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacific Islanders are among the world's most obese populations while Asians, although of&#xD;
      relatively low body mass index (BMI), carry much of their body fat in the upper body and&#xD;
      exhibit greater health risk at the same BMI. Through this project, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      learn more about body size and composition in children of the Pacific Region for whom there&#xD;
      are few national data. In addition, evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based&#xD;
      intervention within a health care system on managing overweight in children.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The ethnic groups of the Pacific Region are predominantly Pacific Islander and&#xD;
      Asian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacific Islanders (PacIsl) are among the world's most obese populations while Asians,&#xD;
      although of relatively low body mass index (BMI), carry much of their body fat in the upper&#xD;
      body and exhibit greater health risk at the same BMI. Childhood offers an opportunity to&#xD;
      develop and support health-promoting behaviors. This project will extend and apply the&#xD;
      nationally recommended DASH eating pattern 115, developed for White, African American and&#xD;
      Hispanic adults, to children and to the growing population of Asians and PacIsl. We will&#xD;
      incorporate culturally-preferred foods, recipes, and physical activities that meet DASH and&#xD;
      other national guidelines, with adaptations for children. We will develop the Pacific Kids&#xD;
      DASH for Health (PacDASH) intervention in Hawaii, where the majority is of Asian and PacIsl&#xD;
      ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linking food and health systems is critical to prevent obesity. The PacDASH intervention will&#xD;
      include a food and physical activity (PA) prescription delivered by a physician at a&#xD;
      community-based health center (HC), in partnership with farmers' markets (FM) that are based&#xD;
      at the HC, and complemented with a toolbox of related activities. The intervention approach&#xD;
      supports child food behaviors and social and environmental cues, which are important to&#xD;
      making healthy food and PA choices. Linking physicians and health with farmers and food at a&#xD;
      convenient HC FM will support increased intake of nutrient-rich, less energy dense foods&#xD;
      among children of understudied ethnic groups who are at high risk for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Goal Our goal is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based&#xD;
      intervention that links food and health, and targets children of the Pacific Region who are&#xD;
      overweight, in order to slow and prevent further weight gain (for children to &quot;grow into&#xD;
      their weight&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop and evaluate the impact of the PacDASH intervention on preventing weight gain&#xD;
           and improving blood pressure in children of the Pacific Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To further develop and test the Pacific Tracker (PacTrac) dietary assessment and&#xD;
                education tool by incorporating updated MyPyramid 112 reference data and&#xD;
                educational output, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To enhance PacTrac with an expert system (ES) of behaviorally-tailored messages and&#xD;
                output.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To evaluate the effect of the PacDASH intervention on nutrition and physical&#xD;
                activity behavior of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe environmental, social, economic and cultural factors associated with body&#xD;
           size and composition of children of the Pacific Region, for whom there are few national&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To examine body size and composition of children of the Pacific Region according to&#xD;
                several measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To examine the influence of individual PacIsl ethnic groups on body size and&#xD;
                composition.&#xD;
