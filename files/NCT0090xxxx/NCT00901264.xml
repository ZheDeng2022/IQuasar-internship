      The purpose of this study is to correlate the results of the MICK assay with short- and&#xD;
      long-term results of treatments in cancer patients and evaluate the role of the MiCK assay in&#xD;
      guiding chemotherapy of cancer patients.&#xD;

      Identification of those patients with cancer who will or will not respond to a specific&#xD;
      chemotherapy is important for making decisions regarding chemotherapy regimens as well as&#xD;
      alternative management approaches. A laboratory test that could help to determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to specific chemotherapeutic agents would&#xD;
      be valuable in choosing the optimal chemotherapy regimen for that patient with an expectation&#xD;
      of increasing the response rate to the therapy. Several types of in vitro assays that measure&#xD;
      tumor cell survival following exposure to cytotoxic agents have been evaluated for their&#xD;
      ability to predict chemotherapy outcomes. As a group, these assays are referred to as drug&#xD;
      resistance assays. In a resistance assay, the surviving tumor cells can be detected directly&#xD;
      by their exclusion or metabolism of specific dyes. Alternatively, since some of tumor cells&#xD;
      are proliferating, their survival can be detected by measurement of DNA synthesis by&#xD;
      radiolabeled precursor incorporation or demonstration of clonogenic potential by growth into&#xD;
      colonies in semi-solid culture medium. In several clinical studies, these assays were useful&#xD;
      in detecting drug resistance and in predicting a poor prognosis for cancer patients. However,&#xD;
      these resistance assays cannot detect sensitivity of an individual patient's tumor cells to a&#xD;
      specific drug. Therefore, new methods determining drug-sensitivity of the tumor cells of an&#xD;
      individual patient and, thus, capable of both predicting a positive treatment outcome and&#xD;
      guiding chemotherapy, would be of significant value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an automated microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay for measuring drug induced apoptosis&#xD;
      in tumor cells has been developed1-4. Apoptosis is a distinct mode of cell death which occurs&#xD;
      under physiological conditions and yet can be induced in malignant cells by chemical and&#xD;
      physical factors including antitumor drugs5-7. During the last decade, it has been recognized&#xD;
      that chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumor activity by triggering apoptosis in&#xD;
      susceptible tumor cells8-17. This implies that the MiCK assay for apoptosis provides a&#xD;
      mechanism-based approach to studying effects of cytotoxic agents on tumor cells. Unlike&#xD;
      &quot;resistance&quot; assays that measure a fraction of cells surviving drug exposure, the MiCK assay&#xD;
      measures a fraction of tumor cells killed by a chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism of&#xD;
      apoptosis. Therefore the MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity, rather than resistance.&#xD;
      Recently the MiCK assay has been shown to predict complete remission rate and survival in&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia patients better than clinical criteria did18-20. In a limited study,&#xD;
      the MiCK assay has been used to direct chemotherapy of the leukemia patients 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MiCK assay has also been used to study drug-induced apoptosis in solid tumors, including&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23. More recent data accumulated by&#xD;
      DiaTech has demonstrated that the MiCK assay can detect drug induced apoptosis in primary&#xD;
      cultures of tumor cells isolated from patients with ovarian carcinoma, gastric carcinoma,&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer and high grade soft tissue sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      correlate the results of the MICK assay with short- and long-term results of treatments in&#xD;
      cancer patients and evaluate the role of the MiCK assay in guiding chemotherapy of cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.1.1 Patients with pathological diagnoses of cancer or leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.1.2 Patients must have tumor which is accessible for biopsy and agree to undergo&#xD;
             tumor biopsy, or drainage of malignant effusion, and the specimen must be submitted&#xD;
             for MiCK assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.1.3 Patients for whom chemotherapy is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.2.1 Patients with symptomatic/uncontrolled parenchymal brain or meningeal metastasis&#xD;
             and tumors not accessible for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.2.2 Patients who are pregnant. Pregnancy. During the course of the study, all&#xD;
             patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the treating&#xD;
             physician if they suspect they might have conceived a child; for females, a missing or&#xD;
             late menstrual period should be reported to the treating physician. If pregnancy is&#xD;
             confirmed by a pregnancy test, the patient must not receive chemotherapy in this study&#xD;
             and must not be enrolled into the study or, if already enrolled, must be withdrawn&#xD;
             from the study. If a male patient is suspected of having fathered a child while on the&#xD;
             study, the pregnant female partner must be notified and counseled regarding the risk&#xD;
             to the fetus. Pregnancy during the course of this study will be reported to the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator as a serious adverse event. Women of child bearing potential&#xD;
             are defined to include any female who has experienced menarche and has not undergone&#xD;
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for more than&#xD;
             12 consecutive months); these includes also females using oral, implanted, or&#xD;
             injectable contraceptive hormones, mechanical devices, or barrier methods to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
