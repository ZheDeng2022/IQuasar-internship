  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder&#xD;
      characterised by abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and alterations in bowel function. This&#xD;
      condition significantly impairs quality of life and places a large burden on health care&#xD;
      resources. Existing therapies for IBS are far from being satisfactory and new therapies are&#xD;
      being constantly sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of IBS remains unclear. Imbalance in the intestinal microbiota is considered&#xD;
      to be one important etiologic factor for IBS. That some probiotics are effective in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of IBS supports this idea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progut is a synbiotic: a combination of probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are viable&#xD;
      beneficial bacteria that are normally present in a healthy digestive tract. Each capsule of&#xD;
      Progut contains 9 billion viable bacteria from 8 different strains that are characteristics&#xD;
      of a healthy normal gut microflora: Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. lactis, and&#xD;
      L. bulgaricus); Bifidobacterium (B. longum, B. infantis and B. bifidum); and Streptococcus&#xD;
      thermophilus at time of manufacturing. To ensure survival of these bacteria, Progut is&#xD;
      encapsulated and enteric-coated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the tolerability of Progut treatment 1-3 capsules/day in&#xD;
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome under the same conditions as those likely to be&#xD;
      encountered in a standard general clinical practice or outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is to obtain tolerability data in patients with IBS in the&#xD;
      Singapore. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the patients' satisfaction and symptom&#xD;
      improvement with Progut treatment.&#xD;

      This will be an open-label, single arm post marketing surveillance study involving an active&#xD;
      treatment period of a minimum 3-week and a maximum 12-week duration. Treatment with Progut&#xD;
      will be at the discretion of the attending doctor and decision is independent of this study.&#xD;
      This study will only recruit patients following the prescription of Progut and follow them up&#xD;
      for upto a maximum of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (Day 1), the eligible patients will receive a prescription for Progut from their&#xD;
      physician. Depending on the discretion of the attending physician, they will be prescribed&#xD;
      Progut for treatment duration lasting 3 to 12 weeks. Safety of Progut under normal clinical&#xD;
      use will be assessed at the end of this period. Perception of effectiveness, and tolerability&#xD;
      of treatment will be assessed on Day 8-15 using a phone interview. On Visit 2 (any time&#xD;
      between Day 22 to 85, depending on duration of treatment given and schedule of their&#xD;
      follow-up visit arranged by the attending physician), the patient will be evaluated for&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement, perception of effectiveness, tolerability and satisfaction with&#xD;
      treatment, following which he/she will formally exit the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design was chosen with the aim of recruiting rapidly a large cohort of patients&#xD;
      representative of the population being prescribed Progut. A total of 50 patients will be&#xD;
      included to allow for an assessment of patient's tolerability of Progut, as well as&#xD;
      satisfaction and perception of effectiveness and symptom response in the Singapore&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
