  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of Veterans are anticipated to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) and&#xD;
      require hemodialysis (HD) treatments as the Veteran population ages. In 2003, approximately&#xD;
      290,000 US citizens were receiving HD and an estimated 19 million were affected by CKD. The&#xD;
      annual growth rate is predicted to be 7% per year with 500,000 Americans receiving HD&#xD;
      treatment by 2010. In 2005, approximately 2500 Veterans were receiving HD with growth&#xD;
      expected to parallel that seen in the general population. Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the&#xD;
      leading cause of dementia in the general population, growing evidence suggests that patients&#xD;
      with advanced CKD experience cognitive deficits related to accelerated cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease. Patients with advanced CKD have been shown to have a high prevalence of sub-clinical&#xD;
      cerebrovascular damage on imaging studies and a heavy burden of vascular risk factors such as&#xD;
      diabetes, elevated cholesterol, and hypertension. Many of the cognitive deficits related to&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease may go unrecognized by routine measures of cognition. HD patients&#xD;
      have increased number of hospitalizations, and several compliance issues ranging from&#xD;
      congestive heart failure to dangerous electrolyte imbalances. Impaired cognition in this&#xD;
      population is likely to have a significant impact on self-care and compliance with complex&#xD;
      medical regimens. Currently, the severity and scope of cognitive impairment related to&#xD;
      vascular disease is not well known in patients with advanced kidney disease. Additionally,&#xD;
      the relationship between cognitive impairment and measures of self-care independence are not&#xD;
      well known. Loss of independence and function secondary to impaired cognitive function is&#xD;
      likely to be a significant problem for patients with advanced kidney disease. Early&#xD;
      identification of functional impairment, particularly instrumental activities of daily living&#xD;
      (IADL), will allow for rehabilitation intervention. Maintaining or improving functional&#xD;
      independence through intensive rehabilitation could translate into better compliance and&#xD;
      lower hospitalization rate among HD patients. Information obtained from this study is likely&#xD;
      to heighten awareness of cognitive impairment and the functional consequences in Veterans&#xD;
      with advanced kidney disease. Primary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The range of cognitive deficits with emphasis on domains affected by vascular disease in&#xD;
           patients with advanced CKD and those receiving hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The associations between severity of cognitive impairment and severity of kidney&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The prevalence of impaired IADLs and the level of health-related quality of life (HRQOL)&#xD;
           in patients with advanced CKD and those requiring hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The relationship or association of cognitive impairment with IADL and HRQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The relationships among cerebral and carotid blood flow, carotid artery stiffness, and&#xD;
      renal specific metabolic abnormalities with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
