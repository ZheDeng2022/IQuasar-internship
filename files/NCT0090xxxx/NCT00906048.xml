  <official_title>A National, Multicenter, Non-comparative Study Evaluating the Efficacy of the Combination of Levofloxacin (500 mg) and Rifampicin (600 or 900 mg Depending on Weight) Administered Once Daily by Oral Route, as Replacement of Empirical Antibiotic Therapy Given Intravenously With a Total Duration of 6 Weeks of the Antibiotic Therapy, in the Treatment of OsteoArticular Prosthetic Infections (OAPI), With a Two-stage Revision of the Prosthesis.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is: to assess the microbiological success of the combination of&#xD;
      levofloxacin and rifampicin, administered for 32 to 37 days, as oral replacement therapy of&#xD;
      an empirical antibiotic therapy of a maximum of 5 to 10 days given intravenously, in the&#xD;
      treatment of OsteoArticular Prosthetic Infections (OAPI), with a two-stage revision of the&#xD;
      prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rate of clinical failure 12 months after the reimplantation of the&#xD;
           prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the joint mobility function score 12 months after the reimplantation of the&#xD;
           prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of the combination of levofloxacin and rifampicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate prognostic factors for success after the end of treatment and at 12&#xD;
           months after the reimplantation of the prosthesis.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteoarticular prosthetic bacterial infection (hip or knee)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented microbiological infection due to Staphylococcus aureus and/or&#xD;
             coagulase-negative staphylococci, susceptible to fluoroquinolones and to rifampicin&#xD;
             with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Staphylococcus aureus, a minimum of 2 positive perioperative samples is&#xD;
