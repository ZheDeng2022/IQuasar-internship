  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of cancer called sarcoma. Because there is no standard treatment for the&#xD;
      patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in&#xD;
      all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research&#xD;
      study using special immune cells. This research study combines two different ways of fighting&#xD;
      disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from diseases&#xD;
      caused by germs or toxic substances. They work by binding those germs or substances, which&#xD;
      stops them from growing or exerting their toxic effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes,&#xD;
      are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells&#xD;
      or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat&#xD;
      patients with cancers: they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure&#xD;
      most patients. We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells&#xD;
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. We now want to see if we can put a&#xD;
      new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The new&#xD;
      gene that we will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition it contains CD28, which stimulated T&#xD;
      cells and make them last longer. In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators&#xD;
      found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the&#xD;
      T cells stay in the body and therefore the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy&#xD;
      before a T cell infusion is called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically&#xD;
      chosen to decrease the number of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of patient's&#xD;
      lymphocytes first should allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in your body,&#xD;
      and potentially kill cancer cells more effectively. We will use fludarabine or the&#xD;
      combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine as the chemotherapy agents for&#xD;
      lymphodepletion. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly&#xD;
      used for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find the largest safe dose of chimeric T cells, and to see whether this therapy might help&#xD;
      patients with sarcoma. Another purpose is to see if it is safe to give HER2-CD28 T cells&#xD;
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the cells have a new gene in them the patient will be followed for a total of 15&#xD;
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned a dose of HER2-CD28 T&#xD;
      cells. Depending on which dose level they are assigned, they will receive one of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2-CD28 T cells and fludarabine (patient will receive fludarabine for 5 days followed by&#xD;
      injection of HER2-CD28 T cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2-CD28 T cells, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (patient will receive fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide for 2 days, fludarabine alone for an additional 3 days, and 2 days of rest&#xD;
      before receiving the HER2-CD28 T cells.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HER2-CD28 T cells will be given into the vein through an IV line. The injection will take&#xD;
      between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for&#xD;
      1 to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be followed for 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion for evaluation of&#xD;
      toxicity. They will have standard tests and procedures as well as research blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has stable disease (the tumor did not grow) or there is a reduction in the&#xD;
      size of the tumor on imaging studies after the T-cell infusion, they can receive additional&#xD;
      doses of the T cells at 6 to 12 weeks intervals. For the first two subsequent HER2-specific&#xD;
      T-cell infusions, patients will be able to receive additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy&#xD;
      according to their dose levels.&#xD;
