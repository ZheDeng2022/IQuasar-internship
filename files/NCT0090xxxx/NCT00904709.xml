      Many women have heavy periods and this can be associated with low blood, tiredness and&#xD;
      inability to carry out normal activities. Approximately 10-30% of these women will have an&#xD;
      underlying bleeding disorder. There is a drug called tranexamic acid which is commonly used&#xD;
      and is effective in reducing menstrual flow. However, up to 1/3 of women have side effects&#xD;
      and they are more common at higher doses. In the medical literature, there are different&#xD;
      dosing schedules and there is one commonly recommended in Canada. Women with underlying&#xD;
      bleeding disorders may require higher doses of this medication compared to those who do not.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to find the lowest effective dose of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      for girls and women with heavy periods who have bleeding disorders and the investigators&#xD;
      think this will be lower then the usual recommended dose. If the investigators' results&#xD;
      support this, it may contribute to changing how the investigators presently prescribe this&#xD;
      medication and may provide a better option for women with heavy periods in particular those&#xD;
      with bleeding disorders. The investigators have just started a Women with Bleeding Disorders&#xD;
      Clinic and hope that this project will lead to better care for the patients and more research&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

      Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding, represents an important health issue for&#xD;
      premenopausal women and is a common cause for primary care consultations. Approximately&#xD;
      10-15% of women have heavy periods. This may be associated with iron deficiency anemia,&#xD;
      fatigue, and time lost from school, work and regular activities. Up to 50% of women with&#xD;
      menorrhagia who have an underlying bleeding disorder have functional limitations and&#xD;
      reduction of quality of life during their menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature reports that 10-30% of women with menorrhagia have an underlying bleeding&#xD;
      disorder. The American Society of Hematology highlighted this as a major public health issue&#xD;
      in 2006, and there have been ongoing efforts to address this problem. The prevalence of a&#xD;
      bleeding disorder in the normal population is 1 in 100; von Willebrand Disease (VWD) being&#xD;
      the most common. Studies have shown between 57% and 93% of women with bleeding disorders have&#xD;
      menorrhagia. Therefore, women, who present with menorrhagia, should be considered for&#xD;
      investigation of a bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining an accurate history of menorrhagia from women is often difficult for several&#xD;
      reasons. Women may be reluctant to initiate discussion about their heavy periods. Also, women&#xD;
      with underlying hereditary bleeding disorders may have heavy periods but since they are the&#xD;
      same as other affected women in their families they consider their menses &quot;normal.&quot; Not&#xD;
      infrequently,a mild bleeding disorder may go undiagnosed until adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menorrhagia is objectively defined as menstrual blood loss of &gt; 80mls. It is well known that&#xD;
      assessment of menstrual blood loss by history alone is unreliable and inaccurate. The&#xD;
      alkaline hematin method provides an objective and accurate technique for the measurement of&#xD;
      menstrual blood loss and is considered the gold standard. However this method is&#xD;
      time-consuming, not readily available for clinical use and impractical, as it requires women&#xD;
      to collect all of their sanitary products for an entire menstrual cycle. The pictorial blood&#xD;
      assessment chart (PBAC) is a simple, non-laboratory method that provides a semi-quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of menstrual flow. Using this method, the patient records the number and degree of&#xD;
      saturation of pads and/or tampons used for up to 8 days of their menstrual cycle on a&#xD;
      pictorial chart and a corresponding score is calculated. In their original report, Higham et&#xD;
      al defined menorrhagia as a PBAC score of &gt; 100 with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity&#xD;
      of 81 %. Janssen et al later reported that a cut-off score of 185 provides high positive and&#xD;
      negative predictive values for 'true' menorrhagia as opposed to the score of &gt; 100 that was&#xD;
      not validated by Reid et al, in a more recent publication. In both the Higham and the Janssen&#xD;
      studies the confidence intervals of the estimates of sensitivity were not reported, therefore&#xD;
      it is difficult to select either one as being definitively better to use as a cut-off score.&#xD;
      In our study we have decided to use a cut-off PBAC score of 100 as a more conservative&#xD;
      approach that will allow the inclusion of more patients with heavy menstrual flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of treatment options for women with menorrhagia including hormone therapy&#xD;
      (combined oral estrogen/progesterone, progesterone alone), tranexamic acid (and other&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic agents), danazol, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      progesterone releasing intrauterine devices, and, finally, the surgical options of&#xD;
      endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. An additional therapy, for women with certain bleeding&#xD;
      disorders (VWD, platelet dysfunction and Hemophilia A carriers) is desmopressin (DDAVP)&#xD;
      (intranasal or subcutaneous). Tranexamic acid is a first line therapy for women with&#xD;
      menorrhagia who do not require contraception and who prefer non-hormonal therapy. It is&#xD;
      considered standard therapy around the world and in most countries (e.g. Canada), it is&#xD;
      available by prescription only, but interestingly in Sweden it is obtained&#xD;
      'over-the-counter.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifibrinolytic therapy has been used for almost forty years for menorrhagia - the first&#xD;
      publication was in 1965. It has previously been described that fibrinolysis is increased in&#xD;
      the menstrual fluid and endometrium in women with heavy menstrual flow. Tranexamic acid,&#xD;
      which is a fibrinolytic inhibitor, competitively blocks the activation of plasminogen to&#xD;
      plasmin and thereby reducing fibrinolysis. Tranexamic acid reduces menstrual blood loss by up&#xD;
      to 50% and it has been shown to be at least as equally as effective as oral contraceptives,&#xD;
      NSAIDs, and intranasal desmopressin. There is no consensus as to the minimal effective dose,&#xD;
      the dose scheduling and the optimal duration of therapy. In the published literature, the&#xD;
      effective dose is variable and ranges from 1000 mg/day to 6000 mg/day. The recommended dose&#xD;
      by the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS), 2009, published by the Canadian&#xD;
      Pharmacists Association, is 3000 mg/day to 6000 mg/day. The current recommended dose as per&#xD;
      the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding by the&#xD;
      Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and the Canadian Hemophilia Society&#xD;
      document on the Management of Women with Bleeding Disorders is 1000 mg orally four times a&#xD;
      day. Interestingly, in China, it is recommended to give 2000 mg/day. The recommended duration&#xD;
      of therapy is also variable; the CPS states the medication should be started &quot;when the flow&#xD;
      is copious&quot; and taken for &quot;several days.&quot; Most clinical trials have used a 4-5 day duration&#xD;
      of therapy. It is given in different schedules, most commonly 3 to 4 times per day. A recent&#xD;
      study compared two doses of tranexamic acid, 2000 mg/day vs. 1000 mg/day, both doses given on&#xD;
      a twice-a-day schedule, with an additional placebo arm, assessing the effect on prevention of&#xD;
      menorrhagia in women with intrauterine devices (IUDs). The women randomized to the tranexamic&#xD;
      acid arms had significantly less menstrual flow compared with the placebo group and there was&#xD;
      no significant difference in efficacy between the two doses of tranexamic acid. Women with&#xD;
      underlying bleeding disorders may need higher doses than women without bleeding disorders;&#xD;
      however, this is uncertain. This medication is not without toxicity and up to one-third of&#xD;
      women experience side effects that are dose dependant. The most common adverse effects are&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and, less common, are headaches, dizziness and allergic reaction.&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid is expensive; the retail price is $1.34/500-mg capsule. For example a dose of&#xD;
      4000 mg/day for 5 days would cost a patient $64.34/month including the dispensing fee. Common&#xD;
      reasons for discontinuing the medication include side effects, cost and the inconvenience&#xD;
      associated with multiple dosing. Many patients will adjust their dose - finding a balance of&#xD;
      efficacy, minimal toxicity, cost, and frequency of dosing. It is our experience that some&#xD;
      patients find this balance with a minimal dose of 500 mg taken twice daily. In this study we&#xD;
      propose to investigate whether the minimal effective and tolerated dose of tranexamic acid,&#xD;
      based on the PBAC score, quality of life factors, and tolerability of side effects is less&#xD;
      than the current Canadian recommended dose of 1000 mg orally four times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if the minimal effective and tolerated dose of tranexamic acid for&#xD;
                girls and women with menorrhagia who have bleeding disorders is lower than the&#xD;
                current dose of 1000 mg orally, four times a day, as recommended by the Clinical&#xD;
                Practice Guidelines for the Management of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding by the Society&#xD;
                of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and the Canadian Hemophilia Society&#xD;
                document on the Management of Women with Bleeding Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine an accurate estimate of the proportion of women who present to our&#xD;
                clinics with menorrhagia who have an underlying bleeding disorder. Based on the&#xD;
                literature this is expected to be 10%-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the effect of body mass index (BMI), age, dose-related side effects,&#xD;
                concurrent medications and quality of life factors on the optimal dose of&#xD;
                tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The minimal effective and tolerated dose of tranexamic acid required by women with&#xD;
                menorrhagia who have bleeding disorders is lower than the current Canadian&#xD;
                recommendation of 1000 mg orally, four times daily (4000 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The true proportion of women with menorrhagia who have bleeding disorders is&#xD;
                under-reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women with menorrhagia without bleeding disorders require a lower dose of&#xD;
                tranexamic acid than women with menorrhagia with bleeding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In addition to the presence of a bleeding disorder, there are likely other factors&#xD;
                including age, BMI, tolerance of side effects, subjective assessment of bleeding,&#xD;
                quality of life issues and compliance that impact on the dosing of tranexamic acid&#xD;
                in women with menorrhagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A decision tool can be developed to aid in dosing women with menorrhagia based on&#xD;
                risk factors such as the presence of a bleeding disorder, age and BMI.&#xD;
