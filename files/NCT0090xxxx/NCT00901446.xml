  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the technical performance and clinical handling of a&#xD;
      coronary catheter that includes two imaging techniques. The catheter being evaluated performs&#xD;
      near infrared spectroscopy and ultrasound imaging of the coronary arteries. Near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy is used to identify lipid or cholesterol deposits in the vessel wall and the&#xD;
      ultrasound component provides structural information about the vessel. Combining multiple&#xD;
      imaging techniques into a single catheter can reduce the total number of catheters required&#xD;
      during treatment and the overall duration of cardiac catheterization. Both of these results&#xD;
      may lead to safer procedures.&#xD;
