  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to ascertain the effectiveness of plastic head&#xD;
      covering in prevention of hypothermia. Hypothermia is defined by body temperature &lt;36.5º&#xD;
      Celsius by the World Health Organization. The surface area of the head is about 20% of total&#xD;
      body surface of a newborn infant and is a major source of heat loss. The objective is to&#xD;
      compare rectal temperature upon admission to the neonatal intensive care between preterm&#xD;
      neonates who had stockinet head covering and those who had plastic-lined stockinet head&#xD;
      covering placed in the delivery room. The investigators aim to demonstrate that plastic-lined&#xD;
      head covering is more effective than stockinet head covering alone in maintaining body&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized control trial will be conducted in Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH)&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) Dallas, Texas. Consent will not be obtained since:&#xD;
      placement of plastic and/or stockinet head covering on the neonate is part of routine&#xD;
      resuscitation care at PMH and by Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) minimal risk to the&#xD;
      preterm neonate is involved, post-delivery consent will be of little value since intervention&#xD;
      only last ~24minutes, and obtaining informed consent from a mother who has labor pains or is&#xD;
      on pain medication may be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the neonates will be carried out in the delivery room by opening a sealed,&#xD;
      opaque envelope just prior to birth. Qualified preterm newborns will be stratified into 2 OB&#xD;
      EGA groups: (≤28weeks obstetrical(OB)estimated gestational age (EGA) and 29-32weeks OB EGA.&#xD;
      In each stratified group, the newborns will be further randomized to control arm (stockinet&#xD;
      head covering) or the intervention arm (plastic-lined head covering). Each arm of the study&#xD;
      will have a sample size of 65, allowing for 130 infants in each OB EGA stratified group and&#xD;
      for a sample size total of 260. Treatment versus control will be assigned by blocks of 8 by&#xD;
      using a random permutation table. The assignment will be sealed in an opaque envelope by a&#xD;
      non-participant person of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PMH high-risk resuscitation (RESUS) team attends all deliveries of infants ≤32 weeks OB&#xD;
      EGA. The RESUS team is comprised of a resuscitation nurse, a respiratory therapist, and a&#xD;
      practitioner. Neonatology fellow and/or attending may also attend these deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of warming aids by the RESUS team is standardized in the following manner:&#xD;
      Randomization envelope will be opened. All infants will be taken from the obstetrician by the&#xD;
      practitioner to an Ohio radiant warmer that has been pre-warmed to 100% capacity prior to the&#xD;
      delivery of the infant. A food-grade storage (polyethylene) bag (will be referred as&#xD;
      &quot;poncho&quot;) will be used on all infants with the EGA of 32 weeks or less OB EGA to decrease&#xD;
      evaporative and convective heat loss. The poncho will be placed by cutting a hole at the&#xD;
      closed end of the bag for the purposes of inserting the head through it. The infants will not&#xD;
      be dried except for the face as recommended by NRP. All infants that are ≤28weeks OB EGA will&#xD;
      have a transwarmer mattress gel pad activated and placed on the radiant warmer during&#xD;
      resuscitation and during transport as per PMH NICU and NRP standard practice. The appropriate&#xD;
      head covering will then be placed to the level of the forehead on the infant as per&#xD;
      randomization assignment. If access to the infant's umbilical cord is needed, a hole will be&#xD;
      cut at the appropriate location. All infants will be transported in a dedicated isolette for&#xD;
      resuscitation that has been prewarmed to 38ºC. The warming aids will be in place until the&#xD;
      infant's arrival in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESUS team will gather the following data in the delivery room: environmental temperature&#xD;
      of the delivery room, rectal temperature immediately after delivery, annotation of warming&#xD;
      aids implemented. The RESUS team also cares for the infant in the first 4 hours of life.&#xD;
      Initial vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure), temperature, need of&#xD;
      ventilation, need of intervention will be recorded by the RESUS team. After 4 hours the care&#xD;
      will be assumed by the primary NICU team as per our standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the admission rectal temperature is taken, the head coverings will be removed and the&#xD;
      infant will no longer be actively enrolled in the research. The rest of the data will be&#xD;
      gathered through the Neonatal Resuscitation Database and Parkland NICU Morbidity and&#xD;
      Mortality Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is that no randomized control trial has been done to demonstrate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of placement of plastic-lined head covering versus stockinet head covering.&#xD;
      It would seem logical that if measures are taken to decrease heat loss from the head, these&#xD;
      measures would improve temperature stability and avoid hypothermia in the premature neonate.&#xD;
