      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue or blood from patients with cancer for&#xD;
      study in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting and storing blood and tissue samples from patients&#xD;
      with suspected solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a tissue and cell repository to be used by Wake Forest University&#xD;
           Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFUCCC) investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide specialized research pathology services to these investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Tumor and normal tissue in the resected specimen (when possible) are harvested and&#xD;
      collected from patients undergoing planned surgery or biopsy. Additionally, any normal tissue&#xD;
      and/or fluid removed in the course of the operation (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid during brain&#xD;
      tumor resection) may also be stored for use in analyzing changes from normal tissue to&#xD;
      cancerous tissue. Specimens are rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve the mRNA,&#xD;
      proteins, lipids, and DNA in the samples for future analysis. Tissue is stored for research&#xD;
      projects on tumors and treatment of cancer patients. Research may involve analysis of the&#xD;
      genetic makeup of the tumor tissue. Genes may be cloned and living cells cultured from the&#xD;
      stored tissue. Blood is also collected during surgery. Samples are maintained and cataloged&#xD;
      for future retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about medical history is collected from patient medical records. This information&#xD;
      includes the following: medical diagnosis; specific information about treatment; other&#xD;
      medical conditions; medical data (i.e., laboratory test results, tumor measurements, CT&#xD;
      scans, MRI scans, x-rays, and pathology results); side effects experienced and treatment for&#xD;
      side effects; long-term information about general health status and the status of disease;&#xD;
      data that may be related to tissue and/or blood samples collected; and identifying numbers or&#xD;
      codes (i.e., social security number and medical record number).&#xD;
