      Background &amp; Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 75% of US population living today will not die of cancer. There has been a recent&#xD;
      report of a colony of cancer-resistant mice developed from a single male mouse that&#xD;
      unexpectedly survived challenges of lethal cancer cell injections. In these so-called&#xD;
      spontaneous regression/complete resistant (SR/CR) mice, cancer cells are killed by rapid&#xD;
      infiltration of leukocytes, mainly of innate immunity. This highly effective natural cancer&#xD;
      immunity is inherited and mediated entirely by white blood cells. Moreover, this cancer&#xD;
      resistance can be transferred to wild type mice through the transfer of various immune cell&#xD;
      types including granulocytes. The infusion of white blood cells, particularly cells of innate&#xD;
      immunity, is a viable anticancer therapy in humans as well. This proposed trial will test&#xD;
      whether white blood cell infusions from healthy unrelated donors can be used to treat cancer.&#xD;
      The trial is designed to determine whether responses can be seen in cancer patients after&#xD;
      infusion of HLA-mismatched white cells from healthy donors. It is important that the donors&#xD;
      and recipients be unrelated and HLA-mismatched to avoid the possibility of&#xD;
      transfusion-related Graft vs. Host Disease. The white blood cells from the healthy donors are&#xD;
      being collected via apheresis following granulocyte mobilization with dexamethasone and&#xD;
      filgrastim. The investigators will refer to the white blood cells as 'granulocytes' because&#xD;
      75-90% of the white blood cells collected through the apheresis will consist of granulocytes.&#xD;
      The dose of at least 2x10 to the11th will be given from 4-5 donors at a rate of no more than&#xD;
      one donor per day for each recipient. There will only be one infusion per day and no more&#xD;
      than 5 infusions per week. Thus, a typical treatment in the study would span 1-2 weeks. After&#xD;
      each infusion, the patients will be monitored carefully for possible adverse events. If&#xD;
      adverse events occur at any time point during or after individual infusion, the treatment can&#xD;
      be stopped until the adverse events can be managed. The daily dose of each infusion is a&#xD;
      frequently used level that has a long safety record. The trial will observe the subject's&#xD;
      cancer for 3 months after the granulocyte infusions are completed. Response at 90 days will&#xD;
      be based on comparison of tumor measurements at baseline. The trial has 3 major endpoints:&#xD;
      dose response and tolerance, safety, and efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 29 Subjects with metastatic, non-hematological cancer can be entered. Potentially&#xD;
      hundreds of healthy Donor-participants will be recruited. A Donor Registry will be built to&#xD;
      store ABO/Rh-specific donors; these donors will be tested for HLA-specific genotyping as well&#xD;
      as fully tested for infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be receiving granulocytes from approximately 4 to 6 donors. Each donor will&#xD;
      be HLA-mismatched to avoid engraftment of the granulocytes and any transfusion-related GVHD.&#xD;
      These infusions will take place over a 1 to 2 week period, the timing of which will be&#xD;
      dependent on both the subject's tolerance and the availability of the donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Response Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients not demonstrating disease progression, response status will be evaluated&#xD;
      between Days +90 to +100 after the last infusion. Day+1 is the first day of white cell&#xD;
      infusion. All measurable lesions (lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
      dimension [longest diameter to be recorded] as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10&#xD;
      mm with spiral CT scan) up to a maximum of 10 lesions representative of all involved organs&#xD;
      should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target&#xD;
      lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and&#xD;
      their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or&#xD;
      clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and&#xD;
      reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further&#xD;
      characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease. The&#xD;
      criteria for response, progression, and relapse are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD)&#xD;
           of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking&#xD;
           as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance&#xD;
           of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient&#xD;
           increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment&#xD;
           started. Patients having a documented response with no reconfirmation of the response&#xD;
           will be listed with stable disease.&#xD;
