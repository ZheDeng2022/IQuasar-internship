  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      administration of Oxycyte in patients with severe non-penetrating traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first dose level (Cohort 1), 11 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 1.0&#xD;
      mL/kg Oxycyte (0.6 g/kg; n=8) or NS (n=3). A total of 8 patients received Oxycyte. The Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the safety data for patients in Cohort 1 through Day&#xD;
      14, and approved escalation to the next dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2, 18 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either 2.0 mL/kg Oxycyte (1.2&#xD;
      g/kg; n=12) or NS (n=6). The DSMB will then review the safety data for all patients in Cohort&#xD;
      2 through Day 14 and either approve escalation to the highest dose or remain at the current&#xD;
      dose. If remaining at the current dose level (Cohort 2) an additional 50 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to Oxycyte (n=25) or NS (n=25) and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If escalation occurs to Cohort 3, 18 patients would be randomized 2:1 to Oxycyte (n=12) or NS&#xD;
      (n=6) to receive the 3.0 mL/kg dose. The DSMB would again review the safety data and decide&#xD;
      whether to treat an additional 50 patients at this dose or to decrease the dose back to 2.0&#xD;
      mL/kg. This group would be randomized 1:1 to receive Oxycyte (n=25) or NS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, single dose, dose-escalation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Oxycyte in patients with severe non-penetrating&#xD;
      Traumatic Brain Injury administered in conjunction with 50% to 80% oxygen and standard of&#xD;
      care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each dose level, patients receiving Oxycyte will be compared to a control group of&#xD;
      patients who will receive Normal Saline (NS); all patients will receive 50% oxygen or&#xD;
      greater, if per standard of care for a particular patient based on his / her condition, up to&#xD;
      a maximum of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic brain damage is found in 80% of patients who die from severe head injury and studies&#xD;
      have shown that early, transient cerebral hypoperfusion of unknown origin is present in about&#xD;
      40% of these patients. In several early research studies, it is documented that about&#xD;
      one-third of severe head injured patients have reduced brain oxygen tension (&lt;25 mm Hg)&#xD;
      especially during the first 6 to 12 hours following severe head injury. In this group of&#xD;
      patients with low brain oxygen, the clinical prognosis is poor with death being a frequent&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a belief that increased brain oxygen levels would prove beneficial in the TBI&#xD;
      patient, it is theorized that perfluorocarbon-enhanced oxygen delivery may provide the same&#xD;
      or greater benefit. PFCs are especially attractive in this setting for several reasons;&#xD;
      first, because they transport oxygen without the need for erythrocytes and hemoglobin and can&#xD;
      thus perfuse and oxygenate &quot;peri-contusional&quot; brain tissue in which it has been shown that&#xD;
      capillaries are so narrowed as to impede red blood cell (RBC) transport; secondly,&#xD;
      perfluorocarbon (PFCs) actually increase oxygen transport and oxygen tension in the tissues,&#xD;
      which cannot be achieved with normobaric hyperoxia alone.&#xD;

          -  Weight â‰¥45 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to begin the infusion of study drug within 12 hours of injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe non-penetrating traumatic brain injury by clinical evaluation,&#xD;
             clinical indication for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, Glasgow Coma Scale&#xD;
             (GCS) assessment (4-8 prior to randomization, obtained any time prior to dosing and&#xD;
             including patients who deteriorate to severe TBI after arrival in the hospital, not&#xD;
             including times when the patient is pharmacologically paralyzed for management or&#xD;

             period at that time and reactivity is difficult to assess due to small pupil size, the&#xD;
             Investigator will determine if the patient is eligible based on clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient, due to his or her injuries is unable to provide written informed&#xD;
             consent, then written consent may be obtained by an appropriate surrogate decision&#xD;
             maker in accordance with preapproved procedures in compliance with local regulations.&#xD;
