  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety of Haemophilus (H.) influenzae,&#xD;
      its ability to produce adverse reactions and to live in the nose and throat. The nose and&#xD;
      throat of healthy adults will be populated with a specific type of H. influenzae Nontypeable&#xD;
      Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) 2019 Streptomycin Resistant (StrR) number 1. Researchers will&#xD;
      study whether the germ settles in the nose and throat, whether it causes symptoms after it&#xD;
      has been placed in the nose, how long the germs last in the nose and throat, and whether the&#xD;
      body tries to produce a permanent defense to the germ. Volunteers will receive a lower dose&#xD;
      (3,200 germs) or a higher dose (32,000 germs). Active participation will last about 28 days,&#xD;
      including a 3 night hospital stay, additional follow-up visits, followed by a 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up phone call. Study procedures will include blood samples, saliva samples, several&#xD;
      nose washes and throat swabs.&#xD;

      Haemophilus (H.) influenzae continues to be a major human pathogen causing upper and lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract diseases ranging from otitis media and sinusitis to invasive pneumonia. The&#xD;
      inoculation by nasal droplets proposed in this trial will introduce the organism into the&#xD;
      nasal mucosa, the natural host tissue for H. influenzae colonization. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      this inoculum will elicit the typical nasal colonization seen in healthy individuals. To&#xD;
      further develop this colonization model, healthy adults devoid of chronic medical conditions&#xD;
      that might predispose the subject to invasive disease, will be enrolled. This study is linked&#xD;
      to Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) protocol 04-022. Final safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity data from DMID 04-022, have been collated. This nasal colonization model&#xD;
      evaluated 15 volunteers and determined that the model was safe in these individuals and&#xD;
      identified a human colonizing dose (HCD) 50 and HCD 90. However, the confidence intervals for&#xD;
      these HCD doses were broad. The goals of this study are to further characterize the safety of&#xD;
      this trial and to further refine the HCD 50 and 90 doses. This study is a single-site,&#xD;
      randomized and blinded study designed to develop a colonization model for Nontypeable&#xD;
      Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Ten healthy young adults ages 18-54 will be enrolled and&#xD;
      inoculated with either 3,200 colony forming units (CFU) or 32,000 CFU of NTHi strain 2019&#xD;
      Streptomycin Resistant (StrR) number 1 and will be followed with nasal wash and throat swabs&#xD;
      to determine whether colonization with NTHi 2019 StrR number 1 develops. Subjects that meet&#xD;
      enrollment criteria will be admitted to the inpatient clinical research unit to a private&#xD;
      room to stay from day 0 thru the morning of day 3 (visits 2-5) to evaluate for reactogenicity&#xD;
      after nasal inoculation. During the hospital stay, subjects will remain in respiratory&#xD;
      isolation. On day 0, five volunteers will be inoculated at the lower dose, 3,200 CFU, and&#xD;
      five will be inoculated with higher dose, 32,000 CFU. After inoculation, primary volunteers&#xD;
      will be followed daily for 6 days (visits 2-8, days 0-6) for clinical assessment and culture.&#xD;
      Days 4-6, inoculated volunteers will return on a daily basis for a review of reactogenicity&#xD;
      parameters, solicitation of adverse events (AEs), a targeted physical exam and pharyngeal&#xD;
      swab and nasal wash specimens will be obtained. On day 6, visit 8, after pharyngeal swab and&#xD;
      nasal wash samples have been collected and women of child bearing potential have had a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test performed, inoculated volunteers will receive 3 days of levofloxacin to&#xD;
      eradicate any potential colonizing study organisms. Participants will return on days 14 and&#xD;
      28 to assess for any AEs, a targeted physical exam will be performed and pharyngeal swab,&#xD;
      nasal wash, blood and saliva will be collected. A telephone visit will be performed 6 months&#xD;
      after inoculation. A substudy will be performed to evaluate whether casual contact can serve&#xD;
      as a mechanism for transmission of NTHi 2019 StrR number 1 from a colonized individual to a&#xD;
      casual contact. Three and up to 10 subjects will be recruited to this substudy. They will&#xD;
      spend 3-5 hours per day for 6 days with the subject in nonintimate contact and will be&#xD;
      followed with nasal wash and throat swabs to determine whether colonization with NTHi 2019&#xD;
      StrR develops. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of NTHi Strain 2019 StrR number 1 administered by nasal drop inoculation. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to: evaluate the frequency and duration of colonization with NTHi&#xD;
      strain 2019 StrR number 1 and to establish a human colonizing dose 5&#xD;
