    <textblock>
      Low birth weight (LBW; birth weight&lt;2,500g) is the most important determinant of mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity in the neonatal period. It is also a very important factor in predicting&#xD;
      nutritional status, health and development in childhood. It even influences health in adult&#xD;
      life, contributing to the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The high rate LBW in DCs&#xD;
      represents therefore a major public health problem. Maternal chronic energy deficiency is&#xD;
      assumed to be a major determinant of the problem in these countries along with prenatal&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies. A large body of recent evidence points out that multiple&#xD;
      micronutrient supplementation as such has only a modest beneficial effect on fetal growth.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is expected that providing these multiple micronutrients in a food supplement&#xD;
      covering energy requirement needs of pregnant women will have an effect of public health&#xD;
      importance on children's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the objective of improving children's health by improving birth outcome and&#xD;
      fetal growth through the provision of a food supplement enriched in multimicronutrients&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research includes 2 constituents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a pilot phase during which dietary behavior of pregnant women is assessed as a component&#xD;
           for optimal fetal growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, including 1300 pregnant women aimed at testing 2&#xD;
           hypotheses: supplementing pregnant women with a food supplement containing a&#xD;
           multivitamin-minerals mix will improve fetal growth; improved fetal growth will have a&#xD;
           positive effect on health and growth during infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is planned in Hounde District, Burkina Faso, in collaboration with Centre Muraz,&#xD;
      which plays a leader role in research and services providing at the district level and in&#xD;
      policy recommendations at the national level. This will ensure that the study findings are&#xD;
      incorporated into on-going district programs with possible replication at the national level.&#xD;
      The research lasts from February 2006 to August 2009.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low birth weight (LBW; birth weight&lt;2500g) is an important predictor of mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in the neonatal period of early postnatal growth and growth during childhood. It is&#xD;
      also associated with cognitive and behavioral development in the first years of life, health&#xD;
      status during childhood, and adult health and human capital. As much as 16 % of all live&#xD;
      births worldwide present a LBW, more than 90% being in low-income countries. Rates are&#xD;
      particularly high in Asia and sub-Saharan countries. In Burkina Faso, it is estimated that 19&#xD;
      % of all live births in 1999-2005 were LBW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries, most cases of LBW are attributed to intrauterine growth retardation&#xD;
      (IUGR) rather than to preterm delivery. Factors interacting with fetal development are&#xD;
      numerous. Among them maternal malnutrition, particularly energy and micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies, and malaria during pregnancy are assumed to be major determinants of IUGR.&#xD;
      Dietary surveys have consistently shown that multiple micronutrient deficiencies, rather than&#xD;
      single deficiencies, are common. However, a number of randomized clinical trials in various&#xD;
      countries have shown only a modest beneficial effect on fetal growth when providing multiple&#xD;
      micronutrient supplements during pregnancy compared to folic acid and iron supplementation.&#xD;
      It is expected that chronic energy deficiency during pregnancy could be hampering the full&#xD;
      potential of the effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation. Therefore it is expected&#xD;
      that incorporating multiple micronutrients in a food supplement (FS), that provides&#xD;
      supplementary energy and protein, instead of multiple micronutrients (UNIMMAP), could have an&#xD;
      effect of public health importance on fetal growth and its correlates. The UNIMMAP supplement&#xD;
      composition, incorporated in the FS or given in the form of a tablet, was proposed by an&#xD;
      expert committee organized by UNICEF, WHO and UNU for pregnancy and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study takes place in the health district of Houndé (south-west of Burkina Faso) in the&#xD;
      surroundings of 2 health centers (12,000 inhabitants) from June 2003 to October 2006. Houndé&#xD;
      is situated in a Sudano-Sahelian climate belt. The diet is essentially cereal-based. In 2004&#xD;
      and 2006, food consumption surveys estimated the average caloric intake during pregnancy at&#xD;
      8.6 MJ and 8.1 MJ during the postharvest and pre-harvest season respectively. Malaria&#xD;
      transmission is permanent with seasonal variations. In 2002, the HIV prevalence among&#xD;
      consulting pregnant women in the district was estimated at 2 %. The incidence of LBW in term&#xD;
      infants was around 17% at the District Hospital in 2000-2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of participants is community-based. During a preliminary census, houses in&#xD;
      the study area are mapped and numbered and a unique identification code allocated to every&#xD;
      woman of child-bearing age. Thirty locally trained home-visitors visit monthly every compound&#xD;
      for early detection of pregnancy and referral to the health center for pregnancy test. Once&#xD;
      the pregnancy is confirmed and after extensive explanation of the study purposes and&#xD;
      procedures in Bwamu, Moré or Dioula, participants are asked to provide signed consent or&#xD;
      thumbprints. There are no exclusion criteria other than planning to leave the area within the&#xD;
      next 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, with directly observed supplement intake.&#xD;
      Pregnant women are randomly assigned to receive daily either UNIMMAP tablet ( vitamin A&#xD;
      800µg, vitamin E 10 mg, vitamin D 5 µg, vitamin B1 1.4 mg, vitamin B2 1.4 mg, niacin 18 mg,&#xD;
      vitamin B6 1.9 mg, vitamin B12 2.6 µg, folic acid 400 µg, vitamin C 70 mg, iron 30 mg, zinc&#xD;
      15 mg, copper 2 mg, selenium 65 µg, and iodine 150 µg) until delivery, or either a food&#xD;
      supplement containing the UNIMMAP. The food supplement consists of 33% peanut butter, 32%&#xD;
      heat-treated soy flour, 15% vegetable oil, 20% plain sugar and the UNIMMAP micronutrient&#xD;
      cocktail in powdered form. Each participant allocated to the FS study group will receive 72g&#xD;
      of FS daily which provides 1.56 MJ (372 kcal) of energy and 14.7g protein. The supplement is&#xD;
      produced by a local women's association in collaboration with a food technologist, the&#xD;
      micronutrients in the FS are dosed by a laboratory technician. UNIMMAP micronutrient tablets&#xD;
      are manufactured by Scanpharm (Copenhagen, Denmark). A randomization scheme is generated by a&#xD;
      computer program in permuted blocks of 4. Randomization numbers are sealed in opaque&#xD;
      envelopes by administrative staff. At each inclusion, the consulting physician in the field&#xD;
      opens the next sealed envelope and transmits the randomization number in case of MMN to a&#xD;
      pharmacist managing for the packaging of drugs in individual plastic zip sachets containing&#xD;
      31 tablets. In case the randomization number shows allocation to the FS group, the&#xD;
      responsible of the FS production site together with project staff, prepares a plastic bag&#xD;
      containing 31 FS sachets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are also randomly assigned randomized to receive intermittent malaria&#xD;
      prophylaxis by either two doses or more than two doses of combined sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (a single dose represented 1500 mg sulfadoxine and 75mg pyrimethamine). The malaria component&#xD;
      will be analysed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of maternal illness, appropriate treatments are provided according to national&#xD;
      guidelines. Severely anemic women (hemoglobin &lt; 70 g/L, without dyspnea) receive ferrous&#xD;
      sulphate (200 mg) + folic acid (0.25 mg) twice daily, during 3 months whatever their&#xD;
      allocation group. All participants also receive Albendazole 400 mg in the second and third&#xD;
      trimester. In case of malaria episode despite the preventative treatment, quinine (300 mg, 3&#xD;
      times a day) is given during 5 days. Vitamin A (200.000 IU) is given to all women after&#xD;
      delivery, in conformity with the national recommendations.&#xD;
