    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether neural block and neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation are effective in treating finger impairment due to stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of stroke-induced hemiparesis among veterans is likely to rise as this&#xD;
      population ages. Post-stroke hemiparesis is often marked by persistent hand impairment, which&#xD;
      adversely affects both a person's ability to work and his/her quality of life. We believe&#xD;
      that impairment is primarily due to neural, rather than biomechanical, factors. At the muscle&#xD;
      level, these factors relate either to the inability to activate muscles (i.e., low muscle&#xD;
      activation) or to activate them appropriately (i.e., abnormal muscle co-activation).&#xD;
      Currently it is unclear as to which one is largely responsible for weakness in the hand as&#xD;
      the net mechanical effect, e.g., reduced fingertip force production, could be the same.&#xD;
      Determination of voluntary muscle force generation could help to explain deficits in&#xD;
      fingertip force production in specific directions, as well as to customize treatment&#xD;
      approaches in which force generation ability of some muscles is decreased and others&#xD;
      increased. The goal of this work is to explain the source of neurally-mediated weakness at&#xD;
      the fingertip following hemiparetic stroke, and to design and experimentally test&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions that attempt to offset this weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we were refining the protocol to experimentally test a rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention-involving neural block and stimulation of select muscles to decrease and&#xD;
      increase muscle force generation-it was more challenging than anticipated to locate, using&#xD;
      ultrasound, small nerve branches to individual muscles for selective neural blocking. As a&#xD;
      result we designed additional interventions, using a computer model, that reflected the&#xD;
      physical limitation to implementation which could still hopefully lead to improved fingertip&#xD;
      function. We are seeking novel approaches to locate and block small nerve branches to&#xD;
      individual muscles for an individual muscle-based approach to rehabilitation which we expect&#xD;
      to be an improvement over rehabilitation interventions that target groups of muscles at a&#xD;
      time. The clinical data collected in the study and biomechanical model simulation work&#xD;
      provide guidance for a clinical trial study in the future.&#xD;
