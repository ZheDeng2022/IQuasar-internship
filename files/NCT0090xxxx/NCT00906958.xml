      The purpose of this study is to determine if the performance of the modified AutoSet device&#xD;
      is equivalent or better than the existing AutoSet device (VPAP Auto) in the efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment and the subjective comfort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterised by a partial or complete collapse of the upper&#xD;
      airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed or auto adjusted positive&#xD;
      pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. The modified device to be assessed in this&#xD;
      study will act in a similar way to the existing device, VPAP Auto, but utilizes an improved&#xD;
      algorithm which should maintain or enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.&#xD;
