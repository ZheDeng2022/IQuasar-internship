      Patients with a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic neuropathy (DN), or low&#xD;
      back pain (LBP) who were currently receiving an analgesic regimen that contained gabapentin&#xD;
      participated in a Phase IV clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of Lidoderm®&#xD;
      administered once daily (q24h) after 14 day in the treatment of PHN, DN, or LBP in patients&#xD;
      who had a partial response to a regimen containing gabapentin.&#xD;
