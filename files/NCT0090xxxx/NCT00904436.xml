  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness is an extremely common and uncomfortable symptom that is reported in more than&#xD;
      two-thirds of persons with tetraplegia. This disordered pulmonary function is due to&#xD;
      respiratory muscle paralysis or to sympathetic denervation results in a restrictive&#xD;
      impairment and airway hyperreactivity, respectively. These restrictive and obstructive&#xD;
      dysfunctions have been associated with the symptom of breathlessness. However, mechanisms&#xD;
      contributing to dyspnea in persons who have tetraplegia are not well understood. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that persons with tetraplegia have an increased prevalence of breathlessness and&#xD;
      may have an altered breathing pattern. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      breathing pattern at rest and measure the changes in breathing after a bronchodilator&#xD;
      treatment (a medicine commonly used to treat asthma that relaxes and opens up airways). The&#xD;
      determination of breathing pattern is done by measuring the movements in the chest wall while&#xD;
      breathing. This design will elucidate differences in breathing patterns between those with&#xD;
      tetraplegia and controls, as well as demonstrate the effect of bronchodilatation on motor&#xD;
      drive and timing. Knowledge of the intraindividual variability and mean values of the&#xD;
      components of the breathing pattern will improve our understanding of breathlessness in these&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to evaluate mechanisms of dyspnea in tetraplegia. This goal will be&#xD;
      accomplished by completing the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To noninvasively assess dyspnea, motor drive, and respiratory timing during prolonged&#xD;
           periods of resting breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if relationships exist between these breathing pattern components and&#xD;
           dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the relationships among respiratory timing, drive, and dyspnea are&#xD;
           altered by a bronchodilator and over its duration of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These specific objectives will be used to test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During prolonged periods of resting breathing, respiratory timing will be altered and&#xD;
           motor drive will be increased and less variable than in able-bodied controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a positive association between motor drive and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improving respiratory mechanics by bronchodilator administration will reduce drive,&#xD;
           normalize timing and lessen dyspnea over the duration of action of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the proposed studies will expand our existing knowledge of ventilatory control&#xD;
      in persons with tetraplegia and relate these changes to dyspnea, a common and distressing&#xD;
      clinical problem in these individuals. These studies will also provide a better&#xD;
      characterization of breathing patterns and their intrasubject variability in persons with&#xD;
      tetraplegia. Currently, the only information regarding breathing patterns in tetraplegia are&#xD;
      of limited duration (15-30 minutes). If this pilot study reveals significant relationships&#xD;
      between motor drive, timing, and dyspnea, compiling &quot;normative&quot; data for breathing patterns&#xD;
      from large numbers of individuals with tetraplegia may be useful in evaluating dyspnea in&#xD;
      different clinical settings.&#xD;
