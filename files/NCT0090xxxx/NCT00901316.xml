  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if adding bleach baths to routine ways for&#xD;
      prevention of Staph infections is helpful. The amount added is a very weak amount. This would&#xD;
      provide a relatively inexpensive method to help prevent recurrent skin infections caused by&#xD;
      the Staph germ. The investigators will also be studying how often Staphylococcus aureus lives&#xD;
      in the nose, throat, and groin area.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In many areas of the United States, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is now an&#xD;
      established community pathogen (CA-MRSA). At Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), about 75% of S.&#xD;
      aureus isolates recovered from healthy children with infections are CA-MRSA and &gt; 90% of the&#xD;
      CA-MRSA isolates are related to one clone, USA300, which also predominates throughout the&#xD;
      U.S. From 8/05 to 7/06, 1400 children with CA-MRSA infection were seen at TCH; 60% were&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital. Why the USA300 clone is so successful in spreading throughout the&#xD;
      community is unclear, but it does harbor a unique set of genes not found in other S. aureus&#xD;
      clones. The anterior nose in the most common area of the body colonized with S. aureus but it&#xD;
      is not known if this is the primary site for colonization by CA-MRSA USA300 clone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3.5% of children at TCH have a proven recurrence of S. aureus infection within&#xD;
      12 months; we believe this is a minimal estimate and that overall at least 10% of children&#xD;
      have recurrences. There is no consensus on the best strategies for preventing recurrent S.&#xD;
      aureus infections or spread of S. aureus among family members. At TCH, in addition to routine&#xD;
      preventative measures, we often recommend for the patients to take a bath at least twice a&#xD;
      week in water to which one teaspoon of household bleach (Clorox) has been added per gallon of&#xD;
      water. Anecdotally this approach has decreased the recurrence rate of S. aureus infections,&#xD;
      but this common strategy among dermatologists has not been formally evaluated and is thus&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that in children who have a&#xD;
      community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus (CA-SA) infection, sodium hypochlorite baths&#xD;
      (Clorox) are a safe and effective component of a prevention strategy that will reduce&#xD;
      recurrent medically attended skin and soft tissue infection (MA-SSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the recurrence rate (over a 12 month period) of medically attended skin and&#xD;
           soft tissue infection visits in children initially evaluated in the TCH Emergency Center&#xD;
           for whom a 3 month prevention strategy includes taking a bath twice a week in water to&#xD;
           which sodium hypochlorite (Clorox) has been added and the recurrence rate in children&#xD;
           for whom a similar prevention strategy has been recommended but without the bath&#xD;
           component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the recurrence rate (over a 12 month period) of skin and soft tissue infection&#xD;
           caused by CA-S. aureus in children for whom a 3-month prevention strategy includes&#xD;
           taking a bath twice a week in water to which sodium hypochlorite (Clorox) has been added&#xD;
           and the recurrence rate in children for whom a similar prevention strategy has been&#xD;
           recommended but without the bath component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the + rates of S. aureus colonization of the anterior nares, pharynx, and&#xD;
           groin for children being evaluated in the emergency center of Texas Children's Hospital&#xD;
           (TCH) or admitted to TCH with suspected S. aureus infections.&#xD;

            <description>Routine Measures Group: Cultures will be obtained from the anterior nares of the nose, the throat and the groin using separate culturette swabs. S. aureus isolates will be identified and antibiotic susceptibility determined. Isolates will subsequently undergo testing for susceptibility to methicillin to determine if the isolate is an MSSA or MRSA strain. All patients and parents will be instructed orally and provided written instructions about routine measures employed for the prevention of S. aureus skin infections.</description>
