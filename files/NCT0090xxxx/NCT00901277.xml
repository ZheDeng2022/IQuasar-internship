    <textblock>
      The study is a three-arm design where up to 600 patients hospitalized post-MI are recruited&#xD;
      from a large hospital and randomized to either the education group (control group) or one of&#xD;
      the two intervention groups. Patients randomized to one of the intervention groups will&#xD;
      receive a nurse-administered intervention plus the use of Microsoft's HealthVault web-based&#xD;
      platform or solely the use of Microsoft's HealthVault web-based platform and web-based&#xD;
      behavioral intervention, both of which includes a behavioral/medication management component.&#xD;
      The 12 months effects of the intervention will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For baseline and outcome assessments we will obtain BP, nonfasting LDL, and Hb A1c. Patients&#xD;
      will also be surveyed about demographics and health behaviors during the baseline and 12&#xD;
      months. Study personnel serve as a liaison between subjects and their providers; however, all&#xD;
      decisions related to clinical care are ultimately left up to the patient's provider. Subjects&#xD;
      with serious adverse effects will be advised and assisted in seeking emergency medical care.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF STUDY Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S.,&#xD;
      accounting for over one third of deaths. Of these, coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for&#xD;
      the greatest proportion of morbidity and mortality with an estimated 770,000 Americans having&#xD;
      a first myocardial infarction (MI) and an additional 430,000 having a recurrent MI in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, much of the focus on improvement of evidence-based medical therapy has been on the&#xD;
      'in-hospital' care phase, yet the greater challenge in improving CHD outcomes is in the&#xD;
      transition from hospital to home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are testing two novel CVD risk reduction interventions for providing tailored&#xD;
      disease-management support for patients who recently had a MI. The first intervention will&#xD;
      utilize home BP monitors for all in this intervention arm, an interactive web-based tool&#xD;
      based on Microsoft's HealthVault technology (for data transmission, tracking and&#xD;
      communication), and nurse telephone disease-management to expand CVD risk management beyond&#xD;
      the walls of the hospital and clinics. This intervention builds on our prior extensive&#xD;
      experience in hypertension management including randomized interventional evaluation in over&#xD;
      2000 patients. This proven approach is now being enhanced with novel technology and a broader&#xD;
      application namely secondary prevention. Combined, it has the potential to enhance post MI&#xD;
      access, and quality of care, and ultimately, to improve patient outcomes. The second&#xD;
      intervention, similar to the other invention arm, will utilize home BP monitors the same&#xD;
      interactive web-based tool based on Microsoft's HealthVault technology (for data&#xD;
      transmission, tracking, and communication), however, the second intervention arm will include&#xD;
      a web-based disease-management to expand CVD risk management. Thus, the two intervention arms&#xD;
      will be similar with the difference being whether individuals receive feedback from a nurse&#xD;
      using a tailored behavioral telephone based intervention or use a tailored web-based&#xD;
      intervention without direct communication with a nurse. The two arms will allow us to test&#xD;
      the clinical impact and cost of using a tailored web-intervention as compared to having&#xD;
      nurses implement a tailored intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND PROCEDURES The study is a three-arm design of up to 600 patients who were&#xD;
      hospitalized post-MI are recruited from a large hospital and randomized to either the&#xD;
      education group (control group) or one of the two intervention groups. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      one of the two intervention groups will receive a home BP monitor, trained in it's use and&#xD;
      will have access to an interactive web-based tool based on Microsoft's HealthVault technology&#xD;
      (for data transmission, tracking and communication). Those in the intervention arms will&#xD;
      receive either a nurse telephone disease-management intervention or web-based&#xD;
      disease-management intervention. Those randomized to the educational control arm, will&#xD;
      receive usual care and information on CHD. The 12 months effects of the intervention will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For baseline assessments of the outcomes, the study will obtain BP, nonfasting LDL, and Hb&#xD;
      A1c. Patients will also be surveyed about demographics and health behaviors during the&#xD;
      baseline and 12 months. After the patient has completed the measurement battery, patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the educational control group or the intervention group,&#xD;
      respectively. The project's masters-level statistician will perform the entire study&#xD;
      randomization before patient enrollment begins. Participants will be randomized using a&#xD;
      computerized random number generator in blocks (size &lt;10) within a single stratification&#xD;
      factor, diabetic status. Additionally, because there are two nurse interventionists&#xD;
      delivering the intervention in the nurse-intervention arm, patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to a nurse in a blocked fashion to ensure approximate even distribution of patients&#xD;
      between nurses. At all follow-up measures, the RA assigned to measure BP and obtain survey&#xD;
      information will not be blinded as to which group the patient is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are not able to complete baseline assessments including BP, LDL-Direct and/or Hb&#xD;
      A1c, the RA will reschedule individuals' appointment to complete the interview at a later&#xD;
      date. Comorbidities will be obtained from individuals' medical records over the 12 months of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomized to the two intervention arms will be provided an easy-to-use home BP&#xD;
      monitor . The primary means of BP monitoring will be through the plug and play uploads of&#xD;
      their readings to the Microsoft HealthVault application. Participants are asked to take blood&#xD;
      pressure readings daily and to upload values to HealthVault weekly. If diabetic, participants&#xD;
      are asked to upload glucose values when taken (as recommended by their provider). If&#xD;
      participants are unable to upload their readings to the Microsoft HealthVault application,&#xD;
      the RA will instruct participants on how to enter values into the application manually. If&#xD;
      participants are unable or unwilling to use HealthVault, the study will provide the&#xD;
      participant with a document to record their home monitor blood pressure and glucose readings&#xD;
      and a self addressed stamped envelope. Every two weeks (bi-weekly), the study will ask the&#xD;
      participant to send the readings back to the study staff. The RA will then enter home monitor&#xD;
      blood pressure and glucose readings into the Microsoft HealthVault application. In addition&#xD;
      to patients' home monitoring information, patients' lab values for non fasting LDL, Hb A1c as&#xD;
      well as important safety monitoring parameters will be manually entered into the study's data&#xD;
      repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND COMPENSATION We will enroll up to 600 subjects who were admitted to&#xD;
      Duke University Medical Center (DUHS) for a MI. Recruitment will occur within approximately a&#xD;
      week to 36 months after hospital discharge. Subjects will be randomly assigned to be in the&#xD;
      educational control group or one of the two intervention groups respectively. At least 50% of&#xD;
      our sample will be women and 40% will be African American based upon our prior hypertension&#xD;
      studies using similar enrollment strategies. Subjects will receive compensation for&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT PROCESS The Research Assistant (RA) will contact the subject within approximately a&#xD;
      week to 36 months after hospital discharge. Patients will receive a letter detailing the&#xD;
      study after hospital discharge and will have the opportunity to opt out of the study. If the&#xD;
      patient does not opt out, the RA will contact the patient after discharge from the hospital,&#xD;
      screen for eligibility, describe the study, obtain informed consent and interview the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT'S CAPACITY TO GIVE LEGALLY EFFECTIVE CONSENT Subjects not competent to give consent&#xD;
      are not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTIONS In the nurse intervention arm, the research nurse (RN) will contact the&#xD;
      patient within one week of enrollment for the purpose of introduction. The schedule of&#xD;
      intervention modules will begin at the initial phone call from the nurse. In the web&#xD;
      intervention arm, participants will receive an e-mail within one week of enrolling with a&#xD;
      link to a secure web-page were the intervention can be activated. A unique aspect of the&#xD;
      intervention is that while some modules are activated at every encounter, other modules will&#xD;
      only be activated at specific encounters when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activation frequency of each module (multiple modules make up an encounter) can vary. The&#xD;
      first modules (medication and side effects) can be potentially activated for all intervention&#xD;
      patients every month if a problem/issue arises (e.g., a medication change has occurred or a&#xD;
      patient reports a new medication side effect). The remaining modules (patient/provider&#xD;
      communication, CVD knowledge/risk perception, and health behaviors) can only be activated for&#xD;
      individuals at specific encounters. Patients are also able to telephone the nurse with&#xD;
      questions related to the management of their diseases. Individuals in the web-based&#xD;
      intervention can e-mail questions to the study team. Should major emergent health care issues&#xD;
      arise during these, or any calls or e-mail communications, the nurse can immediately notify&#xD;
      patients' primary care provider. In the case of e-mail communications, information will be&#xD;
      forwarded to participants' providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multibehavioral, comprehensive approach is proposed because no one factor has been shown to&#xD;
      consistently improve CVD outcomes. An important feature of the intervention is that it&#xD;
      incorporates tailored information and feedback that is specifically relevant to a particular&#xD;
      patient. Previous studies have shown effectiveness using an early version of this&#xD;
      intervention, addressing up to 13 health behaviors focused on improving patient management of&#xD;
      CVD and related health behaviors. Patients will be provided evidence-based recommendations&#xD;
      regarding lifestyle behaviors and will be advised on how to achieve their goals with respect&#xD;
      to these behaviors. In the nurse arm, verbal information will be reinforced with written and&#xD;
      visual material mailed to the patient. In the web-based arm, these materials will be sent to&#xD;
      patients via e-mail. All intervention components are designed to be culturally sensitive. The&#xD;
      behavioral modules include, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol, stress reduction, memory,&#xD;
      patient-provider relationship, medication update, side effects, and knowledge/risk&#xD;
      perception. In addition, those patients using the Microsoft HealthVault system will have&#xD;
      access to further on line patient educational materials prepared by the America Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA).&#xD;
