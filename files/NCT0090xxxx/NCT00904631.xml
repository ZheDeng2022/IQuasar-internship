      Name of Device: Eraser Tattoo Removal Device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description: The Eraser device is a mechanical device, resembling tattoo devices but&#xD;
      with an innovative mechanism for dripping treatment fluid over reciprocating needles and&#xD;
      returning used fluid into a reservoir chamber. The device is intended for removal of tattoos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study is a continuation of a previous feasibility study, which tested the&#xD;
      ability of the device to remove tattoos from small skin areas. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Eraser Tattoo Removal system for removal of&#xD;
      skin tattoos in their entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: 20 patients in the medical center. Subject enrollment will include (i) a&#xD;
      variety of tattoo colors (multiple colors) (ii) a variety of tattoo composition, contour&#xD;
      lines and shadings (iii) Subjects with different skin colors (white, tanned, dark, etcâ€¦) (iv)&#xD;
      professional and amateur tattoos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure: A prospective, non-randomized, open, clinical study designed according to FDA&#xD;
      guidelines; ISO 14155: standard for clinical studies of medical devices; and the procedures&#xD;
      of the Israeli Ministry of Health for clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is signed, demographic details and medical history will be taken and a&#xD;
      physical examination performed. Subjects will be treated with the Eraser device, using&#xD;
      salicylic acid (5%) as washing fluid. The skin will be examined by a physician and the tattoo&#xD;
      area will be photographed. The Eraser device will be used to remove the tattoo from the&#xD;
      entire tattoo area (up to 30 minutes in a single session). An absorbent bandage will be put&#xD;
      on the treated area for one-hour post treatment. After Care Treatment, based on a&#xD;
      Dermatologist's consultation, will be performed on a case-by-case basis (for example, use of&#xD;
      antibiotic ointments in case of infection). All subjects must refrain from exposure to the&#xD;
      sun for 90 days following each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: The subject will return for follow-up at one week, two weeks, 1 month and two&#xD;
      months (if tattoo removal and skin healing is complete), or up to six months (if skin&#xD;
      healing/ tattoo removal are not complete by two months), or until the healing of the tattoo&#xD;
      removal site is completely resolved or until the investigator determines that additional&#xD;
      treatments will provide no further benefit to the patient. In each follow-up visit, a&#xD;
      physician will perform a physical examination, check the skin over and around the treatment&#xD;
      area, and take photographs of the treated area. Images from last follow-up will be compared&#xD;
      with images of the same site taken before the removal procedure, for evaluation of treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat treatments: if tattoo removal is not complete, up to two additional treatments will be&#xD;
      performed, based on the investigator's discretion. After each treatment, follow-up will&#xD;
      continue as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Non-Applicable Concurrent Control: There is no concurrent control group in this&#xD;
      study. Images of tattoos before treatment will serve as the reference measure, to which&#xD;
      images of healed skin, several weeks after tattoo removal, will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Primary Effectiveness Variables: The&#xD;
      primary measure of effectiveness will be the pigment clearance, as evaluated by image&#xD;
      comparison on a 1-5 analog scale (5 - 81-100% clearance- excellent removal; 4 - 61-80% - good&#xD;
      removal; 3 - 41-60% - moderate removal; 2 - 21-40% - fair removal; 1 - 0-20% - poor removal).&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be calculated for the total study group and for individual sub-groups&#xD;
      (skin type, pigment colors, etc.). Effectiveness will be analyzed separately for the area&#xD;
      affected (percentage of treated area that showed any reaction to treatment) and for the&#xD;
      change in color brightness (if, due to technical reasons, part of the tattoo showed a major&#xD;
      effect, this area will be evaluated for the change in color brightness). For both analyses,&#xD;
      the same scale will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety assessment, the rate of systemic and dermatologic adverse events will be&#xD;
      calculated and reported. The data will be listed by type of event and by severity.&#xD;
      Specifically, textural change, hypo- and hyper- pigmentation will be followed and their rates&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: For this clinical study, descriptive statistics will be used. Successful&#xD;
      treatment will be a result of 3 or more (at least, moderate tattoo removal) on the brightness&#xD;
      change scale.&#xD;
