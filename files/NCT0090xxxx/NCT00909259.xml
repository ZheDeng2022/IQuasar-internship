  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the effect of stimulating the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve to treat periodic breathing (a pattern of breathing characterized by hyperpneas&#xD;
      followed by hypopneas or apneas). Clinically, these physiologic events translate into sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced exercise capacity, and possibly&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 of the study is acute in nature, such that subjects will undergo the placement of a&#xD;
      stimulation lead, followed by assessment of stimulation of the phrenic nerve using the lead&#xD;
      for up to 2 nights of sleep. A sensing lead may also be placed during the initial implant&#xD;
      procedure. Observational data will be obtained and stimulation provided using an externalized&#xD;
      system connected to the study leads. Following the study, all investigational components will&#xD;
      be removed from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 of the study is being conducted at one of the participating sites to determine the&#xD;
      initial safety of chronic stimulation of the phrenic nerve in a limited number of patients&#xD;
      with sleep disordered breathing. It is anticipated that data obtained in this feasibility&#xD;
      study will show that the proposed intervention can modify respiration with a low incidence of&#xD;
      adverse effects. The results of this trial are intended to be used to develop a subsequent&#xD;
      protocol for a multi-center study of chronic phrenic nerve pacing.&#xD;

    <description>In Stage 1, a stimulation lead will be introduced via standard access methods and positioned to provide stimulation. A second lead may also be placed for sensing purposes. The proximal portions of the implanted lead(s) will remain externalized such that stimulation and observation can be made using external stimulation and recording equipment. Study subjects will be observed and stimulation will be performed for up to 2 nights of sleep in a clinically supported environment. In Stage 2, a stimulation device and lead will be permanently implanted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a demonstrated history of periodic breathing (symptoms may include sleep&#xD;
             fragmentation, as reported by patient or as witnessed by another person, night arousal&#xD;
             after apneic episodes, reduced exercise capacity, and daytime sleepiness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is expected to be able to tolerate the procedure and remain clinically stable&#xD;
             for the duration of the study (e.g. the subject is able to lie down long enough to&#xD;
             insert the lead(s) without shortness of breath and the subject is able to tolerate&#xD;
             instrumentation during study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or their legal representative is willing and able to sign an IRB/MEC approved&#xD;
