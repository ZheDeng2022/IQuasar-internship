      Objective Depression can present a significant threat to long-duration space missions, and&#xD;
      crews need the ability to recognize it and treat it effectively. We are developing a&#xD;
      prototype computer-based system that includes a module for the recognition and treatment of&#xD;
      depression. Before being used by astronauts, this system needs to be further developed and&#xD;
      tested for efficacy in an analog population. The countermeasure we are developing is intended&#xD;
      for use both in pre-flight training and on the International Space Station. The program has&#xD;
      substantial Earth benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete development of the module for recognizing and preventing depression. We will&#xD;
           complete this module, moving from the prototype stage to a completed computer-based&#xD;
           tool. We will modify the design based on data from our usability and acceptability study&#xD;
           with astronauts at NASA Johnson Space Center. We will pilot-test the module with five&#xD;
           participants and make revisions based on their input.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop the module for implementing computer-based Problem-Solving Treatment (PST).&#xD;
           Currently, problem-solving treatment is done using a practitioner who guides the patient&#xD;
           through this structured therapy and follows their progress. These practitioners are&#xD;
           trained to administer the therapy through a formalized training program that&#xD;
           incorporates a workbook and instructional videos. These materials are well suited for&#xD;
           presentation via multimedia on computers to make the treatment self-guided. The PST&#xD;
           intervention will be modified from its current video/workbook form to a computer-based&#xD;
           form that can be used by astronauts or other professionals who are suffering from&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the efficacy of the computer-delivered PST module for depression in a&#xD;
           randomized, controlled trial. Hypotheses related to this aim are that, compared to a&#xD;
           waiting-list control:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals receiving computer-delivered PST will show a greater reduction in&#xD;
                depression symptoms, as rated by a clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals receiving computer-delivered PST will show a greater reduction in&#xD;
                depression, as rated by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A greater proportion of individuals receiving computer-delivered PST will have&#xD;
                remitted at post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earth-based Applications of Research Project Depression is widespread, and effective&#xD;
      treatments are not available to all persons who have it. This computer-based depression&#xD;
      treatment, with simple modifications and revisions, could be adapted for use in other&#xD;
      isolated, operational environments, such as polar research stations, submarines, commercial&#xD;
      ships, oil rigs and underwater research facilities. Furthermore, even greater value could be&#xD;
      derived by making similar psychosocial support systems available to the public in settings&#xD;
      such as primary care practices, public and mental health centers, schools, social services&#xD;
      offices, places of worship, military bases, prisons, and eventually at home or in any&#xD;
      location, through broadband Internet.&#xD;
