      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      When learning to tap to a rhythm the brain has to coordinate information from different&#xD;
      senses (eyes, ears, touch). This information has to be integrated into a movement plan to&#xD;
      allow a smooth, continuous performance. Two brain areas that are of particular interest for&#xD;
      this task are the posterior parietal cortex that integrates sensory and motor information and&#xD;
      the primary motor cortex that sends out the movement commands to the muscles. These areas&#xD;
      communicate via nerve connections with each other. The goal of this research proposal is to&#xD;
      examine if the strength of the connection between those areas can be changed by practicing a&#xD;
      simple tapping task and if the change in connection strength depends on if the rhythms were&#xD;
      shown by visual or auditory stimuli. Additionally we will investigate how the ability to tap&#xD;
      rhythms relates to other cognitive abilities like problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 20 adult healthy volunteers on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three experimental sessions we propose to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
      electro encephalography (EEG) to examine the role of the posterior parietal cortex in motor&#xD;
      learning. In session 1 a neurological examination will be performed and a clinical and&#xD;
      anatomical MRI (Magnet Resonance Image) will be taken. Session 1 can be skipped if an MRI and&#xD;
      a neurological exam have been performed at the NIH during the last year. In session 2 TMS&#xD;
      will be used to examine the connection between posterior parietal cortex and primary motor&#xD;
      cortex before and after rhythm training. Additionally, EEG will be recorded during the&#xD;
      training session. In session 3 we will examine how the ability to tap to different beats&#xD;
      relates to higher cognitive functions. We will record EEG during tapping simple beats and we&#xD;
      will administer a pen and paper problem-solving test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In session 2 the primary outcome measure will be change in conditioned Motor Evoked Potential&#xD;
      (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitude after learning temporal motor sequences measured in the primary&#xD;
      motor cortex. A secondary outcome measure will be the interregional coherence changes as&#xD;
      measured by EEG during training. In session 3 the primary outcome will be performance on the&#xD;
      tapping task and on the pen and paper test as well as the interregional coherence changes as&#xD;
      measured by EEG during the tapping task.&#xD;
