    <textblock>
      Lynch syndrome (LS), or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is a hereditary&#xD;
      disorder predisposing for colorectal cancer. To reduce the risk of colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      patients undergo colonoscopy every 1-2 years. Chromoendoscopy is relatively new technique&#xD;
      which improves the detection of adenomas, the precursor lesions of colorectal cancer. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether chromoendoscopy, including polypectomy of all detected&#xD;
      lesions, reduces the development of colorectal neoplasia and the need for colectomy in LS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lynch syndrome (LS), or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is an autosomally&#xD;
      dominantly inherited disorder that accounts for 1-2 % of colorectal cancer cases. LS is&#xD;
      caused by germline genomic alterations in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes hMLH1,&#xD;
      hMSH2, hMSH6 and hPMS2. The lifetime incidence of colorectal cancer is 20-75 % in these&#xD;
      mutation carriers. Individuals with LS-associated colorectal cancer differ from those with&#xD;
      sporadic disease in several ways: the tumours are diagnosed at an earlier age; the majority&#xD;
      of tumours is located in the proximal colon; there is an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      synchronous or metachronous colorectal cancers and the prognosis relatively favourable&#xD;
      compared to sporadic cases. It is generally accepted that LS associated colorectal cancers&#xD;
      develop along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence as in sporadic cases. There is evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence is accelerated in LS patients as compared to&#xD;
      the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopic screening and subsequent removal of polyps at a 3-year interval in asymptomatic&#xD;
      at-risk members of LS families has shown to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      improve overall survival. However, within such an interval in surveillance programs, interval&#xD;
      cancers have been observed. It is therefore currently recommended that MMR gene mutation&#xD;
      carriers should be kept under surveillance by regular colonoscopy every 1-2 years beginning&#xD;
      at the age of 20-25 or 5-10 years younger than the earliest affected family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LS adenomas are predominantly located in the proximal colon and frequently carry villous&#xD;
      architecture and high-grade dysplasia, markers that are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing colorectal cancer. Even in LS adenomas smaller than 5-7 mm in size, high-grade&#xD;
      dysplasia can be encountered. Therefore, the identification of high-risk precursor lesions in&#xD;
      LS is considered of paramount importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that conventional colonoscopy has a certain miss rate for colorectal neoplasms,&#xD;
      especially small adenomas. A few years ago, the technique of chromoendoscopy was introduced.&#xD;
      Chromoendoscopy, in which one of various dyes are sprayed onto the colonic mucosa via a spray&#xD;
      catheter passed through the working channel of the endoscope, offers detailed evaluation of&#xD;
      the mucosal surface. Indigo carmine is a contrast stain that is not absorbed and does not&#xD;
      react with the surface mucosa. In 2 large randomised controlled trials chromoendoscopy&#xD;
      significantly increased the detection of small adenomas in the proximal colon as compared to&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy. Recently, 2 trials in LS patients revealed that chromoscopic&#xD;
      endoscopy improved the detection of adenomas, particularly flat lesions, compared to&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy. Together, these data suggest that chromoendoscopy may improve&#xD;
      detection rates of significant neoplastic colonic lesions in LS patients. However, the true&#xD;
      value of chromoendoscopy in the management of LS patients remains to be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine whether chromoendoscopy, including polypectomy of all&#xD;
      detected lesions, reduces the development of colorectal neoplasia and the need for colectomy&#xD;
      in LS patients at follow-up endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will indicate the value of chromoendoscopy in the management of LS&#xD;
      patients and whether the technique should be implemented in current surveillance procedures.&#xD;
