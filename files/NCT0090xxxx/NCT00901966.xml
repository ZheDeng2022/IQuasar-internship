      This K07 Career Development Award application is designed to expand Dr. Dennis career&#xD;
      development from cancer etiology to cancer prevention and control. The career development&#xD;
      plan rests on mentoring directed by experts in cancer prevention research and protected time&#xD;
      to foster my professional development as an independent cancer control researcher. A unique&#xD;
      population, the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, will be used to examine sun exposure,&#xD;
      sun protection behavior, and factors affecting these behaviors regarding the risk of melanoma&#xD;
      in private pesticide applicators (farmers) and their spouses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research plan proposed to examine skin melanoma within this prospective cohort of private&#xD;
      applicators (mostly farmers) and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina (the AHS) in&#xD;
      association with environmental factors. Specific aim 1 examined the risk of melanoma in the&#xD;
      AHS cohort using various existing measures of sun exposure adjusted for skin sensitivity and&#xD;
      sun protection. Subsequently (for aim 2) qualitative research methods were used to design&#xD;
      appropriate measures of sun exposure, sun protection behavior, and factors affecting these&#xD;
      behaviors in private applicators and their spouses within the AHS based on the cohort&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now Aim 3 will be completed by conducting a nested case-control study of melanoma within the&#xD;
      AHS cohort to examine in more detail sun exposure histories and protective behavior. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was designed based on findings from the cohort analyses (aim 1) and qualitative&#xD;
      methods (aim 2). The risk of melanoma will be examined regarding: a) the complex relationship&#xD;
      of cumulative (sun exposure during each decade of life) and intermittent sun exposure&#xD;
      (sunburns and sunny vacations), b) factors affecting behavior including attitudes about sun&#xD;
      exposure and prevention, and c) the use of tanning salons and sunless tanning creams,&#xD;
      particularly in spouses (expected to be rare overall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final aim is to use the results from the cohort and nested case-control studies to design&#xD;
      a behavioral intervention, along with short computer automated telephone interview (CATI)&#xD;
      that can be used in the whole AHS cohort or other farming populations. Funding for such&#xD;
      studies will be sought through the R01) mechanism as an independent cancer control&#xD;
      researcher. The behavioral intervention will be based on those factors that are the strongest&#xD;
      risk factors for melanoma, highly prevalent, and easily modifiable. The behavioral&#xD;
      intervention will be designed based on knowledge and skill gained from the Career Development&#xD;
      Plan goals.&#xD;
