      This study will create a registry of patients with pacemakers and implantable ICDs who will&#xD;
      undergo clinically indicated MRI and will document the incidence of any adverse events or&#xD;
      changes in device parameters that might be associated with the procedure.&#xD;

      The MagnaSafe Registry is an investigator initiated study designed to determine the risks of&#xD;
      performing MRI for patients with pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators&#xD;
      (ICDs). We hope that the results of the registry will provide physicians the risk-assessment&#xD;
      data needed to assess the use of MRI as a diagnostic tool when no alternative diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging technology is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients living with permanent pacemakers or ICD devices in the United States&#xD;
      is increasing dramatically as a result of expanded indications. Between 1990 and 2005, an&#xD;
      estimated 2.8 million pacemakers and 690,000 ICDs were implanted in the United States. The&#xD;
      number of implanted devices continues to increase without an apparent plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of many diseases of&#xD;
      the brain, spinal cord, and musculoskeletal system. For some disease states, no acceptable&#xD;
      alternative diagnostic imaging method is available. As the number of implanted cardiac&#xD;
      devices is increasing, the clinical indications for MRI are expanding as well. Marketing&#xD;
      research estimates that approximately 27.5 million MRI procedures were completed in 2007 (The&#xD;
      Medical Information Division of IMV, LTD). It is predicted that there is a 50-75% probability&#xD;
      that a patient with a pacemaker or ICD will have the need for an MRI over the lifetime of the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most physicians consider the presence of a pacemaker or ICD to be an absolute&#xD;
      contraindication to an MRI study. Patients are denied the examination, even when MR is&#xD;
      clearly the superior diagnostic modality or when there is no acceptable alternative imaging&#xD;
      test available. To provide optimal care to the increasing number of patients with an&#xD;
      implanted cardiac device, health care professionals must have the capability to perform MR&#xD;
      imaging with minimal risk and full knowledge of the possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will create a registry of patients with pacemakers and ICDs who will&#xD;
      undergo clinically indicated MRI and will document any adverse event or change in device&#xD;
      parameters that may be associated with the imaging procedure. The results of this registry&#xD;
      will provide the medical community with an accurate documentation of risk to patients and&#xD;
      will establish a protocol of patient screening and device reprogramming for the purpose of&#xD;
      maximizing the safe performance of MRI as a diagnostic tool in patients with implantable&#xD;
      cardiac devices when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a physician-initiated study that will be coordinated by Scripps Clinic, Green&#xD;
      Hospital. It is being performed under an IDE from the FDA. Funding for the MagnaSafe Registry&#xD;
      comes from multiple sources including competitive grants, institutional grants, foundation&#xD;
      fellowship support, unrestricted educational grants from industry, and philanthropy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital, La Jolla, CA, has performed more than 125 MRIs on patients&#xD;
      with implanted cardiac devices. Results of retrospective clinical observations at Scripps&#xD;
      Clinic were presented at the American Heart Association 2008 Scientific and American College&#xD;
      of Cardiology 2009 Scientific Sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 35 sites will be recruited to participate in the registry. The registry uses a protocol&#xD;
      designed to minimize potential risk to the patient and device. MRI compatible equipment will&#xD;
      be required to monitor vital signs (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximeter,&#xD;
      and single lead cardiac rhythm monitor) while performing scans on patients with implanted&#xD;
      devices. Recommendations from the American Heart Association for performance of MR&#xD;
      examination in patients with pacemakers or ICDs will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI procedures will be conducted for clinical purposes at the discretion of the ordering&#xD;
      physician. MR examination of patients with permanent implanted cardiac devices will only be&#xD;
      performed if there are highly compelling circumstances and when the benefits clearly outweigh&#xD;
      the risks in the opinion of the ordering physician. The decision to have an MRI must be based&#xD;
      on clinical indication, and is not part of the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those wishing to participate in the registry as an investigational site will be required to&#xD;
      obtain approval of the FDA-authorized protocol from their reviewing IRB, and complete a&#xD;
      written investigator agreement.&#xD;
