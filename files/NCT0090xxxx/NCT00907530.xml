    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted as a phase IV, double-blind, multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      crossover trial aimed at a within-subject comparison of MULTIHANCE and GADOVIST at a dose of&#xD;
      0.1 mmol/kg, in terms of qualitative and quantitative assessment of unenhanced MRI (UE MRI)&#xD;
      and contrast-enhanced MRI (CE MRI) for the visualization of brain disease.&#xD;
