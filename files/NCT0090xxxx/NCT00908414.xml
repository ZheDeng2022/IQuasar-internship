      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (i.e., the levels of TMC589337 and TMC589354 circulating in your blood over&#xD;
      time) of increasing single oral doses of TMC589337 and TMC589354 and of multiple increasing&#xD;
      oral doses followed by a single dose of TMC310911 to assess the potential boosting effect on&#xD;
      the latter compound. In this study 3 investigational new drugs are involved. These new&#xD;
      investigational drugs called TMC589337 and TMC589354 (from the PEPI family) and TMC310911 are&#xD;
      in process of development for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Type 1 (HIV-1).&#xD;
      TMC589337 and TMC589354 are novel molecules with no antiviral activity to be used to enhance&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics profile of a drug. TMC310911 is a novel and potent compound and belongs&#xD;
      to a medication class called protease inhibitors (PI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a First-in-Human Phase I, double-blind (neither physician or patient knows the name&#xD;
      of the assigned study drug), randomized (study medication assigned by chance),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (a group of study participants who receive an inactive substance in place&#xD;
      of a medication) trial to examine the safety, tolerability, and plasma pharmacokinetics (pk)&#xD;
      after increasing single oral doses of TMC589337 and TMC589354, and in an open-label (both the&#xD;
      physician and study participant know the name of the assigned study drug) part after&#xD;
      different repeated oral doses in combination with a single oral dose of TMC310911 to assess&#xD;
      the potential pharmacokinetic enhancement on the latter compound. TMC589337 and TMC589354 are&#xD;
      molecules to be used to enhance the pharmacokinetics profile of a drug, e.g., a Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus-Type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PI). TMC310911 is an&#xD;
      investigational PI, currently studied in healthy volunteers. The trial consists of 2 parts: a&#xD;
      single dose escalation part (double-blind, placebo-controlled) and a multiple dosing part&#xD;
      (open label) for both PEPI-compounds: TMC589337 and TMC589354. The single dose escalation&#xD;
      part of the trial will include 2 panels of 8 healthy adult volunteers each (Panel 1 and 2).&#xD;
      Each panel will have 4 oral escalating single dose sessions of either TMC589337 (Panel 1) or&#xD;
      TMC589354 (Panel 2). Healthy volunteers will receive doses of 40 mg (Session Ia), 100 mg&#xD;
      (Session IIa), 200 mg (Session IIIa) and 400 mg (Session IVa) of TMC589337 or placebo. Panel&#xD;
      2 will receive doses of 40 mg (Session Ib), 100 mg (Session IIb), 200 mg (Session IIIb) and&#xD;
      400 mg (Session IVb) of TMC589354 or placebo. Both panels can run in parallel. In each&#xD;
      session, 6 healthy volunteers will receive active treatment and 2 healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      receive placebo with standard meals. Doses of 40 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg of TMC589337&#xD;
      or TMC589354 or placebo will be administered as a single oral administration. The treatment&#xD;
      schedule will be made in such a way that for both panels over 4 sessions each healthy&#xD;
      volunteer will receive active treatment 3 times and placebo once. A washout period (a period&#xD;
      where no treatment will be taken in view of having all the medication eliminated from the&#xD;
      body before starting a new treatment) of at least 10 days will be respected between&#xD;
      consecutive TMC589337, TMC589354 or placebo dosing within each panel. Each single dosing&#xD;
      session will have a staggered approach meaning that first 4 healthy volunteers will be dosed&#xD;
      and 48 hours later the next 4 healthy volunteers will be dosed. Multiple dosing will be&#xD;
      started when the 200 mg sessions of TMC589337 and/or TMC589354 are found to be generally safe&#xD;
      and well tolerated as decided by the Investigator and the Sponsor and approved as such by the&#xD;
      local ethics committee. Multiple dosing of TMC589337 and/or TMC589354 will not be started if&#xD;
      the plasma pk profile is not supportive to evaluate repeated dosing. The multiple dose part&#xD;
      of the trial is open-label and will include 5 panels of 6 healthy adult volunteers each&#xD;
      (Panels 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). Each panel will have 1 session in which TMC589337 or TMC589354&#xD;
      will be administered. Treatment is anticipated to be a twice daily regimen, and different&#xD;
      dose regimens will be tested. Final doses will be determined according to the results&#xD;
      obtained from the single dose sessions but will not be higher than a total daily dose of 400&#xD;
      mg. If multiple dosing is found to be generally safe and well tolerated in Panel 3 and 4,&#xD;
      doses for Panels 5-7 can be determined. Both Panels 3 and 4, and Panels 5 and 6 can run in&#xD;
      parallel. In Panel 7, 1 compound, either TMC589337 or TMC589354, will be selected for a twice&#xD;
      daily or once daily regimen for 7 days. In addition, the healthy volunteers of Panels 3, 4, 5&#xD;
      and 6 will receive a single oral dose of 300 mg of TMC310911 on Day 7 of these sessions to&#xD;
      assess the enhancing effect of repeated administration of TMC589337 and TMC589354 on the pk&#xD;
      profile of a single dose of TMC310911. Healthy volunteers of Panel 7 will receive either a&#xD;
      300 mg dose of TMC310911 or a dose of 600 mg TMC310911 at the same conditions. Study&#xD;
      medication will be given under fed conditions in Panels 3-6, and under fed or fasted&#xD;
      conditions (depending on the findings of previous sessions) in Panel 7. After a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 14 days healthy volunteers of Panels 3 to 7 will have an additional&#xD;
      session in which a single oral dose of 300 mg (or 600 mg for Panel 7 only) of TMC310911 alone&#xD;
      will be administered (Sessions VIIIa, VIIIb, IXa, IXb and X). Full pk profiles of TMC589337&#xD;
      and TMC589354 will be determined up to 72 hours after single dosing and after the morning&#xD;
      dosing of Day 7 (multiple dosing), and over 12 hours (or over 24 hours for Panel 7 when given&#xD;
      once daily.) after the morning dose on Days 1 and 6 of the multiple dosing sessions. Full pk&#xD;
      profiles of TMC310911 will be determined over 24 hours when given alone and on Day 7 of the&#xD;
      TMC589337 and TMC589354 multiple dosing sessions. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated&#xD;
      continuously and documented (safety report) before stepping up to the next dose. Dose&#xD;
      escalation in the single and multiple ascending dose regimens will continue only if the&#xD;
      previous dose was found safe and generally well tolerated by the Investigator and the Sponsor&#xD;
      and approved as such by the ethics committee. Actual doses may be adapted pending on the&#xD;
      outcome of the previous sessions. The expected duration of the study (excluding screening) is&#xD;
      at least 8 weeks. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be recorded at regular intervals&#xD;
      throughout the trial period. Illnesses and side effects will be monitored continuously. Blood&#xD;
      and urine samples will be taken at screening, in Panel 1 and 2 on Day 1, 2 and 4 of sessions&#xD;
      I to IV, in Panel 3 to 7 on Day 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10 of session V, VI and VII, on Day 1 and 2&#xD;
      of session VIII, IX and X and at the 2 follow-up visits 10 to 14 days and 30 to 32 days after&#xD;
      last drug intake. Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be taken and vital signs (blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate) will be measured at screening, in Panel 1 and 2 at each session day ( on Day -1&#xD;
      only ECGs), in Panel 3 to 7 at Day -1 (only ECG), Day 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10 in session V, VI&#xD;
      and VII and on Day 1 and 2 of session VIII, IX and X and at the 2 follow-up visits. Physical&#xD;
      examination will be done at screening, on Day 4 of each session in Panel 1 and 2, on Day 6&#xD;
      and 10 of session V, VI and VII, on Day -1 and 2 of session VIII, IX and X and at the 2&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Continuous ECG data will be obtained during the first 8 hours after intake&#xD;
      of study medication in the single dose escalation part of the study.&#xD;
      TMC589337,TMC589354,TMC310911 and placebo are formulated as oral drinkable solutions. Panel&#xD;
      1-2 consist of single dose of TMC589337 or TMC589354 and placebo from 40-400mg (2ml to 5ml)&#xD;
      on Day 1 of each session. Panel 3-7 consist of TMC589337,TMC589354 or placebo twice daily (or&#xD;
      once daily in Panel 7), from Day 1 to Day 7 with maximum daily dose of 400mg (5ml) plus a&#xD;
      single morning intake of 300mg (12ml) (or 600mg for Panel 7 only) TMC310911 on Day 7 and on&#xD;
      Day 1 in 2nd session.&#xD;
