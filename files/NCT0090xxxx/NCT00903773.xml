  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of severe renal impairment or failure&#xD;
      on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (TVR). Pharmacokinetics means how the drug&#xD;
      is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and unbound plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of the sum of TVR and its R-diastereomer VRT-127394 will be assessed.&#xD;
      (Diastereomers are substances whose chemical structures are mirror images of each other).&#xD;
      Finally, the short-term safety and tolerability of TVR in participants with severe kidney&#xD;
      disease will be determined. The results of this study will guide dose recommendations for TVR&#xD;
      in subjects with kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label trial to investigate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      telaprevir (TVR) in 12 participants with severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine&#xD;
      clearance (CrCl) &lt; 30 mL/min) as compared to 12 participants with normal renal function,&#xD;
      matched for sex, race, age (± 10 years) and BMI (± 20%). Open-label means that the study&#xD;
      doctor and the participants know what treatment will be assigned to them. All participants&#xD;
      will receive a single 750-mg dose of TVR. Pharmacokinetic profiles of total TVR up to 24&#xD;
      hours postdose will be determined. A 24 hour urine collection test will be performed to&#xD;
      estimate the CrCl. In addition, the effect of severe renal impairment on the total and&#xD;
      unbound plasma concentrations of the sum of TVR and VRT-127394 will be assessed. Tolerability&#xD;
      and safety of TVR will be assessed throughout the trial period. Illnesses and side effects&#xD;
      will be checked at every visit. Blood and urine samples will be taken at screening, on Day 1,&#xD;
      2 and at the 2 follow-up visits. ECG and vital signs will be taken at screening, twice on day&#xD;
      1, on day 2 and at the first follow-up visit. At the second follow-up visit vital signs alone&#xD;
      will be determined. A physical examination will be done at screening, on the day before TVR&#xD;
      intake, on day 2 and at both follow-up visits. All participants will receive a single 750-mg&#xD;
      dose of telaprevir (TVR) given by mouth as 2 tablets of 375 mg.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males are allowed and females of childbearing potential if adequate contraception is&#xD;
             used. Females of non-childbearing potential should be amenorrheal for at least 2&#xD;
             years, or have undergone tubal ligation (or other permanent birth control methods), or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For participants with severe renal impairment: consistent with the disease process of&#xD;
             chronic renal failure and associated symptoms, otherwise judged to be in good health&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator on the basis of a medical evaluation (including a&#xD;
             physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and&#xD;
             screening laboratory tests), with any concomitant medical conditions under stable&#xD;
