  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LBH589 is a drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking certain enzymes. LBH589 has shown effects against cancer in laboratory studies and&#xD;
      in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this medicine will show the same&#xD;
      activity in humans. As of May 2006, approximately 100 patients have received treatment with&#xD;
      either an intravenous or capsule form of LBH589. Only the capsule form of LBH589 will be used&#xD;
      in this study. In addition, information from other research studies and laboratory studies&#xD;
      suggests that this study drug may help to treat lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal during the Phase I portion of this research study is to find out the highest&#xD;
      and safest dose of LBH589 that can be given in combination with pemetrexed in subjects with&#xD;
      lung cancer without causing severe side effects. The main goal of the Phase II portion of&#xD;
      this study is to find how the patient's lung cancer responds to the LBH589 in combination&#xD;
      with pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate how the patient's body processes the combination of LBH589&#xD;
      and pemetrexed. To determine this, the investigators will measure the amount of study drug in&#xD;
      the patient's blood. This will be done with a series of blood tests, called pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) tests. Other purposes of this study will be to determine the side effects of LBH589 in&#xD;
      combination with pemetrexed and whether or not this combination is effective in treating your&#xD;
      type of cancer.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LBH589 given on a three times weekly schedule&#xD;
           when combined with pemetrexed for the treatment of patients with advanced thoracic&#xD;
           malignancies, except squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (phase I part).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the overall response rate and non-progression rate (clinical benefit rate)&#xD;
           and progression-free survival of the combination of LBH589 and pemetrexed in patients&#xD;
           with previously-treated advanced NSCLC (phase II part).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects of LBH589 and pemetrexed on levels of histone&#xD;
           deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as on levels&#xD;
           of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify biomarkers in baseline, archival tumor tissue that may correlate with&#xD;
           antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population Phase I: We will enroll patients treated with any number of prior regimen&#xD;
      and all thoracic malignancies, except squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: We will enroll patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC who have received 1&#xD;
      prior chemotherapy regimen (1 additional regimen in the setting of initial curative treatment&#xD;
      is allowed if completed &gt;1 year earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV, day 1, every 21 days, on the first day of the week LBH589 is&#xD;
           given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LBH589 three-times-a-week (doses will be at least 2 days apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday,&#xD;
           Friday), until disease progression or intolerable toxicities LBH589 will start the week&#xD;
           prior to the first pemetrexed cycle and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies will be performed&#xD;
           (week -1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II study. Phase I: 9-18 patients (estimated); Phase II: 17-41 patients&#xD;
      (estimated).&#xD;
