      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidemiological part: characteristics of low back pain patients from a forestry company&#xD;
           in Finland. Data is collected from occupational health databases and self administered&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of several different&#xD;
           interventions in subacute low back pain (LBP) patients in occupational health (OH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects were divided into two randomised controlled trials with the name of &quot;mild&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;moderate&quot; low back pain trials (interventions) and also mild vs natural course (NC) and&#xD;
      moderate vs. NC interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, disability and quality of life were collected up to 2 years by self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires and sickness absences were gathered from electronical records for at least 4&#xD;
      year's follow up time.&#xD;

    <description>An intensive, multidisciplinary LBP rehabilitation program was carried out in a physical medicine out-patient unit at the local Central Hospital. The program included a 3-week pre-course of 1,5 hour session at 3 days per week, closely followed by a 3-week intensive rehabilitation course of 6.5 hours per day for 5 days per week. A personal graded activity training program was made for each subject and patients were later called for follow-up visit within 1 year of the initial course. Arm is included in the MOderate and Moderate vs. NC interventions.</description>
