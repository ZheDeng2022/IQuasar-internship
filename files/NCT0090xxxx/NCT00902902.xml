      The aims of this study were divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for the diagnosis of hepatitis B&#xD;
           related HCC. Established the standard of GP73 in normal people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To definitude the connections between the GP73 level and various diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To find the relations of HCC metastasis and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collectivity type: Prospectiveï¼Œrandomized, controlled, multi-central clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients: The subjects were from different hospitals including: Peking Union Medical&#xD;
           College Hospital (PUMCH), The Cancer Hospital of Peking Union Medical College (PUMC),&#xD;
           QiDong Cancer Institute, and Department of Surgery University of Chicago from November&#xD;
           of 2007 till the end of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arrangement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was consisted of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Established the standard of normal people and test the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
           HCC patients. The samples were acquired from Health Screen Center and Department of&#xD;
           liver surgery of PUMCH, The Cancer Hospital of PUMC and QiDong Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Extend the study bound, including the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus&#xD;
           (HCV) carriers. The HBV (+) samples were come from Chinese hospitals and institutions.&#xD;
           The HCV (+) samples were provide by the Department of Surgery University of Chicago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research the relations of serum GP73 level and the other diseases, such as other&#xD;
           malignant liver tumors, liver metastatic tumors, liver benign tumor, HCC recurrence&#xD;
           following surgery etc.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A group of patients with no history of liver disease, alcohol consumption less than&#xD;
             40g a week, and no risk factors for viral hepatitis were enrolled from the General&#xD;
             Internal Medicine clinics. All subjects in this control group were documented to have&#xD;
             normal liver biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consecutive patients with HCC and patients with HBV &amp; HCV that were age, gender, and&#xD;
             race/ethnicity matched to the HCC patients were enrolled from the Liver Clinic during&#xD;
             this period. The diagnosis of HCC was made by histopathology, and if histopathology&#xD;
             was not available by two imaging modalities (ultrasound [US], magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging [MRI], or computed tomography) showing a vascular enhancing mass &gt;2cm. HBV&#xD;
             infection status was based on hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HCV infection&#xD;
             status was based on serum HCV antibody and HCV-RNA positive.&#xD;
