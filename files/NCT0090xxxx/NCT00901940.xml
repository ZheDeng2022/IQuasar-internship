      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the immune response to two vaccines&#xD;
      against 4 related bacteria: meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. These bacteria can&#xD;
      cause meningitis and /or septicaemia (blood poisoning). The two vaccines are a&#xD;
      protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (MenACWY)and a meningococcal plain polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccine(MenACWY PS). Both vaccines are licensed and are currently used for travellers to&#xD;
      areas with a high incidence of invasive meningococcal disease. However, plain polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccines are known to be poorly immunogenic in children and they do not stimulate&#xD;
      immunological memory, apart from the serogroup A component. In contrast, a&#xD;
      protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y&#xD;
      has been found to be immunogenic in infants and to be able to induce immunological memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a single centre, open-label, randomised, controlled study in 150&#xD;
      healthy adults aged 18-70 years. The participants will be given either 2 injections of the&#xD;
      meningococcal protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine one month apart, or one injection of&#xD;
      the meningococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine followed one month later with an injection of&#xD;
      the meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Blood samples will be collected before immunisation and&#xD;
      at several time points following immunisations to evaluate the level of meningococcal&#xD;
      specific antibody induced by two different vaccination regimes. The data derived from the&#xD;
      study will be relevant in determining which of these vaccines should be used in preference in&#xD;
      travellers who are receiving immunisation against meningococcal disease before travelling to&#xD;
      high risk areas. Additionally, a number of scientific questions regarding the nature of the&#xD;
      immune response to the two vaccines (specifically looking at the white blood cells&#xD;
      responsible for producing antibodies, known as B cells) and the role of genetic variations in&#xD;
      influencing the vaccine recipient's immune response will be addressed in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this single centre, open-label, randomised, controlled study of 150 healthy adults aged&#xD;
      18-70 years we will be evaluating the immune response to immunisation with 2 different&#xD;
      vaccines against 4 related bacteria known as Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135&#xD;
      and Y. These bacteria (also known as meningococci) can produce meningitis and septicaemia&#xD;
      (blood poisoning). The first vaccine, which has been used as a travel vaccine in the UK for&#xD;
      several years, is known as the MenACWY plain polysaccharide (MenACWY PS). The other vaccine,&#xD;
      known as the MenACWY conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) was licensed in the UK in March 2010 and is&#xD;
      now recommended as a travel vaccine by the Department of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the immune response to these vaccines we will be measuring not only the&#xD;
      blood levels of antibodies specific to serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y meningococci, but also the&#xD;
      population of white blood cells known as B cells which produce these antibodies. Two forms of&#xD;
      these B cells will be measured, the plasma cells (which actively produce antibodies) and&#xD;
      memory B cells (which do not produce antibodies but persist in the body and can be stimulated&#xD;
      to turn into plasma cells when required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised into group I or group II on a 1:1 basis to receive either&#xD;
      MenACWY or MenACWY PS. One month later, all participants will receive a booster dose of the&#xD;
      MenACWY conjugate vaccine. The ACWY polysaccharide vaccine will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously, and the MenACWY conjugate vaccine will be given intramuscularly. Each&#xD;
      participant will be observed for at least 15 minutes after vaccination for any immediate&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected from each participant for analysis prior to each&#xD;
      immunisation, 7 days following the first immunisation and 7 and 28 days following the second&#xD;
      immunisation. The volume of blood samples obtained at each timepoint will be 20 mLs. Blood&#xD;
      will be used for antibody analysis (by ELISA), B cell analysis (by ELISpot)and DNA extraction&#xD;
      for genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, participants enrolled in this study will have a total of 5 visits in a period of&#xD;
      2 months. They will receive two doses of the MenACWY conjugate vaccine or one dose of the&#xD;
      ACWY polysaccharide vaccine followed by one dose of the MenACWY conjugate vaccine. During&#xD;
      this period they will have a total of 5 blood samples taken (5x20mL= 100 mL of blood taken in&#xD;
      a 2 month period).&#xD;
