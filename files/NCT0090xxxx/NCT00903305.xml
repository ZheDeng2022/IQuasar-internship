      RATIONALE: Meeting with a nurse to assess symptoms and quality of life may be more effective&#xD;
      than standard care in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying nurse-provided care to see how well it works&#xD;
      compared with standard care in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of an advanced practice nurse, standardized nursing intervention&#xD;
           protocol (SNIP) model vs usual care on overall quality of life and psychological&#xD;
           distress of patients with stage I-III breast cancer, from initial treatment to 6 months&#xD;
           post diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare symptom control in these two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare geriatric assessment outcomes in these two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the effects of the SNIP intervention as compared to the usual care group on&#xD;
           resource use by these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the effects of SNIP on patients' and clinicians' satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effects of SNIP on patients' management of transitions from one phase of&#xD;
           chronic illness to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify subgroups of these patients who benefit most from the SNIP in relation to&#xD;
           sociodemographic characteristics, disease/treatment factors, and geriatric assessment&#xD;
           predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain feedback from clinicians regarding interpretation of findings and application&#xD;
           to the routine care of breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled sequentially to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 is enrolled during&#xD;
      months 4-21 and group 2 is enrolled during months 25-54.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (usual care): Patient questionnaires are administered at baseline and at 3 and 6&#xD;
           months. The clinicians' satisfaction with care is also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (advanced practice nurse [APN] intervention): Patients are accrued by an APN.&#xD;
           Patients meet with the APN periodically to assess their physical well-being including&#xD;
           ambulatory care needed, care of physical symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting), and psychological well-being. Questionnaires are administered at baseline and&#xD;
           at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, questionnaires include the FACT-Breast, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale,&#xD;
      Psychological Distress Thermometer, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, and Patient&#xD;
      Satisfaction with Intervention. Clinicians also complete questionnaires. Patients' medical&#xD;
      charts are also reviewed.&#xD;
