  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes have dysfunction of the lining of the arteries which lead to impaired&#xD;
      circulation in the small blood vessels. This is thought to be secondary to reduced chemicals&#xD;
      in the blood viz: nitric oxide. This chemical is derived from an amino acid (protein)&#xD;
      L-arginine. Therefore, the researchers investigated whether giving patients L-arginine&#xD;
      (versus dummy powder) would improve the blood flow in the small blood vessels in the lower&#xD;
      limbs of patients with damage to their nerves (neuropathy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) with&#xD;
      a prevalence of around 30 - 45%. In addition, diabetic patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
      macrovascular disease, as well as other complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients will have developed peripheral neuropathy 10-20 years after the&#xD;
      onset of diabetes, which is an important cause of foot ulceration, Charcot joints, amputation&#xD;
      and increased morbidity and mortality. In view of this the cost to the National Health&#xD;
      Service in 1987 was a staggering £13.5 million. Therefore there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      prevention of diabetic neuropathy and its sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy is unclear, with both metabolic and vascular&#xD;
      factors having been implicated. Microvascular disease is possibly the initial event in the&#xD;
      development of diabetic complications. Microvascular disease may play an important role in&#xD;
      the causation and exacerbation of diabetic neuropathy. Histopathological studies have shown&#xD;
      thickening of vessel walls, hyperplasia of capillary endothelial cells and increased plugging&#xD;
      of vessels in neuropathic patients. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be an important&#xD;
      initiating factor for the development of these complications. Endothelial dysfunction is&#xD;
      thought to develop as a consequence of changes in nitric oxide and cell adhesion molecules in&#xD;
      the plasma of diabetic patients. L-arginine is an amino acid, which is the only source of NO&#xD;
      in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose to study the efficacy of arginine supplementation ( this is available&#xD;
      over the counter as a food supplement) on endothelial function and other biomarkers of&#xD;
      impaired endothelial function. We hope with this study to demonstrate that L-arginine&#xD;
      supplementation will enhance nitric oxide availability, thereby improve the microcirculation&#xD;
      and subsequently improve peripheral nerve function. We will use surrogate markers to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of L-arginine supplementation to show an improvement in diabetic complications&#xD;
      such as microalbuminuria in the urine, and TcPO2 in the skin of the lower limbs. In addition&#xD;
      microcirculation will be assessed using the Moor Laser Doppler flow machine and the&#xD;
      Radiometer TcPO2 device. Endothelial function will also be assessed indirectly by measuring&#xD;
      the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin and E-selectin. This will be performed&#xD;
      using standard ELISA techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients will be recruited for the study. Half will be randomised to taking the&#xD;
      food supplement L-arginine and half to placebo. At baseline all patient will have a clinical&#xD;
      assessment of their neuropathy status in the lower limb, blood pressure and BMI. Fasting&#xD;
      bloods for glucose, lipids profile, U&amp;E's, FBC, CRP, cell adhesion molecules and nitric oxide&#xD;
      will be done at baseline and three months later at the end of the study. The TcPO2 and&#xD;
      micro-circulation will be assessed at baseline and also at three month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the twenty patients that is randomised to L-arginine will be given a tin containing 1&#xD;
      kilogram of the food supplement L-arginine. They are to take a spoonful (three grams) of the&#xD;
      L-arginine and dissolve it in a glass of sugar free cold drink of their choice such as orange&#xD;
      or lemon squash. They are to take it before food three times a day. The twenty patient&#xD;
      randomised to placebo will receive a tin containing one kilogram of placebo and the&#xD;
      instruction is as for the L-arginine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will receive L-arginine powder (3G TDS) and 20 patients will receive placebo,&#xD;
      lactose powder (3G TDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination as part of routine care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BMI, BMI will be calculated by weight/height (kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lying and standing blood pressure will be measured twice, in the right arm using&#xD;
           Dinamap™ (Critikon, UK), after resting for 10 minutes. Hypertension will be defined&#xD;
           according to WHO criteria (systolic blood pressure (sBP) &gt;140 mm Hg and/or diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure (dBP) &gt;90 mm Hg or if the patient is on current antihypertensive&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overnight microalbumin excretion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neuropathic Disability Score and Vibration Perception threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TcPO2 of the right foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Micro-circulation of the right foot using Moore Laser Doppler iontophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood from an antecubital vein will be collected after an overnight fast and after resting&#xD;
      for fifteen minutes in the supine position for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. as part of routine care - FBC, U&amp;E's, fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin, fasting&#xD;
           lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. additional blood test - CRP, cell adhesion molecules, nitric oxide&#xD;
