      This trial will study a prime-boost vaccine approach designed mainly to induce cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune (CTL) responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two vaccine candidates will be used in two different prime-boost regimens: ADVAX (DNA) +&#xD;
      TBC-M4 (MVA) and TBC-M4 (MVA) alone. Both these vaccines have already been tested in humans&#xD;
      and both were found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. Approximately 32 volunteers (24&#xD;
      vaccine /8 placebo recipients) will be included in the study.&#xD;
