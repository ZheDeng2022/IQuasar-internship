    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively document the incidence of CM adverse reactions at&#xD;
      the time of ERCP and to determine whether various perceived risk factors are predictive of&#xD;
      adverse reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions to iodine containing contrast media (CM) have been described after&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) but have been difficult to study due&#xD;
      to their extremely low incidence. Adverse reactions can be classified by severity (mild,&#xD;
      moderate or severe) or underlying mechanism (idiosyncratic versus nonidiosyncratic).&#xD;
      Nonidiosyncratic reactions are related to the dose and osmolality of the CM; these are not&#xD;
      observed during ERCP due to the relative small amount of systemic absorption of CM.&#xD;
      Idiosyncratic reactions on the other hand are not dose-dependent and generally occur shortly&#xD;
      after administration of CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication with corticosteroids, H1/H2 -blockers and the use of low osmolality CM is&#xD;
      beneficial in preventing nonidiosyncratic reactions during intravascular administration.&#xD;
      However their role in during ERCP is unclear as CM is not injected into the intravascular&#xD;
      space. Currently there are no formal recommendations and clinical practice varies&#xD;
      considerably. The general purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of CM reactions&#xD;
      during ERCP and to determine whether various risk factors are predictive of idiosyncratic&#xD;
      reactions. Based on these results, we hope to develop guidelines for the use of prophylaxis&#xD;
      to prevent CM reactions in ERCP.&#xD;
