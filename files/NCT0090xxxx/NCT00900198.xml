      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients who are being evaluated and/or treated at the NIH Clinical Center (pediatric and&#xD;
      adult) and adult patients at participating sites will be entered onto this tissue procurement&#xD;
      protocol for collection of tissue specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain samples from adult and pediatric patients for research purposes from tests and&#xD;
           procedures that are done as required by the primary research protocol(s) to which a&#xD;
           patient is enrolled or as part of their standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain samples for research purposes from non-surgical procedures, such as&#xD;
           percutaneous biopsies, performed for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or&#xD;
           biological fluids for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adult patients (18 years of age and older) and pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of&#xD;
      age) who are being evaluated for and/or treated for cancer at the NIH Clinical Center and&#xD;
      adult patients from participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a multicenter tissue procurement protocol with NCI as the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For adult patients: specimens for research purposes, as outlined in this protocol, will&#xD;
           be obtained from tests and procedures that are done as required by the primary research&#xD;
           protocols to which a patient is enrolled or as part of their standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
           Non-surgical procedures, such as percutaneous biopsies, may also be performed for the&#xD;
           sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or biological fluids for this protocol.&#xD;
           Tissues and biological fluids to be procured may include but are not limited to blood,&#xD;
           serum, urine, tumor tissue, normal tissue, pleural fluid, CSF, saliva, bronchial&#xD;
           alveolar lavage (BAL), circulating tumor cells, hair follicles, and bone marrow. These&#xD;
           specimens will be stored with unique identifiers and used to perform only those research&#xD;
           studies that are outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For pediatric patients: tumor biopsy/resection tissue used for pediatric preclinical&#xD;
           model development will only be from tissue already being obtained as part of a procedure&#xD;
           necessary for the patient s clinical care or as part of a primary research protocol;&#xD;
           blood specimens will be collected as part of a blood collection already scheduled for&#xD;
           the patient s clinical care or as part of the planned pre-procedure bloodwork; volumes&#xD;
           collected will not exceed institutional research limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the risks associated with any invasive procedure, such as tumor biopsy, the&#xD;
           procedure will be discussed in detail with the patients and their parents/guardian (as&#xD;
           indicated), including the side effects, prior to obtaining a separate consent for each&#xD;
           procedure. A separate consent will not be signed prior to obtaining samples by minimally&#xD;
           invasive measures, such as venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study has three separate consent forms: one for adult patients at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center to opt to donate their samples for ongoing research on assay development and&#xD;
           studies of molecular pathways; and two for the generation of preclinical models (adult&#xD;
           and pediatric). Adult patients at the NIH and participating sites, and also pediatric&#xD;
           patients (NIH Clinical Center only), can opt to donate samples to create preclinical&#xD;
           models to study tumor biology and genetics, and to develop new therapies for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may remain on study for the duration of their consent or completion of the&#xD;
           planned procedure, whichever comes first.&#xD;
