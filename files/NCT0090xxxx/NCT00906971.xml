      1) INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic functional constipation (CFC) is a common problem in the pediatric population,&#xD;
      affecting approximately 25% of those seeking specialized medical care. The complaint is&#xD;
      multifactorial, involving environmental, psychological and physiological factors, which&#xD;
      interact with the brain-gut axis, but the retention of stools secondary to the pain-restraint&#xD;
      cycle, associated to the fear and anxiety of the resulting bowel movement, is important in&#xD;
      the development and management of CFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties involved in the management of CFC are common. Conventional treatment includes&#xD;
      educational measures, disimpaction, laxatives and an increased fiber intake. However, these&#xD;
      measures have not necessarily been beneficial for all cases, with a cure ratio of between 50&#xD;
      and 60%, and around one third of all patients become long-term sufferers of constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscles of the intestine contribute to atonic constipation - sluggish or flaccid muscles&#xD;
      in the bowel or rectum, or spasticity - increased muscle tone due to emotional stress. These&#xD;
      two factors are both present in patients with CFC. Bowel movement depends on the interlinked&#xD;
      functions of abdominal muscles, the pelvic floor and diaphragmatic breathing: contraction of&#xD;
      the diaphragm, abdominal distention resulting from the voluntary relaxation of the abdominal&#xD;
      wall and the pelvic floor lead to increased intra-abdominal and peristaltic pressure and&#xD;
      relaxation of the external anal sphincter (EAS), thus culminating in bowel movement. Added to&#xD;
      which, activity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system causes an increase in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility and relaxation of the sphincters. The superficial and deep&#xD;
      abdominal muscles, in addition to the diaphragm and muscles of the pelvic floor, form a&#xD;
      single muscle unit that assists regular bowel movement, and should all be worked together in&#xD;
      order to stimulate peristalsis. Therefore, a combination of exercises that stimulate and&#xD;
      relax the abdominal muscles, indirectly acting on the pelvic floor, coordinated with&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing, may trigger contraction of the intestinal and rectal muscles,&#xD;
      therefore bringing relief to patients with CFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary treatment can complement the conventional treatment of CFC. Physiotherapy&#xD;
      exercises for the abdominal muscles and diaphragm plus abdominal massage may reverse any&#xD;
      changes brought on by CFC. Retraining the intestinal functions is brought about due to two&#xD;
      main effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mechanical - stimulating colonic movements, improving coordination of the muscles&#xD;
           involved in bowel movement, thus encouraging fecal propulsion and increasing abdominal&#xD;
           muscle tone;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. neurological - parasympathetic stimulation increases muscle motility, while sympathetic&#xD;
           stimulation reduces anxiety, promoting relaxation and increasing endogenous serotonin,&#xD;
           thus reducing discomfort and increasing a sense of well-being. However, little evidence&#xD;
           of physiotherapy exercises applied to patients with CFC is available in the literature,&#xD;
           and randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of muscular training, abdominal massage&#xD;
      and diaphragmatic breathing in patients with CFC. The hypothesis is that exercises for&#xD;
      training abdominal muscles, a diaphragmatic breathing pattern and abdominal massage increase&#xD;
      the frequency of bowel movements and reduce episodes of fecal incontinence in patients with&#xD;
      CFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with two parallel groups. In the physiotherapy&#xD;
      group, physiotherapy exercises will be employed (isometric training of the abdominal muscles,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing exercises and abdominal massage) together with conventional treatment&#xD;
      (disimpaction, when necessary, a high-fiber diet, laxatives and toilet training). Patients in&#xD;
      the medication group will be only submitted to conventional treatment. Disimpaction will be&#xD;
      conducted with phosphate saline solution (once a day, from one to five days, according to&#xD;
      patient needs). During toilet training, the patient will be instructed to sit on the toilet&#xD;
      for at least five minutes, with support for the feet, after the three main meals of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will carried out in the Pediatric Unit at Hospital das Clínicas at Federal&#xD;
      University of Pernambuco (UFPE), which provides patients with tertiary health care. Children&#xD;
      and adolescents aged between 4 and 18 years take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion in the study, patients will be considered with CFC presented two or more of the&#xD;
      following parameters in the basal period, at least once a week, during the previous two-month&#xD;
      period, according to Rome III criteria: two or less bowel movements per week, at least one&#xD;
      episode of fecal incontinence per week, reports of retentive behavior, episodes of hard&#xD;
      stools or pain during bowel movements, presence of a large quantity of stool in the rectum&#xD;
      and large diameter stools, which could obstruct the toilet. Exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      patients who take medication that caused constipation, patients with organic causes and&#xD;
      children with cognitive problems to perform the protocol. Children aged four to six years&#xD;
      were assessed for their ability to complete the physiotherapy exercises. This assessment will&#xD;
      consist of a few repetitions of the protocol conducted shorter after completing the forms,&#xD;
      where difficulty in completing protocol exercises will considered non-inclusion criteria, so&#xD;
      as not to interfere with the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians will sign the terms of informed consent after receiving information on&#xD;
      the aims and procedures of the study. A specially structured form will apply regarding signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of CFC. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research involving&#xD;
      human beings at the Centro Integrado de Saúde Amaury de Medeiros (Registration 085/08).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A table of random numbers will be created in the computer by someone not involved in the&#xD;
      study, from which will determined the random distribution sequence of the patients. This&#xD;
      information will remain the exclusive knowledge of one research assistant, who will use these&#xD;
      numbers to allocate patients by order of study entry, immediately after giving their consent&#xD;
      to take part. This will only made known to the researchers after statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy + medication group (Intervention) Physiotherapy exercises will be&#xD;
           conducted by one single generalist physiotherapist, specially trained to perform the&#xD;
           exercises during the three months prior to the study. Twelve individual sessions will be&#xD;
           held twice a week, each lasting forty minutes, and adherence will be confirmed only if&#xD;
           patients attended all twelve sessions. A one-minute rest period will be observed between&#xD;
           each series of exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isometric training of the abdominal muscles The aim of the training will be to&#xD;
                increase intra-abdominal pressure (which compresses the intestines) and the colonic&#xD;
                propulsive force during voluntary effort. Considering that there is indirect&#xD;
                synergic activation between the pelvic floor muscle and the lower abdominal muscle,&#xD;
                the operation of the voluntary isometric contraction of the upper abdomen and the&#xD;
                simultaneous relaxation of the lower abdomen improves muscle coordination,&#xD;
                relaxation of the pelvic floor and relaxation of the external anal sphincter, thus&#xD;
                optimizing bowel movement. This consist of a contraction of the upper abdomen&#xD;
                muscle and diaphragm and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower abdomen, under&#xD;
                the supervision of the physiotherapist. Training will be carried out in two&#xD;
                manners: with the patient lying in a left lateral decubitus position with the hip&#xD;
                and knee flexed at 90º and sitting. In the lying method, training began with two&#xD;
                series of eight contractions and relaxations, into the third week, and then will&#xD;
                increase to two series of twelve contractions and relaxations, and will remain so&#xD;
                until the sixth week. In the sitting method, training will begin with one series of&#xD;
                three contractions and relaxations lasting ten seconds, increasing to five&#xD;
                repetitions in the third week, and remaining so until the sixth week. The exercise&#xD;
                will considered successfully carried out when a protrusion of the lower abdomen was&#xD;
                visible, indicating the simultaneous relaxation of the lower abdomen and the pelvic&#xD;
                floor, from which point the series was initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Breathing exercises The aim was to achieve a regular pattern of abdominal breathing&#xD;
                and strengthen the abdominal muscle, improving coordination between breathing, the&#xD;
                abdominal and anal muscles and colonic propulsion. Standard diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
                will achieve with a modified exercise, under the supervision of the&#xD;
                physiotherapist, with the patient in a seated position, with one hand placed on the&#xD;
                abdomen and the other on the thorax, and will be instructed to breath in slowly,&#xD;
                deeply and progressively for 6 to 8 seconds, retain the air for 10 seconds and&#xD;
                exhale slowly for 6 to 8 seconds. Two series will be completed, with ten&#xD;
                repetitions, and the exercise was considered successfully performed when greater&#xD;
                mobility of the hand placed on the abdomen achieves, compared to minimal or no&#xD;
                mobility of the hand on the thorax, from which point the series was initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abdominal massage The aim will be perform propulsive abdominal massage to promote&#xD;
                colonic and rectal motility, and train the intestinal function and bowel movement.&#xD;
                The physiotherapist will perform slow circular clockwise movements, along the line&#xD;
                of the colon, applying constant moderate pressure to the abdomen with a regular&#xD;
                tennis ball, remaining on each point for one minute, beginning with the ascending&#xD;
                colon moving in the direction of the sigmoid colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication and guidance Patients will use a laxative (magnesium hydroxide), for&#xD;
                which the dosage will vary according to individual needs (a minimum of 2 ml/kg),&#xD;
                and will receive guidance regarding fiber-rich foods, water and toilet training.&#xD;
                Patients will attend weekly consultations with a pediatric gastroenterologist, who&#xD;
                will be unaware of which patients belonged to which treatment group, since patients&#xD;
                were only receiving clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication Group (Control) Patients in this group will be monitored on a weekly basis by&#xD;
           a pediatric gastroenterologist, who will be unaware of which patients belonged to which&#xD;
           treatment group, since patients were only receiving clinical follow-up. All patients&#xD;
           will be prescribed a laxative (magnesium hydroxide), for which the dosage varied&#xD;
           according to individual needs (a minimum of 2 ml/kg), and will receive guidance&#xD;
           regarding fiber-rich foods, water and toilet training, under the same conditions as&#xD;
           patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Since there are no other similar studies, the sample was calculated from a study&#xD;
      that instructed children to achieve bowel movements sitting on the toilet. A reduction was&#xD;
      encountered of 80% in fecal incontinence in the intervention group and 55% in the control&#xD;
      group. The effect on the reduction of fecal incontinence (&lt; one/week) was estimated at 25% in&#xD;
      favor of the intervention. Epi-Info 6.04 was employed, using p=5% power=80%, which resulted&#xD;
      in 72 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and follow-up The frequency of bowel movement and retentive fecal incontinence will&#xD;
      be the primary outcome measures. Pain and increased effort for bowel movement, consistency of&#xD;
      stools and retentive behavior will be secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up, parents or guardians will keep a diary describing the intestinal habits of&#xD;
      the children. These data will be checked and handed in weekly to the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis to compare the two groups at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up period with regard to the primary and secondary outcome measures will be blind, by&#xD;
      intention-to-treat, considering loss of follow-up as treatment failure. In such cases, at the&#xD;
      end of the follow-up period, the frequency of bowel movement and fecal incontinence will be&#xD;
      recorded, as well as the response to other variables, reported at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
      The chi-squared test will be used for proportions and the Student t-test for numerical&#xD;
      variations with normal distribution (the Bartlett test was used to verify the homogeneity of&#xD;
      the variance). The Mann-Whitney test will be used for numerical variables with non-normal&#xD;
      distribution. Statistical significance will set at p&lt;0,05. All analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using the Epi-Info™, version 6.04d (CDC - Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,&#xD;
      USA and WHO World Health Organization, Geneva, swirtzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intragroup treatment additional exploratory analysis will be also conducted to assess the&#xD;
      function of retentive behaviour and fear of bowel movement in the frequency of bowel movement&#xD;
      at the end of treatment.&#xD;
