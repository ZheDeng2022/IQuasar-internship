  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older people with disabilities who cannot leave their homes are at increased risk of&#xD;
      depression or depressive symptoms. Short-term psychotherapy, without medications, has been&#xD;
      found effective for treating this population of people. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a&#xD;
      brief, structured, cognitive-behavioral therapy that teaches people problem-solving and&#xD;
      coping skills to deal with negative life events and daily problems. Previous research&#xD;
      demonstrated that PST is an effective treatment for depression when delivered to older adults&#xD;
      in their homes. The cost of service for these in-home visits, however, can be prohibitive for&#xD;
      many older adults and social service providers. One way to extend treatment to more older&#xD;
      adults is to deliver PST via teleconferencing (tele-PST). This study will test the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of tele-PST in treating depression in homebound older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two phases. Phase 1 will examine the feasibility of delivering treatment&#xD;
      via teleconference. Participants in this phase will receive six weekly sessions of tele-PST&#xD;
      and then complete a 2-week follow-up visit in which their depression, disability, and&#xD;
      resourcefulness will be assessed. Logistical and procedural problems and acceptability of the&#xD;
      treatment to participants will be used to guide modifications or adaptations made to tele-PST&#xD;
      before conducting a larger, randomized trial in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in Phase 2 will last 6 weeks, with follow-up visits lasting until 24 weeks&#xD;
      after the conclusion of treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      groups: tele-PST, in-person PST, and attention control. Participants in the tele-PST group&#xD;
      will receive six weekly sessions of PST via teleconference, and participants in the in-person&#xD;
      PST group will receive six weekly sessions of PST from a study therapist in person. Both&#xD;
      these groups will also receive six monthly maintenance calls from their study therapist after&#xD;
      the completion of treatment. Participants in the attention group will receive six weekly&#xD;
      phone calls followed by six monthly phone calls to monitor their health. All participants in&#xD;
      Phase 2 will complete assessments at 2, 12, and 24 weeks following their treatment. These&#xD;
      assessments will measure the adequacy of recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies;&#xD;
      the compliance rates and service delivery costs of tele-PST and in-person PST; and&#xD;
      participants' depression, disability, and resourcefulness.&#xD;
