  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SF1126 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic tumors by assessing the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and&#xD;
      defining the maximum tolerated dose given twice per week for 4 weeks and ultimately define a&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SF1126 is a conjugate containing a vascular targeted pan-PI3K inhibitor that selectively&#xD;
      inhibits all PI3K class I isoforms and other key members of the PI3K superfamily, including&#xD;
      mTORC1/2, DNA-PK, PLK-1, CK2, ATM and PIM-1. SF1126 is designed to inhibit both angiogenesis&#xD;
      and cell proliferation by targeting and binding to specific integrins such as αγβ3 that are&#xD;
      expressed on the surface of new tumor vasculature and within the tumor compartment. In&#xD;
      preclinical xenograft models SF1126 has demonstrated broad activity as a single agent;&#xD;
      synergy with commonly used chemotherapy agents, targeted agents, and radiation; and has been&#xD;
      shown to reverse resistance mediated through the PI3K/PTEN pathway.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Accrual will be limited to patients with tumor types that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator is known to have PTEN loss or PI3 Kinase mutations potentially important&#xD;
             in the biology of their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients with histologically confirmation of advanced solid malignant tumor which&#xD;
             is refractory to standard therapies or which no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
