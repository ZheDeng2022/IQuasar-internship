      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells. Giving it after surgery may kill any&#xD;
      tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of radiation therapy and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in treating women with early stage breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the freedom from local and regional failure in women with early stage&#xD;
           breast cancer treated with accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the acute and late toxicity of accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
           using previously published toxicity scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure cosmesis using the Harvard cosmesis scale in patients who have undergone&#xD;
           lumpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify co-variates responsible for poor cosmetic outcome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients who have undergone lumpectomy undergo either intracavitary balloon&#xD;
      brachytherapy boost and hypofractionated, accelerated whole breast irradiation (AWBI) OR&#xD;
      3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT)/intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) boost and AWBI.&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone mastectomy undergo hypofractionated, accelerated chest wall&#xD;
      irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost and AWBI (post-lumpectomy): Patients undergo&#xD;
           intracavitary balloon brachytherapy boost twice daily for 2 days (total of 4 fractions).&#xD;
           Beginning 5-21 days after completion of brachytherapy, patients undergo AWBI once daily&#xD;
           5 days a week for approximately 2 weeks (total of 11 fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D-CRT/IMRT boost and AWBI (post-lumpectomy): Patients undergo 3D-CRT/IMRT boost twice&#xD;
           daily for 2 days (total of 4 fractions). Patients also undergo AWBI as above before or&#xD;
           after boost radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerated chest wall irradiation (post-mastectomy): Patients undergo accelerated chest&#xD;
           wall irradiation once daily 5 days a week for approximately 2 weeks (total of 11&#xD;
           fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone lumpectomy undergo frontal digital photography of the breasts at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately before the initiation of radiotherapy, and then annually for 3 years&#xD;
      after completion of radiotherapy. These patients also complete the Breast Cancer Treatment&#xD;
      Outcome Scale at baseline and at 3 years after completion of radiotherapy. Physicians&#xD;
      complete the Harvard Cosmesis scale at baseline and at 1 and 3 years after completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 1, 4, and 8 and then&#xD;
      every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;
