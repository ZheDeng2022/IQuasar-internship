      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemoprevention is the use of preventive medications to reduce the risk of breast cancer&#xD;
           for women who are at a high risk of developing the disease. Although the treatment has&#xD;
           shown effectiveness in preventing cancer development, chemoprevention is notably&#xD;
           underutilized even by women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in determining if better decision support mechanisms, such as&#xD;
           interactive Web sites, can help to overcome some of the barriers to chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop and test a prototype Web-based module that will provide decision support to&#xD;
      women who are considering chemoprevention for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women 35 years of age and older who are at high risk for breast cancer and whose doctor&#xD;
           has recommended chemoprevention (either Tamoxifen or Raloxifene), and who have no other&#xD;
           history of cancer (apart from non-melanoma skin cancer or precancerous cervical&#xD;
           lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have a working e-mail address and access to a computer with internet&#xD;
           access and a telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are considering chemoprevention will be randomized to a Web-based&#xD;
           decision support module or standard care online information resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation lasts two months and involves using the online resources provided and&#xD;
           filling out questionnaires two times during the study (at the beginning and the end).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first time will be at the begin of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No medical treatments are offered as a part of this study&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer chemoprevention has been notably underutilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers to integrating breast cancer risk reducing measures include: lack of time, low&#xD;
           priority of risk reduction in comparison to treatment, the need to personalize risks and&#xD;
           benefits of chemoprevention, and the need for resources/information necessary for women&#xD;
           to make informed decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to quality decision support resources to facilitate making informed,&#xD;
           preference-sensitive decisions about chemoprevention may provide a mechanism to overcome&#xD;
           some of the current barriers to chemoprevention utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and refine a web-based patient decision support module for high-risk women&#xD;
           making a decision about breast cancer chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a randomized study of TACHD decision support versus standard care online&#xD;
           information support to evaluate the impact of the chemoprevention module of the TACHD&#xD;
           decision support intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with no history of cancer other than cervical carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma&#xD;
           skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk for breast cancer based on at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gail score &gt; 1.67&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of atypical hyperplasia (either ductal or lobular)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of lobular carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documentation of a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Considering a decision about chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to an IBM-compatible or MacIntosh personal computer with broadband Internet&#xD;
           access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to an email account&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to a telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged 35 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to communicate in English verbally and in writing&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The project will be guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (CSHIP)&#xD;
           model overall, and incorporate the Ottawa Decision Support. Framework (ODSF) in one&#xD;
           consistent decision support process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of the chemoprevention decision support module will be conducted in a two-group&#xD;
           pre- post-test experimental design with 64 at-risk women identified through Fox Chase&#xD;
           Risk Assessment Programs and the NCI Clinical Cancer Genetics Program (CCGP) at the&#xD;
           National Naval Medical Center (NNMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A process evaluation analysis will assess participants' experiences using TACHD.&#xD;
