      Hypothesis - Rotigaptide will improve endothelial function in the context of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lining of blood vessels (endothelium) can react to hormones in the blood stream causing&#xD;
      the blood vessel muscle to relax (vasodilatation) and allow more blood to flow. The nitric&#xD;
      oxide and prostacyclin pathways are well documented in this process. However, evidence points&#xD;
      to the existence of a third powerful relaxant called endothelium derived hyperpolarising&#xD;
      factor (EDHF) but its identity and mechanism of action have proved elusive. As well as&#xD;
      causing blood vessels to relax and more blood to flow, EDHF may be involved in the&#xD;
      endothelium signaling, triggering release of a specialised clot dissolving factor called&#xD;
      tissue plasminogen activator (t PA). t PA is important to ensure small clots, which are&#xD;
      constantly being formed in the circulation, are rapidly dissolved and do not grow large&#xD;
      enough to cause heart attacks and strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence points towards the requirement for 'gap junctions' in the mediation of EDHF&#xD;
      responses. Gap junctions are specialised pores which allow small molecules and charge to pass&#xD;
      between cells. They are found between endothelial cells and the underlying muscle of the&#xD;
      blood vessel. A drug called Rotigaptide has been developed to cause gap junctions to open. It&#xD;
      has been safely administered in healthy volunteers and is now in a Phase II drug trial. By&#xD;
      opening gap junctions the investigators hypothesise that it could increase EDHF mediated&#xD;
      activity and vasodilatation. It represents a useful tool with which to examine the role of&#xD;
      gap junctions in EDHF activity in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously the investigators have demonstrated that rotigaptide does not contribute to&#xD;
      endothelial function in healthy volunteers. The investigators now wish to examine the effect&#xD;
      of rotigaptide in conditions of endothelial dysfunction. By limiting the blood flow to the&#xD;
      arm for 20mins the ability of the blood vessel to vasodilate is impaired. By administering an&#xD;
      intra-arterial rotigaptide infusion the investigators want to assess any functional&#xD;
      preservation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The endothelium plays a pivotal role in the control of vascular tone and is&#xD;
      responsible for the local release of profibrinolytic factors. Nitric oxide (NO), the original&#xD;
      endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and prostacyclin (PGI2) have now been well&#xD;
      characterised. The elucidation of their roles in vascular physiology and pathophysiology has&#xD;
      been fundamental to recent advances in the treatment and prevention of many cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Whilst these factors are of major importance, evidence points to the existence of a&#xD;
      third powerful vasodilator called endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation -&#xD;
&#xD;
      After blockade of both NO and PGI2, a substantial degree of endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      vasodilatation is still observed and is attributed to EDHF. Despite almost two decades of&#xD;
      research and debate, the exact nature of EDHF and its mechanism of action remain unclear.&#xD;
      Consistently, EDHF's role as a vasodilator is most prominent in the smaller resistance&#xD;
      arteries that are responsible for the control of systemic blood pressure and local organ&#xD;
      perfusion. As well as its involvement in physiological processes, alterations in EDHF&#xD;
      activity may contribute to the vascular effects of the myriad of conditions either caused by,&#xD;
      or resulting in, endothelial dysfunction. However, the lack of understanding of EDHF has&#xD;
      precluded its direct manipulation as a specific therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous fibrinolysis -&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its function in the control of vascular tone, there is evidence to suggest&#xD;
      that EDHF may be responsible for the endothelial release of the pro-fibrinolytic factor,&#xD;
      tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombus formation and dissolution is a continuous process in the vasculature and is&#xD;
      regulated by dynamic interactions between pro-coagulant and pro-fibrinolytic factors.&#xD;
      Endogenous fibrinolysis is determined by the relative balance between the acute local release&#xD;
      of t-PA from the endothelium and its subsequent inhibition by plasma plasminogen activator&#xD;
      inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In the presence of an imbalance in the fibrinolytic system,&#xD;
      subclinical microthrombi on the surface of atherosclerotic plaques may propagate and&#xD;
      ultimately lead to arterial occlusion and tissue infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms via which t-PA release is mediated are incompletely understood. Bradykinin, an&#xD;
      endogenous endothelium-dependent vasodilator, causes the endothelial release of t-PA.&#xD;
      However, Brown et al have demonstrated that inhibition of prostacyclin and nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthesis does not diminish bradykinin mediated endothelial t-PA release in the human&#xD;
      forearm. Therefore, they suggest that EDHF is responsible for the endothelial release of t-PA&#xD;
      but, to date, this hypothesis has not been adequately addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gap Junctions -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gap junctions are found at points of cell-cell contact where they form an aqueous pore&#xD;
      through which small hydrophilic molecules and ionic charge may pass. Each gap junction&#xD;
      comprises two hemichannels, or connexons that are composed of six connexin (Cx) subunits.&#xD;
      Although each connexon may be composed of a mix of connexin subtypes, Cx37, Cx40 and Cx43 are&#xD;
      particularly associated with mammalian endothelium and vascular smooth muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case for a pivotal role of gap junctions in the EDHF phenomenon has strengthened. Gap&#xD;
      junction plaques are most abundant in small resistance arteries and their distribution is&#xD;
      proportional to the magnitude of the EDHF-mediated response. These topographical data have&#xD;
      been extrapolated to argue for a direct link between gap junctions and EDHF. Furthermore,&#xD;
      murine knockout models provide direct evidence for a role of gap junctions and specific&#xD;
      connexins in the control of vascular tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentiation of Communication via Gap Junctions -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotigaptide (ZP-123) is a novel hexapeptide (Ac-D-Tyr-D-Pro-D-Hyp-Gly-D-Ala-Gly-NH2),&#xD;
      originally developed as an antiarrythmic agent it has now been safely administered to healthy&#xD;
      humans as a six day continuous infusion of up to 20 mg (0.30 mmol) per day and is now in&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trials. It has been shown to promote electrical coupling between&#xD;
      ventricular myocytes by increasing gap junction conductance potentially via alterations in&#xD;
      the phosphorylation status of Cx43 and it increases the number of gap junctions in the&#xD;
      ischaemic myocardium It potentiates gap junction-mediated dye transfer via Cx43 expressing&#xD;
      HeLa cells but not via Cx26 or Cx32 but its effects on electrical conduction and dye transfer&#xD;
      via Cx37 and Cx40, the other major vascular connexins, have yet to be assessed. However, we&#xD;
      have recently shown that Cx43 is required for the mediation of EDHF vasodilatation of human&#xD;
      subcutaneous resistance vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently demonstrated that rotigaptide does not enhance endothelium-dependent or&#xD;
      independent forearm arterial vasodilatation in healthy volunteers. However there may be a&#xD;
      role for potentiating gap junctions under some circumstances. In animal models of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction those treated with rotigaptide had significantly reduced infarction sizes.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction is central to the pathophysiology of diabetes and is responsible for&#xD;
      the vascular complications associated with this condition. In animal models of diabetes&#xD;
      reduced expression of connexins has been demonstrated with blunted response to EDHF,&#xD;
      suggesting a link between endothelial dysfunction and gap junctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction can be mimicked in vivo with brief periods of ischaemia, resulting in&#xD;
      a reduced response to endothelium-dependant vasodilators. In the forearm arterial&#xD;
      circulation, we will test the hypothesis that rotigaptide-induced enhancement of&#xD;
      communication via gap junctions attenuates ischaemic endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
