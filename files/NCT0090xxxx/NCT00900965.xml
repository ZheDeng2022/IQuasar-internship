  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common digestive disorder that affects more than&#xD;
      5% of population in Hong Kong. However, there is no effective treatment of IBS using Western&#xD;
      Medicine. Acupuncture, a traditional therapeutic modality, has been used in China for&#xD;
      thousands of years for various pain disorders. In addition to analgesia, acupuncture has also&#xD;
      been shown to influence physiology of gastrointestinal tract. The investigators set out to&#xD;
      evaluate the therapeutic value of acupuncture in IBS. The investigators will study its&#xD;
      effects on rectal sensation and brain activity in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated for study eligibility at visit 1 (baseline). Baseline&#xD;
      assessment includes individual IBS symptoms (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation, and&#xD;
      diarrhea) as perceived by patients will be scored. The syndrome of IBS patients will also be&#xD;
      recorded and analyzed based on the Chinese medicine theories. All patients will then undergo&#xD;
      baseline rectal barostat for thresholds of rectal sensation. At visit 2, eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either (1) electroacupuncture or (2) sham electroacupuncture&#xD;
      treatment groups. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanning will be performed&#xD;
      before, during and after the electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be evaluated for study eligibility at visit 1 (baseline). Baseline&#xD;
      assessment includes the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Global symptom assessment: Based on Rome III Working Group recommendation, a clinical&#xD;
           outcome response measure is used in which patients are required to report &quot;improved&quot;,&#xD;
           &quot;the same&quot; or &quot;worsened&quot; to the question &quot;Do you have adequate symptom relief in the&#xD;
           past 7 days?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individual IBS symptoms: The individual IBS symptom (pain/discomfort, bloating,&#xD;
           constipation, and diarrhea) as perceived by patients will be scored in a 5-point scale&#xD;
           (0=none or asymptomatic; 1=mild with no limitation of normal activities; 2=moderate with&#xD;
           limitation of some normal activities; 3=intense and unable to carry out most normal&#xD;
           activities; 4=incapacitating symptom that are intolerable and unable to carry out all&#xD;
           normal activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Syndrome of Chinese medicine: The syndrome of IBS patients will be recorded and analyzed&#xD;
           based on the Chinese medicine theories. These symptoms involving: fatigue, appetite,&#xD;
           sense of mouth, quality of sleep, the coating of tongue, pulse, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life (QOL) assessment: A disease-specific questionnaire- IBS Quality of Life&#xD;
           Scale (Chinese) will be used for assessment of QOL in response to treatment. The&#xD;
           questionnaire was locally validated, and was recently developed by our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rectal barostat: The patients will be evaluated for the sensory threshold and maximum&#xD;
           tolerable threshold of rectum in response to balloon distension of rectum before the&#xD;
           acupuncture treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either (1) electroacupuncture or&#xD;
      (2) sham electroacupuncture. During the treatment, the patient will receive fMRI to evaluate&#xD;
      the cerebral cortical activity in response to balloon distension of rectum. Three sets of&#xD;
      real-time functional brain mapping using fMRI will be performed during rectal balloon&#xD;
      distensions at maximum tolerable pressure at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 minutes after acupuncture needle insertion before delivery of electrical stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 15 minutes after electrical stimulation begins (electrical stimulation continues during&#xD;
           MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immediately after electrical stimulation stops before removal of acupuncture needle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectal barostat:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The barostat device contains a built-in computer system that can be programmed to&#xD;
      automatically perform distensions of balloon with fixed time lags and bag pressure&#xD;
      increments. Variation in balloon volume in a constant pressure reflects the change in tone&#xD;
      and compliance of the visceral wall. Furthermore, through a programmed variation in&#xD;
      intraballoon pressure, the sensory threshold of subject can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is instructed to take low residue diet 2 days prior to barostat. On the day&#xD;
      before barostat, bowel preparation is performed by ingestion of 4 liters of polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol solution in 2 divided doses. After a 12-hour fast, the participant is positioned in&#xD;
      supine position on MRI table. A barostat bag is inserted into the rectum. The barostat device&#xD;
      is connected to the barostat catheter using a low compliance PVC tubing. The participant will&#xD;
      remain alone in MRI cubicle during the whole experiment but a speaker and microphone system&#xD;
      allows communication with the investigator. He/she is also provided a squeeze bulb to signify&#xD;
      pain. Repeated squeezing of the bulb signifies request for termination of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phasic isobaric rectal distensions are performed automatically using ascending method of&#xD;
      limits (AML) protocol with successive increments of 4 mm Hg (40-second duration) alternating&#xD;
      with intermittent periods of bag deflation (40 seconds). During each distension phase, the&#xD;
      participant is requested to report the perception ratings by pressing on the perception panel&#xD;
      of barostat device with the following scale: (1) no sensation (2) the first sensation of&#xD;
      balloon distension, (3) desire for defecation, (4) maximum tolerable sensation. The procedure&#xD;
      will be stopped when pain or maximum tolerable sensation is reported. The sensory threshold&#xD;
      is defined as lower limit of the bag pressure that evokes the first sensation of balloon&#xD;
      distension. The pain threshold is defined as pressure that elicits a &quot;pain&quot; response or&#xD;
      maximum tolerable sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroacupuncture Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be performed by a single licensed acupuncturist. Both the patient and the&#xD;
      investigator are unaware of the treatment assigned. A specially designed copper needle&#xD;
      (0.22x4mm), which can be used safely in MRI suite, will be inserted through a plaster over&#xD;
      the respective acupoints, under which a plastic ring will be positioned, connected with&#xD;
      electrical stimulation machine (EY-3308 Model, G6805-2 Mayfair) through wires with&#xD;
      stimulation frequency of 150Hz, lasting for 30 minutes. For sham acupuncture, the needle will&#xD;
      be positioned at 2cm away from the true respective acupoints., the same electric stimulation&#xD;
      will be the same as real acupuncture treatment. The treatment will be given by an independent&#xD;
      acupuncturist who is not involved in the data acquisition and analysis. Points for&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment are chosen to regain the balance of liver qi stagnation and strengthen&#xD;
      the spleen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical location (Function according to TCM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SP06:3cm above the medial malleolus dorsal tibial rim (Strengthens spleen and stomach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ST25:2cm lateral to the umbilicus (Strengthens spleen and stop diarrhea)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ST36:5cm below patella, 2 cm lateral of the tibial rim (Strengthens spleen and stomach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ST37:3cm below ST36 (Strengthens spleen and stop diarrhea)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOLD imaging is performed with a 3-T MRI scanner (Philips Achieva 3.0T, X series, Quasar Dual&#xD;
      MRI system). Each study consists of axial T1-weighted spin echo images (matrix of at least&#xD;
      192 × 256) covering the whole brain for anatomical correlation. Functional scan is performed&#xD;
      using a single-shot echo planar pulse sequence in an interleaved multislice format with a&#xD;
      field of view of 24 cm and a matrix size of at least 64 × 64, resulting in a in-plane&#xD;
      resolution of 3.75 × 3.75. The pulse sequence parameters include a 90° flip-angle with a TE&#xD;
      (time to echo)/TR (repetition time) of 60 ms/4000 ms. Each paradigm consists of 5 periods.&#xD;
      Each period will consist of rest and stimulation (tube inflation causing rectal distension).&#xD;
      In each period, 50 dynamics are performed. Each dynamic will last for 2 seconds. The scans&#xD;
      will be performed with the rectal tube inflated to render:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Desire for defecation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Painful sensation, as determined by the barostat study at baseline visit within one week&#xD;
           before MRI scanning.&#xD;
