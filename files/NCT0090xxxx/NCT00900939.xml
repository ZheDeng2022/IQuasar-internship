      The purpose of this study is to determine if a low-fat, vegan diet affects the number of acne&#xD;
      lesions, acne severity, and acne extent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne is the most common skin disorder in the United States. Although many cases are&#xD;
      transient, the condition is often chronic, causing self-consciousness and social&#xD;
      stigmatization over the short term and physical scars and damaged self-esteem over the long&#xD;
      term. Patients and clinicians have frequently attributed acnegenesis to diet; studies of&#xD;
      varying quality have been published on the topic since the 1830s. Recently, well-designed,&#xD;
      controlled, prospective studies suggest an acnegenic effect of specific dietary factors,&#xD;
      including high-glycemic-index foods and dairy products. Limited evidence also suggests an&#xD;
      acnegenic effect of foods containing saturated fats. More well-designed, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trials are needed to further establish dietary effects on acne. Based on&#xD;
      epidemiologic observations and results of prior clinical trials, we are conducting a pilot&#xD;
      study to determine if a low-fat, low-glycemic-index vegan diet affects the number of acne&#xD;
      lesions and acne severity.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet for the full 16 weeks of the study. They will also be guided to favor foods with a low glycemic index. The diet consists of whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits, with no restriction on energy intake. Animal products, added oils, and added sugars will be excluded.</description>
