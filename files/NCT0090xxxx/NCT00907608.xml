    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of partial correction of anemia with&#xD;
      Darbepoetin alfa to a target of 11 g.dL (female) or 12 g/dL (male) on the reduction of&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and total mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the leading cause of end stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease with 60&#xD;
      percent of the global diabetic population coming from Asia. Growing evidence confirms the&#xD;
      predictive role of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      This is due to the constellation of conventional and non-conventional risk factors in&#xD;
      patients who develop CKD, such as anemia, inflammation and abnormal bone metabolism. In this&#xD;
      regard, anemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in&#xD;
      patients with CKD, patients with left ventricular dysfunction and in general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective erythropoiesis is dependent on the production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.&#xD;
      Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes and up to 20% of diabetic patients are&#xD;
      noted to have anemia. In a meta-analysis of community-based population studies, anemia&#xD;
      interacts with CKD to increase the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality among patients with diabetes. Previous studies that examined the effect of&#xD;
      erythropoietin therapy on anemic subjects with CKD did not find statistical difference in&#xD;
      mortality rates between the treated and untreated groups. Possible explanations for the lack&#xD;
      of benefits include higher level of blood pressure and increased blood viscosity leading to&#xD;
      worsening of chronic congestive heart failure in the treated subjects. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      partial correction of hemoglobin may be more appropriate.&#xD;
