      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Two primary&#xD;
           cell types, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, account for most cases. Of the&#xD;
           two, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for more than 80 percent of all&#xD;
           deaths from esophageal cancer. Many cases occur in certain areas with defined geographic&#xD;
           boundaries, including parts of Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies of ESCC in developed countries (such as the United States) suggest that heavy&#xD;
           tobacco and alcohol use, poor diet, and low socioeconomic status are the primary risk&#xD;
           factors. Males and African Americans are also at higher risk. However, these risk&#xD;
           factors do not fully explain the prevalence of cases in several of the identified&#xD;
           geographic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ESCC is the most common cancer seen at Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya, and a notable&#xD;
           number of patients are 30 years of age or younger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the feasibility of a new protocol by recruiting visitors to Tenwek Hospital and&#xD;
           volunteers from the general population for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use the new protocol to obtain blood and urine samples from ESCC cases in Tenwek&#xD;
           Hospital and from nonpatient volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital patients and volunteers who live within 50 kilometers of Tenwek Hospital in&#xD;
           western Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will complete a questionnaire and provide blood and urine samples for&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The questionnaire will include questions about individual and family medical&#xD;
                history, living conditions, lifestyle, habits, and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine samples will be collected from all participants after the&#xD;
                questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological samples will be shipped to the United States for further testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be offered as part of this study.&#xD;

      This pilot study will assess the feasibility of completing the first formal case-control&#xD;
      study to examine etiologic factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Kenya and&#xD;
      will be conducted in Western Kenya, a high-risk area for ESCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer causes over 380,000 deaths per year and ranks as the sixth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death worldwide. Two primary cell types, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      account for most cases. Although the rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma have risen rapidly in&#xD;
      the United States and elsewhere, ESCC still accounts for 80% of all esophageal cancer cases&#xD;
      in the world. Many of these cases occur in high-risk areas with sharp geographic boundaries&#xD;
      within China, Iran, a small region of South America, South Africa, and Kenya. Studies of ESSC&#xD;
      in economically developed countries, such as the US, point to smoking tobacco, heavy alcohol&#xD;
      drinking, poor diets deficient in fresh fruits and vegetables, and low socioeconomic status&#xD;
      as the main etiologic factors. Other independent risk factors may include being male and&#xD;
      being African-American. Smoking tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption do not explain the&#xD;
      incidence rates in the high-risk regions because these habits are less common and less&#xD;
      intensely practiced in these high-risk areas compared to the low risk area. Also, in highrisk&#xD;
      areas the incidence rates are similar in men and women despite differences in the rates of&#xD;
      tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. Therefore, it is important to consider a wide range of&#xD;
      etiologic factors to explain the high rates of cancer in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenwek Hospital is a 300 bed mission hospital located in Bomet District, Rift Valley&#xD;
      Province, approximately 200 miles from Nairobi in the west of Kenya. Tenwek serves as a&#xD;
      primary health care facility for approximately 400,000 people, and it has become a referral&#xD;
      center for a broader population. ESCC is the most common malignancy seen at Tenwek Hospital&#xD;
      and the patients show a very unusual age distribution with 10% of cases less than or equal to&#xD;
      30 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pilot for a case-control study of ESCC at Tenwek Hospital, recruiting&#xD;
      people that live within 50 km of the hospital. Initial pilot testing showed that neither&#xD;
      hospital-visitor controls nor general-population controls were practical control sources. We&#xD;
      now plan to test the feasibility of collecting 50 hospital-based non-cancer patient controls.&#xD;
      We will then enroll 50 cases and 50 additional hospital-based non-cancer patient controls to&#xD;
      test all aspects of our protocol. We will ship the biological samples collected from these&#xD;
      individuals to the US and test their suitability for our intended assays. All subjects will&#xD;
      be interviewed using a structured questionnaire and will be asked to provide biological&#xD;
      samples including blood and urine. Environmental risk factors (including lifestyle, habits,&#xD;
      and diet) will be assessed through questionnaires.&#xD;
