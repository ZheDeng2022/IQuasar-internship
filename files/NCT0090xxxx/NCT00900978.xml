  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization of S. pneumoniae in infants is generally acquired at&#xD;
      approximately 4-6 months of age. Although there are differences in the prevalence and rank&#xD;
      order of serotypes obtained from NP specimens and from those with invasive diseases,&#xD;
      pneumococcal nasopharyngeal isolates may reflect the strains circulating in the community and&#xD;
      may be used as a marker to predict serotype prevalence of invasive disease and resistance&#xD;
      patterns. The information about pneumococcal strains found in Jordanian children and&#xD;
      NP-carriage of infants is limited and do not include children living in rural regions.&#xD;
      Monitoring serotype distribution is essential for the appropriate application of vaccination.&#xD;
      Vaccine use in infants proves to be highly efficacious in the prevention of invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease as well as in decreasing the carriage of vaccine serotypes in the&#xD;
      nasopharynx of infants which impacted significantly in the long run on otitis media infection&#xD;
      and helped decrease the infection rates among contacts of these infants. The result has been&#xD;
      a decrease in the pneumococcal infection rate among elderly contacts of these infants and&#xD;
      decrease colonization with pneumococci. In order to determine the pneumococcal serotypes&#xD;
      which are prevalent among infants attending day care centers (DCCs) in Jordan, a study of&#xD;
      these types circulating among infants will be determined over a period of 15 months in&#xD;
      250-300 children attending the DCCs in Ajlun-City by taking 3 NP-swabs, the first before the&#xD;
      first vaccine injection in May 2009, the second before the third injection at 10 months of&#xD;
      age and the third swab sample is taken at 1 year of age (2-3 months after the last injection&#xD;
      with the 7vPCV. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of NP-carriage and&#xD;
      serotype distribution of the strains isolated from infants less than 2 years old, and to get&#xD;
      an insight about the coverage of the available and future pneumococcal conjugate vaccines&#xD;
      developed for this infectious agent. Good results of this study project would make&#xD;
      recommendations for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to include the vaccine in the National&#xD;
      Vaccination Program. 15000 doses of the 7v PCV (Prevenar) were donated from Wyeth&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical company to the MOH of Jordan in September 2008. These will be vaccinated in a&#xD;
      vaccine program (for free) over 15 months period in 2009-2010 in one city in north Jordan&#xD;
      called Ajlun. This city has 3676 births per year (Statistics of the MOH 2007). The&#xD;
      vaccination program will start from the 18th of May, 2009, and ending in August 2010. The way&#xD;
      the vaccine will be given is 2 + 1 injections as recommended by the vaccination committee of&#xD;
      the MOH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S. pneumoniae is one of the major bacterial causes of invasive disease, community acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia and respiratory tract infections worldwide (Song, Oh et al. 2008). It causes&#xD;
      meningitis, bacteraemia, otitis media, pneumonia and other infections. The resistance rate of&#xD;
      this bacteria to antibiotics all over the world is increasing and the mortality rate globally&#xD;
      have reached 2 million every year as reported by the WHO. Risk groups are mainly young&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age, immune-deficient patients and elderly. There are 91 different&#xD;
      serotypes of this infectious agent known worldwide. In the United States of America and&#xD;
      Europe, research on S. pneumonia showed that over than 70-85% of all S. pneumoniae cases can&#xD;
      be covered and prevented by the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar (7v-PCV)).&#xD;
      This percentage is different according to the country. In Jordan, this vaccine was introduced&#xD;
      and licensed in January 2006 without any previous preliminary studies of the serotypes or&#xD;
      capsular types found. Furthermore, there are no published data about the infections caused by&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumonia from Jordan. The total number of Jordanian population is estimated in&#xD;
      2007 to be 5,744 million inhabitants with birth rate 28 per 1000 and these people are&#xD;
      concentrated in the capital of Amman (1.781 million), Irbid (629679) and Zarqa (819000). Of&#xD;
      Jordanian inhabitants and according to WHO recent numbers of 2008, 37.1% are children below&#xD;
      15 years of age and 3.8% are over than 65 years of age, and total children below 5 years are&#xD;
      estimated 2007 to be 917000. This means that the people at risk of pneumococcal infections is&#xD;
      40.9% of the total population. Furthermore, statistical data of the MOH reported an increase&#xD;
      of non-meningococcal meningitis cases (without specification of the exact cause of&#xD;
      meningitis) from 438 cases (incidence 10.2/ 100,000 population) in 1995 to 778 cases&#xD;
      (incidence 14.5/ 100,000 population) in 2007. In 2005, 458 cases/ 747 cases (61%) were from&#xD;
      Irbid city alone -north-; and this was 460 cases in 2007 from 778 cases with non&#xD;
      meningococcal meningitis. The maximum number of cases with non-meningococcal meningitis was&#xD;
      reported in years 2000 (1108 cases with an incidence rate of 22/ 100,000), and in 2003 (1079&#xD;
      cases with an incidence rate of 19.7/ 100,000). In 2007, 778 cases were reported in Jordan&#xD;
      with non-meningococcal meningitis, 140 of these cases were from Amman and 490 were from Irbid&#xD;
      alone and the rest are from the other parts in Jordan. If we consider as is known that 30% of&#xD;
      these infections (non-meningococcal meningitis) are due to S. pneumonia. This means that 233&#xD;
      cases with S. pneumonia meningitis reported annually with 147 from Irbid and 42 cases from&#xD;
      Amman which makes 189 cases (81% of all pneumococcal meningitis of Jordan occurring in Irbid&#xD;
      and Amman).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors have been identified to promote the clonal spread of multiresistant strains;&#xD;
      such as places with high density of children as in DCC and orphanages. S. pneumonia, that are&#xD;
      resistant to many antimicrobial agents. Extensive and often excessive use of antibiotics can&#xD;
      promote the replacement of strains susceptible to antimicrobial agents by resistant ones&#xD;
      (Garcia-Rodriguez and Fresnadillo Martinez 2002), (Pradier, Dunais et al. 1997). Despite&#xD;
      adequate antibiotic treatment, morbidity and mortality due to pneumococcal disease remain&#xD;
      high (Butler, Shapiro et al. 1999). Moreover, the increase of multidrug resistance among&#xD;
      pneumococcal isolates hampers adequate treatment (Crook and Spratt 1998), (Klugman 1996),&#xD;
      (Tomasz 1997). These strains are subsequently disseminated in the community by other contacts&#xD;
      of colonized children, e.g., their siblings and parents. It is possible to limit the spread&#xD;
      of some serotypes of S. pneumoniae by vaccination, but studies of the impact of immunization&#xD;
      on colonization have yielded discrepant results (Dagan, Givon-Lavi et al. 2002), (Dagan,&#xD;
      Melamed et al. 1996), (Dagan, Muallem et al. 1997), (Mbelle, Huebner et al. 1999). New&#xD;
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been shown to be effective against invasive diseases in&#xD;
      young children (Black, Shinefield et al. 2000). Furthermore, a protective effect against&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections such as (recurrent) otitis media has been observed (Black,&#xD;
      Shinefield et al. 2000), (Eskola, Kilpi et al. 2001). Thus far, the 7-valent pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine Prevenar (Wyeth) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      and the European Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products and is recommended by the U.S.&#xD;
      Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the prevention of invasive diseases in&#xD;
      children under 2 years of age. Recommendations are also made for older children at increased&#xD;
      risk for invasive disease, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus infection and&#xD;
      asplenia and those with increased risk for pneumococcal mucosal disease, such as children&#xD;
      with recurrent acute otitis media. The effect of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine in children aged 1 to 7 years with a history&#xD;
      of recurrent acute otitis media was studied (Veenhoven, Bogaert et al. 2003). Clinically, no&#xD;
      protective effect of the pneumococcal vaccines on recurrence of acute otitis media was found.&#xD;
      At the nasopharyngeal level, however, a significant reduction of colonization with&#xD;
      vaccine-type pneumococci was found after vaccination, whereas a simultaneous increase in&#xD;
      colonization with non vaccine serotypes was observed (Veenhoven, Bogaert et al. 2003), (van&#xD;
      der Linden, Al-Lahham et al. 2007). The spread of non-vaccine 19A penicillin resistant&#xD;
      pneumococcal strains in the USA is a very serious development indeed, the children had to be&#xD;
      treated with levofloxacin and one became partially deaf. With widespread of Prevenar use in&#xD;
      Jordan this clone might appear (Pichichero and Casey 2007; Pichichero and Casey 2007).&#xD;
      Recently, a Ph D study in Jordan showed that the resistance of penicillin G to S. pneumoniae&#xD;
      isolated from healthy children in the kindergarten has reached to 92%. The efficacy of the 7v&#xD;
      PCV to define the disease burden in the developing countries has been studied .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE OF WORK&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project has many dimensions including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research project would give an idea about the effect of the vaccine that is given to&#xD;
           the children, whether this would affect the incidence of IPD indirectly in the city of&#xD;
           Ajlun compared to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a result of the first point, a governmental National program of vaccination of&#xD;
           children will take place for the Jordanian children at specific age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the resistance pattern of the isolates against 14 different antibiotics&#xD;
           will be developed. High resistance rates will indicate that treatment with such an&#xD;
           antibiotic is not efficient and we must use an alternative for the treatment. A precise&#xD;
           result of the antibiotic resistance pattern could save money by prescribing antibiotics&#xD;
           that are safe and effective, and would educate the Jordanian population about a better&#xD;
           use of antimicrobials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Furthermore, Serotyping of S. pneumoniae isolates of all pneumococcal strains isolated&#xD;
           in this study would give an idea about the coverage of the vaccine available and would&#xD;
           answer the families question shall we vaccinate our children or not!! Why should we pay&#xD;
           85 JDs privately to vaccine since the coverage is less than 50% as an example. Here&#xD;
           comes the question whether we should use the 13 va,lent vaccine of the same type, which&#xD;
           is still under development. Carriage of S. pneumoniae in Jordan pediatrics below 5 was&#xD;
           developed in the primary results of the carriage in Jordan and was 57%. if the carriage&#xD;
           distribution in the Jordanian population has to do with specific serotypes, which are&#xD;
           included in the 7-vPCV, then vaccination would be the best idea to prevent occurrence of&#xD;
           the infection then decrease morbidity and later the mortality rate due to the infections&#xD;
           of this pathogen. The northern of Jordan constitutes of more than 50% of all&#xD;
           non-meningococcal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An appropriate vaccination program of specific areas and/or specific age groups in&#xD;
           Jordan might decrease the distribution of this disease and in turn saving money.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results will obtain an insight into the effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
           on the genetic pneumococcal population structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research findings will later on improve the quality of different private and&#xD;
           governmental laboratories in Jordan through personal contact and advising. By applying&#xD;
           bioinformatics and the phylogeny from the data of resistance, serotyping and Multilocus&#xD;
           Sequence Typing (MLST), global clonal relationship of the strains can be obtained from&#xD;
           the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A 15 month surveillance study of Nasopharyngeal Carriage and Antibiotic&#xD;
      Resistance of S. pneumoniae in Healthy Jordanian Infants will be launched in Jordan (Ajlun)&#xD;
      in the time period between May 2009 to August 2010. Children will be given the 7vPCV as&#xD;
      during the 3rd, 5th and 10th months of age (two plus one scheme). Nasopharyngeal swabs will&#xD;
      be collected from the DCCs of Ajlun. Questionnaires and special forms will be taken with each&#xD;
      isolate and will be sent to the reference lab at the German-Jordanian University for&#xD;
      isolation of pneumococci, identification, serotyping, and resistance and for molecular&#xD;
      analysis, statistical analysis and coverage. Agreement from the Ministry of Health (MOH), to&#xD;
      take all ethical points regarding sample collection into consideration will be guaranteed.&#xD;
      The samples will be cultivated at a microbiology lab of the German-Jordanian University.&#xD;
      Molecular methods will be investigated in Germany at the National Reference Center for&#xD;
      Streptococci. Phases of project implementation will be collection of the samples, and&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture and identification: Samples will be inoculated on Columbia agar plates with 5% sheep&#xD;
      blood. The plates will be incubated at 35°C with 5% CO2 overnight. Identification will be&#xD;
      performed by conventional microbiological methods like colony morphology, susceptibility to&#xD;
      optochin (bioMérieux), and bile solubility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Susceptibility testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing will be performed using the broth micro broth&#xD;
      dilution method recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (CLSI&#xD;
      2008). Antibiotics to be used are Penicillin G, Amoxicillin, Cefotaxime, Cefuroxim,&#xD;
      Cefpodoxim, Clarithromycin, Clindamycin, Tetracycline, Levofloxacin, Telithromycin,&#xD;
      Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole, Chloramphenicole, Vancomycin and might include other possible&#xD;
      new antibiotics as upon request as Tigecycline. S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 will be included as&#xD;
      a control strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of resistance determinants (Geno- and phenotyping): PCR of macrolide resistance&#xD;
      determinants will be performed as described previously (Reinert, Lütticken et al. 2003;&#xD;
      Reinert 2004; Reinert, Jacobs et al. 2005). For the classical detection of erm(B) and mef(A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotyping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal strains will be serotyped by Neufeld's Quellung reaction using type and factor&#xD;
      sera provided by the Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population to be Included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All November 2008 newborns of the Ajlun city (ca 3676/year) - equals 250-300 child/month&#xD;
      included in the vaccination program in the time period 1.04.2009 to 28.04.2009 will have&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swab before the first dose of PCV-7 and a second swab before the third dose at&#xD;
      12th month of age, and a third swab 3 months after the third dose. Swabs will be sent to a&#xD;
      reference lab at the German-Jordanian University for identification, serotyping, and&#xD;
      resistance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects per Study Group (if applicable): 250-300 infants. Birth cohort in Ajlun is&#xD;
      3676/year representing 250-300 child/month. The study will be conducted on newborns of Jan&#xD;
      2009 coming for the vaccination at their third month of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The frequency of NP carriage, serotype distribution&#xD;
      and antimicrobial resistance patterns of the strains in infants less than 2 years old who are&#xD;
      not attending daily care centers, who live in rural areas. As there is no truly efficacy in&#xD;
      this project, determination and assessment of the reduction in vaccine type pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage as a result of vaccination, so that in this project we will model the impact of a&#xD;
      routine program with the 7v PCV based on the serotype coverage in the country. known&#xD;
      documented effectiveness in other countries using the same schedule, since it is well known&#xD;
      that the 7v PCV can prevent. Rate of resistant strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: Statistical analysis will be done after completion of the&#xD;
      project, epidemiological statistics including: Calculate the percentage of Nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      Carriage with vaccine type and non vaccine type at each time of isolation from each newborn,&#xD;
      resistance to antibiotics (percentage of resistance, MIC50, MIC90 and range): demographic&#xD;
      analysis for age, sex, and others like presence of a child within the house who attends&#xD;
      school, socio-economical level, antibiotic use before the last 30 days, sleeping room- alone&#xD;
      or with siblings and presence of a smoker in the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) Approval: Include&#xD;
      information about the IRB/IEC, confirming that its composition and mechanism for provision of&#xD;
      approval are consistent with International Conference on Harmonization, Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and/or local and regional&#xD;
      requirements and that all necessary IRB/IEC approval and Competent Authority approvals will&#xD;
      be obtained in connection with the proposed research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent/Privacy Authorization: Include information on the manner in which informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained and adherence to applicable regulations including applicable privacy&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled infants in the daily care centers, the parents or the mother or father would be&#xD;
      respectfully asked to sign a document of agreement for the vaccination with the 7v PCV, and&#xD;
      to take NP swabs from the infants enrolled, and to take data for protocoling and those&#xD;
      parents will be educated on the benefits of the vaccination before vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Started in June 2009 to August 2009, with collection of 377 NP-samples from 2 months&#xD;
      age infants after the first injection with 7v PCV in Ajlun. As a result 133 strains of&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated.&#xD;
