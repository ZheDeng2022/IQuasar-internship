      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease apolipoprotein&#xD;
      B-100-containing lipoproteins by increasing their fractional catabolic rates through&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor-mediated uptake. Their influence on hepatic secretion&#xD;
      of these lipoproteins is controversial. The current study investigates whether simvastatin&#xD;
      influences lipoprotein secretion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      3-Hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) have an&#xD;
      established role in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Their efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in secondary and primary prevention has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in large prospective trials. HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors inhibit competitively&#xD;
      the rate-limiting enzyme of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. As a consequence, the&#xD;
      intracellular pool of free cholesterol decreases and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors&#xD;
      are up-regulated, leading to an increased receptor-mediated clearance of LDL from plasma.&#xD;
      This mechanism is responsible for a large proportion of their cholesterol-lowering effect.&#xD;
      However, a statin-induced decrease in lipoprotein production has also been proposed as a&#xD;
      mechanism for their lipid-lowering effects. The underlying mechanisms in vivo, however, that&#xD;
      would mediate such an effect, are not fully understood. Except for their pronounced&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering properties, statins have also a modest effect (about 15 to 20%) in&#xD;
      decreasing triglyceride concentrations. In subjects with high intra-abdominal fat stores, an&#xD;
      increased flux of free fatty acids to the liver produces an increased rate of hepatic&#xD;
      triglyceride synthesis, which in turn leads to increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)&#xD;
      production, since the latter is partly determined by the intracellular availability of&#xD;
      triglycerides. This is also found in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and there are a&#xD;
      number of studies showing that in this pathophysiologic state statins are able to decrease&#xD;
      lipoprotein production. Interestingly, in obese individuals it has been shown that statins&#xD;
      increase the catabolism of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins but do not alter their rates of&#xD;
      production or secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we focus on subjects with near normal body weight (mean body mass index&#xD;
      25 +- 3 kg/m2) and normal serum triglyceride concentrations to investigate, in the fasting&#xD;
      state, whether statins influence hepatic lipoprotein production. Since recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that the supply of cholesterol available for incorporation into nascent lipoprotein&#xD;
      particles also exerts a regulatory influence on apoB secretion by the liver, we investigate&#xD;
      in addition the acute inhibitory effects of a high bolus dose of simvastatin in order to&#xD;
      stimulate LDL receptor expression to a maximum degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the present study is to determine the influence of simvastatin on apoB-100&#xD;
      appearance rates and lipoprotein kinetics in fasting non-obese subjects with moderate&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. For this purpose, each subject will be investigated with three turnover&#xD;
      protocols: once without treatment, once during chronic simvastatin treatment at a standard&#xD;
      dosage, and once during chronic simvastatin treatment after an additional acute-on-chronic&#xD;
      high bolus dose of simvastatin.&#xD;
