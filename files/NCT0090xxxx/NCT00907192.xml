      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the frequency of self-reported over and under use of opioid analgesics in&#xD;
           patients with advanced cancer. Patients with advanced cancer are those patients who have&#xD;
           been described to have either one of the following: recurrent disease, those that have&#xD;
           failed multiple chemotherapies (more than second line therapy), locally advanced&#xD;
           disease, and metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the association between patients' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about&#xD;
           opioids, and frequency of deviation in opioid use with patients' demographic&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine association between alcohol abuse/chemical coping and self-reported&#xD;
           deviations in opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the association between the use of opioids and patient-related barriers to&#xD;
           opioid use.&#xD;

      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you start the study, the research nurse will check your medical record to see if you&#xD;
      are eligible to take part in this study. Information will be recorded about your demographics&#xD;
      (such as age, marital status, ethnicity, education level, and gender), medical history (such&#xD;
      as the type of cancer and level of pain), and prescriptions (such as the name of any opioid&#xD;
      drugs, doses, and schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be interviewed by the&#xD;
      study staff before a regular visit with your doctor. You will be asked some questions about&#xD;
      your use of pain drugs and other knowledge and/or attitudes that you may have about them. You&#xD;
      may also be asked for general information (such as your age, marital status, or educational&#xD;
      level) if it was not available in your chart and medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, you will complete 5 short questionnaires about your use of pain drugs,&#xD;
      your attitudes about the pain drugs and their use, and concerns that you may have about your&#xD;
      use of these pain drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take about 5-10 minutes for the interview and another 10-15 minutes to complete all&#xD;
      the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your interview and questionnaire responses will not be shared with your regular doctor unless&#xD;
      the study staff feels that you maybe be at harm. If you feel you need a doctor's opinion&#xD;
      about anything that is asked in the interview and/or questionnaires, please contact your&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your interview and questionnaire responses will only be used for this research study and will&#xD;
      not be shared with your family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the interview and questionnaires, your participation in this study will be&#xD;
      over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 200 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients must be given prescriptions for around the clock (ATC) and as needed (for&#xD;
             breakthrough pain) oral opioids for cancer pain on the previous visit to the&#xD;
             Palliative Care Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be able to understand, read, write, and speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have no clinical evidence of cognitive impairment, as determined by the&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients who have the caregiver as the primary person that does the management of&#xD;
             opioid medication intake will be excluded as analysis is focused on patients' and not&#xD;
             the family or caregivers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs as it relates to the&#xD;
             primary objective.&#xD;
