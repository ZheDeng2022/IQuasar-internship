      The purpose of this study is to determine whether maintenance renal transplant patients&#xD;
      receiving Myfortic can reduce or discontinue GI prophylaxis medications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GI prophylaxis is common post kidney transplant and is routinely used in patients receiving a&#xD;
      variety of different immunosuppressive regimens. Cellcept and prednisone are often the&#xD;
      biggest concern for GI distress and GI ulcers. Routine use of GI prophylaxis medications&#xD;
      post-transplant are potentially one mental obstacle to transplant clinicians being fully&#xD;
      persuaded of the GI neutral effect of myfortic in the immunosuppressive regimen. Patients&#xD;
      receiving myfortic (as part of the conversion in the US02 study) are theoretically at a&#xD;
      reduced risk for GI upset and development of GI ulcers. These patients are ideal candidates&#xD;
      to discontinue their GI prophylaxis medications while taking myfortic.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have completed the parent study, US02.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on GI medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving Myfortic (all dosages are allowed), neoral or tacrolimus&#xD;
             with or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for at&#xD;
             least two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with and/or without mild GI complaints (e.g. upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia,&#xD;
             anorexia, nausea, vomiting) with or without diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the&#xD;
             inclusion period. The test should be performed at Baseline visit. If positive, the&#xD;
             patient will not be included. Effective contraception must be used during the trial,&#xD;
             and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and&#xD;
             from whom written informed consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of graft rejection or treatment of acute rejection within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received an investigational immunosuppressive drug within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are&#xD;
             pregnant and/or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of&#xD;
             &lt;1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia (&lt;4,000/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt;9.0g/dL prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically significant infection requiring continued therapy, severe&#xD;
             diarrhea or active peptic ulcer disease that would interfere with the appropriate&#xD;
             conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe liver disease (incl. abnormal liver profile i.e. AST, ALT or total&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;or= 3 times ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal physical or laboratory findings of clinical significance within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             inclusion which would interfere with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of drug and/or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to self-administer the GSRS, GIQLI and PGWBI questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving &gt;10mg/day prednisone dose.&#xD;
