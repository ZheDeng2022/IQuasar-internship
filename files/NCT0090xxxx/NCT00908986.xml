      The objective of this study is to assess the as efficacy of rituximab as induction therapy in&#xD;
      membranous lupus nephritis. Safety and tolerability will additionally be assessed. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive open-label 2 courses of rituximab at baseline and at 6 months. They will be&#xD;
      followed monthly for 18 months to assess response and durability of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis: B cell depletion will be an effective safe and well tolerated treatment for&#xD;
      membranous lupus nephritis (Class V).&#xD;
