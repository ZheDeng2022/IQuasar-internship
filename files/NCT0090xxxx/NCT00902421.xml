  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The urologic literature suggests that there is an association between a variety of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders and incontinence. Most notably, depression is found in a significant&#xD;
      percentage of patients with urinary incontinence. Depression also occurs in other conditions&#xD;
      associated with urinary urge incontinence, such as aging and dementia, and in neurologic&#xD;
      disorders such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. Correction of some neurologic disorders&#xD;
      eliminates both depression and urge incontinence. Although chronic medical disorders such as&#xD;
      urge incontinence may lead to depression, an alternative hypothesis is that these two&#xD;
      conditions share a common neurochemical pathogenesis. Lowering monoamines such as serotonin&#xD;
      and noradrenaline in the central nervous system (CNS) leads to depression and urinary&#xD;
      frequency and a hyperactive bladder in experimental animals. Thus, depression may not only be&#xD;
      the result of persistent urinary incontinence, but individuals with altered CNS monoamines&#xD;
      could manifest both depression and an overactive bladder. The latter condition may lead to&#xD;
      urge incontinence, urinary frequency, urgency, or enuresis. Uncovering further evidence for&#xD;
      such a linkage could serve as the basis for the development of genetic markers and novel&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions for these two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSRI on OAB&#xD;
      patients who does not respond to the antimuscarinic agents.&#xD;

      -  3-month, prospective, open-label, comparative trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the changes of OAB symptoms in patients who did not showed&#xD;
                therapeutic benefits after 3 months of treatment with antimuscarinic agents and who&#xD;
                then treated with SSRI (escitalopram) for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the change of patient perception of urgency and bladder condition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the change of patient perception of quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the change of psychologic parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the patient perception of treatment benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To find the predictive factors of patients who respond to the 3 month-treatment&#xD;
                with escitalopram&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To explore the efficacy of escitalopram on the tolerability and safety&#xD;
