    <textblock>
      The investigators propose such a trial to compare a Musculoskeletal and Obstetric Management&#xD;
      (MOM) program to standard obstetric care alone for lower back pain/pelvic pain (LBP/PP)&#xD;
      during and after pregnancy.&#xD;

      Initially patients will have a Baseline Musculoskeletal Exam (BME) at 24-28 weeks pregnancy&#xD;
      at which point self reported tests/questionnaires will be administered as well as functional&#xD;
      testing (see below &quot;procedures for research&quot;) performed. At this point patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into either Standard Obstetric Management or Musculoskeletal and Obstetric Care&#xD;
      (MOMS) groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Obstetric Management : All patients (both groups) will be seen for standard&#xD;
      obstetric care typically once every month. Complicated cases may need to be seen more&#xD;
      frequently. There is no standard obstetric care approach to LBP/PP in pregnancy, thus,&#xD;
      patients in the standard obstetric care group will receive limited, although realistic&#xD;
      interventions for LBP/PP. In addition, patients will attend one-on-one educational sessions&#xD;
      on pre-natal care. The women in this group will have a minimum of 4 pre-natal care sessions.&#xD;
      These visits will be timed to match the additional time and care given to the MOM group. The&#xD;
      timed sessions will be compared with the MOMS group at monthly intervals to maintain&#xD;
      treatment attention equality. Patients will have a complete medical assessment including&#xD;
      history and physical examination administered by their obstetrical provider. As part of their&#xD;
      intervention for LBP/PP, evaluation of lifestyle and work activities may be taken into&#xD;
      consideration. Modification of lifestyle may be recommended including, rest and general&#xD;
      aerobic exercise. Short-lived heat treatment (i.e. heating pad for no more than 10 minutes)&#xD;
      is another possibility. Use of analgesia may be prescribed, including acetaminophen and NSAID&#xD;
      preparations, or narcotics if deemed necessary by the provider. Narcotic use and centrally&#xD;
      acting muscle relaxants are typically not encouraged, but at times maybe necessary to help&#xD;
      control pain. For pain that is debilitating and worsening, consultation with orthopedic or&#xD;
      neurological services may be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal and Obstetric Management (MOM): In addition to their standard obstetric&#xD;
      visits, patients in this group will see the MOM team every one to two weeks depending on&#xD;
      severity of symptoms. We have found through treating pregnancy-related pain that visits every&#xD;
      one to two weeks is sufficient as the majority of the cases are mild to moderate&#xD;
      presentations of non-inflammatory pain. A standard history will be taken and the patient will&#xD;
      be assessed for musculoskeletal conditions to identify signs of serious illness, neurological&#xD;
      deficit and/or orthopedic instability. If any of these conditions are evident, the patient&#xD;
      will be immediately referred for specialist consultation. The patients in this MOM group will&#xD;
      be treated with biobehavioral management, manual therapy and spinal stabilization exercise as&#xD;
      described in detail below. The obstetric physician and chiropractic physician will have&#xD;
      coordinated schedules at each clinic. For pain that is debilitating and worsening,&#xD;
      consultation with orthopedic or neurological services will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at 33 weeks gestation and 3 months post-partum and research&#xD;
      end-points collected. Please see next cell for detailed description of these functional and&#xD;
      endurance tests as well as self reported test.&#xD;
