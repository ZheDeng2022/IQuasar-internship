  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who are undergoing&#xD;
      Biventricular (BiV) Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) implantation in whom&#xD;
      optimization of atrioventricular (AV) delay is not possible due to prolonged&#xD;
      inter-atrial/intra-atrial delay. These patients would benefit from left atrial pacing, and if&#xD;
      a significant number of patients fall into this group, it may be beneficial to develop a left&#xD;
      atrial lead.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study. Patients referred for BiV-ICD implantation or&#xD;
      upgrade will be implanted as is routinely done, with the following modifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrical readings will be taken at various points in the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RA lead will temporarily be placed on the atrial septum for these readings (normally&#xD;
           it is actively fixed to the RA appendage wall). The final RA lead position will be&#xD;
           actively fixed to the RA appendage wall as is standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CS lead will be placed in the proximal coronary sinus for these readings prior to&#xD;
           passing it distally to pace the LV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) 30 days post-procedure. This&#xD;
           will be coordinated to coincide with their standard 30-day follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduction times between the left atrium and right atrium (inter-atrial conduction time) will&#xD;
      be measured at the time of implant, and left atrial contraction time will be measured by TTE&#xD;
      at the follow-up appointment. For patients in whom the inter-atrial conduction time plus the&#xD;
      left atrial contraction time is greater than the right-atrial to right-ventricular conduction&#xD;
      time, it is not possible to optimize the AV delay. The proportion of patients who fall into&#xD;
      this group will be the main endpoint of the study. Patients will be followed for this study&#xD;
      until their follow-up appointment and TTE at 30 days post-implant. The total sample size of&#xD;
      this study will be 50 patients. We expect to consent approximately 75 patients, expecting&#xD;
      that 1/3 will not meet all entrance criteria or will withdraw early.&#xD;
