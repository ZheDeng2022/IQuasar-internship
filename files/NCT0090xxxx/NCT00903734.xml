    <textblock>
      The goal of this screening portion of this clinical research study is to learn if you are&#xD;
      eligible to take part in a clinical research study using Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride)&#xD;
      and either Erbitux (cetuximab), Velcade (bortezomib), or Sprycel (dasatinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of the screening portion of this clinical research study show that you are&#xD;
      eligible to take part in one of the studies described above, the study drug that you will be&#xD;
      assigned to take will depend on the results of biomarker analysis performed as a part of the&#xD;
      screening tests described below. Biomarkers are chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood/tissue that&#xD;
      may be related to how your body might react to the study drug.&#xD;

      Drug Administration and Study visits for Erlotinib hydrochloride:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will be taking Erlotinib hydrochloride in this study, you will take Erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride by mouth daily at least 1 hour before eating and 2 hours after eating. You will&#xD;
      have study visits once a month. If you continue to be on study longer than 2 cycles, study&#xD;
      visits may become less frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking, including over-the-counter drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 8 weeks on study, you will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease. You will have a CT or MRI scan every 8 to 12 weeks after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking Erlotinib hydrochloride for as long as you are benefitting. You will&#xD;
      be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. If the&#xD;
      disease gets worse, the study doctor may assign you to 1 of 3 studies. The study doctor will&#xD;
      discuss this in more detail with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this screening study will be over after all of the screening tests and&#xD;
      procedures described above have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 102 participants will take part in this study. All&#xD;
      will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with pathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic cancer that is&#xD;
             refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or who have had no&#xD;
             standard therapy that induces a CR rate of at least 10% or improves survival by at&#xD;
             least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have tumor tissue available, either from an archival specimen, or from a&#xD;
             recent biopsy, to be analyzed for EGFR mutation. Patients must sign consent for the&#xD;
             umbrella protocol prior testing for EGFR mutation. Patients will be eligible if they&#xD;
             have an EGFR-sensitive mutation, OR if they have an EGFR-resistant mutation, OR if&#xD;
             they do not have an EGFR mutation, but have benefited from EGFR inhibitor therapy&#xD;
             (including either &gt;/= 4 months of stable disease [SD] OR a &gt;/= partial response [PR]).&#xD;

             or active infection; altered mental status or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements and/or obscure study results.&#xD;
