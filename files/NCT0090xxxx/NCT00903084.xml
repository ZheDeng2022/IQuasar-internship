  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a hair test can reveal how much of the anti-HIV medication&#xD;
      tenofovir a person without HIV has been exposed to.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new strategy for the prevention of HIV infection. It&#xD;
      involves providing antiretroviral medications-those that treat HIV infections-to people&#xD;
      before they are exposed to HIV. In clinical trials of PrEP, several of which are currently&#xD;
      under way, accurate measurements are needed of how much exposure participants have to the&#xD;
      PrEP medications. Current methods, such as self-reports of medication adherence or pill&#xD;
      counting, can lead to inaccurate readings of PrEP exposure because participants may forget to&#xD;
      take pills and individual differences may affect levels of exposure. Measuring PrEP exposure&#xD;
      levels in hair yields an objective marker of exposure that is not subject to self-report&#xD;
      errors and that takes into account individual differences. This study will test the use of a&#xD;
      hair sample for assessing the level of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an&#xD;
      antiretroviral medication, in people not infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 9 months. Participants will undergo baseline testing&#xD;
      and then will be randomly assigned to begin one of three conditions, based on dosing&#xD;
      schedule: receiving TDF 2, 4, or 7 days per week. All participants will complete each of&#xD;
      these dosing schedules, but the order in which they are completed will be randomly assigned.&#xD;
      Each dosing schedule will last 6 weeks, with a break of several weeks between them. During&#xD;
      each dosing schedule, study staff will confirm that participants are taking each scheduled&#xD;
      dose by watching them take the pills on weekdays and calling them on weekends. Follow-up&#xD;
      visits will occur at Days 1, 21, and 42 of each dosing schedule. During the baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up visits, the following will be completed: an HIV rapid test; counseling about HIV&#xD;
      prevention; a brief physical exam; a talk with a staff member about health, symptoms, and&#xD;
      other medications; a blood draw, which will be used for several tests; collection of a urine&#xD;
      sample and pregnancy test; and optional donation of a sample of pubic hair. On the last day&#xD;
      of each dosing schedule, a small sample of hair will be cut from each participant's scalp. An&#xD;
      additional follow-up visit will occur after participants complete 4 weeks of the 7-day dosing&#xD;
      schedule. This visit will last 24 hours and will involve collection of additional blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
