    <textblock>
      Hypoxia is recognized to be an independent predictor of clinical outcome in oncology. PET&#xD;
      using [18F]-FMISO has been described to be useful for the non invasive assessment of hypoxia&#xD;
      in cancer. The use of this radiotracer for brain tumours is very limited and there is no&#xD;
      standard to acquire and quantify [18F]-FMISO uptake. So there is a need for a methodological&#xD;
      evaluation of this PET tracer The purpose of this research is to define optimal parameters&#xD;
      for acquisition and data exploitation to quantify [18F]-FMISO uptake and so predict clinical&#xD;
      outcome in glioblastomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low sensitivity to radiation of glioblastoma is partly caused by hypoxia. Hypoxia in tumours&#xD;
      is not predicted by tumour size. Detecting and monitoring tissue oxygenation are of great&#xD;
      interest to modify therapeutic strategies, including local dose escalation for radiotherapy&#xD;
      or select chemotherapeutic agents with better impact in glioblastomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET with appropriate radiotracers, especially [18F]-FMISO, enables non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      hypoxia. [18F]-FMISO only accumulates in viable hypoxic cells. So, it has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that PET using 18F-FMISO is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. But there isn't any&#xD;
      optimal acquisition protocol or standardized images quantification treatment. Thus, the&#xD;
      interpretation of [18F]-FMISO PET images and the predictive value of [18F]-FMISO SUV&#xD;
      (Standardized Uptake Value) remain unclear explaining the need of methodological approaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia is one of the worst prognostic factors of clinical outcome in glioblastomas. Today,&#xD;
      it is well admitted that hypoxia is heterogeneous, variable within different tumour types and&#xD;
      varied spatially and temporally. Hypoxia induced proteomic and gene expression changes that&#xD;
      lead to increase angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. So the hypoxic fraction in solid&#xD;
      tumours reduces their sensitivity to conventional treatment modalities, modulating&#xD;
      therapeutic response to ionizing radiation or certain chemotherapeutic agents. This is&#xD;
      particularly important in glioblastomas. Hypoxic cells in solid tumours could influence local&#xD;
      failure following radiotherapy and has been associated with malignant progression, loco&#xD;
      regional spread and distant metastases and represents an increasing probability of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the non-invasive determination and monitoring of the oxygenation status of tumours is&#xD;
      of importance to classify patients' outcome and modify therapeutic strategies in those&#xD;
      tumours. Actually the oxygenation status of individual tumours is not assessed routinely.&#xD;
      Numerous different approaches have been used to identify hypoxia in tumours. Eppendorf oxygen&#xD;
      probe measurements (pO2 histography) may be considered as a 'gold standard' for hypoxia in&#xD;
      human malignancies. However, it is an invasive method being confined to superficial, well&#xD;
      accessible tumours and requires many measures. PET using [18F]Fluoro-deoxyglucose&#xD;
      ([18F]-FDG), allows non-invasive imaging of glucose metabolism and takes a growing place in&#xD;
      cancer staging, but [18F]-FDG can't assess correctly the oxygenation status of tumours and is&#xD;
      not suitable for brain tumor. PET with appropriate radiotracers enables non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of presence and distribution of hypoxia in tumours. Nitroimidazoles are a class of&#xD;
      electron affinic molecules that were shown to accumulate in hypoxic cells in cultures and in&#xD;
      vivo. [18F]-FMISO is the most frequently employed tracer; its intracellular retention is&#xD;
      dependent on oxygen concentration. Consequently [18F]-FMISO has been used as a non-invasive&#xD;
      technique for detection of hypoxia in human. Different authors have demonstrated that it is&#xD;
      suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. Thus, [18F]-FMISO PET has been studied to evaluate&#xD;
      prognosis and predict treatment response. However, some investigators report an unclear&#xD;
      correlation between Eppendorf measurements and standardized uptake values (SUV). This&#xD;
      observation may be explained by the structural complexity of hypoxic tumour tissues.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is a need of standardized procedures to acquire and quantify [18F]-FMISO&#xD;
      uptake. Actually the use of this tracer is very limited in clinic and the academic studies&#xD;
      have included small populations of patients and suffer of the heterogeneity of technical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal acquisition protocol and treatment&#xD;
      parameters enable to describe [18F]-FMISO uptake in glioblastomas known to be hardly&#xD;
      influenced by hypoxia. Then, validate [18F]-FMISO-PET as a prognostic maker of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will introduce a pretherapy [18F]-FMISO PET-CT in the treatment planning of patients&#xD;
      suffering of different newly diagnosed glioblastoma and eligible to a radical treatment with&#xD;
      curative intent, consisting of conformational radiotherapy and chemotherapy. [18F]-FMISO&#xD;
      PET-CT results will not be take into account for the patient management. We will test&#xD;
      different acquisition protocols and use a wild panel of quantification parameters issued from&#xD;
      published studies and original ones developed by our team enable to describe [18F]-FMISO&#xD;
      uptake. Patients will be followed clinically and para-clinically during one year after the&#xD;
      end of the treatment according to the edited recommendations of each tumour type and grade to&#xD;
      analyze outcome (failure is define as persistent disease in the primary site, progression of&#xD;
      disease, locoregional relapse after complete response or distant metastasis). Thus we will be&#xD;
      able to measure failure free survival and determine overall survival.&#xD;
