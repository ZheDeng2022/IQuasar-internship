  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Skin abscesses are a growing problem in the general pediatric population around&#xD;
      the world. While the standard treatment for an abscess/boil is incision and drainage, many&#xD;
      physicians also prescribe antibiotics, despite the lack of evidence that antibiotics are&#xD;
      necessary to help the wound heal. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether&#xD;
      antibiotics are necessary after incision and drainage of a skin abscess in children. This is&#xD;
      an important question because medical evidence has shown that using antibiotics when they are&#xD;
      not needed has contributed to the increase of bacterial antibiotic resistance. In fact,&#xD;
      several of the antibiotics that successfully killed Staph bacteria several years ago are now&#xD;
      no longer effective because of antibiotic resistance. Now resistant forms of Staph bacteria,&#xD;
      called &quot;Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus&quot; (CA-MRSA), account for 50-85%&#xD;
      of all pediatric skin abscesses. If antibiotics are not necessary then withholding them when&#xD;
      appropriate may help slow the progression of antibiotic-resistant Staph infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The investigators believe that antibiotics are no better&#xD;
      than placebo at achieving a cure after drainage of an abscess in a child. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to answer the question: Do antibiotics after abscess drainage result in a&#xD;
      better chance of cure than placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: If abscess drainage alone is shown to be as effective as drainage followed&#xD;
      by antibiotics, then the routine use of antibiotics for this problem could be avoided. This&#xD;
      would help limit the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria (especially CA-MRSA) in&#xD;
      communities around the world. A well-designed study may provide the evidence to change the&#xD;
      way children are treated for abscesses in a future where antibiotic resistant bacteria will&#xD;
      be even more of a public health challenge.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  has only one localized abscess (&gt;/= 2 cm of erythema and induration), which is&#xD;
                  clinically judged to be amenable to incision and drainage. (i.e., on clinical&#xD;
                  exam their is fluctuance, erythema, induration, and/or purulent drainage)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has an abscess that is Â± 7 days from onset, who requires surgical incision and&#xD;
                  drainage for a skin and soft-tissue abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  children &lt; 6 months of age&#xD;
