  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for head and neck and lung cancer includes chemotherapy, radiation and&#xD;
      surgery. For patients with cancer of head and neck or lung that recurs after surgery and/or&#xD;
      radiation, or has spread to other parts of body, chemotherapy using cisplatin can slow down&#xD;
      tumor growth and extend lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, azacitidine, can block the ability of some cancer cells to replicate, and has&#xD;
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndrome, which&#xD;
      is a slowly developing blood cell-related cancer. In laboratory and animal experiments using&#xD;
      head and neck and lung cancer cells, azacitidine has been shown to be a cisplatin &quot;helper&quot;,&#xD;
      (that is, it makes cisplatin more effective in stopping the growth of head and neck and lung&#xD;
      cancer. )&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the combination of azacitidine and cisplatin has not been used in patients with head&#xD;
      and neck or lung cancer, the investigators are performing this study combining azacitidine&#xD;
      and cisplatin to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the study drug may have on patients&#xD;
      with advanced head and neck or lung cancer. The investigators are doing this study because&#xD;
      they would like to find a better treatment for these types of cancer.&#xD;

      Azacitidine will be given with standard dose of cisplatin. At the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      three patients will be treated with low dose of azacitidine. If that dose does not cause bad&#xD;
      side effects, then the dose will slowly be made higher for new patients who take part in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive azacitidine as a once-a-day subcutaneous (under the skin) injection&#xD;
      every day from day 1 to day 5 of 28 days in this study. Cisplatin is given intravenously on&#xD;
      day 8. This 28-day or 4-week period of time is called a cycle. Cycles are repeated every four&#xD;
      weeks for as long as the physician recommends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, patients will need the following tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam - This will be done weekly during first 2 weeks of every 4-week treatment&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for blood counts - These will be done every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for kidney function, liver function, and to measure electrolytes - These&#xD;
           will be done every week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for research study - This will be done weekly during first cycle, then&#xD;
           weekly during the first 2 weeks on the subsequent treatment cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays or scans - These will be done once every 8 weeks.&#xD;
