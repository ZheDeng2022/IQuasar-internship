    <textblock>
      Rationale: Spray cryotherapy (SCT) using liquid nitrogen has been safely and effectively used&#xD;
      in the esophagus, airways and pleura. Treatment with SCT for central airway stenosis may&#xD;
      provide an effective, and more durable and perhaps safer alternative to the current&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the feasibility of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of&#xD;
           malignant and benign central airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the safety of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of&#xD;
           malignant and benign central airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the efficacy of using Spray cryotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of&#xD;
           malignant and benign central airway disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study will be a prospective, single arm, open label intervention study&#xD;
      performed at the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands Study population: The&#xD;
      study population exists of 25 patients with malignant or benign central airway disease.&#xD;
      Patients in which current treatment options are regarded to be suboptimal can be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: TruFreeze Spray CryoTherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility is defined as being able to apply the SCT as planned in one, or more&#xD;
      bronchoscopies according to the instructions for use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by capturing all adverse events (AEs) that occur 1) during the SCT&#xD;
      procedure, and 2) all AEs that occur until hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured using 1) patient reported outcomes (questionnaires), 2) percentage&#xD;
      improvement in airway stenosis, 3) durability of treatment effect, 4) need to re-intervene&#xD;
      with other therapies because of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden, risks and benefit associated with participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that will be recruited and participate in this prospective clinical trial have a&#xD;
      severe central airway disease which is highly symptomatic for which current available&#xD;
      therapies are either very difficult to perform, are hazardous, have no real benefit, or just&#xD;
      simply not available yet. The current treatment risks of this patient group are high,&#xD;
      especially in the patients where the airway patency is at risk. The main additional risk&#xD;
      associated with the use of SCT is the occurrence of a pneumothorax. Patients participating&#xD;
      will adhere to their current medical care, with the one addition of a voluntary follow-up&#xD;
      bronchoscopy after SCT.&#xD;
