  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMCgp100-102 is a Phase I/II study of the weekly intra-patient escalation dose regimen with&#xD;
      IMCgp100 as a single agent in participants with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM). According to&#xD;
      this regimen, all participants in the trial received 2 weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose&#xD;
      level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose&#xD;
      escalation commenced at the third weekly dose at C1D15. The Phase I testing of the&#xD;
      intra-patient escalation dosing regimen is designed to achieve a higher exposure and maximal&#xD;
      plasma concentration of IMCgp100 after doses at Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) and thereafter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical study of IMCgp100 in participants with advanced uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II study of IMCgp100 administered on a weekly basis with an intra-patient&#xD;
      escalation dosing regimen. The intra-patient escalation occurred at the third weekly dose on&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15). According to this regimen, all participants in the trial received 2&#xD;
      weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D-QW), and then a dose escalation commenced at the third weekly dose at C1D15 with&#xD;
      the goal to achieve a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for the&#xD;
      weekly dosing regimen (RP2D-QW). The dose escalation identified the intra-patient escalation&#xD;
      regimen (RP2D-IE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I portion of the study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.The recommended&#xD;
      Phase II dose of the intra-patient escalation dose regimen (RP2D-IE) was identified and&#xD;
      expansion cohorts in metastatic uveal melanoma was accrued based on prior therapy.&#xD;
