      Background: The active video game (VGA) it has been studied how much to the physiological&#xD;
      factors of your practice. The objective was to determine whether an AVG session promotes&#xD;
      post-exercise hypotension (PEH) similar to walking exercise. Methods: Fifteen hypertensive&#xD;
      (49.0 ± 1.6 years), both genders performed five randomized sessions, lasting 60 minutes: 1)&#xD;
      AVG, 2) sedentary video game (SVG), 3) walk treadmill with moderate intensity (WMI), 4) walk&#xD;
      treadmill with similar intensity to VGA (WGI), and 5) control without exercise (CON).&#xD;
      Intensity was determined by Heart rate (HR) and Perceived Exertion (PE). Blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      and cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) measurements were taken at rest and every 10 minutes&#xD;
      post exercise for 60 minutes.&#xD;

      Volunteers of study Participated of this study 15 hypertensive patients of both genders, five&#xD;
      of them men. All participants were obese grade I and were using drug therapy. Were adopted as&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: 1) be hypertensive; 2) age between 45 and 59 years old and 3) not perform&#xD;
      regular exercise; 4) not use of beta-blockers drugs and calcium channel blockers; 5) not be&#xD;
      affected by labyrinthitis; 6) women be not in menopause, and, 4) be not practitioners of VGA.&#xD;
      Already as exclusion criteria: 1) modifying the antihypertensive treatment during treatment;&#xD;
      and 2) Not have developed the ability to play during the adaptation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee of the University Hospital Lauro&#xD;
      Wanderley under protocol nº 201/11 and after subjects having been cleared up all the&#xD;
      procedures of the study, the subjects were asked to sign the Term of Free and Informed&#xD;
      Consent (TFIC) according to the Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The subjects were submitted to five protocols lasting 60 minutes: 1- Game in VGA&#xD;
      (Dance Dance Revolution ®); 2- Walking/running reproducing the intensity obtained in the&#xD;
      session with VGA; 3- Walking/running with intensity between 60% and 85% of MHR; 4- sedentary&#xD;
      video game (VGS) and 5- A session control without exercise (CON), where participants remained&#xD;
      at rest. The order of sessions was determined randomly and were carried at with a minimum of&#xD;
      48 hours between them. The intensity was monitored by measurements of HR and PE. BP and&#xD;
      cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) were assessed before and for a period of 60 minutes after&#xD;
      exercise, at intervals of 10 minutes between each measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation to the game and instructions before study Before starting the experimental&#xD;
      protocols, the volunteers performed three sessions of adaptation with 20 minutes duration&#xD;
      each. In these sessions, they were instructed about the proper way of handling the VGA and&#xD;
      VGS instruments, which were passed the necessary guidance on the different directions of&#xD;
      arrows used in the game. These three sessions proved sufficient for them to understand the&#xD;
      dynamics of the two games and obtain enough coordination to play without interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adaptation period, a schedule was made with voluntaries to the experimental procedures&#xD;
      and they were instructed not to drink caffeine-containing foods and drinking alcoholic&#xD;
      beverages for at least 48 hours before of the each experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVG and SVG procedures The VGA utilized was Dance Dance Revolution® (SSD Company Ltd., Shiga,&#xD;
      Japan) to Playstation 2® (San Mateo, CA, USA). In this VGA the practitioner simulates a&#xD;
      synchronized dance for footsteps ordered on a carpet (matpad) containing the areas to be&#xD;
      trodden that replace traditional buttons of a control VGS. The style of the music used in the&#xD;
      game is similar to those used in gyms. The game consists of passing arrows in four directions&#xD;
      that appears on the screen at randomly and in the rhythm of different songs contained in the&#xD;
      game. When the arrows pass on the screen, the player must step on the corresponding arrow on&#xD;
      the carpet, in the music rhythm. At the end of each music, immediately next music was&#xD;
      selected to minimize the time interval between them. Was connected to the video game a&#xD;
      multimedia projector used as screen, where it was played the game image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VGS game was the same as VGA, with the difference only that the carpet was replaced by&#xD;
      joystick and volunteers remained seated during the game. Both sessions VGA as VGS lasted for&#xD;
      60 minutes. Heart rate was measured every 10 min using um heart rate monitor (Polar ® brand,&#xD;
      model RS800CX, Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Exercise Protocol The subjects performed two aerobic exercise sessions lasting 60&#xD;
      minutes on a treadmill (Moviment® LX160i - Brudden LTDA, Amazon, Brazil). One session was&#xD;
      performed in intensity similar to the intensity reached during the session VGA and the other&#xD;
      session was performed with moderate intensity (ranged between 60% to 85% of maximum reserve&#xD;
      heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate was monitored by heart rate monitor (Polar ® brand, model RS800CX, Polar&#xD;
      ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland) every 10 minutes to ensure that volunteers maintain the&#xD;
      predetermined intensity during exercise on treadmill. For the exercise protocol on the&#xD;
      treadmill in the intensity of AVG, the lowest and highest measured heart rate found in the&#xD;
      video game was adopted as a target zone for the heart rate on the treadmill. To the protocol&#xD;
      on moderate intensity, the target heart rate was determined according to equation (equation&#xD;
      1) proposed by Karvonen, et al.20:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equation I FCT = FCR + i%(FCM-FCR), FCT= heart rate training; FCR = heart rate at rest;; FCM&#xD;
      = Maximum heart rate; i% = training intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the rest period the Subjective Perception Scale of Borg effort 21 was presented to the&#xD;
      subjects with indices 6-20 for the subjects become acquainted with fatigue stages that are&#xD;
      from very mild to exhaustive. During the games or exercise on the treadmill, the PE was&#xD;
      questioned every 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Monitoring After the arrival of the subjects to the data collection site, they&#xD;
      were instructed to remain seated for 10 minutes in a quiet room, illuminated with controlled&#xD;
      temperature between 295,1ºC and 298,1ºC and then was measured the baseline BP. New BP&#xD;
      measurements were taken immediately after the end of exercise and for 60 minutes of the post&#xD;
      exercise or video game procedures recovery every 10 minutes. BP was measured by auscultation,&#xD;
      following strictly the protocol proposed in the VI Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension22.&#xD;
      For Was used a aneroid sphygmomanometer (WelkinAlllyn®, Skaneateles Falls, New York, USA)&#xD;
      with an accuracy of two millimeters of mercury and previously calibrated against a mercury&#xD;
      column and a stethoscope Premiun® mark (G-Tech).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Autonomic Modulation (CAM) CAM was determined by recording the variability RR&#xD;
      interval of HR, using the hear rate monitor Polar ® RS800CX (Polar ElectroOy, Kempele,&#xD;
      Finland). The CAM was recorded after 10 minutes of initial rest and recovery post treadmill&#xD;
      or video game procedures for 60 minutes every 10 minutes. Each measure lasted five minutes.&#xD;
      Data were transported through an infrared device to a computer provided with software of the&#xD;
      same manufacturer. The data are analyzed in the frequency domain (sympathetic-vagal balance -&#xD;
      LF / HF) in software Kubios (University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland).&#xD;
