  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Arrest is among the leading causes of death, with survival still well under 50% and&#xD;
      the majority of the survivors suffering from moderate to severe neurologic deficits. The&#xD;
      human, social and economic costs are staggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During resuscitation, damage is mitigated if chest compressions and other medical care are&#xD;
      optimal, allowing some blood to reach the brain and some oxygen to reach the cells. Once the&#xD;
      heart starts beating again, which is called return of spontaneous circulation, brain&#xD;
      perfusion is reestablished, but usually not to normal. The now damaged brain is very fragile,&#xD;
      can be sensitive to any changes in blood pressure or metabolic abnormalities, and swelling&#xD;
      might set in. Hypoperfusion can persist, without the clinician's knowledge. All of these&#xD;
      events further damage the brain and diminish the odds that the patient will regain a normal&#xD;
      life. Therefore, the hours following return to spontaneous circulation are critical to the&#xD;
      patient's future recovery, and constitute a window of opportunity to maximize the brain&#xD;
      ability to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to optimize resuscitative efforts and post-arrest management, clinicians must know&#xD;
      what is actually happening with the most vital organ, the brain. The problem is that it is&#xD;
      very difficult to do in a comatose patient. The available technologies only reveal indirect&#xD;
      evidence of brain suffering, like the swelling on CT-scans, but not to continuously evaluate&#xD;
      at the bedside if the brain actually receives enough blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA recently approved a device named the c-flow, made by ORNIM. This device looks at red&#xD;
      blood cells in the brain and the speed at which they move to evaluate an index of cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion. It does so with sensors put on the patient's forehead, which emit and detect&#xD;
      ultrasounds and infrared light. This index can inform the clinician about the amount of blood&#xD;
      flow the brain receives, and it can be put in place very quickly, even during resuscitative&#xD;
      efforts, and without any danger for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study looks at how well the information obtained with the c-flow matches the one obtained&#xD;
      from other indirect indices and, more importantly, how well it predicts patient outcome. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to establish threshold values of this index of perfusion that predict a&#xD;
      good recovery so that this information may be used to optimize patient's neurological outcome&#xD;
      in the near future.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is undergoing a major paradigm shift, with new emphasis&#xD;
      on optimizing neurological recovery. As a result, Cardio-Cerebral Resuscitation (CCR) is now&#xD;
      the preferred term for describing protocols directed at promoting survival and recovery from&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. Establishing and maintaining brain perfusion is the critical endpoint of&#xD;
      resuscitation; however, there is currently no simple and reliable way to evaluate the&#xD;
      adequacy of brain tissue perfusion in cardiac arrest patients. The overall goal of the NINCA&#xD;
      study is to determine if non-invasive cerebral blood flow index (CFI) can be used as a simple&#xD;
      and effective measurement of brain perfusion during and after resuscitation from cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. Our researchers hypothesize that this monitoring may one day be routinely used to (1)&#xD;
      evaluate the adequacy of chest compressions, (2) avoid brain tissue hypoperfusion induced by&#xD;
      excessive hyperventilation or shivering, (3) serve as an endpoint for goal-directed&#xD;
      hemodynamic support, (4) evaluate the potential for neurological recovery, and (5) help guide&#xD;
      post-cardiac arrest care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications for Further Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of the research will hopefully establish that non- invasive cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow monitoring is feasible during and after CPR; is dependent on adequate MAP, CO,&#xD;
      temperature, SpO2 and ventilation; and is a valid predictor of neurological recovery. If&#xD;
      confirmed, such monitors may one day become part of standard ICU post-cardiac arrest&#xD;
      monitoring and even be part of standard resuscitation equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of optimal CFI thresholds or targets will support future studies to determine&#xD;
      if &quot;goal directed&quot; and individualized post-resuscitation ICU care is feasible using&#xD;
      non-invasive cerebral perfusion indices. This could lead to a new way of optimizing&#xD;
      hemodynamic support, temperature management and ventilation strategies to maintain adequate&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion and improve neurological outcomes.&#xD;
