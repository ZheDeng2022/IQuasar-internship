  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause infections of the ears, sinuses&#xD;
      or lungs. It can also cause more serious infections of the blood or brain. The elderly and&#xD;
      young children are more vulnerable to these types of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccines available at present are effective only on a certain number of strains of the&#xD;
      bacteria. The PnuBioVax vaccine is being developed to work on a broader range of strains.&#xD;
      This study will be looking at the safety and tolerability of the study drug for three&#xD;
      different dosages: 50 μg, 200 μg, and 500 μg compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population eligible to take part in the study are healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
      between 18 and 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will have&#xD;
      received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to participate in&#xD;
      writing. Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the information leaflet&#xD;
      and agreeing to participate. Only subjects who agree to undertake precautions to avoid&#xD;
      pregnancy of either themselves of their partner during the study period will be eligible.&#xD;
      Volunteers will give signed consent for their physician to be notified about their&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;

      This is a phase I study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of PnuBioVax administered on&#xD;
      three occasions 28 days apart at dose levels of 50 µg, 200 µg, and 500 µg in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 8 visits in total; screening period to determine eligibility, 3&#xD;
      treatment periods comprising of an overnight stay at the clinic (days 1, 29 and 57) and 4&#xD;
      outpatient follow up visits (7 days after each dosing period and one on day 85). Volunteers&#xD;
      will also be requested to complete a diary card from day 1 to day 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 Volunteers will take part in this study and will be randomly assigned to each sequential&#xD;
      dose group as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: up to 3 doses of 50 µg of PnuBioVax or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: up to 3 doses of 200 µg of PnuBioVax or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: up to 3 doses of 500 µg of PnuBioVax or placebo Within each cohort, nine&#xD;
           subjects will receive PnuBioVax and three subjects will receive placebo. Each subject&#xD;
           will receive administrations of PnuBioVax or placebo on Days 1, 29 and 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lowest dose of PnuBioVax will be evaluated first (i.e. Cohort 1). Dose escalation will&#xD;
      only proceed in the subsequent cohorts if blinded safety data (adverse events, injection site&#xD;
      reactions, concomitant medication, vital signs and routine laboratory assessments) from day 8&#xD;
      from the 12 subjects in the preceding cohort have been reviewed by the Sponsor and Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and are found to be satisfactory. The Sponsor and Principal Investigator will&#xD;
      also review the safety data after each subsequent dose to ensure repeat dosing does not give&#xD;
      rise to safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed up 7 days after each vaccination and also by telephone 14 and 21&#xD;
      days following each vaccination. Subjects will also be requested to record any adverse events&#xD;
      in a daily diary. Haematology, biochemistry and vital signs will be measured at each follow&#xD;
      up visit (except day 85) and a full safety follow up will be completed 7 days after the third&#xD;
      dose (day 64).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bloods will be drawn for evaluation of the immune response to the PnuBioVax, 28 days&#xD;
      following the first, second and third administrations (Days 29, 57 and 85). The blood draw at&#xD;
      day 85 will also be used for exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of autoantibodies will be assessed at screening (baseline level), and day 85 by&#xD;
      measurement of anti nuclear antibody (ANA) levels.&#xD;
