    <textblock>
      During surgery and after surgery elevated blood glucose levels can lead to poor outcome such&#xD;
      as wound infections. Current technology does not allow close monitoring of glucose levels&#xD;
      often resulting in poor management of glucose levels. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of using a continuous glucose monitor (Dexcom Gen 6 Professional)&#xD;
      during and after surgery. Such a monitor has the potential of monitoring glucose levels&#xD;
      continuously and in real-time, thus allowing better glucose management&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During surgery high blood glucose levels, termed hyperglycemia, are commonly encountered due&#xD;
      to the physiological stress. Hyperglycemia has been associated with complications such as&#xD;
      surgical site infections, adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary events. Optimal glucose&#xD;
      control targeted at preventing hyperglycemia has been shown to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      complications. However, performing optimal glycemic management during and after surgery is a&#xD;
      significant challenge because varying effects of surgical stress and anesthesia interventions&#xD;
      produce rapid changes in glucose levels. The current method of manually measuring blood&#xD;
      glucose every hour or less is grossly inadequate to track changes in glucose levels.&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) have the ability to automatically measure blood glucose&#xD;
      levels in near continuous fashion. Integrating CGMs as part of a glycemic control protocol&#xD;
      can lead to better management of glucose levels with fewer hyperglycemia episodes and lower&#xD;
      glucose level variability resulting in better post-surgical outcome. The viability of using a&#xD;
      CGM in during and after surgery has only been minimally studied, that too with older&#xD;
      generation systems. The investigators propose a study that aims to evaluate viability of&#xD;
      using a current generation CGM in surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a Continuous&#xD;
      Glucose Monitor (CGM) in measuring blood glucose levels and trends in surgery patients. The&#xD;
      secondary goal is to observe and analyze trends in perioperative blood glucose levels to&#xD;
      understand the dynamic effects of surgical stress and anesthetic agents on blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. This information will allow development of better intraoperative glucose management&#xD;
      strategies and protocols. The specific aims of the study are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare glucose measurements made by a next generation, investigational Continuous&#xD;
           Glucose Monitor (Dexcom Gen 6 Professional CGM) against point of care (POC) glucose&#xD;
           meter (Accu Chek Inform II, Roche Diagnostics), during the intraoperative and&#xD;
           postoperative periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate the trends in glucose levels measured by a CGM against surgery and anesthesia&#xD;
           events (Induction, Incision, Emergence) and factors, and administration of anesthetic&#xD;
           drugs (inhalational agents, steroids, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexcom Gen 6 Professional CGM will be used for the proposed study. The Gen 6 CGM is FDA&#xD;
      approved for non-hospital use. Its use for the study will be off-label as it will be used in&#xD;
      a hospital setting. However, for this study the CGM will be used as a secondary monitor not&#xD;
      intended for patient care. The anesthesia provider and nurse practitioner will continue to&#xD;
      use the existing manual glucose measurements (Point of care glucose meters or laboratory&#xD;
      measurements) for clinical care. The measurements made by the Dexcom Gen 6 CGM will be&#xD;
      blinded (not displayed) so that the providers and the patients cannot see or use the measured&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensor will be placed on the upper arm. Sensor location will be consistent across all&#xD;
      patients. Because CGM makes interstitial glucose measurement, any interference from IV&#xD;
      infusions is anticipated to be minimal. However, to minimize any potential interaction with&#xD;
      an infusion (Dextrose) the placement of the sensor will be on the arm different from the IV&#xD;
      arm, if possible. After placement, the CGM sensor requires a warm-up period of 2 hours before&#xD;
      which measurements cannot be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a single phase at the University of Washington Medical Center.&#xD;
      However, after the first 4 patients, a safety evaluation will be performed. Study will be&#xD;
      continued only if the CGM is determined to be safe and able to make glucose measurements that&#xD;
      are comparable to those made by the standard point of care (POC) glucose meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Consenting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified through a surgery schedule report or at surgeon's&#xD;
      clinic with assistance from PCC (Patient care coordinator) who will notify a research&#xD;
      coordinator. The research coordinator will screen the patient to make sure that he/she meets&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria. If a patient meets eligibility criteria, the research coordinator&#xD;
      will approach the candidate patient either via mail or during the History &amp; Physical visit to&#xD;
      communicate study details and provide the consent form. If an eligible patient expresses&#xD;
      interest, research coordinator will arrange an appointment to place the CGM sensor about 2-4&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will contact (by phone/email) the patient prior to surgery to answer&#xD;
      any study related questions and to enquire about the patient's decision to participate in the&#xD;
      study. If the candidate patient wishes to participate, the coordinator will make arrangements&#xD;
      to obtain signed consent and enroll the patient in the study prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will meet with the eligible patient at the time of the sensor&#xD;
      placement and collect the signed consent form, thus officially enrolling the patient for the&#xD;
      study. The patient will be given a gift card ($50) as a token of appreciation for enrolling&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of the CGM sensor and calibration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGM sensor has a warm-up period of 2 hours before which measurements cannot be made. CGM&#xD;
      sensor will be applied on consented patients about 2.5 hours prior to surgery. The CGM&#xD;
      monitor will be configured to not display the glucose measurements and trends (blinded mode).&#xD;
      Lastly, the CGM clock will be synchronized to the hospital computer clock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institutional protocol for glucose management will be followed using the POC and lab&#xD;
      glucose measurements as reference. The measurements made by the CGM will be blinded and the&#xD;
      anesthesia provider will not be able to see or use the CGM values for clinical care. In the&#xD;
      OR, the CGM monitor will placed on top platform of the anesthesia machine beside the POC&#xD;
      glucose meter base. This location will ensure that the monitor is within 20 feet of the&#xD;
      sensor and within the control of the anesthesia providers. Hourly blood glucose measurements&#xD;
      performed by the POC glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics Inform II) or laboratory meter (part of&#xD;
      arterial blood gas panel) will be automatically acquired and documented in the electronic&#xD;
      anesthesia record. The CGM keeps a log of the continuous glucose measurements every 5 minutes&#xD;
      for retrospective download and review. The anesthesia information system will also document&#xD;
      the patient demographics (Age, Gender, BMI, etc), medications and fluid, anesthetic agent's&#xD;
      concentrations, temperature, surgical and anesthesia events. These data elements can be&#xD;
      retrospectively downloaded for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery (PACU/ICU/Wards):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institutional protocol for glucose management will be continued after surgery in PACU,&#xD;
      surgical ICU or surgical wards. Glucose will continue to be monitored every 1-6 hours. In&#xD;
      addition to POC measurements, blood samples taken for venous or arterial collection will be&#xD;
      automatically documented in the inpatient electronic medical record. The CGM measurements&#xD;
      will continue to be blinded to the nurse practitioner. CGM use will be continued for a total&#xD;
      period of 72 hours after surgery or until the patient is discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      whichever occurs earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM monitor disconnect &amp; cleaning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGM sensor and monitor will be removed at the end of the study period by either the&#xD;
      research coordinator or the bedside nurse. The CGM will be covered in a protective shield and&#xD;
      cleaned per procedures approved for the CGM. After cleaning procedures are complete the&#xD;
      monitor will be used on a new patient. Additionally, the CGM measurements will be downloaded&#xD;
      by the principal investigator into a data file for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and feasibility check:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety and feasibility check will be performed after the CGM has been applied on 4&#xD;
      patients. The primary outcome measure at the safety check point will be the ability of the&#xD;
      sensor to make measurements and transmit the results to the monitor without data drops&#xD;
      (without significant interruptions during electrocautery and other surgical interventions,&#xD;
      anesthetic interventions and medication administration). Additionally, the feasibility of&#xD;
      applying, maintaining and using the sensor in an OR environment will be evaluated for any&#xD;
      potential issues. Lastly, the study will also observe any unexpected incidence of patient&#xD;
      safety issues - potential infection, rash, or swelling of the area where the sensor is&#xD;
      applied, potential RF interference etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be continued only after successful completion of the safety check, and only if&#xD;
      there is reasonable assurance that the CGM can be used safely and reliably in the operating&#xD;
      room and postoperative areas with acceptable accuracy (Mean Absolute Relative Difference ~&#xD;
      20%) without significant interference from anesthetic drugs, electrocautery, edema and other&#xD;
      surgery and anesthesia factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGM glucose measurements made every 5 minutes will be downloaded from the monitor to a&#xD;
      computer file using a software program provided by Dexcom Inc. Patient demographics (Age,&#xD;
      Gender, BMI, DM status), preoperative labs (glucose, HbA1c), anesthesia and surgery events,&#xD;
      POC glucose measurements, medication data (including insulin), temperature and anesthetic&#xD;
      agent information will be extracted from the Anesthesia Information Management System (AIMS)&#xD;
      database. Post-operative glucose measurements and medication information will be collected&#xD;
      from Hospital Electronic Medical Record and Data warehouse system (AMALGA, Microsoft Inc.&#xD;
      Redmond, WA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will focus on three aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test of equivalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Paired CGM-POC measurements will be compared to determine mean bias (mean difference)&#xD;
           and SD. The investigators will report the 95% limits of agreement, calculated as mean&#xD;
           bias ± 1.96 X SD, the recommended statistic for assessing agreement between two methods&#xD;
           of measurement. Data will be presented on Bland-Altman plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CGM accuracy and bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CGM measurements will be compared against the corresponding POC glucose measurements&#xD;
           to evaluate accuracy. MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference) will be used as the main&#xD;
           accuracy measure. Effect of confounding factors - body temperature, BMI, Diabetes&#xD;
           status, inotrope score, anesthetic agents, medications and use of electrocautery on CGM&#xD;
           functionality and measurement accuracy will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CGM accuracy assessment will be performed via the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pearson correlation coefficient between the CGM and POC glucose paired values&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clarke Error Grid analysis relating CGM-POC glucose measurement pairs to evaluate&#xD;
                clinical accuracy (% measurements in zones A &amp; B)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MARD ranges for all paired CGM-POC glucose measurements for the following glucose&#xD;
                ranges &lt;100, 100-140, 140-180, &gt; 180 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trends and changes in blood glucose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trends and changes in blood glucose levels through the course of surgery and immediate&#xD;
      postoperative phase (24 hours) will be analyzed across patients to determine consistent trend&#xD;
      indicators (anesthesia and surgery events, use of medications, anesthetic agents etc).&#xD;
      Specifically, multivariate analysis of glucose trends adjusted for covariates will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine the effect of surgical stress, anesthesia and medications on blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. CGM measurements will be used to evaluate the percentage of time glucose&#xD;
      levels are within the desired range (100-140 mg/dL and 100-180 mg/dL) and evaluate the level&#xD;
      of glucose excursions between hourly POC glucose measurements.&#xD;
