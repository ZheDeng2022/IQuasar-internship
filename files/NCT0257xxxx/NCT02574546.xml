      This research is being done to learn more about the risk of developing breast cancer by&#xD;
      studying cells from both normal breast tissue and breast cancer tumor tissue. The goal is to&#xD;
      study cells, genes, and gene products to help us to learn how to detect cancer in its&#xD;
      earliest stages, and if this information may differ in patients with different ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that, besides reduced access to care, the increase in breast cancer&#xD;
      incidence and mortality in AA (African American) compared to EA (European American or&#xD;
      Caucasian) women is influenced by the biology of the tumor. Gene methylation changes caused&#xD;
      by environmental factors starting at birth is one mechanism through which genetic and&#xD;
      non-genetic factors could affect development of breast cancer and which could underlie&#xD;
      disparities in aggressiveness. The investigators were the first to show that a panel of genes&#xD;
      was hypermethylated specifically in AA-ER-negative tumors in young women in comparison to&#xD;
      EA-tumors in women of the same age. Gene promoter methylation is found at low levels in&#xD;
      healthy breast tissues from women without cancer. Race and family history of cancer increase&#xD;
      the likelihood of these early events. Thus, epigenetic changes may be early events in&#xD;
      transformation of breast cells and tumor formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll women from different ethnic backgrounds undergoing mastectomy in order&#xD;
      to collect normal and tumor tissue to study these genetic changes and breast cancer risk.&#xD;

          -  Unresected, untreated breast cancer planning surgical management with mastectomy (with&#xD;
             or without axillary nodal evaluation/dissection and/or with any other clinical&#xD;
             assessment).&#xD;
