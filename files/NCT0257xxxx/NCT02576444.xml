      The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine tumor overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) in molecularly selected patients with measurable disease as assessed by the Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), before versus after 16 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      across tumor types in each arm of the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II signal-searching study in a range of tumor types with the potential to&#xD;
      identify novel tumor indications for combination therapy with olaparib that can subsequently&#xD;
      be explored in dedicated studies. Patients will be enrolled in this study based on molecular&#xD;
      markers from genetic profiling performed on their tumors prior to study entry (outside of&#xD;
      protocol). The trial will also identify genetic determinants of response and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tumors harboring damaging mutations in Homologous - DNA repair (HDR) genes or&#xD;
      mutations such as ATM, CHK2, MRN (MRE11/NBS1/RAD50), CDKN2A/B and APOBEC will be treated with&#xD;
      olaparib or olaparib and AZD6738. Enrollment to the olaparib monotherapy arm will be&#xD;
      completed prior to commencement of enrollment to the olaparib and AZD6738 arm. Patients with&#xD;
      tumors harboring IDH1/IDH2 mutations will be treated with olaparib. Patients with tumors&#xD;
      harboring either TP53 or KRAS mutations or mutations in KRAS and TP53 will be treated with&#xD;
      AZD1775 plus olaparib. Patients with tumors harboring PTEN, PIK3CA, AKT, or ARID1A mutations&#xD;
      or other molecular aberrations leading to dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway will be&#xD;
      treated with AZD5363 plus olaparib.&#xD;
