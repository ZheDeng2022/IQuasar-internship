      This phase III study, open-label, randomized study investigating lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone with and without biaxin in subjects with newly diagnosed, previously untreated&#xD;
      MM. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a regimen consisting of&#xD;
      either biaxin, lenalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone (BiRd arm), or lenalidomide and&#xD;
      low-dose dexamethasone (Rd arm). 306 patients will be included (50% in Spain (153) and 50% in&#xD;
      the USA (153)&#xD;

      BiRd Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects on the BiRD arm will receive clarithromycin, Revlimid (lenalidomide), and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in 28-day cycles. Dosing is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily on days 1-28 for a 28-day cycle. If a dose of&#xD;
           clarithromycin is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. If it&#xD;
           is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up. Vomited doses will not be made&#xD;
           up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle for patients with a calculated&#xD;
           creatinine clearance of &gt;60 cc/min. Patients with a calculated creatinine clearance of&#xD;
           &lt;60 cc/min will receive 15 mgs PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28 cycle. If a dose of&#xD;
           lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. If it is&#xD;
           missed for the entire day, it should not be made up. Vomited doses will not be made up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle. Missed or&#xD;
           vomited doses will not be made up. If subject cannot tolerate oral dexamethasone, it&#xD;
           will be given intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rd Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects on the Rd arm will receive Revlimid, and dexamethasone in 28-day cycles. Dosing is&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle for patients with a calculated&#xD;
           creatinine clearance of &gt;60 cc/min. Patients with a calculated clearance of &lt;60 cc/min&#xD;
           will receive 15 mgs PO daily on days 1-21 of a28 cycle. If a dose of lenalidomide is&#xD;
           missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. If it is missed for the&#xD;
           entire day, it should not be made up. Vomited doses will not be made up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle. Missed or&#xD;
           vomited doses will not be made up. If subject cannot tolerate oral dexamethasone, it&#xD;
           will be given intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative studies: Relative dose intensity: Projected total dose per cycle of each&#xD;
      component of assigned drug will be divided by the actual dose received and a ratio will be&#xD;
      assessed for each cycle delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD: Minimal residual disease testing will be performed in subjects who achieve complete&#xD;
      response. MRD testing may be performed either by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR), whichever is more readily available at the study institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue their randomized treatment assignment until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). In case toxicity precludes dosing of one&#xD;
      agent (i.e dexamethasone, clarithromycin, lenalidomide), treatment regimen will continue with&#xD;
      the remaining agents. Subjects unable to receive ALL the components of the assigned treatment&#xD;
      arms will be removed from study after reasonable attempts to dose reduce and manage side&#xD;
      effects. Subjects can also be removed from study at investigator's discretion, or if they&#xD;
      withdraw consent. At completion or early discontinuation of treatment, subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 30 additional days or up to the initiation of subsequent treatment (whichever&#xD;
      occurs first), after which they will be off the active treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up for disease status and survival will proceed until the subject has&#xD;
      withdrawn consent, is lost to follow-up, or has died.&#xD;
