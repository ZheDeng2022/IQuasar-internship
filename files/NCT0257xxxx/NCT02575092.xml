  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced nephropathy has become the third-largest cause of hospital acquired acute&#xD;
      renal injury, and which morbidity is only less than that of renal hypoperfusion and renal&#xD;
      toxicity of drugs, about 11%of all cases. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of contrast-induced&#xD;
      nephropathy(CIN) is not entirely clear yet. May be associated with renal hemodynamic changes,&#xD;
      medullary ischemia because of renal blood flow reduction, oxidative stress, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction ,contrast agents damage the epithelium of renal tubular directly and so on.&#xD;
      Currently the studies have proved that inflammation(CRP, TNF-α and NF-қB) played a role in&#xD;
      CIN.It is well-know that the hyperhomocysteinemia(HHCY) is a independent risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, which has pro-inflammatory effects. Researches showed that Hcy&#xD;
      stimulated CRP generation by the NMDAr-ROS-ERK1 / 2 / p38-NF-қB signaling pathway and&#xD;
      triggered inflammatory response. We will compare the CIN incidence of different plasma Hcy&#xD;
      levels in adults hypertensive patients undergoing coronary artery diagnosis and treatment(CAG&#xD;
      and PCI). CIN was defined as an absolute ≥0.5mg/dl or a relative ≥25% increase in the serum&#xD;
      creatinine level at 48 hours after the procedure. The relationship between decreased plasma&#xD;
      Hcy levels and blood pressure values by using Enalapril Maleate and Folic Acid Tablets(as the&#xD;
      program-based antihypertension) and recovery of CIN has been observed. Using univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate Logistic regression to analyse the relationship between HHcy and CIN, and taking&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to select the best Hcy plasma levels that which&#xD;
      can predict the CIN and the probability. This study will help us to understand the&#xD;
      relationship between HHcy and CIN that course of the procedure in adults hypertensive&#xD;
      patients, preoperative plasma Hcy levels can predict the incidence of CIN and whether&#xD;
      Enalapril Maleate Folic Acid tablets can reduce the CIN of hypertensive patients with HHcy.&#xD;
      Which has important clinical significance. This study also offer feasibility for further&#xD;
      research that HHcy plays a role in pathogenesis and specific signaling pathways of CIN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first stage: the establishment of hypothesis of the relationship between HHcy and CIN The&#xD;
      demographic and laboratory data were retrieved from the His system. Hypertensive patients who&#xD;
      underwent coronary artery diagnosis and treatment(CAG or PCI) at Fuling Central Hospital of&#xD;
      Chongqing City from June 2013 to August 2015 were initially included in the present study.&#xD;
      The baseline characteristics of the hypertensive patients according to the tertile of plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine level will be analysed, and investigating the incidence of CIN and relevant&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage: To verify the hypothesis of relationship between HHcy and CIN in patients&#xD;
      with hypertension CER research method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients who accepted the coronary artery diagnosis and treatment(CAG and PCI ) in&#xD;
           departments of Geriatrics and Cardiovascular within one year were initially participate&#xD;
           in. According to the statistics that we finished, the proportion of hypertension in the&#xD;
           total patients who underwent procedure has reached about 80%, so there has more than&#xD;
           4000 patients with hypertension within 1 year will be involved. The levels of plasma Hcy&#xD;
           in the total patients will be detected. The patients will divided into 2 groups&#xD;
           according to the plasma Hcy levels,The hypertensive patients(adults) with their plasma&#xD;
           Hcy levels ≥10 umol/L will take Enalapril Maleate and Folic Acid Tablets(as the&#xD;
           program-based antihypertension), The hypertensive patients(adults) with their plasma Hcy&#xD;
           levels &lt;10 umol/L will take Enalapril Maleate Tablets(as the program-based&#xD;
           antihypertension).The procedure will be carried out after blood pressure valves within&#xD;
           normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will be followed up for 3 months, they will return to hospital 3 times(once&#xD;
           a month) after discharged. Urine routine and renal function will be tested, to register&#xD;
           blood pressure,any change of body condition and other related factors per months, and&#xD;
           plasma Hcy levels will be detected in the hypertensive patients with&#xD;
           higher-homocysteinemia at second and third months after discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data collection and data statistics will be carried out per 2 months. All patients who&#xD;
           undergoing coronary artery diagnosis and treatment(CAG and PCI)will be divided into&#xD;
           group A without hypertension, group B that the hypertensive patients with their plasma&#xD;
           Hcy levels &lt;10 umol/L and group C that the hypertensive patients with plasma Hcy levels&#xD;
           ≥10 umol/L. To compare CIN incidence of the 3 groups at each time point, the CIN&#xD;
           incidence of group B and group C will be compared, and association between CIN and the&#xD;
           levels of blood pressure and plasma Hcy will be analyzed by multivariate logistic&#xD;
           regression analysis according to the ROC curve.&#xD;
