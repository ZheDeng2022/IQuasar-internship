  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the objectives are to determine the efficacy and toxicity of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy (IC) with nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin (Arm 1: AP) and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm 2:&#xD;
      A) alone in patients with HNSCC, and to compare these data to nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      5-FU (APF). The investigators also hypothesize that the high anti-tumor efficacy of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel in HNSCC is due to the upregulation of macropinocytosis, a result of the&#xD;
      frequent presence of Ras and PI3K (and epidermal growth factor receptor -EGFR) activation in&#xD;
      this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment to Add Arm 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this amendment, the investigators retain the AP + concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT)&#xD;
      backbone but de-escalate the dose of radiation therapy (RT) from 70 Gy to 42 Gy. The&#xD;
      investigators also plan to administer one dose (vs three) of cisplatin during RT. This novel&#xD;
      treatment approach will be evaluated in patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (OPSCC) (Arm 3), a sub-group with a very favorable prognosis.&#xD;

          <description>Six weeks of nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2/week) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2 days 1 and 22) followed by primary tumor site (PTS) assessment&#xD;
If complete response (CR)/partial response (PR), three more weeks of nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT)&#xD;
If &lt;PR, move directly to CRT if not surgical candidates.&#xD;
CRT includes cisplatin (if cannot receive cisplain will receive cetuximab) which will begin 1 to 35 days after the completion of cycle 3. The first dose of cisplatin will be given during the initial 5 days of definitive radiation therapy, the second on approximately Day 22 of radiation, and the third on approximately Day 43 of radiation.&#xD;
It is strongly recommended that intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) begin within 21 to 42 days (no later than 56 days) after the start of cycle 3. The total dose will be 7000 cGy in 35 fractions of 200 cGy each over 7 weeks. A dose of 6300 cGy in 35 fractions is optional and may be delivered to areas considered to be an intermediate risk.</description>

        <description>Assessment of primary tumor site will be done by laryngoscopy performed in the office or in the operating room. The primary tumor response to the first two cycles of induction will be assessed using visual categorical response. The percent change from baseline will be dictated in the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician's clinical exam note.&#xD;

CRT includes cisplatin (if cannot receive cisplatin will receive cetuximab) which will begin 1 to 35 days after the completion of cycle 3. The first dose of cisplatin will be given during the initial 5 days of definitive radiation therapy, the second on approximately Day 22 of radiation, and the third on approximately Day 43 of radiation.&#xD;
It is strongly recommended that intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) begin within 21 to 42 days (no later than 56 days) after the start of cycle 3. The total dose will be 7000 cGy in 35 fractions of 200 cGy each over 7 weeks.
