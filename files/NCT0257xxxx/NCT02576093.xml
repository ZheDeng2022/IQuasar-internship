  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is the local tolerability and systemic safety of a novel k-opioid&#xD;
      receptor agonist proven to inhibit inflammation and pruritus in preclinical model of&#xD;
      dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three concentrations of WOL071-007 and placebo will be applied to patients with AD in a&#xD;
      first-in-human, single-center, combined single/multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD),&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, half-side comparison (MAD part only) study. The IMP will be&#xD;
      applied occlusively to lesional or non-lesional skin. In the SAD part 24 subjects will&#xD;
      receive the IMP for 2 days. In the MAD part, 30 hospitalized subjects will receive the IMP&#xD;
      for 6 days. Study objectives are the safety and tolerability as well as (MAD part only) the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of WOL071-007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three concentrations of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) WOL071-007 (= active IMP)&#xD;
      or placebo will be applied to patients with a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis at&#xD;
      screening with an Investigator's Global Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA) score of 1 or 2 (mild&#xD;
      to moderate) and/or a local SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) ≤12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose level cohort will begin with 2 sentinel patients: 1 patient randomized to receive&#xD;
      active IMP and the other patient randomized to receive placebo only. From the remaining&#xD;
      patients 1 patient will be randomized to receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Single Ascending Dose (SAD) part of the study the active IMP or placebo will be&#xD;
      applied to a defined surface area of ≤ 100 cm² of non-lesional skin (Day 1) or lesional skin&#xD;
      (Day 2) for about 22 hours and the patients will remain in the study center for at least 6&#xD;
      hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part placebo or test product + placebo (half-side&#xD;
      comparison) will be administered up to 24 hours to achieve a defined surface area of&#xD;
      approximately 2000 cm² in total (10% Body Surface Area) for each dose level cohort. A Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board will review the data and recommend continuation following each dose&#xD;
      level cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary criteria for evaluation are safety assessments, e.g. by Adverse Event (AE) recording,&#xD;
      and assessments of the local tolerability (by scoring of local symptoms) as well as of the&#xD;
      systemic tolerability (e.g. by blood tests and neurological examination) of WOL071-007. In&#xD;
      the MAD part additionally pharmacokinetics will be measured and as secondary parameter local&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
