  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ASP2215 in&#xD;
      subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment to matched healthy subjects with normal&#xD;
      hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess the safety and tolerability of single-dose ASP2215 in subjects&#xD;
      with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and matched control subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be admitted to the site one day before each study drug administration (i.e. Day&#xD;
      -1) and confined at the site till the collection of post-dose PK samples (Day 21). For&#xD;
      subjects with hepatic impairment, subject will discharge on Day 21, and will visit the&#xD;
      clinical unit on Day 24 (±1 day) and Day 28 (±1 day) for collection of post-dose PK samples.&#xD;
      End of study Visit For Healthy subjects will take place 1 to 5 days following collection of&#xD;
      last PK sample.&#xD;
