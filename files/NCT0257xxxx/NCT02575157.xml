      Bisphosphonates (BP) are widely used in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women and older men. Recently, there has been concern about the risk of&#xD;
      adverse events after several years of using these agents. This has resulted in a publication&#xD;
      from the Food and Drug Administration that suggested that, for many individuals, a holiday&#xD;
      from bisphosphonates might be considered after 4-5 years of continuous use. In that&#xD;
      publication there was little, if any, guidance on how clinicians should proceed after the&#xD;
      holiday is initiated.&#xD;

      Bisphosphonates (BP) are widely used in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women and older men. Recently, there has been concern about the risk of&#xD;
      adverse events after several years of using these agents. This has resulted in a publication&#xD;
      from the Food and Drug Administration that suggested that, for many individuals, a holiday&#xD;
      from bisphosphonates might be considered after 4-5 years of continuous use. In that&#xD;
      publication there was little, if any, guidance on how clinicians should proceed after the&#xD;
      holiday is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisphosphonates likely work by first binding to the hydroxyapatite crystal, and when the&#xD;
      crystal is dissolved in the acid medium created by osteoclasts in the process of bone&#xD;
      resorption, the bisphosphonate is released, and is incorporated into the osteoclast where it&#xD;
      inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and interferes with intracellular protein&#xD;
      trafficking. The consequence is loss of osteoclast resorptive activity and in some cases&#xD;
      osteoclast apoptosis. Thus the potency of any particular bisphosphonate is dependent on&#xD;
      independent processes, such as the binding affinity to hydroxyapatite and the potency of&#xD;
      enzyme inhibition. As patients remain on bisphosphonates, it is likely that more and more of&#xD;
      the drug will become incorporated into the skeleton. Therefore, when the drugs are&#xD;
      discontinued, they gradually leach from the skeleton. The rate at which the effects of the&#xD;
      drug wear off (&quot;off-rate&quot;), as evidenced by changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover,&#xD;
      should be dependent on the binding affinity. The length of time for which the pharmacologic&#xD;
      effect continues will also be dependent on potency of enzyme inhibition. Thus, each&#xD;
      bisphosphonate will likely have a unique off-rate. Data from the extensions of some of the&#xD;
      clinical trials support the concept of variable off rates, but there are no head to head data&#xD;
      to determine this. Furthermore, clinical trial data may have limited utility in patients seen&#xD;
      in a practice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers have been shown in a number of studies to be reliable surrogate markers&#xD;
      for the overall rate of bone remodeling in the skeleton. After menopause or ovariectomy,&#xD;
      serum levels of biochemical markers increase and these increments have been associated with&#xD;
      the rate of bone loss as measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). As individuals age,&#xD;
      fracture risk is determined by both age and bone mineral density (BMD). Trabecular bone score&#xD;
      (TBS), an advanced application for DXA, describes the quality of bone microarchitecture,&#xD;
      which has been shown to impact bone strength and thus fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical trial data where bisphosphonates have been discontinued and subjects continue to&#xD;
      be followed, biochemical markers increase after the drug is stopped, and presumably the&#xD;
      fracture benefit of the drug will be gradually lost. Concern over possible association of the&#xD;
      long term side effects of bisphosphonates (notably osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical&#xD;
      fractures of the femoral shaft) have led to a concept, endorsed by FDA, of a drug holiday. At&#xD;
      present there are no guidelines on how patients should be followed when the drugs are&#xD;
      discontinued. From the clinical trial data in different subject populations with differing&#xD;
      protocols, as well as in vitro data, the inference may be drawn that the off effects will&#xD;
      vary with different drugs. It is hypothesized that risedronate will lose its effect more&#xD;
      rapidly than alendronate. However, this concept has never been studied in a prospective&#xD;
      clinical study. Therefore, the intent in this prospective study is to examine patients who&#xD;
      are about to be taken off of 2 different bisphosphonate drugs and compare their off rates&#xD;
      using two established biochemical markers (sCTX and P1NP).&#xD;
