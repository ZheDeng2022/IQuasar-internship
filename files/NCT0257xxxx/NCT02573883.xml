      This study is being done to compare the effects, good and bad, of fractionated CO2 laser&#xD;
      treatment and clobetasol propionate .05% ointment on vulvar lichen sclerosus.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is a well-characterized dermatosis resulting in labial atrophy,&#xD;
      synechiae and introital narrowing and can often cause dyspareunia, itching and co-existent&#xD;
      vulvar pain. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the clinical diagnosis and the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment usually consists of topical steroid therapy (Chi). Clobetasol propionate and&#xD;
      mometasone furoate are potent topical steroids that have long been considered gold-standard&#xD;
      treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus and work through anti-inflammatory, anti-mitotic, and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effects. One of the complications of long-term steroid use, however, is&#xD;
      potential thinning of the vulvar skin, therefore limiting long-term use. Clobetasol&#xD;
      propionate has a range of efficacy from 61-91% depending on the selected outcome criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vulvovaginal SmartXide -V2-LR laser system by DEKA (Calezano, Italy) is a fractionated&#xD;
      C02 laser with maximum 40 Watt power and laser energy emission at 10,600 nanometer wavelength&#xD;
      which is mainly absorbed by water in the underlying tissue (Salvatore). The SmartXide-V2-LR&#xD;
      system was first introduced in 2009 with DOT therapy distributing fractioned CO2 laser in&#xD;
      small spots of 200 microns to the vulvar skin or vaginal epithelium, resulting in a portion&#xD;
      of the skin remaining intact with less tissue destruction and faster healing (Salvatore). The&#xD;
      device is cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for incision, excision,&#xD;
      ablation, and coagulation of gynecologic soft tissues. The fractioned therapy has been shown&#xD;
      to stimulate fibroblastic growth through activation and biosynthesis of collagen and&#xD;
      restoration of the extracellular matrix with collagen fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is known about long-term effects of fractionated C02 laser therapy use in the&#xD;
      vulva or vagina, although the treatment is widely accepted in plastic and cosmetic surgery&#xD;
      and dermatology. Increased marketing for laser vaginal rejuvenation has spawned a proprietary&#xD;
      female genital cosmetic surgery industry in the US with very limited published outcome data.&#xD;
      SmartXide -V2-LR has some established outcome data for treatment of genitourinary syndrome of&#xD;
      menopause (GSM), also known as vulvovaginal atrophy (Salvatore).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of clobetasol propionate .05%&#xD;
      ointment to fractionated CO2 laser procedure for the treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus.&#xD;
      Women presenting to the urogynecology clinic will be screened for lichen sclerosus. Vulvar&#xD;
      biopsy will be performed for confirmation, and, if eligible, the patient will be consented to&#xD;
      undergo baseline questionnaires, photodocumentation of vulvar lesions and randomization. A&#xD;
      minimum of 2 weeks are required from the time of biopsy to treatment. Patient will be&#xD;
      randomized to monthly LASER treatment for 3 months or topical STEROID therapy (clobetasol&#xD;
      propionate .05% ointment nightly for one month then three times weekly for 2 additional&#xD;
      months) in a 1:1 ratio using a computer generated randomization schedule. Because of the&#xD;
      nature of the treatment, it will not be possible to blind patients but the assessor will be&#xD;
      blinded to the intervention. Patients may have used clobetasol propionate in past, but must&#xD;
      complete 8 week wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient questionnaires include multiple validated scales and surveys to provided reproducible&#xD;
      measures of vulvar symptoms as primary and secondary outcomes. Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed at the intake visit, repeated at 6 month and one year follow up. The investigators&#xD;
      expect improved subjective and objective results in the LASER group at 6 months compared with&#xD;
      the STEROID group. At 6 months, participants are giving the option to crossover to receive&#xD;
      the other treatment arm if desired due to continued symptoms. All groups are followed to 12&#xD;
      months for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations were conducted using the absolute change in the Skindex 29 as the&#xD;
      primary end point. Out study will reach 80% power to detect a mean difference of 16 points on&#xD;
      the Skindex 29 (sd=22 for both groups) between the study groups with 25 patients in each&#xD;
      group, or 50 in total based on a one-sided two-sample t-test with alpha=0.05 (He). By&#xD;
      accounting for 10% attrition, the investigators propose to recruit 56 patients to the study&#xD;
      to be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to each group, with a blocked component for those who used&#xD;
      tropical clobetasol in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered into a secure RedCAPS Database which provides complete auditing for data&#xD;
      management processes. De-identified backup data will be kept in locked files at the&#xD;
      participating site. Plans for publication will be handled by the investigators at MedStar&#xD;
      Washington Hospital Center and will adhere to publication policies. All personnel with access&#xD;
      to data collected have completed the Program for Ethics Education in Research training with&#xD;
      the appropriate HIPAA certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be compensated for travel and may be accountable for some medical bills for&#xD;
      office visits. Study location is Medstar Lafayette Office 1133 21st St NW, Washington, DC&#xD;
      20036.&#xD;

        <description>The Skindex-29 is a validated questionnaire for assessing acute dermatologic symptoms over a 4-week period. The Skindex-29 is a 29 question version of the original SkinDEX questionnaire. Total numeric score is reported ranging from 0-100. Scores reported as a change between six months and baseline with more negative scores indicating greater improvement.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was unblinded for patients and evaluators and only performed at a single center. The steroid group had more non-compliant patients (25% vs 4%). We limited our investigation to only postmenopausal women Further research using placebo and sham lasers for treatment blinding is needed. Patients previously using topical vaginal estrogen were continued on prior treatment, groups were not stratified based on estrogen exposure, however there where equal numbers between groups.</limitations_and_caveats>
