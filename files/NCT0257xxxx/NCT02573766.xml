  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using a type of non-invasive therapy&#xD;
      called neurofeedback training can help teach patients with peripheral neuropathy how to&#xD;
      change their own brain waves to lower their perception of neuropathy and help improve their&#xD;
      overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofeedback training is a type of therapy that uses an electroencephalograph (EEG) and a&#xD;
      computer software program to measure brain wave activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The equipment used for neurofeedback training is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available. Using neurofeedback equipment to teach patients ways to&#xD;
      modify their own brain waves to lower the perception of symptoms and improve quality of life&#xD;
      is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 99 participants over the age of 18 will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following baseline tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 7 questionnaires about your symptoms, how you have been feeling, and&#xD;
           your general quality of life. It should take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic information about you (such as your age and education level) will also be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EEG to measure the electrical activity of your brain. During the EEG,&#xD;
           researchers will place a cap containing 19 electrodes on your scalp and 1 electrode on&#xD;
           each earlobe. The electrodes will measure and record your brain wave activity, similar&#xD;
           to the way a doctor listens to your heart beat from the surface of your skin. The EEG&#xD;
           should take about 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the baseline tests, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of a dice)&#xD;
      to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the&#xD;
      same, or worse than the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive traditional neurofeedback training.&#xD;
           Traditional neurofeedback training rewards you based on your own brain's activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive sham neurofeedback training. Sham&#xD;
           neurofeedback training does not use your own brainwaves. In sham neurofeedback, you will&#xD;
           be training from the brainwaves of another person who does not have neuropathy. Sham&#xD;
           neurofeedback is not designed to help train your brainwaves. It is designed to be&#xD;
           compared with traditional neurofeedback to learn if traditional neurofeedback has any&#xD;
           real effect. If you have any questions about how sham neurofeedback is designed to work,&#xD;
           talk with the study doctor or study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 3, you will continue to receive standard care. You will not&#xD;
           take part in the neurofeedback training, but you will take part in the follow-up visits&#xD;
           (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Groups 1 or 2, you will not be told if you are receiving traditional&#xD;
      neurofeedback training or sham training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofeedback Training (Groups 1 and 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have at least 2 neurofeedback training sessions each week for up to 10 weeks (20&#xD;
      training sessions total). The training sessions may take place on any 2 days of the week and&#xD;
      may be up to 5 times a week, if you are interested in training more quickly. The study doctor&#xD;
      will discuss the option of training faster with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each neurofeedback training session should take about 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each session, you will have an EEG while you sit quietly, relax, and watch a computer&#xD;
      screen. The screen will be blank at first and then a series of pictures will appear. The&#xD;
      pictures will change as your brainwaves change. You may also be shown pictures of flowers,&#xD;
      bridges, mountains, and so on. You may be asked to play small games, for example a Pac-Man&#xD;
      type game in which a small character moves around a maze. You will be able to choose to&#xD;
      either view pictures or play a game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When researchers see that your brain waves change in the way they are looking for, you will&#xD;
      be &quot;rewarded.&quot; When you are rewarded you will see a pretty picture on screen and you will&#xD;
      hear a beep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurotherapist will be present during each session to make sure you do not fall asleep and&#xD;
      that you are relaxed during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each neurofeedback training session, you will also be asked to rate your neuropathic&#xD;
      symptoms on a scale of 0-10 before you begin the neurofeedback training and again after the&#xD;
      session is complete. This should only take a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on this study will be over after follow-up. If you are in Groups 2&#xD;
      or 3, you may be able to stay on study for an additional 4 months if you agree to Optional&#xD;
      Procedure #1 (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up (All groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 week after your last neurofeedback training session and again about 1 month later:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the same 7 questionnaires you completed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EEG. If you are in Group 3, you will have this EEG about 1 week after&#xD;
           Group 1 has completed their neurofeedback training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After you have completed the assessment 1 month later, you will be told which group you&#xD;
           were in and offered neurofeedback if you were in the sham group.&#xD;
