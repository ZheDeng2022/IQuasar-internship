  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To show the superiority in safety of Smoflipid over Intralipid® as measured by the number of&#xD;
      study patients in each treatment group with conjugated bilirubin exceeding 2 mg/dL during the&#xD;
      first 28 days of study treatment, confirmed by a second sample collected 7 days after the&#xD;
      first sample.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Outcome of a planned interim analysis was that the sample size required to show superiority was&#xD;
    too high to be feasible. Fresenius Kabi requested termination to the FDA on 17 Jan 2020. FDA&#xD;
    accepted termination by written response on 16 Apr 2020.&#xD;
