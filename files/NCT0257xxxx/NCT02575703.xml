    <textblock>
      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3023414 has been&#xD;
      specially prepared to contain the radioactive carbon atom [¹⁴C]. [¹⁴C] is a naturally&#xD;
      occurring radioactive form of the element carbon. Adding a low dose of radiation to the study&#xD;
      drug does not change how the drug works but helps to identify when the drug appears in the&#xD;
      blood, urine, breath, and stool after it is given. The study will last about 15 days for each&#xD;
      participant, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

                  documentation. Men who are sexually active with a pregnant partner agree to use a&#xD;
                  condom for 91 days from the time of dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female participants: Women not of childbearing potential due to surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (at least 6 months after hysterectomy with or without bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy or at least 6 months after tubal ligation) confirmed by medical&#xD;
                  history or menopause. Postmenopausal women include women with spontaneous&#xD;
                  amenorrhea for at least 12 months, not induced by a medical condition such as&#xD;
