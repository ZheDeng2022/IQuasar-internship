  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to participate in this research study because the participant's&#xD;
      doctor has ordered a myocardial perfusion SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography)&#xD;
      scan to look at the blood flow in the participants heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial perfusion imaging is a proven test that looks at the blood flow to the&#xD;
      participant's heart after the injection of a radioactive tracer. The standard test requires&#xD;
      two injections of the radioactive tracer and takes images of the participant's heart at rest&#xD;
      and after a stress test. It has been proposed that in some cases, patients could have images&#xD;
      done only after the stress portion of the test and, if normal, the rest images would not need&#xD;
      to be done. In this case, only one injection of the radioactive tracer would be needed. It&#xD;
      has further been proposed that adding another stress image made with the participant lying on&#xD;
      their stomach, will increase the confidence of the reporting doctor in reporting stress&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the extra information added from the image with&#xD;
      the participant on their stomach helps the doctor when reporting the test results.&#xD;

      Successfully implementing a SFSO-MPI protocol requires a validated pre-screening tool and a&#xD;
      proven imaging protocol that aids the physician in reporting the study with confidence. The&#xD;
      investigator's previous study, entitled &quot;The feasibility of Stress-First/Stress-Only&#xD;
      Myocardial Perfusion Imaging to reduce patient radiation exposure in a selected subset of&#xD;
      patients undergoing testing in a tertiary care facility (SFSO-MPI)&quot;, was designed to validate&#xD;
      a pre-screening tool developed by Duvall et al. In the investigator's population the tool&#xD;
      demonstrated sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of 0.79 (0.74-0.83) and 0.55 (0.48-0.62)&#xD;
      (unpublished data). The sensitivity was lower than previous published. However the&#xD;
      investigators noted that a greater proportion of participants were classified as abnormal&#xD;
      (55% vs 31 and 36% in the two cohorts described by Duvall et al) and a high number of&#xD;
      patients (15%) were reported as having equivocal stress images. These factors may have&#xD;
      affected the sensitivity of the pre-screening tool. A greater proportion of the&#xD;
      investigator's participants would then have required a rest study for proper interpretation&#xD;
      of the test. Additional imaging increases the patients' radiation exposure and time&#xD;
      requirement for the study and affects the proper allocation of department resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department routinely images patients in only the supine position. The implementation of&#xD;
      routine combined supine/prone imaging is expected to decrease image artifacts which may&#xD;
      reduce the number of studies reported as equivocal. If combined supine/prone imaging is&#xD;
      successful in changing the interpretation of a significant proportion of equivocal stress&#xD;
      studies to normal, then the need for rest imaging will be obviated in a larger group of&#xD;
      patients, resulting in reduced radiation dose to patients and medical staff, better&#xD;
      laboratory efficiency due to faster throughput, reduced time commitment for patients and&#xD;
      lower radiopharmaceutical cost. This change to practice will also further aid meeting the&#xD;
      American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) goal of no more than 9mSv patient exposure in&#xD;
      50% of studies.&#xD;
