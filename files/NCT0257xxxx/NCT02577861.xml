  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm the efficacy of Holoclar at one year after the first&#xD;
      treatment in patients suffering from moderate to severe LSCD (Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency)&#xD;
      secondary to ocular burns. In case of failure of the treatment and upon clinical indication&#xD;
      of the Principal Investigator, a second transplant with Holoclar will be offered if&#xD;
      eligibility will be confirmed. The efficacy of two treatments with Holoclar at one year after&#xD;
      the last treatment will be also evaluated. All patients will be followed-up for 12 months&#xD;
      after each implant to determine the treatment efficacy by an Independent Assessor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, open label, uncontrolled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened according to the Study Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and will be&#xD;
      candidates for the ACLSCT if all eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients then will undergo limbal biopsy for the collection of limbal stem cells for product&#xD;
      manufacturing. The confirmation of the eligibility criteria is followed by a roll-in phase of&#xD;
      approximately 6 months. At the end of the roll-in period, Holoclar will be implanted through&#xD;
      a specific surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ACLSCT, efficacy assessments will be performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for both&#xD;
      first and second treatment (the latter only when applicable). One year after the&#xD;
      transplantation, efficacy will be adjudicated by two independent assessors (primary and key&#xD;
      secondary endpoints) and the study completion will be reached when 1 year of follow-up after&#xD;
      the last transplant in the last patient will be accomplished.&#xD;
