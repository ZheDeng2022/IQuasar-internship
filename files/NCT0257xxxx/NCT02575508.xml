      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pan fibroblast growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor BGJ398 when given together with fluorouracil, irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride and oxaliplatin (combination chemotherapy) in treating patients with untreated&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to another place in the body. Pan FGFR kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      BGJ398 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pan FGFR&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor BGJ398 together with fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      may be a better treatment for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine dose-limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose of BGJ398 (pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398) administered in combination with modified&#xD;
      (m)FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic and colorectal cancer patients. (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the 6-month overall survival rate of patients with treatment-naïve&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BGJ398, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan&#xD;
      (irinotecan hydrochloride) and their metabolites when administered in combination and explore&#xD;
      for drug-drug interactions. (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the 1-year overall survival rate, response rate, progression free survival&#xD;
      and cancer antigen (CA)19-9 changes in treatment-naïve metastatic pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of BGJ398 in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in&#xD;
      the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore plasma and tumor biomarkers associated with efficacy to the study combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Patients&#xD;
      also receive pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-28.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

                       rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                       contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study; women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago;&#xD;
             in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse during and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last dose of the study treatment and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
