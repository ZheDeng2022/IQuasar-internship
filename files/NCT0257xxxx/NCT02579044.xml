    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II dose-escalation trial of everolimus in combination with lonafarnib in&#xD;
      Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and progeroid laminopathies (henceforth&#xD;
      &quot;progeria&quot;). The study will be conducted at a single clinical site utilizing the Clinical and&#xD;
      Translational Study Unit (CTSU) at Boston Children's Hospital. Lonafarnib will be&#xD;
      administered at doses previously established in the pediatric population and in this&#xD;
      population of progeria subjects. This study will first determine the dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus when administered in combination&#xD;
      with lonafarnib. It will then determine the efficacy of everolimus when administered at its&#xD;
      MTD in combination with lonafarnib for disease in progeria.&#xD;
