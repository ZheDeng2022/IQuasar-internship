      The aim of this study is to test whether tesamorelin, in combination with a text-messaging&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection can result in memory and thinking difficulties in some people, even those&#xD;
      successfully treated with antiretroviral medications. Tesamorelin is an injectable medication&#xD;
      already approved by the U.S. FDA to treat abdominal fat accumulation in HIV. Abdominal fat&#xD;
      accumulation is linked to memory and thinking difficulties, and previous studies have&#xD;
      suggested that tesamorelin also may be beneficial for memory and thinking, but this has not&#xD;
      been tested in HIV. The aim of this study is to test whether tesamorelin, in combination with&#xD;
      a text-messaging application to help with motivation and adherence, will significantly&#xD;
      improve memory and thinking in HIV. We plan to enroll 100 volunteers with HIV infection at 2&#xD;
      sites - the University of California, San Diego and the University of Southern California,&#xD;
      University of San Francisco and the satellite site, PalmTree Clinical Research, Inc. Before&#xD;
      entry, volunteers will be required to show evidence of abdominal obesity and a minimum level&#xD;
      of memory and thinking difficulties on cognitive tests. This is a randomized trial in which&#xD;
      each volunteer will have a 60% chance of initially receiving tesamorelin (the immediate&#xD;
      group) and a 40% chance of initially receiving no treatment (the deferred group).&#xD;
      Subsequently, the deferred group (those who initially received no treatment) will receive&#xD;
      tesamorelin for 6 months and those who initially received tesamorelin will receive no&#xD;
      treatment for 6 months. Volunteers will be trained in the use of a 2-way text-messaging&#xD;
      system that will help the research team to support volunteers' ability to take the study&#xD;
      medication as directed. We will measure volunteers' memory and thinking skills before and at&#xD;
      the end of treatment. We will collect blood at various points during the study to check for&#xD;
      safety of the treatment and to determine its effects on the body. Volunteers will also be&#xD;
      asked to have magnetic resonance scans of the head and abdomen to monitor the effects of the&#xD;
      study medication on brain chemistry and abdominal fat.&#xD;
