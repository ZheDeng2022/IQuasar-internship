      The objectives of this pivotal study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate bioavailability of an extended-release and immediate release Codeine&#xD;
           Phosphate/Guaifenesin tablet at steady state following multiple oral administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the safety and tolerability of this Codeine Phosphate/Guaifenesin extended&#xD;
           release formulation.&#xD;

      This study will be a single-center, Two-site open-label, randomized, multiple-dose,&#xD;
      two-treatment, two-period crossover design. During the course of the study, thirty eight (38)&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers will receive multiple doses of Codeine Phosphate/ Guaifenesin&#xD;
      extended-release tablet 30 mg/600 mg and multiple doses of an IR Codeine Phosphate/&#xD;
      Guaifenesin immediate-release tablet 20 mg/400 mg tablet in two separate treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will enter the clinic the day prior [approximately 12 hours] to each dosing and&#xD;
      will be confined in the clinic for 7 nights for each treatment period. The extended release&#xD;
      tablet (test) will be administered as two tablets two times a day, 12 hours apart, and the&#xD;
      immediate release tablet (reference) will be administered as one tablet six times a day, 4&#xD;
      hours apart. Pre-dose blood samples will be collected prior to morning dose on Days 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 5, 6 and 7. On Day 7, Two extended release tablets will be given once in the morning and&#xD;
      the immediate release tablet will be given three times, in the morning and 4 and 8 hours&#xD;
      later. Serial blood samples will be collected on Day 7 for up to 12 hours post morning dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7 volunteers will be released from the study site after the 12-hour blood collection&#xD;
      if clinically appropriate and will return to the study site to start the next treatment after&#xD;
      a minimum of 7 days of wash-out period, which begins the morning after the last dose taken of&#xD;
      the previous Period.&#xD;
