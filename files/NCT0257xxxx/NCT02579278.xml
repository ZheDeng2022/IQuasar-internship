    <textblock>
      In almost one third of patients with rectal cancer, cancer spreads through the bowel wall&#xD;
      into nearby veins which can be seen on MRI scans and is known as mrEMVI. It has been observed&#xD;
      that this is linked with worse survival due to the spread of cancer to the liver and other&#xD;
      organs. The investigators think that this may occur by spread of cancer cells in the blood&#xD;
      stream. Circulating cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of patients&#xD;
      with both metastatic and primary carcinoma (but not healthy individuals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial does not interfere with the patient's routine treatment pathway. Participants will&#xD;
      be chosen if they demonstrate mrEMVI on their baseline MRI scan. 20 patients who become&#xD;
      mrEMVI positive (following pre-operative therapy) and 20 patients who are mrEMVI negative&#xD;
      will have blood samples taken before and during surgery and a comparison will be made between&#xD;
      the two groups. If the investigators can find a link between the cancer cells seen in blood&#xD;
      to mrEMVI they may be able to use this test to help guide treatment in the future. This study&#xD;
      will serve as the feasibility of a larger, comparative study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular or venous invasion in patients with rectal cancer has been considered a significant&#xD;
      prognostic factor for over half a century. Interest in understanding the mechanisms that&#xD;
      govern tumour spread from the rectum to distant sites such as the liver has driven the study&#xD;
      of lymphatic and vascular invasion by malignant cells. Venous invasion has traditionally been&#xD;
      identified on histological analysis of resection specimens but there remains variability&#xD;
      between pathologists. Inconsistencies in the histological methods used in identifying venous&#xD;
      or vascular invasion have led to difficulties in interpreting the actual incidence or&#xD;
      prevalence; the literature reports prevalence ranging between 9-61%. None-the-less EMVI is&#xD;
      considered an independent prognostic factor and as such has been recognised by the Royal&#xD;
      College of Pathologists in the UK by including it in the minimum dataset for reporting&#xD;
      colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the increasing accuracy of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      has meant that prognostic factors such as extra mural venous invasion can be confidently&#xD;
      identified on imaging. The literature has shown that EMVI can be well identified using MRI.&#xD;
      mrEMVI has also been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for disease recurrence&#xD;
      following chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore MRI can identify additional cases of EMVI when&#xD;
      compared to routine histopathology and the degree of improvement of mrEMVI on post-CRT scans&#xD;
      is associated with improved disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of patients with both&#xD;
      metastatic and primary carcinoma. By virtue of the presence of EMVI, it is likely that tumour&#xD;
      cells and DNA fragments are more likely to be shed, and a higher blood circulating % mutation&#xD;
      frequency will be seen as compared to patients who are mrEMVI negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tumour fragments may then act as microemboli to other sites and potentially increase&#xD;
      the risk of developing metastases. Furthermore intra-operative manipulation of the tumour&#xD;
      itself may lead to greater release of tumour cells into the mesenteric circulation suggested&#xD;
      by wedge shaped defects in the liver after surgical resection due to portal vein thrombi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways in which to identify cell free tumour DNA. Studies using polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR- a way to concentrate the amount of ctDNA to become a meaningful&#xD;
      measurable amount which can then be used to assess for aberrations) also showed ctDNA to be&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of disease recurrence and worse survival outcomes. There is no&#xD;
      standard technique and confounding factors are present in each step of the analysis of ctDNA,&#xD;
      which can lead to sampling errors and inconsistencies. This lead to development of several&#xD;
      techniques to try to increase the isolation of the DNA such as fast spin columns so that&#xD;
      ctDNA only binds to a silica gel and then eluted by using water or a buffer system.&#xD;
      Polymerase chain reaction can be used to quantify the tumour ctDNA. Other techniques include&#xD;
      double spinning and the use of phenol-chloroform, amplification methods or rapid spinning to&#xD;
      retrieve small DNA fragments. Early studies measured and quantified the total amount of&#xD;
      circulating DNA and found that higher amounts of overall cell free DNA was associated with&#xD;
      tumour. ctDNA from tumour cells can be distinguished from normal ctDNA by examining its&#xD;
      profile in relation to size and fragmentation however debate arose on whether longer or&#xD;
      shorter fragments were associated with tumour resulting in unclear conclusions. Circulating&#xD;
      tumour DNA has been hypothesized as arising from tumour, normal tissue or tumour-associated&#xD;
      stromal cells, however, tumour derived ctDNA tended to be more fragmented and exhibit a&#xD;
      greater variation in size although overall were larger than ctDNA arising from normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation into whether there is a spike in the intra-operative phase would be of&#xD;
      interest. A further study shows that recurrent disease is related to ctDNA increases and is&#xD;
      higher in patients with metastatic disease and furthermore those patients with higher ctDNA&#xD;
      levels and metastases have a poorer prognosis. The challenge with this type of analysis is&#xD;
      that the cell-free DNA may or may not be directly related to tumour and so more recently&#xD;
      focus has been turned on tumour specific cell free tumour DNA as defined by known mutations&#xD;
      such as kras and p53 (tumour p53 is termed tp53).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In colorectal cancer the majority of patients have non-hypermutated tumours on histology. Of&#xD;
      the hyper-mutated tumours TP53 and KRAS make up 60% and 43% of mutations respectively. The&#xD;
      investigators will screen blood-based ctDNA for p53 and KRAS. When the investigators take the&#xD;
      blood they will get a certain amount of circulating DNA which could be tumour or normal and&#xD;
      then they analyse this to see if it has the mutations and if it does then the investigators&#xD;
      can call it ctDNA (circulating tumour DNA). If there is no mutation this does not necessarily&#xD;
      exclude ctDNA because there is a sensitivity and specificity associated with the analysis&#xD;
      methods of the mutations (i.e KRAS and tp53) and not all tumours will have the KRAS or p53&#xD;
      mutations. In some reports from colorectal cancer the pick-up rate for these mutations in&#xD;
      blood correlates to 100% of those tumours found to have the same mutation on histology.&#xD;
      Furthermore plasma or serum sampling may be more sensitive and so in a cohort of 100 patients&#xD;
      the pick-up rate of tumours may be up to 70% for one or the other mutations (kras and TP53).&#xD;
      In other cancers such as lung cancer, the investigators pick up 65% of mutation in the blood,&#xD;
      therefore on average the investigators can expect to detect 0.65 x 60 = 39% of patients to&#xD;
      have detectable mutations in the blood. For this study it is likely then that the pick-up&#xD;
      rate will lie between 39 - 70%. In this group, the investigators will be able to compare the&#xD;
      ctDNA profile between EMVI positive and negative tumours after neoadjuvant long course&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy and determine if the ctDNA profile changes intraoperatively.&#xD;
