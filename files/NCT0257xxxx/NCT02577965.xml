      Recent studies suggest important gender differences in the pathophysiology and prognosis of&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This is the first prospective controlled&#xD;
      study to assess gender differences in the mechanism of plaque rupture/erosion and thrombus&#xD;
      formation in patients presenting with STEMI treated with primary angioplasty. Gender-related&#xD;
      mechanisms of plaque rupture or erosion will be investigated using a combination of&#xD;
      Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA), high resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      of the culprit vessel and histopathology analyses of thrombus aspirates of the infarct&#xD;
      related lesion, performed by independent core laboratories, blinded to group (male or female)&#xD;
      and clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In OCTAVIA; enrollment in a 1:1 ratio according to gender group will be ensured by a&#xD;
      computer-assisted matching algorithm for gender and age (&lt; 50, 51-70, and &gt; 70 years).&#xD;
      Matching has the purpose to enable enrollment of an even number of male and female patients&#xD;
      in balanced age groups. This type of dynamic algorithm is appropriate when the composition of&#xD;
      the referral population is not known in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the OCTAVIA study was calculated on the basis of per patient stent strut&#xD;
      coverage (a continuous variable with right skewed distribution) with mean of 97.0% and&#xD;
      standard deviation of 4.0% in men, versus mean of 95.0% and standard deviation of 4.0% in&#xD;
      women, following XIENCE PRIMEâ„¢ Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System implantation. Thus,&#xD;
      aiming for a 5% 2-tailed superiority alpha, an 80% power, and assuming a 1:1 enrollment&#xD;
      according to gender, a total of 64 patients per group should be enrolled. Anticipating a 10%&#xD;
      dropout rate due to patients lost to follow-up and inadequate imaging (included major side&#xD;
      branch sections), the total enrollment is set at 70 patients per group (total population of&#xD;
      140 subjects).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A suboptimal degree of attention has focused on the detection and management of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) in women until recently. Although many women do not perceive heart&#xD;
      disease as a significant health risk, CAD is the leading cause of mortality in women in most&#xD;
      developed nations, with mortality primarily driven by acute ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock (American Heart Association 2005 Heart Disease and&#xD;
      Stroke Statistics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, literature articles regarding various aspects of heart disease in women&#xD;
      significantly increased. These reports have highlighted important sex differences in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of ischemic heart disease and have denounced&#xD;
      pervasive sex-related disparities in referral and treatment for heart disease as a major&#xD;
      reason for outcome differences between the sexes. Such activities have been useful in driving&#xD;
      attention to heart disease in women, an area largely ignored by the scientific community and&#xD;
      the public just 20 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, we must recognize that to date, limited data substantiate many of these statements;&#xD;
      such recognition is important to guide future research efforts. A careful look at recently&#xD;
      published literature reveals only modest advancements toward clarifying gender-based&#xD;
      differences in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and gender-based differences in&#xD;
      outcome. At the same time, key questions concerning strategies for prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of heart disease in women remain unanswered, and cardiovascular clinical trials continue to&#xD;
      include fewer women than men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fundamental question is whether the mechanisms underlying ischemic heart disease in women&#xD;
      differ from those in men. This is an important question because if pathophysiology differs in&#xD;
      women, such differences can inform strategies for prevention, detection, and treatment that&#xD;
      would be most effective for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of indicators point to a different mechanism in man and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. More symptoms, but less diseased vessels. Despite having more symptoms and physical&#xD;
           limitations, women have less obstructive coronary heart disease than men, as assessed by&#xD;
           angiography along the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes. Chest pain without&#xD;
           apparently severe obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is distinctly more common in&#xD;
           women than in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disability unrelated to severity of coronary obstructions. Among women, chest pain&#xD;
           symptoms and disability do not correlate with severity of coronary stenosis, assessed by&#xD;
           angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Higher risk after infarction despite lesser cardiac damage. Women, particularly those&#xD;
           who are young or middle-aged (whom one would expect to be most advantaged for coronary&#xD;
           disease risk compared with men due to estrogen protective actions), show higher rates of&#xD;
           adverse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI) than men of similar age, despite&#xD;
           less severe coronary narrowing, smaller infarcts, and more preserved systolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the identification of less obstructive atheroma has been put forth as a&#xD;
      potentially helpful strategy for the risk stratification of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this is a compelling theory, to date there is little evidence to suggest that&#xD;
      vascular abnormalities in the absence of obstructive atheroma as detected by angiography are&#xD;
      more commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemia among women than men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have evaluated gender differences in coronary structure and function using&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound and other types of vascular testing. These studies have found that&#xD;
      women had less atheroma volume than men, including both luminal plaque and atheroma within&#xD;
      the media, despite older age and more risk factors, and even after accounting for body&#xD;
      surface area and vessel size. After adjusting for body size, women also have smaller coronary&#xD;
      vessels. However, these studies were unable to identify other vascular abnormalities, like&#xD;
      plaque characteristics, that might explain gender differences in clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, we are far from being able to conclude, or even suggest, that these hypothesized&#xD;
      abnormalities play a larger etiologic or prognostic role for ischemic heart disease among&#xD;
      women than among men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general pattern of higher mortality and complication rates in women after acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes (ACS) compared with men has been described for many years. It is important to&#xD;
      recognize, however, that gender differences in mortality after ACS do not occur across the&#xD;
      board but only in specific patient subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that differences by MI type (STEMI versus other types) may be due to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology underlying these events. For example, acute occlusion caused by thrombus&#xD;
      superimposed on a ruptured or eroded atherosclerotic plaque is believed to play a larger role&#xD;
      in trans mural infarctions than other types of ACS. Thus, it is possible that gender&#xD;
      differences in vessel size and collateralization put women at greater risk than men after&#xD;
      STEMI but not after other types of ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also unclear why gender differences in the outcome of MI are seen in young and&#xD;
      middle-aged patients but not older patients. One would expect that women younger than 50&#xD;
      years of age, the majority of whom are premenopausal, should be more advantaged rather than&#xD;
      less advantaged compared with men of similar age in terms of survival. On the other hand, for&#xD;
      coronary disease to occur in younger women, it must be aggressive, driven by multiple risk&#xD;
      factors, or caused by secondary or unknown causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A less aggressive clinical treatment of women with coronary heart disease relative to men has&#xD;
      been documented for years, with a tendency to refer to it as gender bias in health care&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2005 Statement from the American Heart Association reviewed gender-specific data on the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention and pharmacotherapy. Despite the&#xD;
      fact that more women than men die from cardiovascular disease in the United States, and&#xD;
      despite the established benefits of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in reducing&#xD;
      fatal and nonfatal ischemic complications in patients with acute myocardial infarction, only&#xD;
      an estimated 33% of annual PCIs are performed in women. In addition, women experience greater&#xD;
      delays to intervention and are referred for diagnostic catheterization less frequently than&#xD;
      are men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in angioplasty equipment and technique have improved options for patients&#xD;
      with smaller coronary and peripheral (access) arteries. In addition, the increased use of&#xD;
      stents and adjunctive pharmacotherapy has improved outcomes in both women and men.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, women continue to represent 15% to 38% of the population in studies of PCI, and&#xD;
      still relatively few gender- or race-specific data exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Heart Association, better understanding and elimination of this&#xD;
      apparent treatment disparity is a priority. One of the areas of interest is to refine&#xD;
      treatment pathways and strategies for women with STEMI, in whom mortality rates and bleeding&#xD;
      risk remain higher than in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further optimize clinical outcomes of women undergoing PCI, evidence-based evaluation in&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials must emphasize increased recruitment of women, with mandates to&#xD;
      include gender-specific, ethnic, and racial gender-based results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an innovative catheter-based imaging&#xD;
      technology that utilizes light rather than ultrasound to obtain unique details of the vessels&#xD;
      on a microscopic scale. OCT provides high-resolution (10 to 15 micron axial), full&#xD;
      tomographic in vivo images and measurements of coronary arteries and deployed stents with a&#xD;
      high level of accuracy.(8,9) Applications of this technique include diagnostic assessments of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis and guidance of coronary interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least a decade of renewed interest in women's cardiovascular health, we are left&#xD;
      with more questions than answers. Fundamental questions about the pathophysiology of ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease in women remain unanswered. We have gained few clues about the basis for gender&#xD;
      differences in coronary heart disease and what is unique about the female vascular system. As&#xD;
      a result, we are yet unable to explain gender differences in the epidemiology, presentation,&#xD;
      treatment and outcome of coronary heart disease. Key questions remain about why women are&#xD;
      protected from cardiovascular disease, why this protection is restricted to the coronary&#xD;
      system, and why this protection ends when women have diabetes or an acute MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We lack studies that compare biological mechanisms of disease between women and men to better&#xD;
      define vascular processes that are unique to women. We lack sufficiently large follow-up&#xD;
      studies to link such processes to cardiac end points. How can we increase the inclusion of&#xD;
      women in cardiovascular clinical trials? Without an answer to these questions, little can be&#xD;
      done to improve the prevention and the treatment of coronary heart disease in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In STEMI patients, acute coronary occlusion caused by thrombus superimposed on a ruptured or&#xD;
      eroded plaque plays an important role. Nevertheless, no evidence is available concerning the&#xD;
      mechanism of plaque rupture, the underlying vascular abnormalities of the infarct related&#xD;
      vessel and the biological responses such as vascular remodeling and repair, that are unique&#xD;
      to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OCTAVIA trial, gender-related mechanisms of plaque rupture will be investigated using&#xD;
      a combination of Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA), OCT and histopathology analyses of&#xD;
      thrombus aspirates of the culprit lesion performed by independent core laboratories, blinded&#xD;
      to the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By combining clinical variables with QCA, OCT and thrombus analysis, it is possible to obtain&#xD;
      critical information concerning the relationship between serological biomarker of cardiac&#xD;
      damage, clinical and prognostic correlates of coronary plaque morphology and the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of coronary thrombosis in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to assessing gender differences in the mechanism of plaque rupture, OCTAVIA will&#xD;
      also evaluate the changes in the vascular territory remote from the infarct related lesion,&#xD;
      the local vascular response to primary angioplasty interventions and the correlation with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes over one year of follow-up. These data are important to support a gender&#xD;
      based differential strategy and can have a substantial impact for the improvement of clinical&#xD;
      practice in the treatment of women with STEMI.&#xD;
