      The hypothesis is that structured preoperative cognitive screening of seniors is feasible&#xD;
      without specialized staff and can help preoperatively identify persons at high risk of&#xD;
      complications. To demonstrate generalizability of the single center experience, and&#xD;
      strengthen the case for routine preoperative cognitive screening of seniors, the aims of this&#xD;
      proposal are to implement preoperative cognitive screening of seniors in the preoperative&#xD;
      clinics of a community hospital (NWH) and a 2nd tertiary care institution (MGH); and&#xD;
      determine whether impairment is an independent predictor of adverse perioperative events.&#xD;

      The overriding hypothesis is that structured preoperative cognitive screening of seniors is&#xD;
      feasible without specialized staff and can help preoperatively identify persons at high risk&#xD;
      of complications. To demonstrate generalizability of the single center experience, and&#xD;
      strengthen the case for routine preoperative cognitive screening of seniors, the aims of this&#xD;
      proposal are to implement preoperative cognitive screening of seniors in the preoperative&#xD;
      clinics of a community hospital (NWH) and a 2nd tertiary care institution (MGH); and&#xD;
      determine whether impairment is an independent predictor of adverse perioperative events. We&#xD;
      will enroll seniors (≥ 65 years of age) presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or&#xD;
      Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) for elective noncardiac, non-neurological surgery requiring&#xD;
      hospital admission (N = 250 each). Study staff will be deployed to one of the sites each day&#xD;
      according to a randomization scheme to avoid bias (thus, at each site, recruitment will on&#xD;
      average occur 10 d per month). A study team member will obtain informed consent if the&#xD;
      patient agrees to participate and satisfies eligibility criteria. Exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      planned ICU admission postoperatively; history of stroke or brain tumor; uncorrected vision&#xD;
      or hearing impairment (unable to see pictures or read or hear instructions); limited use of&#xD;
      the dominant hand (limited ability to draw); and/or inability to speak, read or understand&#xD;
      English.Study staff will use the computerized scheduling system, which is updated&#xD;
      continuously in real time and captures relevant information such as age and procedure, to&#xD;
      identify potential subjects. When patients check in with the receptionist for their&#xD;
      appointment they will be notified that they may be eligible to participate in a study in the&#xD;
      CPE involving patients over the age of 65. The receptionist will then provide them with a&#xD;
      brochure about the study that includes information about the purpose of the study, the risks&#xD;
      to the patient, and the potential benefits to society. The patient will then be asked if they&#xD;
      are willing to speak with one of the study investigators and only those patients that agree&#xD;
      to speak with a study investigator will be approached. The staff member will then describe&#xD;
      the goals and risks of the study in a quiet room and ask the patient if they choose to&#xD;
      participate. After all questions have been answered and the patient has the opportunity to&#xD;
      read the consent form, written consent will be obtained by one of the study investigators.&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the interviewer will ask the patient and informant (if&#xD;
      available) &quot;Have you spoken to your doctor about or been evaluated for a change in memory or&#xD;
      thinking?&quot; Study staff will also gather a variety of demographic, functional, and medical&#xD;
      information by direct questioning and review of the medical record. Specifically, we will&#xD;
      collect data on age, years of education, living situation, history of falls, ASA physical&#xD;
      status, metabolic equivalents (METS), medication history, and Charlson Comorbidity index. We&#xD;
      will administer standard instruments to assess mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short [GDS],&#xD;
      a 15-item self-report questionnaire, and health and functional status (basic and instrumental&#xD;
      activities of daily living [ADLs and IADLs, respectively, and the SF36]), and measure grip&#xD;
      strength with a Jamar hand dynamometer as an index of frailty.The SF36 survey profiles&#xD;
      physical and mental health and quality-of-life. In addition, it will take one-minute to&#xD;
      administer the Animal Fluency Test. This is a cognitive screen that has been shown to be&#xD;
      useful in identifying patients at risk of developing postoperative delirium. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 will also be administered as a potential&#xD;
      alternative to the SF36 in measuring physical health and disability. Each enrolled patient&#xD;
      will also receive a business card listing the investigators' contact information and be&#xD;
      advised to expect a follow up telephone call 6 months after surgery to verify data elements&#xD;
      and reassess functional outcome.The MiniCog will be used for preoperative cognitive&#xD;
      screening. Preoperative clinic staff will perform and score the MiniCog during the&#xD;
      preoperative visit, and a study staff member will independently score each test subsequently.&#xD;
      The MiniCog involves 3-item recall for memory and a clock drawing test that serves as a&#xD;
      distractor. The MiniCog tests visuospatial representation, recall, and executive function.&#xD;
      The MiniCog takes just 2-4 min to complete but has been validated in community-based&#xD;
      populations, has minimal education, language, or ethnic bias, high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity for impaired cognition, and age-adjusted normative data are available. Moreover,&#xD;
      the pilot data at BWH show the MiniCog is well accepted by geriatric surgical patients, is&#xD;
      easy for caregivers of different types to administer and score, and has high inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability in a preoperative clinic setting. Probable cognitive impairment will be defined&#xD;
      as a MiniCog score ≤ 2 (out of 5) but ordinal scores will also be considered in the data&#xD;
      analysis. A score ≤ 2 is a standard cutoff and has ~75% sensitivity and ~90% or greater&#xD;
      specificity for MCI or dementia when compared to longer screening and assessment instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures for feasibility (Aim 1) will be rate of successful testing (a&#xD;
      score-able test) and accuracy of scoring (vs. an investigator). Secondary feasibility outcome&#xD;
      measures will be perspective of the practitioner about cognitive screening (survey of MGH and&#xD;
      NWH CPE staff) and the impact of testing on patient flow at each institution. The latter will&#xD;
      be obtained by extracting and comparing data from the CPE's computerized patient flow&#xD;
      tracking system on time spent with a provider in a preoperative evaluation room and total&#xD;
      duration of the CPE visit (check-in time to departure time) between enrolled subjects and age&#xD;
      and procedure matched patients seen in the CPE the previous year. The primary patient&#xD;
      outcomes (Aim 2) will be delirium, discharge to a place other than home, and functional&#xD;
      outcome (change in SF36); secondary outcomes will be hospital length of stay (LOS),&#xD;
      complications (including in-hospital falls), and 30 d readmission rate or mortality. Delirium&#xD;
      will be assessed directly on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 by a member of the study team&#xD;
      using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical&#xD;
      patients.The remaining outcomes data will be extracted from the medical record or electronic&#xD;
      databases. Both institutions track time spent in the CPE (with provider, in the lab, in the&#xD;
      waiting room, etc.) and have databases that tabulate numerous elements of the hospital event&#xD;
      such as age, gender, and race, surgical service, procedure, DRG codes, admit and discharge&#xD;
      dates (LOS), and discharge disposition (home, home with services, rehabilitation, skilled&#xD;
      nursing facility).&#xD;
