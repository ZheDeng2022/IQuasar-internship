    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of terameprocol in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-grade glioma that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      terameprocol, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of terameprocol given orally on days 1-5&#xD;
      every 28 days in patients with high grade glioma. (Part 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate terameprocol tumor to plasma ratios in resected high grade gliomas following&#xD;
      5 days of oral terameprocol administration. (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the maximum duration of terameprocol that can be safely administered on a&#xD;
      continuous basis. (Part 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) of oral terameprocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the toxicities of oral terameprocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the contribution of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9)&#xD;
      genotypes on the variability of oral terameprocol pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive terameprocol orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
