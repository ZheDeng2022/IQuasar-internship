      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to evaluate the safety of a latex safe protocol as proposed by the&#xD;
      Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. In other words,the investigators&#xD;
      hope to demonstrate that patients with known latex allergy or latex sensitisation can be&#xD;
      treated safely in operating theatres without special requirements towards scheduling provided&#xD;
      that all powdered latex gloves are removed from the OR environment( preparation rooms,&#xD;
      theatres, recovery room and surroundings). In contrast, earlier guidelines require the&#xD;
      theatre to be left unused during at least 3 hours before a patient with suspected latex&#xD;
      allergy can be operated on in this theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators want to evaluate to what extend patients who report a latex allergy&#xD;
           show risk factors of latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate to what extend latex allergy was proven by laboratory testing or skin&#xD;
           testing in patients who report a latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of latex allergic reaction when patients report a latex allergy.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic reactions to natural rubber latex( NRL, or Latex) are an important issue in daily&#xD;
      anesthesia practice. Latex allergy may result in lesions consistent with irritation&#xD;
      dermatitis and type 4 allergic contact dermatitis. But it may also result in type 1 allergic&#xD;
      reactions which are potentially lethal.(1) The prevalence of latex allergy in a general&#xD;
      population is estimated less than 1%, but sensitization can rise up to 5.4-7.6%.(3,4) In&#xD;
      certain populations at risk, the prevalence of latex allergy and sensitization rises up to&#xD;
      17% in health care workers an even 73% in patients who were exposed to latex on a regular&#xD;
      basis( eg. Patients with spina bifida).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients require special logistic and organizational requirements during their stay in&#xD;
      the operating room. Nowadays, both guidelines from the Belgian Society of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Resuscitation(BVAR-SARB) as the American Association of Anesthesiologists recommend these&#xD;
      patients to be scheduled as the first case of the day.(1,3) In this way, these patients are&#xD;
      treated in an environment with a minimal amount of airborne latex particles. After all,&#xD;
      studies have proven that using powdered latex gloves causes a substantial contamination of&#xD;
      the operating room. Latex particles can even remain airborne up to 5 hours&#xD;
      afterwards.(1,3,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consequence, the guidelines mentioned earlier dictate patients with a (high risk for)&#xD;
      latex allergy to be treated in an operating theatre left unused during at least 3 to 6&#xD;
      hours.(1,2,6) Of course, such requirements can result in organizational problems potentially&#xD;
      resulting in delaying procedures, financial losses, patient discomfort and dissatisfaction&#xD;
      with both patients as well as hospital staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last years, some professionals have suggested the idea that planning these patients as&#xD;
      first case of the day is no longer necessary because of certain technical evolutions in&#xD;
      current operating room practice.(7) In a guideline published by the Australasian Society of&#xD;
      Clinical Immunology and Allergy (last updated March 2010), patients at risk or with known&#xD;
      latex allergy are no longer scheduled as first case of the day. However, this requires the&#xD;
      removal of all powdered latex gloves from the OR (including pre-anesthesia unit, operating&#xD;
      theatres, post anesthesia care unit and surroundings).(8) The requirement for a completely&#xD;
      latex free environment en materials when operating on a actual patient with (suspected) latex&#xD;
      allergy remains unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several studies have shown the importance of powdered gloves in the spread of&#xD;
      airborne latex particles and the basis for this protocol seams acceptable and logical, there&#xD;
      is currently no literature confirming the safety of this practice in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to evaluate the safety of a latex safe protocol as proposed by the&#xD;
      Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. In other words,the investigators&#xD;
      hope to demonstrate that patients with known latex allergy or latex sensitisation can be&#xD;
      treated safely in operating theatres without special requirements towards scheduling provided&#xD;
      that all powdered latex gloves are removed from the OR environment (preparation rooms,&#xD;
      theatres, recovery room and surroundings). In contrast, earlier guidelines require the&#xD;
      theatre to be left unused during at least 3 hours before a patient with suspected latex&#xD;
      allergy can be operated on in this theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators want to evaluate to what extend patients who report a latex allergy&#xD;
           show risk factors of latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate to what extend latex allergy was proven by laboratory testing or skin&#xD;
           testing in patients who report a latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of latex allergic reaction when patients report a latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The level of satisfaction of surgeons and OR scheduling staff with the new latex safe&#xD;
           protocol and with the switching to powder free latex gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history, including allergies of every patient will be assessed . Every patient with&#xD;
      (suspected) latex allergy who will undergo surgery will be approached to participate in this&#xD;
      study. There are no restrictions regarding type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will ask all eligible patients to sign an informed consent. The researchers&#xD;
      will ask all patients who are willing to participate to complete a short questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients refusing to participate will be treated by the same protocol. However, they will not&#xD;
      be contacted in order to provide further medical data in relation to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the stay in the OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing staff and the anesthesiologist perform a time-out procedure prior to surgery. A&#xD;
      (suspected) latex allergy is marked in the electronic case file. The software registers this&#xD;
      cases and sends a confirmation to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the anesthesiologist marks if a latex allergic reaction has&#xD;
      occurred through a pop -up in the electronic case file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Recovery room: Continuation of the latex safe protocol. When the patient is discharged to&#xD;
      the ward, a pop-up in the electronic case file asks if any type of latex allergic reaction&#xD;
      has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient receives a short note, explaining that the research team will contact him/her&#xD;
      after 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Wards/ discharge from hospital: The research team will contact every patient who was marked&#xD;
      latex allergic 72 hours after their surgery to answer the questionnaire about any allergic&#xD;
      reaction to latex( by phone or in person).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of latex reactions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Irritation dermatitis: a non-allergic reaction of the skin to an irritans. Lesions are&#xD;
           limited to the area of contact and may occur minutes to hours after exposure. Symptoms&#xD;
           include itching, erythema, a burning sensation, blistering, flakiness and fissuring of&#xD;
           the skin. This type of reaction is never life-threatening.(1,3,6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allergic contact dermatitis or delayed cell- mediated hypersensitivity reaction or type&#xD;
           4 reaction: T- cell mediated sensitivity for chemical additives absorbed by the skin.&#xD;
           Lesions occur after 6 to 48 hours following exposure and peak after 48 to 72 hours. The&#xD;
           lesions may exceed the contact area and consist of itching, erythema, blistering or&#xD;
           flakiness.( Symptoms often resemble those of irritation dermatitis.)(1,3,6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IgE mediated immediate hypersensitivity( type 1 reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on B-cell mediated production of IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibodies towards Hev b latex&#xD;
      proteins after a first exposure. Symptoms already occur after a few minutes up to 1 hour,&#xD;
      depending of the route of exposure (inhalation, parenteral or mucous membrane exposure). The&#xD;
      severity of the reaction also varies in relation to the route of exposure. Type 1 allergic&#xD;
      reactions in response to latex exposure may be lethal.(1,2,3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • If the research team( or in daily practice: the attending physician) suspects a latex&#xD;
      allergic reaction during the study period , they will determine RIA(radioimmunoassay) -&#xD;
      tryptase in case of an anaphylactic reaction. Furthermore, the patient will be referred to an&#xD;
      allergy consultant for skin prick test in order to confirm a possible latex allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction about the newly implemented protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from 01-02-2016, the research team will investigate the level of satisfaction about&#xD;
      the newly implemented protocol by means of a short questionnaire( written or E-mail) sent to&#xD;
      all involved surgeons and OR scheduling staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this questionnaire, the investigators want to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general satisfaction regarding the new protocol by means of a numeric rating scale&#xD;
           ranging from 0 (very unsatisfied) up to 10 (very satisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether this new protocol has simplified the OR schedule. The investigators will do so&#xD;
           by means of a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (not true at all) up to 10(absolutely&#xD;
           true).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the level of satisfaction regarding the new type of surgical gloves in case the surgeon&#xD;
           had to switch.The investigators will do so by means of a numeric rating scale ranging&#xD;
           from 0 (very unsatisfied) up to 10 (very satisfied).&#xD;
