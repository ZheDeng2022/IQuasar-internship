      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of running a phase III double-blind,&#xD;
      double-dummy randomised controlled trial comparing Depo-Medrone 120mg intramuscular injection&#xD;
      vs. Anakinra 100mg subcutaneous injection for 5 days for the treatment of acute gout attacks&#xD;
      in patients with chronic kidney disease as defined by a eGFR &lt; 60mls/min/1.73m2 and â‰¥&#xD;
      30mls/min/1.73m2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a common condition that affects 1 in 40 people in the UK. It causes painful &quot;attacks&quot;&#xD;
      of joint swelling, redness and tenderness, mostly affecting the foot, ankle, knee, hand and&#xD;
      wrist. It is common in people with kidney disease, who also tend to be older people with&#xD;
      other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. The&#xD;
      investigators do not know the safest and best way to treat gout attacks in this increasing&#xD;
      cohort of people. A lot of people are given treatment that can worsen their kidney disease,&#xD;
      along with their other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to compare the safest treatment currently available, steroids, with a&#xD;
      new treatment called Anakinra. This treatment stops the action of a chemical called&#xD;
      interleukin-1 which has been discovered to play an important role in gout attacks. This&#xD;
      treatment has already been used to treat gout attacks in a handful of patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease. The investigators feel it may be a better alternative to steroid treatment which can&#xD;
      sometime worsen diabetes, heart disease and blood pressure. Participants will predominantly&#xD;
      be followed-up for one week and a final 8 week follow-up, and be recruited from hospitals in&#xD;
      the East of England.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A definitive scientific study comparing these two treatments would involve a big expensive&#xD;
      study requiring large numbers of patients and large amounts of information to be collected.&#xD;
      Before the investigators do a big study like this, the investigators want to perform a small&#xD;
      study using a smaller number of patients (32 patients) over a period of 22 months in total.&#xD;
      It will then give us information to plan a larger study to answer the question of which&#xD;
      treatment may be better, safer and provides the most value for money for the NHS.&#xD;
