    <textblock>
      PregSource uses a crowd-sourcing approach, asking pregnant women to enter information&#xD;
      regularly and directly about their pregnancies throughout gestation and the early infancy of&#xD;
      their babies into online surveys and trackers via a website and/or mobile application&#xD;
      (&quot;app&quot;). In exchange, participants can track their data over time, print out reports to share&#xD;
      with their healthcare team, and see how they compare to other women. In addition, PregSource&#xD;
      will provide participants with links to trusted, evidence-based information about pregnancy&#xD;
      management, issues, and complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of PregSource: Crowdsourcing to Understand Pregnancy (PregSource) is: to better&#xD;
      understand the range of physical and emotional experiences and alterations in behavior that&#xD;
      women have during pregnancy and after giving birth, the impact of these experiences on&#xD;
      women's lives, and the perinatal challenges encountered by special sub-populations of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PregSource uses a longitudinal, crowd-sourcing, citizen science approach, asking pregnant&#xD;
      women regularly and directly about their pregnancies. Participants enter information&#xD;
      throughout gestation and the early infancy of their babies into online surveys and trackers&#xD;
      via a website and/or mobile application (&quot;app&quot;). In exchange, participants will be able to&#xD;
      track their pregnancy data over time, print out reports to share with their healthcare team,&#xD;
      and view summaries of de-identified data to see how they compare to other women. In addition,&#xD;
      PregSource will provide participants with links to trusted, evidence-based information from&#xD;
      partner organizations about pregnancy management, issues, and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be a potential pool of recruits for clinical studies. Based on&#xD;
      information they enter, eligible women who are interested in participating in clinical&#xD;
      studies may be sent contact information about observational or interventional studies. Their&#xD;
      contact information will not be shared directly with researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a critical mass of data is collected, de-identified data will be available to approved&#xD;
      researchers for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are pregnant and interested in joining PregSource, please:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Go to https://pregsource.nih.gov/.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Complete the questions on the Join page&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complete the online consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that you will be asked some information for your account Profile, and you should start&#xD;
      receiving/seeing questionnaires to complete on the My Dashboard page. You can also come in as&#xD;
      often as you want/need to to complete PregSource's trackers to tell us about your mood,&#xD;
      activity level, sleep, morning sickness, and weight gain. We also have a separate tracker for&#xD;
      adding any medications, vitamins, and other supplements you may take during your pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More information is available at: https://pregsource.nih.gov. If you have any additional&#xD;
      questions, please let us know at pregsource@nih.gov.&#xD;
