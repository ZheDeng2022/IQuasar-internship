    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the elimination of guselkumab glycoform variants&#xD;
      following a single intravenous (IV) administration of guselkumab at a 10 milligram per&#xD;
      kilogram (mg/kg) dose in healthy participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-dose study in healthy participants. All participants will&#xD;
      receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of guselkumab at a dose of 10 milligram per&#xD;
      kilogram (mg/kg) over 60 minutes on Day 1. After the administration of study drug on Day 1,&#xD;
      participants will stay in the clinical study unit until being discharged after the&#xD;
      assessments on Day 2. Participants will be required to return to the study center for&#xD;
      outpatient visits including safety assessments through Day 85 after study drug&#xD;
      administration. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be a healthy man or woman with no clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormalities on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             performed at Screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or&#xD;
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only&#xD;
             if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under&#xD;
             study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and&#xD;
             initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a weight in the range of 60.0 kilogram (kg) to 100.0 kg, inclusive, if male; have&#xD;
             a weight in the range of 50.0 kg to 90.0 kg, inclusive, if female. Have a body mass&#xD;
             index of 18.5 kilogram per meter^2 (kg/m^2) to 30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) test&#xD;
             at Screening and on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before drug administration, a woman must be either not of childbearing potential (Not&#xD;

             with amenorrhea for at least 12 months, or any age with amenorrhea for at least 6&#xD;
             months and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40 international Units/&#xD;
             Liter); permanently sterilized (eg, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy); or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy) OR of childbearing potential&#xD;
             and practicing a highly effective method of birth control consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects participating in&#xD;
             clinical studies (established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of&#xD;
             contraception; placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);&#xD;

             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; male partner sterilization (the vasectomized partner&#xD;
             should be the sole partner for that participant); true abstinence [when this is in&#xD;
             line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant])&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant currently has or has a history of any clinically significant medical&#xD;
             illness or medical disorders the investigator considers should exclude the subject,&#xD;
             including (but not limited to), neuromuscular, hematological disease, immune&#xD;
             deficiency state, respiratory disease, hepatic or gastrointestinal (GI) disease,&#xD;
             neurological or psychiatric disease, ophthalmological disorders, neoplastic disease,&#xD;
             renal or urinary tract diseases, or dermatological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is currently undergoing or has previously undergone allergy immunotherapy&#xD;
             for a history of anaphylactic reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had major surgery (eg, requiring general anesthesia) within 8 weeks&#xD;
             before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery&#xD;
             planned during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study (16&#xD;
             weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has previously received guselkumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines)&#xD;
             or used an invasive investigational medical device within 3 months or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) before the study drug administration&#xD;
