  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome which leads to poor health outcomes in older adults, such as&#xD;
      falls, disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, and death. Due to the dramatic&#xD;
      growth in the U.S. aging population and the health care costs associated with frailty&#xD;
      (estimated at more than $18 billion per year), frailty is a major health care problem. There&#xD;
      has been little research into potential pharmacologic interventions that would delay or&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of frailty. Thus, the major goal of this study is to test metformin as a&#xD;
      novel intervention for the prevention of frailty. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      diabetes/insulin resistance and inflammation are major contributors to frailty, and that the&#xD;
      use of metformin to modulate diabetes/insulin resistance and inflammation will prevent and/or&#xD;
      ameliorate the progression of frailty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to poor health outcomes such as falls,&#xD;
      disability, institutionalization, and death. The prevalence of frailty is estimated to be&#xD;
      7-15% among community-dwelling older U.S. adults. The associated costs of frailty were&#xD;
      estimated to be more than $18 billion in 2000 and these will continue to increase over the&#xD;
      next two decades. Thus, an increasingly frail older population will have major implications&#xD;
      for the demand for health care services, including hospital usage, home care, and long-term&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from several studies have suggested strong roles for diabetes and insulin resistance,&#xD;
      which are associated with increased inflammation, in the physiological basis of frailty. The&#xD;
      investigators' recent epidemiological research with a community-based population of older&#xD;
      adults showed that diabetes was the most significant predictor of frailty onset and worsening&#xD;
      over time. While the importance of frailty and its impact on an aging U.S. society have been&#xD;
      widely recognized, to date there are no effective interventions to prevent or treat frailty.&#xD;
      Therefore, the major goal of this study is to test a drug with insulin-sensitizing and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties, such as metformin, as a novel intervention for frailty&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that metformin will lead to reduced inflammation and insulin&#xD;
      resistance present in older glucose-intolerant subjects and that these changes will&#xD;
      consequently prevent the onset and/or progression of frailty in this sub-population of older&#xD;
      adults. Subjects with impaired glucose intolerance will be enrolled in this study because&#xD;
      this group encompasses approximately 1/3rd of the older population, this group is at&#xD;
      increased risk for developing diabetes and frailty, and is the most likely to benefit from a&#xD;
      potential anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Frailty will be defined using validated standardized criteria (Fried et al., J Geron. 2001 Mar;56(3):M146-56). The frailty score will be measured every 6 months as 0 through 5 of the following 5 frailty characteristics: 1) unintentional weight loss (&gt;= 10 pounds) in last year; 2) self reported exhaustion based on the Geriatric Depression Scale item, &quot;Do you feel full of energy?;&quot; 3) muscle weakness based on hand grip strength measurement (standardized cut points are published); 4) slow gait speed based on 10-foot walk (standardized cut points are published); and 5) low physical activity measured in kilocalories/week based on the Minnesota Leisure Time Questionnaire (standardized cutpoints are published).</description>
