    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well onalespib works in treating patients with anaplastic&#xD;
      large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has not&#xD;
      responded to previous treatment (refractory) or that has returned after a period of&#xD;
      improvement (recurrent). Onalespib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall response rate (ORR) to single agent AT13387 (onalespib) as measured by the&#xD;
      proportion of partial and complete responses (PR + CR) in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      ALK positive (+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and BCL6+&#xD;
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR) of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Safety and tolerability of single agent AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL,&#xD;
      MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measurement of on-target activity of AT13387 (onalespib) in ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+&#xD;
      DLBCL through immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment, on-treatment, and&#xD;
      time of progression tumor biopsies for HSP90 clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determination of genetic and transcriptional markers for response and resistance to&#xD;
      AT13387 (onalespib) in patients with ALK+ ALCL, MCL, and BCL6+ DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease that has not been previously irradiated, defined&#xD;
             as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal&#xD;
             lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm (&gt;= 2 cm) with conventional imaging or &gt;= 10 mm with spiral&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) scan; if the patient has been previously irradiated, there&#xD;

                  cycle 1 and at the time of disease progression of accessible tumor; having&#xD;
                  accessible tumor for biopsy is not required for eligibility; we expect that at&#xD;
                  least 80% of patients will have accessible tumor for these biopsies, however&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy&#xD;

             therapy, which must have included a multiagent chemotherapy regimen and prior&#xD;
             ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor therapy; patients must have relapsed following or be&#xD;
             ineligible for, or refuse, autologous stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCL6+ DLBCL: patients must have disease that has relapsed and or is refractory to&#xD;
             prior therapy, which must have included an anthracycline, if not contraindicated;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
             or hemolysis, in which case =&lt; 3.0 x ULN is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN or a creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients&#xD;
             with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;

          -  Potassium above the institutional lower limit of normal (supplementation to meet this&#xD;
             is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Magnesium above the institutional lower limit of normal (supplementation to meet this&#xD;
             is allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ patients are eligible for the trial provided they&#xD;
             meet the other study criteria in addition to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CD4+ T-cells &gt;= 250/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV sensitive to antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Zidovudine not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Long term survival anticipated on the basis of HIV alone were it not for the&#xD;
                  lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No concurrent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness other&#xD;
                  than the lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AT13387 (onalespib) on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after the completion&#xD;
             of AT13387 (onalespib) administration; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of AT13387 (onalespib) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Although the pharmacokinetic (PK) data in humans is still unknown, the potential for&#xD;
             drug-interaction cannot be ruled out; pre-clinical studies suggest that AT13387&#xD;
             (onalespib) is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a moderate inhibitor of BCRP and&#xD;
             P-gp, and a strong inhibitor of MATE 1/2-K; patients must be willing to not take St.&#xD;
             John wort or grapefruit juice while participating in this trial and should avoid drugs&#xD;
             that are strong inducers of P-gp, and to switch to alternative drugs when available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B positive patients are eligible; prophylactic hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
             therapy is recommended but only if there is no circulating virus detectible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transformed lymphoma patients are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;&#xD;
             steroids for symptom palliation are allowed, but must be either discontinued or on&#xD;
             stable doses at the time of initiation of protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents; all investigational&#xD;
             agents other than ibrutinib must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             beginning treatment; prior ibrutinib therapy must have been discontinued at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to beginning therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known leptomeningeal or brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events; imaging or spinal fluid analysis to exclude central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) involvement is not required, unless there is clinical suspicion by the&#xD;
             treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to AT13387 (onalespib)&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There will be no exclusion of patients with known visual impairment or symptoms,&#xD;
                  including by not limited to peripheral flashes (photopsia), blurred or double&#xD;
                  vision, floaters, color distortion and dimness, difficulties with light/dark&#xD;
                  accommodation, tunnel vision or other field defects, halos, apparent movement of&#xD;
                  stationary objects, and complex disturbances; patients will have a baseline&#xD;
                  ophthalmologic exam to serve as a point of comparison and further exams as needed&#xD;
                  should visual symptoms develop; no pretreatment eye exam findings or ocular&#xD;
                  symptoms have been associated with an increased risk of ocular toxicity seen with&#xD;
                  AT13387&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AT13387 (onalespib) has the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AT13387 (onalespib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with AT13387 (onalespib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any&#xD;
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require&#xD;
             major surgery during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of another malignancy (except for non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ&#xD;
             cervical or breast cancer) unless disease free for at least three years; patients with&#xD;
             prostate cancer are allowed if prostate specific antigen (PSA) is less than 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccine within one week&#xD;
             of study entry or during study period&#xD;
