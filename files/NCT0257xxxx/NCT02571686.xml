      The aim of this project is to test the accuracy of pulse oximeters during mild, moderate and&#xD;
      severe hypoxia. This is done by comparing the reading of the pulse oximeter during brief,&#xD;
      steady state hypoxia with a gold-standard measurement of blood oxyhemoglobin saturation&#xD;
      (arterial blood sample processed in a laboratory hemoximeter). The data obtained is submitted&#xD;
      by pulse oximeter manufacturers to the FDA for device approval.&#xD;

      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies normally involve 6-12 normal adult volunteer paid subjects, with 20-25 1-2 ml&#xD;
      arterial blood samples from each subject obtained at different steady-state levels of hypoxia&#xD;
      from 70-100%. Blood samples obtained from an arterial line are measured in a hemoximeter to&#xD;
      determine true saturation value. Some sponsors may not require any blood sampling. Some&#xD;
      sponsors may require additional blood samples, up to 35 samples may be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readings from the test pulse oximeters are recorded and compared to these &quot;gold-standard&quot;&#xD;
      blood values. The pulse oximeter probes may be located at a variety of sites on the subjects,&#xD;
      including fingers, toes, ears, forehead, scalp and bridge of the nose. These detector-probes&#xD;
      are all non-invasive. The level of hypoxia is measured and controlled by the investigator. A&#xD;
      computer program that displays a prediction, breath by breath, the arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, (SaO2) of the study subject. SaO2 is computed from end-expired Po2 and Pco2 as&#xD;
      determined by mass spectrometer gas analysis. This information permits the inspired gas&#xD;
      mixture of air, plus CO2 and nitrogen, to be adjusted by an operator watching the value&#xD;
      computed after each expiration on an analog meter. This computer-estimated saturation is&#xD;
      adjusted by the operator to one of 6 levels of predicted saturation, and is held stable for&#xD;
      about 30 seconds at each level. Two or three &quot;runs&quot; are conducted per subject. Each &quot;run&quot;&#xD;
      lasts 8-12 min and 4 to 5 plateaus are tested per run. The manufacturer may choose the target&#xD;
      values. Plateaus are typically sought at 92%, 86%, 80%, 74%, 68% and 62%. Other manufacturers&#xD;
      have asked for an equal number of data points but with all points between 70% and 100%. Some&#xD;
      sponsors may also request additional variables to be measured during testing including high&#xD;
      or low Carbon Dioxide (CO2), where subjects will be asked to hyperventilate; low perfusion,&#xD;
      where subjects will be asked to lay flat, or with their head up or down; testing pulse&#xD;
      oximeters during motion, with the subject's hand fixed to a motion machine; or measure&#xD;
      eye-tracking during hypoxia. The subject's will be informed by the study staff and in the&#xD;
      consent form if any of these additional procedures apply.&#xD;
