  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principle investigator is evaluating self-reported quality of vision and quality of life&#xD;
      in physicians undergoing LASIK, SMILE and PRK surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in&#xD;
      the study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated&#xD;
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would&#xD;
      exclude the participant from the study, then the investigator will inform the participant and&#xD;
      make an appropriate referral. This is standard practice for laser in situ keratomileusis&#xD;
      (LASIK) surgery, small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and photorefractive keratectomy&#xD;
      (PRK) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive examination&#xD;
      including computerized videokeratography, then the participant can be enrolled. These exams&#xD;
      are also standard practice for LASIK, SMILE and PRK surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quality of Vision (QoV) Questionnaire will be administered following the pre-operative&#xD;
      visit during which participants are enrolled and then at the three-month and twelve-month&#xD;
      post- op visits before the participants are seen by the principle investigator. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will undergo bilateral simultaneous LASIK eye surgery, SMILE or PRK surgery.&#xD;
      The participants will be seen pre-operatively, on the day of surgery, post op day one, one&#xD;
      month, three months, and twelve-months as part of the study. Participants may also be seen&#xD;
      more frequently if required from a medical standpoint. The participant will receive topical&#xD;
      antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. LASIK treated eyes will receive&#xD;
      pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week to four weeks after treatment. All of this is&#xD;
      within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of patients undergoing&#xD;
      LASIK, SMILE and PRK surgery.&#xD;
