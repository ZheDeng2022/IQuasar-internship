      The study &quot;Phase I trial of Adoptive T cell Therapy with Activated P53 specific T cells for&#xD;
      Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer&quot; is an open label, single arm trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) accumulate high numbers of endogenous tumor&#xD;
      antigen specific cytotoxic and helper memory T cells in their blood. Upon appropriate&#xD;
      reactivation, tumor antigen specific T cells can recognize and eliminate autologous tumor&#xD;
      cells. This can be achieved ex vivo by their stimulation with antigen pulsed autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cells in the absence of regulatory T cells. Upon adoptive transfer, specifically&#xD;
      reactivated T cells from cancer patients can efficiently reject autologous human tumors in&#xD;
      vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major target antigen of anti tumor effector T cells in CRC patients is p53, which is&#xD;
      overexpressed in many colorectal cancers. Within this clinical trial, high numbers of&#xD;
      endogenous tumor specific T cells will be harvested by leukapheresis from the blood of CRC&#xD;
      patients harbouring p53-reactive T cells. Isolated T cells will be depleted from regulatory T&#xD;
      cells and specifically reactivated for three days ex vivo with three synthetic long peptides&#xD;
      containing the most immunogenic regions of p53 using autologous dendritic cells as antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells. Activated T cells will be re-infused into the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with CRC stage UICC IV under routine first line FOLFOX 6/Bevacizumab therapy are&#xD;
      planned to receive a singular treatment with an autologous T cell product at a dose of 5x10^7&#xD;
      (first three or six patients) or 5x10^8 (last four or seven patients) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient treatment and follow-up will be performed at the National Center for Tumor Diseases&#xD;
      (NCT) and at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of&#xD;
      Heidelberg. Leukapheresis will take place at the DRK-Blutspendedienst&#xD;
      Baden-Württemberg-Hessen in Mannheim and generation of therapeutic cells will be performed at&#xD;
      the GMP Unit Cellular Therapy of the DKFZ. Analysis of blood samples with respect to special&#xD;
      immune parameters is carried out at the Immune Monitoring Laboratory, Department of&#xD;
      Translational Immunology at the NCT, Heidelberg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an adoptive&#xD;
      transfer of ex vivo reactivated p53 specific T cells obtained from peripheral blood.&#xD;
