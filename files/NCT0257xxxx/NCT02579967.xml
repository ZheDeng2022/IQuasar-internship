      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is when stem cells are taken from one person s blood or&#xD;
      bone marrow and given to another person. Researchers think this may help people with immune&#xD;
      system problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant is safe and effective in treating people&#xD;
      with primary immunodeficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors: Healthy people ages 4 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients: People ages 4-75 with a primary immunodeficiency that may be treated with&#xD;
      allogeneic blood or marrow transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have urine tests, EKG, and chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow harvest: With anesthesia, marrow is taken by a needle in the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: They will have several drug injections over 5-7 days. Blood is taken by IV&#xD;
      in one arm, circulates through a machine to remove stem cells, and returned by IV in the&#xD;
      other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible vein assessment or pre-anesthesia evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung test, heart tests, radiology scans, CT scans, and dental exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible tissue biopsies or lumbar puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow and a small piece of bone removed by needle in the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy 1-2 weeks before transplant day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor stem cell donation through a catheter put into a vein in the chest or neck&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several-week hospital stay. They will take medications and may need blood transfusions and&#xD;
      additional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, recipients will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remain near the clinic for about 3 months. They will have weekly visits and may require&#xD;
      hospital readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have multiple follow-up visits to the clinic in the first 6 months, and less frequently for&#xD;
      at least 5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are conditions associated with major&#xD;
           quantitative or qualitative immunologic abnormalities that are, in most cases, due to&#xD;
           defects in cells of hematopoietic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with PID can have life-threatening complications including malignancy,&#xD;
           recurrent infection, and autoimmunity/immune dysregulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (allo BMT) has the potential to cure the&#xD;
           immune defect in PID and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with&#xD;
           these diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate the acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)-free, graft failure-free survival at&#xD;
      day +180 after allo BMT, analyzed separately by conditioning arm/cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two&#xD;
           criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PID as defined by identified genetic defect or, in the absence of a mutation,&#xD;
                patients with an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT who meet the&#xD;
                clinical history criteria below may be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical history of at least two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Protracted or recurrent infections&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Infection with an opportunistic organism&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Chronic elevation in the blood of a latent virus&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Evidence of immune dysregulation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hypogammaglobulinemia/dysglobulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one 7-8/8 (9-10/10) HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an&#xD;
           HLA-haploidentical related donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate end-organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consensus opinion by the investigative team that the patient has the potential to&#xD;
           benefit from transplant despite existing, non-hematopoietic organ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status: patients with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation,&#xD;
           except in the case of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will have two arms that vary in mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RIC and RIC-MMF arms: pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days -11 and -7, low-dose&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically&#xD;
           dosed, on days -3 and -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow is the preferred graft source. Peripheral blood stem cells are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GVHD prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  High-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4,&#xD;
                sirolimus on days +5 through +90, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5&#xD;
                through +35 for all arms except the RIC-MMF arm. The RIC-MMF arm will receive MMF&#xD;
                of varying durations based on a duration de-escalation schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants with DNA repair/telomere defects/familial cancer syndromes may receive&#xD;
                a reduced dose (25 mg/kg/day) PTCy on days +3 and +4, in addition to sirolimus and&#xD;
                MMF.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two&#xD;
             criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PID as defined by identified genetic defect or, in the absence of a&#xD;
                  PID-associated genetic mutation, patients with an immune defect potentially&#xD;
                  amenable to allo BMT who meet the clinical history criteria below may be eligible&#xD;
                  upon discussion with the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Mutations should be confirmed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, if such&#xD;
                       testing is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients without a mutation must be deemed eligible and appropriate for allo&#xD;
                       BMT by the PI. Some patients may meet the clinical history criteria listed&#xD;
                       below, but will not be eligible if it is thought that their clinical history&#xD;
                       is due to a condition apart from an immune defect. In addition, patients&#xD;
                       with a PID of mild severity, such as those with selective IgA deficiency,&#xD;
                       may meet at least two of the clinical history criteria, but may be deemed&#xD;
                       inappropriate for allo BMT by the PI if it is felt that the risks of the&#xD;
                       procedure outweigh the severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical history of at least two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection&#xD;
&#xD;

                       elevations over a period of 6 months or longer) of a latent virus (EBV, CMV,&#xD;
                       HHV6, HHV8, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Evidence of immune dysregulation, as manifested by autoimmune disease,&#xD;
                       atopy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome,&#xD;
                       granulomas, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation&#xD;
                       syndrome related to an underlying lymphoma with no other clinical history&#xD;
                       suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency will not be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hypogammaglobulinemia, dysglobulinemia, or impaired response to vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Department of Pathology, if&#xD;
                       prior biopsies are available&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tissue diagnosis should be confirmed by NCI Departmentof Pathology, if prior&#xD;
                       biopsies are available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of at least one 7-8/8 (9-10/10) HLA-matched related (excluding an&#xD;
             identical twin) or unrelated donor, or an HLA-haploidentical related donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consensus among the PI, key AIs, and consultants (as necessary) that correction of the&#xD;
             patient s immune system through BMT has the potential to improve the patient s health,&#xD;
             quality of life, and/or life expectancy, after taking into consideration the patient s&#xD;
             existing non-hematopoietic, potentially irreversible organ dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate end-organ function, as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% by 2D&#xD;

                  than or equal to 20% by ECHO for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF, or LVEF&#xD;
                  greater than or equal to 30% if the patient has radiologic evidence of aortic,&#xD;
                  renal, or coronary artery vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary function tests: DL(co) (corrected for hemoglobin) and FEV(1) greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 40% of predicted for the RIC and RIC-MMF arms; or in pediatric&#xD;
                  patients, if unable to perform pulmonary function tests, there should be no&#xD;
                  evidence of dyspnea at rest, no requirement for supplemental oxygen, and oxygen&#xD;
                  saturation &gt;92% on room air. Calculations will be based on the values reported in&#xD;
                  CRIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (unless due to Gilbert s syndrome or&#xD;
                  hemolysis) for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF; ALT and AST less than or equal&#xD;
                  to 10 times ULN for patients receiving RIC or RIC-MMF. Patients who are above&#xD;
                  these bilirubin, ALT, or AST thresholds may be eligible for the RIC or RIC-MMF&#xD;
                  arms if evaluated by a hepatologist who deems the liver function test&#xD;
                  abnormalities to be potentially reversible with bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated creatinine clearance of greater than or equal to 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2),&#xD;
                  calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults and Schwartz formula for&#xD;
                  pediatric patients, for patients with creatinine levels above the institutional&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate central venous access potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of greater than or equal to 60% or ECOG&#xD;
             performance status of 2 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful&#xD;
             to a fetus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for at least one year post-allo BMT. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in the study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease status: Patients with malignancy are to be referred in remission for&#xD;
             evaluation, except in cases of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any&#xD;
             time. Should a patient have progressive disease or a donor becomes unavailable after&#xD;
             enrollment, the patient will be referred back to his/her primary&#xD;
             hematologist-oncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best&#xD;
             interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI, then the patient&#xD;
             may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study,&#xD;
             although this should only occur as a bridge to transplant. If under either of these&#xD;
             settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to&#xD;
             transplant, then he/she must come off the study. Patients receiving standard therapy&#xD;
             will be told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits, alternatives to&#xD;
             the proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere,&#xD;
             outside of a research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - RECIPIENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents, with the exception of&#xD;
             virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation&#xD;
             prior to allo BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to agents (cyclophosphamide, busulfan, pentostatin, sirolimus, MMF, G-CSF)&#xD;
             used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with the transplant&#xD;
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy, except in cases of&#xD;
             virus-associated malignancies with CNS involvement in which case the patient may&#xD;
             benefit from the transplant to control the malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MAGT1 mutation and active need to take anti-platelet agents and/or therapeutic&#xD;
             anti-coagulation that cannot be interrupted during aplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive or other acquired immunodeficiency that, as determined by the PI,&#xD;
             interferes with the assessment of PID severity and/or the attribution of clinical&#xD;
             manifestations of immunodeficiency to a PID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Related Donor):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Related donor deemed suitable and eligible and willing to donate per clinical evalations&#xD;
        who are additionally willing to donate blood, urine, and marrow specimens for research.&#xD;
        Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing Standard Policies and&#xD;
        Procedures for determination of eligibility and suitability for clinical donation. Note&#xD;
        that participation in this study is offered to all related donors but is not required for&#xD;
        clinical donation, so it is possible that not all related donors will enroll on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Related Donor):&#xD;
&#xD;
        None&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Unrelated donors will be evaluated in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies and&#xD;
        Procedures, available at:&#xD;
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/, except for the&#xD;
        additional requirement of EBV serostatus testing. Note that participation in this study is&#xD;
        offered to all unrelated donors but not required for clinical donation, so it is possible&#xD;
        that not all unrelated donors will enroll on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - UNRELATED DONOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Unrelated donors: failure to qualify as a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donor per&#xD;
        current NMDP Standards, available at:&#xD;
        http://bethematch.org/About-Us/Global-transplant-network/Standards/.&#xD;
