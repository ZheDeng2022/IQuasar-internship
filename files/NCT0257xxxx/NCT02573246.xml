      Psychological treatments are effective, but take a long time and can be burdensome.&#xD;
      Therefore, avenues to optimize behavioral treatments are needed. Despite important&#xD;
      advancements, neuroscience has had a limited effect on psychotherapy development. Therefore,&#xD;
      one paradigm shift would be to develop neuroscience informed behavioral treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators identified from the literature a problem that affects several mental&#xD;
      disorders (emotion dysregulation) and a neural circuit that underlies this important concern.&#xD;
      They found that this circuit is dysfunctional in those with psychopathology but can be&#xD;
      changed with treatment. The goal is in one session to train this brain network to operate&#xD;
      more efficiently and to test the short and long term effects of this intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to engage this brain network using a traditional psychotherapy strategy&#xD;
      (cognitive restructuring) and to enhance learning using repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS), a neuromodulation technique through which magnetic stimulation enhances&#xD;
      the electrical activity in brain areas close to the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team proposed two studies to examine this novel approach, In one of the studies 83&#xD;
      participants were enrolled and 47 eligible participants were divided into 3 groups. All&#xD;
      participants were trained in emotion regulation by first being asked to remember an event&#xD;
      where they experienced a negative emotion and then being instructed either to think&#xD;
      differently about the event, or to wait. Participants simultaneously underwent either active&#xD;
      (left or right side of brain) or sham rTMS. In a second study 65 participants were enrolled,&#xD;
      and 31 were assigned to either active left or sham rTMS guided using neuroimaging results.&#xD;
      Across both studies, the investigators measured regulation in the lab and during a-week long&#xD;
      naturalistic assessment. Participants in the second study returned for a follow up&#xD;
      neuroimaging visit at the end of this week. Participants returned for a one moth follow up&#xD;
      assessment and to rate feasibility, acceptability, and provide feedback. This proof of&#xD;
      concept set of studies demonstrated feasibility and preliminary efficacy for this approach,&#xD;
      which opens new frontiers for neuroscience informed treatment development.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite significant advancements in psychiatric research, the majority of adults with mental&#xD;
      health disorders do not benefit from current evidence-based treatments, especially if they&#xD;
      have difficulties managing negative emotions. One solution to this unmet clinical need is to&#xD;
      take a neuroscience-informed approach to treatment development in order to radically change&#xD;
      patient care. Despite an explosion of research on the neurobiological underpinnings of&#xD;
      emotion, emotion regulation, and psychopathology, there have been few attempts to use such&#xD;
      findings to advance behavioral treatments. Neuroscience-informed treatment development could&#xD;
      optimize psychotherapy gains and reduce burden on therapists and clients. Therefore, we&#xD;
      propose to build a fundamentally novel approach to treating difficulties managing negative&#xD;
      emotions (or emotion dysregulation) that builds on the strength of current therapies, but&#xD;
      that also accelerates and enhances gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with several different psychiatric disorders have difficulty managing negative&#xD;
      emotions, a problem that has been traced back to impairments in the fronto-limbic brain&#xD;
      circuitry. In healthy samples this neural network is activated in response to tasks requiring&#xD;
      regulation of emotional arousal and disrupting this circuit leads to psychiatric symptoms. In&#xD;
      psychiatric samples, this circuit is underperforming as evidenced by (1) hyperactivity in the&#xD;
      amygdala (the brain structure that signals emotional arousal), (2) slow return to baseline&#xD;
      after amygdala activation, (3) hypoactivity in frontal regions (responsible for regulation),&#xD;
      and (3) insufficient cross-talk between these regions when patients experience negative&#xD;
      emotional arousal. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and neurostimulation are&#xD;
      two different interventions that can remediate function in impaired brain circuits. Both&#xD;
      interventions have evidence of success in changing the fronto-limbic network but also need&#xD;
      improvement. Therefore, the investigators plan to combine magnetic brain stimulation and&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring (an evidence-based behavioral treatment for difficulties managing&#xD;
      emotions) in a one-session intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recruited participants for two studies. In one study, 83 transdiagnostic&#xD;
      adults (i.e., who meet criteria for any DSM 5 disorder) who engage in cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      with low frequency as measured by an established questionnaire were enrolled and 47 were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either active (left or right) or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS). In a second study, 65 transdiagnostic adult participants with high&#xD;
      emotional dysregulation were enrolled, and 31 were randomly assigned to active left or sham&#xD;
      rTMS guided using neuroimaging analyses. All included participants practiced reducing&#xD;
      negative emotions (induced with standardized autobiographical stressors) using cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring while undergoing high frequency or sham rTMS to the right or left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex. Standardized, established procedures were used to teach cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring, to generate personalized stressors, to induce negative emotional arousal, and&#xD;
      to implement the one session of rTMS. Immediate effects were evaluated using measures of&#xD;
      emotional arousal and regulation during the intervention and for one week afterwards using 8&#xD;
      daily automated mobile phone calls. Long-term effects in emotion regulation, functional and&#xD;
      psychiatric impairment were examined at 1-week and 1-month follow-up interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the imaging portion of the study underwent an MRI before the intervention&#xD;
      day. This imaging session included training in the emotion regulation task to be performed in&#xD;
      the scanner, including practice in reappraisal and distraction; a memory cue assessment to&#xD;
      rehearse cuing of memories; a mock scan if necessary, MRI safety screening confirmation,&#xD;
      structural (Diffusion tensor imaging and anatomical) and functional MRI (fMRI) images will be&#xD;
      collected. During the fMRI scan, participants completed the emotional regulation task where&#xD;
      they were asked to recall an emotional memory from the Emotional Memory selection tasks and&#xD;
      then be cued to reappraise, distract or allow negative emotions. At the end of the trials,&#xD;
      participants rated their current emotional state. At the one week follow up, in addition to&#xD;
      the tasks described above, they returned to complete a second MRI after 1 week where they&#xD;
      were reoriented to the emotion regulation task, had structural and functional MRI images&#xD;
      collected with the emotion regulation task occurring during the fMRI portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that rTMS would enhance cognitive restructuring by yielding a&#xD;
      quicker reduction in emotional arousal when compared to sham TMS, and would lead to more&#xD;
      frequent use of the cognitive restructuring in the natural environment. This set of studies&#xD;
      is intended to launch a series of investigations using innovative paradigms to optimize&#xD;
      treatments for psychiatric disorders and it could lead to the next generation of&#xD;
      neuroscience-informed behavioral interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to Return to Heart Rate Baseline During the Regulation Period During Training</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after intake</time_frame>
    <description>The estimated marginal mean of the difference in length of time that it takes participants to reduce emotional arousal after three emotional inductions when they use Cognitive Restructuring (CR) with or without the enhancing effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Psychophysiological measurements were collected continuously using the BIOPAC MP-150. For each baseline, heart rate (HR) was averaged from the last 240s. Time to return to one's HR baseline was defined as the amount of time (e.g., number of seconds) it took from the beginning of regulation for the continuously monitored HR to reach a value that was lower than the average pre-stimulus baseline HR. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation (desirable outcome). A baseline value for regulation duration was computed as the time it took during habituation for the person to return to HR baseline. Number of seconds was transformed with a logarithmic function for analyses to achieve normality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Return to Heart Rate Baseline During the Regulation Period at Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine difference in length of time that it takes participants to reduce emotional arousal (as measured with physiological indicators) after an emotional induction when they use CR. This measure, was collected at the 1 month follow up assessment. Only one stressor-regulation period was presented at follow up. The number of seconds it took for participants to return to the pre-stimulus baseline during the regulation period was transformed with a log function for normality. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation, a desirable outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological Emotion Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after study start</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will record heart rate continuously throughout the intervention and then extract high frequency heart rate variability (an index of emotion regulation) from the regulation periods. Continuously recorded HR was divided into 120 s bins, and HF-HRV was extracted from cleaned raw ECG from each bin. Baseline HF-HRV was measured at the beginning of the experiment and right before each autobiographical stressor presentation. The treatment condition (active left, active right, or sham), baselines, the experimental condition (regulation 1, 2, and 3), and the time within each experimental condition (0 to 4 for each 120 s segment within that period) were used to predict HF-HRV. Higher HF-HRV indicates enhanced regulation, a desirable outcome. To make interpretation easier, the raw HF-HRV score was multiplied with 1000000. To achieve normality, this multiplied score was transformed with a logarithmic function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Activation in the Neural Emotion Regulation Network</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>For groups 4 &amp;5, the investigators collected functional imaging data while participants engaged in an emotion regulation task. We examined the BOLD response change in the contrast between down-regulating negative emotions and feeling negative emotions a week after intervention controlling for the maximum change in this contrast at intake. Specifically we examined changes in activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), the amygdala and insula. Data were first preprocessed with fMRIprep and MRIQC. At the first level, functional data were analyzed as individual runs, using a general linear model (GLM) in which trial events were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The [Restructure- Feel_negative] contrast was then used to generate Level 2 analysis, in which BOLD activity for each of the four runs were combined using a fixed-effect model. Higher numbers indicate more activation (desired outcome).</description>

    <measure>Acceptability, as Measured by Qualitative Exit Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine how acceptable participants find the intervention. A previously developed in-house interview (A. D. Neacsiu, Luber, et al., 2018) was administered at the 1-month follow up, and it included Likert-type questions about feasibility, acceptability, and overall satisfaction rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (extremely; secondary outcomes).</description>

    <description>The investigators will examine how feasible the proposed intervention is. A previously developed in-house interview (A. D. Neacsiu, Luber, et al., 2018) was administered at the 1-month follow up, and it included Likert-type questions about feasibility, acceptability, and overall satisfaction rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (extremely; secondary outcomes).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Psychological Distress, as Measured by the Outcome Questionaire -45</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine change in general psychological distress after the intervention. The Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) is a 45-item self-report measure used to track severity of psychopathology throughout treatment. It consists of subscales that identify three types of problems that lead to general stress: psychological symptoms, interpersonal conflicts, and problems with social roles. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). We computed the total score (ranging from 0 to 180) from data collected at intake, at 1 week after the intervention, and at 1 month after the intervention. Higher score indicate higher psychopathological distress than lower scores. The estimated marginal means from the growth model comparing differences between conditions are presented in the table below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Daily General Emotional Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine change in emotional distress after the intervention as measured by daily mobile phone ratings 8 times/day for 7 days of subjective units of distress; SUDS). The 8 ratings/day will then be averaged into a mean/day. This daily SUDS mean (range 0-9) will be entered in analyses. Higher SUDS indicates more distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotion Dysregulation and Functional Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week and 1 month after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine changes in the reappraisal scale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; range 1-7), in the total score from the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; range 36-180), and in the total score from the work and social adjustment functional impairment scale (WSAS; range 0-40) from before to after the one time intervention. Higher ERQ-Reappraisal scores indicate more use of cognitive restructuring (a favorable outcome). Lower DERS total score and lower WSAS average score indicate lower overall emotional dysregulation and lower impairment in functioning, which are desirable outcomes. Outcomes were analyzed using HLM models and the data presented below represents the estimate marginal means for each condition for the growth in each outcome controlling for baseline.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment from the community occurred between 3/1/2016 and 2/17/2019 . Additional funding was received in 2017 to collect additional data. Two conditions were added where procedures were identical but targeting for neurostimulation was done using functional neuroimaging data. Participants were recruited for both the study and the sub study and assigned to one at intake.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>We enrolled 148 participants in both studies of which 78 were randomized in one of the two studies (main study or sub study). Twenty seven participants decided to withdraw after intake.In addition, 42 participants were excluded after enrollment (e.g., TMS was contraindicated, did not meet criteria for any DSM disorder, had current psychosis/mania/addiction, etc). One participant piloted the procedures and was also excluded from analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants in this arm will be administered the neuromodulation enhanced cognitive restructuring intervention over the left side of the brain and will partake in short term and long term follow up testing.&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 15 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses</description>

          <title>ERQ Reappraisal Score</title>
          <description>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The ERQ (6) is a 10-item self-report inventory that assesses the routine use of two cognitive emotion regulation strategies: expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal. The items use a 7-point Likert scale with responses ranging from one (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The data reported here is for the Cognitive reappraisal subscale which can range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating more use of reappraisal to alter emotions.</description>

        <title>Time to Return to Heart Rate Baseline During the Regulation Period During Training</title>
        <description>The estimated marginal mean of the difference in length of time that it takes participants to reduce emotional arousal after three emotional inductions when they use Cognitive Restructuring (CR) with or without the enhancing effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Psychophysiological measurements were collected continuously using the BIOPAC MP-150. For each baseline, heart rate (HR) was averaged from the last 240s. Time to return to one's HR baseline was defined as the amount of time (e.g., number of seconds) it took from the beginning of regulation for the continuously monitored HR to reach a value that was lower than the average pre-stimulus baseline HR. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation (desirable outcome). A baseline value for regulation duration was computed as the time it took during habituation for the person to return to HR baseline. Number of seconds was transformed with a logarithmic function for analyses to achieve normality.</description>

The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

        <description>The investigators will examine difference in length of time that it takes participants to reduce emotional arousal (as measured with physiological indicators) after an emotional induction when they use CR. This measure, was collected at the 1 month follow up assessment. Only one stressor-regulation period was presented at follow up. The number of seconds it took for participants to return to the pre-stimulus baseline during the regulation period was transformed with a log function for normality. Lower numbers indicate quicker regulation, a desirable outcome.</description>

Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

        <description>The investigators will record heart rate continuously throughout the intervention and then extract high frequency heart rate variability (an index of emotion regulation) from the regulation periods. Continuously recorded HR was divided into 120 s bins, and HF-HRV was extracted from cleaned raw ECG from each bin. Baseline HF-HRV was measured at the beginning of the experiment and right before each autobiographical stressor presentation. The treatment condition (active left, active right, or sham), baselines, the experimental condition (regulation 1, 2, and 3), and the time within each experimental condition (0 to 4 for each 120 s segment within that period) were used to predict HF-HRV. Higher HF-HRV indicates enhanced regulation, a desirable outcome. To make interpretation easier, the raw HF-HRV score was multiplied with 1000000. To achieve normality, this multiplied score was transformed with a logarithmic function.</description>

        <title>Changes in Activation in the Neural Emotion Regulation Network</title>
        <description>For groups 4 &amp;5, the investigators collected functional imaging data while participants engaged in an emotion regulation task. We examined the BOLD response change in the contrast between down-regulating negative emotions and feeling negative emotions a week after intervention controlling for the maximum change in this contrast at intake. Specifically we examined changes in activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC), ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), the amygdala and insula. Data were first preprocessed with fMRIprep and MRIQC. At the first level, functional data were analyzed as individual runs, using a general linear model (GLM) in which trial events were convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The [Restructure- Feel_negative] contrast was then used to generate Level 2 analysis, in which BOLD activity for each of the four runs were combined using a fixed-effect model. Higher numbers indicate more activation (desired outcome).</description>
        <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
        <population>This data was not collected from all participants. It was only collected for a subset of participants assigned to the imaging sub study (groups 4 and 5). The numbers presented represent estimated marginal means from the MANCOVA analysis comparing conditions and covarying maximum activation within the contrast at intake.</population>

            <description>Participants in this arm will be administered the neuromodulation enhanced cognitive restructuring intervention over the left side of the brain and will partake in short term and long term follow up testing. The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

        <title>Change in General Psychological Distress, as Measured by the Outcome Questionaire -45</title>
        <description>The investigators will examine change in general psychological distress after the intervention. The Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) is a 45-item self-report measure used to track severity of psychopathology throughout treatment. It consists of subscales that identify three types of problems that lead to general stress: psychological symptoms, interpersonal conflicts, and problems with social roles. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). We computed the total score (ranging from 0 to 180) from data collected at intake, at 1 week after the intervention, and at 1 month after the intervention. Higher score indicate higher psychopathological distress than lower scores. The estimated marginal means from the growth model comparing differences between conditions are presented in the table below.</description>
        <time_frame>1 week and 1 month</time_frame>
        <population>Only participants who provided data were included. In the first study (first 3 groups) one participant from the active right condition did not complete the 1-week follow-up self-reports. One sham, three active left, and one active right participant could not tolerate the intervention and dropped. In the second study (last 2 groups) two participants could not tolerate the intervention and dropped in each condition. One participant in sham did not complete his OQ-45 measure at follow up.</population>

The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

          <description>The investigators will examine change in emotional distress after the intervention as measured by daily mobile phone ratings 8 times/day for 7 days of subjective units of distress; SUDS). The 8 ratings/day will then be averaged into a mean/day. This daily SUDS mean (range 0-9) will be entered in analyses. Higher SUDS indicates more distress.</description>

        <title>Change in Emotion Dysregulation and Functional Impairment</title>
        <description>The investigators will examine changes in the reappraisal scale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; range 1-7), in the total score from the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; range 36-180), and in the total score from the work and social adjustment functional impairment scale (WSAS; range 0-40) from before to after the one time intervention. Higher ERQ-Reappraisal scores indicate more use of cognitive restructuring (a favorable outcome). Lower DERS total score and lower WSAS average score indicate lower overall emotional dysregulation and lower impairment in functioning, which are desirable outcomes. Outcomes were analyzed using HLM models and the data presented below represents the estimate marginal means for each condition for the growth in each outcome controlling for baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>1 week and 1 month after the intervention</time_frame>
        <population>Only participants who provided data were included. In the first study (first 3 groups) one participant from the active right condition did not complete the 1-week follow-up self-reports. One sham, three active left, and one active right participant could not tolerate the intervention and dropped. In the second study (last 2 groups) two participants could not tolerate the intervention and dropped in each condition. One participant in sham did not complete his self-report measures at follow up.</population>

The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected for each participant throughout their participation in the study (approximately 1-2 months/participant). Adverse event data was collected starting after signing consent through completion of the follow-up final visit- about a 1-2 month time frame for each individual. If an individual was lost to contact or dropped, AE data collection ended at that point. Once the individual completed the study, AE data was no longer collected.</time_frame>

          <description>Participants in this arm will be administered the neuromodulation enhanced cognitive restructuring intervention over the left side of the brain and will partake in short term and long term follow up testing. The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system (i.e., scalp measurements).&#xD;
Cognitive Restructuring: Cognitive restructuring is a cognitive behavioral intervention through which participants learn how to think differently about stressful events in order to feel less emotional arousal. Specifically, participants learn how to distance themselves from the situation, think of the memory as just a memory, or focus on alternative explanations or facets of the situation that are less emotionally upsetting.The specific neurostimulation target will be established using the 10-20 system.&#xD;
rTMS: rTMS is a neurostimulation intervention where the participant receives 40 minutes of high frequency (10 HZ) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (4 s train, 26s inter-train interval). The first 10 minutes of neurostimulation will happen during a habituation period in the absence of emotional induction and cognitive restructuring. the rest of 30 minutes will happen in chunks of 10 minutes, following a 2 minute negative emotional induction using autobiographical stressors, while the participant engages in cognitive restructuring.</description>
