    <textblock>
      Study in 400 patients with bipolar disorder I or II, of relapse risk factors. The principal&#xD;
      objective of this research is to test the predictive value of core vulnerability dimensions&#xD;
      such as affective instability and emotional reactivity, measured by validated questionnaires&#xD;
      (AIM and ALS) on recurrence of affective major episode (depressed, hypomanic or manic) during&#xD;
      a 24 months prospective follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several arguments suggest that inter-individual variability in the risk of&#xD;
      relapse is influenced by genetic factors. In particular, the implication of such factors have&#xD;
      been demonstrated in rapid cycling or antidepressants induced mania. However, this has never&#xD;
      been tested in cohorts followed prospectively. Finally, the existence of neuropsychological&#xD;
      deficits in bipolar disorder is well documented and their role in the risk of relapse is&#xD;
      suspected. Yet the nature of these deficits, their origin and evolutionary course remain&#xD;
      poorly investigated. In summary, the secondary objectives of this research are the study of&#xD;
      the influence of these other clinical, neuropsychological and genetic factors on the risk of&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Scientific rationale The dimensions of affective instability and emotional reactivity, are&#xD;
      considered core psychological and temperamental vulnerability dimensions to bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Differences in levels of instability and reactivity may account for the inter-individual&#xD;
      variability observed in bipolar disorder in terms of risk of relapse. These dimensions are&#xD;
      measured using validated questionnaires (Affective Instability Measure (AIM) and Affective&#xD;
      Lability Scale (ALS)). Relapsing is defined as the occurrence of a depressive episode,&#xD;
      hypomanic, manic or mixed episode (DSMIV criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors that may influence the risk of relapse have been suggested in the literature&#xD;
      but have not been formally tested in prospective studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cognitive deficits: the existence of neuropsychological deficits in bipolar disorder are&#xD;
           well documented and their role in the risk of relapse is suspected. Yet the nature of&#xD;
           these deficits, their origin and their course remain poorly investigated. Indeed, some&#xD;
           appear to be related to the neurotoxicity of the episodes themselves, the other being&#xD;
           related to the vulnerability to bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The involvement of genetic vulnerability factors in bipolar disorder is widely&#xD;
           demonstrated. Several arguments suggest the implication of genetic factors in the risk&#xD;
           of relapse. This is the case for some outcome patterns such as rapid cycling or&#xD;
           antidepressants induced mania. Again, this has never been tested in cohorts followed&#xD;
           prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The role of certain inflammatory and infectious factors in the etiology of bipolar&#xD;
           disorder has been suggested but it is clear whether these biomarkers are &quot;state&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;traits&quot;. Thus, the role of neurotoxic inflammatory or infectious factors in relapse&#xD;
           mood has never been tested in a prospective follow up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Main objective of the project To determine if the scores of AIM and ALS, assessed&#xD;
                at baseline in euthymic bipolar patients is associated with relapse in patients&#xD;
                during a 2 years follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary objectives of the project Determine if the neuropsychological performance&#xD;
                at T0, measured in euthymic patients predict relapse during a 2 years follow-up&#xD;
                period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether the neuropsychological deficits observed in euthymic bipolar patients that&#xD;
      contribute to functional impairment worsen with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA collection to test the involvement of candidate genes Serum collection to study the&#xD;
      biological and infectious biomarkers&#xD;
