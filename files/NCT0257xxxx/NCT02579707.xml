    <textblock>
      This will be a 2-part study. PART 1 is an open-label, randomized, food effect study of&#xD;
      AG-120. Subjects will be enrolled to a fed/fasted or fasted/fed treatment sequence in a&#xD;
      2-period crossover design. PART 2 is an open-label study to determine the safety and PK&#xD;
      parameters of a single 1000-mg oral dose of AG-120.&#xD;

             laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator. (Calcium,&#xD;
             magnesium, and potassium levels within normal ranges)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. negative test for selected drugs of abuse and cotinine at Screening (does not include&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. female subjects with reproductive potential must agree to undergo medically supervised&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to study drug administration. Pregnancy tests will be performed&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. males must either be sterile or agree to use 2 of the following approved methods of&#xD;
             contraception from time of giving informed consent until 90 days following the last&#xD;
             dose administration. Subjects will refrain from sperm donation from time of giving&#xD;
             informed consent until 90 days following the last dose administration&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. poor peripheral venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. donation of blood or plasma within 8 weeks before first dose administration through&#xD;
             Study Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to initial Check-in and for at least&#xD;
             28 days following the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit&#xD;
