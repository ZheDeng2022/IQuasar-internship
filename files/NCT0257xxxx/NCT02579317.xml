  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite conscious intentions to remain abstinent, persons with substance use disorders often&#xD;
      find that negative emotions and environmental cues automatically &quot;trigger&quot; drinking and other&#xD;
      substance use. This study aims to test whether activating the baroreflex mechanism can be&#xD;
      used &quot;in the moment&quot; to help resist drinking triggers. It consists of 3 phases (Recruitment,&#xD;
      Intervention, Follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Trained research staff conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and questionnaires&#xD;
      to assess participant's mood, substance use, and triggers. Participants are paired with a&#xD;
      Primary Research Clinician (PRC) who will work with them during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Approximately 4 weeks after intake into the Center for Great Expectations Intensive&#xD;
      Outpatient program, an 8-week intervention begins. Pre-and post-intervention laboratory&#xD;
      sessions occur at Cardiac Neuroscience Laboratory, Center of Alcohol Studies, Piscataway, NJ.&#xD;
      Some participants take part in pre- and post-intervention neuroimaging sessions (Rutgers&#xD;
      University Brain Imaging Center, Newark, NJ). Participants are randomized into an active&#xD;
      intervention or control group after the pre-intervention lab session. They are given an&#xD;
      iPhone and trained to use a paced breathing app that is pre-loaded onto the phone.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups use their app any time they anticipate or experience a trigger to&#xD;
      drink or use drugs. Participants are compensated for their use of the app and the time for&#xD;
      participation. To ensure that participants are correctly performing the paced breathing task,&#xD;
      their PRC visit with them weekly to provide coaching sessions using a computer-based&#xD;
      biofeedback program. During the 4th week, ECG and respiration data are collected.&#xD;
      Participants also complete questionnaires about mood and triggers, and provide feedback on&#xD;
      the usefulness of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the lab sessions, participants complete a series of questionnaires and ECG, blood&#xD;
      pressure and respiration are collected during four 5-minute tasks (resting baseline,&#xD;
      non-resonance breathing, resonance breathing, and visual processing/attention). During the&#xD;
      neuroimaging sessions, participants are placed in the scanner for structural scans and four&#xD;
      5-minute tasks (as tasks as previously noted); ECG and blood pressure are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Participants are re-contacted 1 and 3 months after the intervention to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about their quality of life across multiple domains and the usefulness of the&#xD;
      app.&#xD;
