  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the present study is to evaluate the utility of mGluR5 binding as&#xD;
      measured by PET as a biomarker of the CNTNAP2 mutation and related /mTOR kinase pathway&#xD;
      dysregulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will focus on mGluR5 PET binding as a surrogate measure for level of&#xD;
      activity of the mTOR kinase pathway. This study is being conducted by the New York State&#xD;
      Psychiatric Institute (NYPSI) and the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene Inc (RFMH) and&#xD;
      will take place at Columbia University Medcial Center (CUMC) in New York City and at a&#xD;
      research office in Strasburg, PA. Subjects (n=20) with the CNTNAP2 mutation with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or a related condition will be recruited from the Amish and Mennonite&#xD;
      communities and brought to CUMC for detailed investigation. Affected individuals will be&#xD;
      compared to Old-Order Amish control patients drawn from the same families but not harboring&#xD;
      CNTNAP2 mutations (n=20). The primary measure will consist of mGluR5 PET binding in DLPFC. In&#xD;
      addition, secondary analyses will assess binding in other brain regions such as hippocampus&#xD;
      and visual cortex. Exploratory measures, as well as relationships between PET mGluR5 binding&#xD;
      and clinical symptomatology,will be assessed.&#xD;

             schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder not elsewhere classified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18-59 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genetic confirmation that patient carries CNTNAP2 mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will be of Amish and/or Mennonite descent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a relative willing to be part of the study and this relative will travel with the&#xD;
