      This is a 2 part study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      DS-3032b that can be given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM) that is relapsed (has come&#xD;
      back) and/or refractory (has not responded to treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to continue to study the safety of the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose found in Part 1 of the study.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants each will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to 10 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of DS-3032b you receive will depend on when you join&#xD;
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of DS-3032b.&#xD;
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of DS-3032b than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      DS-3032b is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive DS-3032b at the highest dose that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take DS-3032b capsules by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-21 of each 28-day study&#xD;
      cycle. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, you will take your morning dose of study drug at the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should take each dose of DS-3032b with at least 4 ounces of water about 2 hours before or&#xD;
      1 hour after a meal. If you miss or vomit a dose of study drug at home, you should not retake&#xD;
      the missed or vomited dose. Wait and take the next scheduled dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should bring any empty bottles and unused study drug to the clinic at each visit. You&#xD;
      will be given a diary to record when you take your study drug each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing before your dose of study&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have had some of these tests performed recently, you may not need to have them&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) and biomarker testing&#xD;
           before your dose of study drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body&#xD;
           at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease and for&#xD;
           biomarker testing. You may have this procedure performed at anytime between Day 24 of&#xD;
           Cycle 1 and Day 5 of Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, this routine blood or urine&#xD;
           collection will include a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease and for biomarker and cytogenetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease. If you can become pregnant, this routine collection will&#xD;
           include a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you will be contacted either by phone or&#xD;
      during a clinic visit to find out what drugs you are taking and how you are doing. If you are&#xD;
      called, it should take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. DS-3032b is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the&#xD;
      study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             defined by at least one of the following: *Serum M-protein level &gt;/=0.5 g/dL for&#xD;
             Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA), or Immunoglobulin M (IgM) disease; *&#xD;
             M-protein or total serum Immunoglobulin D (IgD) &gt;/=0.5 g/dL for IgD disease; * Urinary&#xD;
             Myeloma (M)-protein excretion of &gt;/= 200 mg over a 24-hour period; * Involved free&#xD;

             lowest response value in any one or more of the following: *Serum M-protein (the&#xD;
             absolute increase must be &gt;/=0.5 g/dL) and/or; * Urine M-protein (the absolute&#xD;
             increase must be &gt;/=200 mg/24 hours) and/or; * Only in subjects without a measurable&#xD;
             serum and urine M protein level: the difference between involved and uninvolved free&#xD;

          9. Subjects with gastrointestinal conditions that could affect the absorption of DS-3032b&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with prolongation of corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method (QTcF) at&#xD;
             rest, where the mean QTcF interval is &gt;450 milliseconds (ms) for males and &gt; 470 ms&#xD;
             for females based on electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have required plasmapheresis and exchange less than 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             initiation of therapy with DS3032b.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, should not be enrolled. Subjects are not&#xD;
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy for&#xD;
             a prior malignancy, are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years, and are&#xD;
             considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse. In addition,&#xD;
             subjects with basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial carcinoma of&#xD;
             the bladder, carcinoma of the prostate with a current prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
             value of &lt;0.5 ng/mL, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia will be eligible. Finally,&#xD;
             subjects who are on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast&#xD;
             cancer may enroll, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression&#xD;
             during the previous three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's participation in the clinical&#xD;
             study or evaluation of the clinical study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with prior treatment with an MDM2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Nonclinical studies indicate that DS-3032b is metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Drugs that are&#xD;
             strong inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may alter the PK of DS-3032b and should&#xD;
             therefore be avoided. St. John's wort (hypericin) therefore will not be permitted for&#xD;
             30 days before and during participation in the study. Because DS-3032b is a substrate&#xD;
             for CYP3A4/5 and grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, foods or beverages&#xD;
             containing grapefruit should not be taken within 48 hours before initial dose of study&#xD;
             drug and throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
