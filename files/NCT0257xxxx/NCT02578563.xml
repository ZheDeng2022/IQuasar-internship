      To evaluate clinical effectiveness and safety of Singaporean Type 2 Diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      patients administered SGLT 2 inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with other commonly used&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic drugs in real life clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate real life clinical effectiveness and safety of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter&#xD;
      inhibitor- 2 in Singaporean Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      in clinical practice setting. The study would also assess treatment patterns with SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor patient relevant outcomes in whole population as well as pre identified patient&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis to be done at 1 year and extended analysis at 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T2DM is associated with overweight/obesity and high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in White&#xD;
      patients, whereas Asian patients are more predisposed to high abdominal fat distribution and&#xD;
      high postprandial glucose (PPG) levels, thought to contribute1-4. In response to identical&#xD;
      meals, Asian subjects exhibit greater glycemic response than do White subjects4,5. According&#xD;
      to the Diabetic Society of Singapore, one out of nine people aged 18 to 69 has diabetes,&#xD;
      that's about 11.3% of the population or more than 400,000 people &amp; this is expected to rise&#xD;
      with the increasing prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and high-calorie dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors offers a novel insulin-independent approach to lowering hyperglycaemia and&#xD;
      improving metabolic control of type 2 diabetes: they reduce renal glucose reabsorption by&#xD;
      inhibition of SGLT2 transporters in the proximal tubule of the kidney, resulting in urinary&#xD;
      glucose excretion. Since SGLT2 inhibition is independent of Î²-cell function or insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, this treatment approach could have applications throughout the natural history&#xD;
      of diabetes.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reductions in fasting plasma glucose concentration and bodyweight during the treatment&#xD;
      with the SGLT2 i, are sustained. Early weight loss, is partly due to a mild osmotic diuresis&#xD;
      caused by SGLT2 I, however, the gradual progressive reduction in bodyweight thereafter, with&#xD;
      decreased waist circumference, is consistent with a reduction of fat mass. This reduction is&#xD;
      potentially attributable to the loss of excess energy through glucose excretion in the urine,&#xD;
      an effect supported by the increased urinary glucose/creatinine ratio in patients assigned to&#xD;
      SGLT2i.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many trials shows that SGLT2 i can improve glycaemic control in patients who have inadequate&#xD;
      control with metformin. The drug acts independently of insulin, lowers weight, and is not&#xD;
      associated with risk of hypoglycaemia. Safety and tolerability of the drugs were also&#xD;
      confirmed. Therefore, addition of SGLT2i to metformin provides a new therapeutic option for&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done by AZ medical personnel or Pharmacy interns, it will be a paper&#xD;
      data collection and will be handed over to the CRO company for data entry &amp; analysis..Data&#xD;
      analysis will be done by an independent CRO company namely BioQuest Solutions.&#xD;
