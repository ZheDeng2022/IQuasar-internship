  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal method of total knee replacement component fixation to the bone remains a&#xD;
      challenge. The use of bone cement is considered the gold standard and is the preferred&#xD;
      technique for most surgeons. However, uncemented fixation methods have been developed in an&#xD;
      attempt to tackle problems that can be seen when cement is used. The cement-bone interlock&#xD;
      can deform and degrade over the years and can lead to aseptic loosening, especially in young&#xD;
      and active patients. A loosened prosthesis results in an impaired functioning and painful&#xD;
      knee in daily life for which a revision of the prosthesis may be necessary. To prevent&#xD;
      aseptic loosening and subsequent revision surgery, new methods of uncemented fixation have&#xD;
      been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these methods is to use a highly porous metal called TritaniumÂ®. It can improve the&#xD;
      biologic fixation by resembling the characteristics of trabecular bone. It is expected that&#xD;
      this surface aids bone ingrowth and to have similar or even better results concerning early&#xD;
      fixation properties and long-term durability compared with cemented fixation. Excellent&#xD;
      results using this highly porous Tritanium have been seen in total hip surgery already.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-blinded, randomized clinical trial will assess clinical and radiological outcomes&#xD;
      including Roentgen Stereophotogrammetry (RSA) measurements of a newly approved uncemented&#xD;
      Triathlon Tritanium CR total knee prosthesis compared with a standard cemented Triathlon&#xD;
      metal-backed CR total knee prosthesis (both by Stryker Orthopaedics). Two arms of each 35&#xD;
      patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be prosthetic migration after two years of the uncemented&#xD;
      Triathlon Tritanium CR Total Knee and the cemented Triathlon CR Total Knee by means of RSA.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the new uncemented Tritanium prosthesis will perform at least equally&#xD;
      good in terms of migration and clinical parameters compared with the standard cemented&#xD;
      Triathlon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure will be long-term (10-year) survival based on the two-year&#xD;
      migration patterns combined with clinical factors and radiographic aspects. In order to&#xD;
      identify other clinical parameters besides the fixation of the prosthesis components,&#xD;
      clinical scores and radiographic aspects will be correlated with the RSA outcome. The 10-year&#xD;
      results will be used to verify the predicted long-term survival results.&#xD;

    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living , function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms).</description>
