  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project &quot;SEAL-DK&quot; is focusing on advantages and disadvantages of two treatment&#xD;
      strategies: non-invasive fissure sealing and invasive restorative treatment of manifest&#xD;
      occlusal caries lesions in permanent teeth in children and adolescents. The purpose of the&#xD;
      project is to promote the understanding of the possibilities of non-invasive treatment of&#xD;
      occlusal caries lesions in the permanent dentition, and to increase the present knowledge&#xD;
      about the optimal threshold for sealing or restoration, respectively, when treating such&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is carried out as a randomized study of the two treatment strategies:&#xD;
      non-invasive versus invasive treatment of occlusal caries. When organizing the study, it is&#xD;
      emphasized that no treatment shall be carried out, if conflicting the participating dentists'&#xD;
      perception of clinically proper caries treatment, and that the results shall have a high&#xD;
      reliability and consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that caries progression can be stopped by non-invasive fissure sealing&#xD;
      changing the threshold and postponing the time for invasive restoration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The first restoration is fatal for the prognosis of the tooth. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that caries progression can be stopped with a tight sealing which may even lead to&#xD;
      re-mineralization of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the possibility of treating manifest occlusal caries with non-invasive&#xD;
      sealing instead of conventional resin restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: the study is carried out as a prospective, randomized clinical study (RCT).&#xD;
      Primary, occlusal caries lesions in 521 patients, aged 6-17 years old were treated by&#xD;
      non-invasive resin based sealing (n= 368) or resin based restoration (n=153). The dentists or&#xD;
      patients were not free to choose the treatment type. Randomization between sealing and&#xD;
      restoration (2:1) was made by computer for each practitioner at the University of Copenhagen&#xD;
      and kept at the clinics in sealed envelopes. The treatments are examined clinically and&#xD;
      radiographically after 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. The treatments are performed and&#xD;
      controlled by 68 general practitioners from Public Dental Health Care Service in 9 Danish&#xD;
      municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealing: The dentists use material of own choice, and follow their usual clinical procedures&#xD;
      based on the instructions from the manufacturer and the guidelines from The Department of&#xD;
      Cariology and Endodontics, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration: The dentists use preparation design and material of own choice, and follow their&#xD;
      usual clinical procedures based on the instructions from the manufacturer and the guidelines&#xD;
      from The Department of Cariology and Endodontics, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of regression, arrest and progression of sealed and restored caries lesions,&#xD;
      are computed and related to the clinical and radiological registrations of patient, dentist&#xD;
      or treatment related factors for assessing of statistically significant correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of each factor on the quality, longevity and need for retreatment of occlusal&#xD;
      sealants and restorations, will be assessed using non-parametric tests and Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      survival analyses for statistical treatment of data, supplemented with summarizing&#xD;
      multivariate survival analyses such as the Cox regression model and discriminatory analyses.&#xD;
