      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are testing a new way to find out what causes infections in people in hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current techniques use chemical or biological tests on a person s samples. Samples are blood,&#xD;
      tissue, stool, saliva, urine, etc. Researchers are testing new techniques that use a device&#xD;
      called MiSeq. It can sequence all of the DNA (genetic material) in a sample. This may show&#xD;
      microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses that cause infection. Researchers want&#xD;
      to know if the new test works as well or better than current tests. They will do this by&#xD;
      looking at about 250 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if MiSeq works as well as or better than current tests to identify microorganisms&#xD;
      that cause infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH patients whose samples have been sent to the Microbiology Service s lab for routine&#xD;
      microbiologic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consent to have samples they gave as part of their routine medical care&#xD;
      used in the study. For those under age 18, a parent or legal guardian will consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and optimize testing that uses a next-generation DNA&#xD;
      sequencing instrument, Illumina MiSeq, along with the associated computer infrastructure and&#xD;
      bioinformatics software required for sequence analysis. This system is ultimately intended&#xD;
      for use by the NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine to identify infectious&#xD;
      agents in primary patient specimens. Next generation sequencing techniques based on&#xD;
      sequencing of total DNA from primary specimens are expected to have many advantages over&#xD;
      classical microbiological approaches. These include the detection of pathogens directly from&#xD;
      primary specimens that may be difficult or impossible to culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, discarded patient samples and autopsy material will be tested with the MiSeq&#xD;
      system to identify and classify bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. For the purpose of&#xD;
      this study, the term samples will refer to any sample such as swabs, tissue biopsies, blood,&#xD;
      feces, saliva, urine, wound, etc. The investigators analyzing the sequencing results will be&#xD;
      blinded to the microbiology culture results for a validation subset of specimens to be tested&#xD;
      with the MiSeq system. The results of the MiSeq analysis will be converted into a form that&#xD;
      can be compared with the Microbiology Services official culture results that are stored in&#xD;
      the laboratory information system (software from SCC SOFT Computer [Clearwater, FL, USA]).&#xD;
