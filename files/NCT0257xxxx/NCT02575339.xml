    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, randomized phase I/II study of MLN0128 versus standard&#xD;
      sorafenib. Eligible subjects in the phase I trial will receive MLN0128 in escalating doses.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects in the phase II trial will be 1:1 randomized to either the MLN0128 arm or&#xD;
      the sorafenib arm.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 dose escalation trial will evaluate MLN0128 in a standard 3+3 successive cohort&#xD;
      design to identify the highest planned dose level. Phase II trial subjects will be 1:1&#xD;
      randomized to receive either MLN0128 (investigational arm) or sorafenib (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (dose level +1) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 15mg&#xD;
      on day 1 of the 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (dose level +2) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 20mg&#xD;
      on day 1 of the 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 (dose level +3) will consist of 3-6 evaluable patients who will receive MLN0128 30mg&#xD;
      on day 1 of the 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 28 days of treatment&#xD;
      (1 cycle). However, decisions to move to next dose escalation cohort will not be made until&#xD;
      all subjects complete 2 cycles of therapy at a given dose. There will be no further dose&#xD;
      escalation beyond dose level +3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will take place following completion of the screening evaluations and&#xD;
      eligibility assessments. Stratification factors will be employed during randomization to&#xD;
      minimize between-arm assignment imbalance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Child-Pugh score 5-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 Child-Pugh score 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the strata, subjects will be randomly assigned with equal probability to either the&#xD;
      investigational arm (Arm A: MLN0128) or the control arm (Arm B: sorafenib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: MLN0128 will be administered orally at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) once&#xD;
      weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Sorafenib will be administered at 400mg PO BID daily, with dose adjustment per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new treatment cycle (1 cycle = 28 days) will only be initiated when all of the following&#xD;
      conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelets ≥ 50 x 10*9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-hematologic treatment related toxicities have improved to grade 1 or resolved per&#xD;
           Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment may continue until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Life Expectancy: ≥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have adequate organ function, as specified below, within 7 days before study&#xD;
      registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow reserve consistent with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count ≥ 50 x 10*9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
           (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤&#xD;
           5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min based either on Cockcroft-Gault estimate or based on&#xD;
           urine collection (12 or 24 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting serum glucose (≤ 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides ≤ 300 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;7.0%&#xD;
