  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in patients with thoracolumbar chronic and complete&#xD;
      spinal cord injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, non-placebo controlled, prospective, phase II clinical trial. The study&#xD;
      population will consist of 40 patients who had spinal cord injury for at least 12 months,&#xD;
      with thoracolumbar chronic and complete spinal cord injury, ASIA grade A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A practitioner, a surgeon and a nurse will review the medical records of the patients to&#xD;
      determine the presence / absence of inclusion / exclusion criteria. If the patient is a&#xD;
      potential candidate for the study, an interview will be scheduled to review and confirm&#xD;
      his/her eligibility. Patients will undergo a series of clinical and neurological assessments&#xD;
      and will also be submitted to the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell blood count;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical analysis (measurement of electrolytes - sodium, potassium, magnesium);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal function tests (urea and creatinine);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulation profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic profile (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine summary and culture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serology required for blood transfusion and marrow transplant in Brazil;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-Ray;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone densitometry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urodynamic studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatosensory evoked potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography of thoracic and lumbar spine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also as part of the preoperative evaluation, the patients will respond to questions from the&#xD;
      SF (Short Form) -36 questionnaire (for assessment of quality of life) and the questionnaires&#xD;
      for the assessment of neuropathic pain. Clinical follow-up will be kept for patients who&#xD;
      suspend their participation in the study for any adverse event and / or laboratory&#xD;
      abnormality, or for the patient's own desire, following insurance protocols. In addition to&#xD;
      the clinical and surgical follow-up, specific medical care will be offered to patients who&#xD;
      experience adverse events, until stabilization of the patient, even if the target date for&#xD;
      completion of the study has been exceeded. The candidates included in the study will be asked&#xD;
      to voluntarily participate and give their informed written consent.&#xD;
