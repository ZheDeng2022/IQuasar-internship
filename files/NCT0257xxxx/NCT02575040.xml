  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiota is determined to constitute a &quot;microbial organ&quot; which has pivotal roles in&#xD;
      the intestinal diseases and body's metabolism. Evidence from animal and human studies&#xD;
      strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria flora and inflammatory bowel diseases.&#xD;
      Lots of studies showed its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis.&#xD;
      Corticosteroid dependence in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)&#xD;
      is an important clinical problem and maintenance of steroid-free remission is a key treatment&#xD;
      goal. Early studies using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Ulcerative Colitis (UC)&#xD;
      and Crohn's diseases have also met with success. This is an first step into investigating the&#xD;
      potential efficacy of standardized FMT through terminal ileum for UC and CD, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to determine the efficiency and safety of FMT in a series of 80&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe UC and CD.&#xD;

      Intestinal microbiota have a major role in disease pathogenesis, either in a form of a&#xD;
      &quot;permissive&quot; role or as a direct pathogenic cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile colitis; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD) have all been connected to a disturbance in the equilibrium of intestinal microbiome.&#xD;
      The cause of IBD in unknown but evidence is getting that immense immune reaction of&#xD;
      intestinal immune system to microflora combined with a genetic predisposition are responsible&#xD;
      for the chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbial treatment (FMT) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy&#xD;
      intestine as a probiotic preparation. The fecal material of a healthy individual is fluidized&#xD;
      and that inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual, assuming that the healthy&#xD;
      flora will colonize and cure the intestine. Previous work had shown success in fecal&#xD;
      transplantation as a treatment for clostridium difficile colitis. There are also reports of&#xD;
      the efficacy of this treatment for inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are&#xD;
      small. 41 cases were reported , In some the FMT was inserted through a nasogastric tube&#xD;
      directly to the duodenum, in some be colonoscopy and in some by an enema. A significant&#xD;
      clinical improvement was reported in 19 of 25 patients. 13 of 17 stopped IBD treatment , 15&#xD;
      of 24 entered full clinical remission. In all 15 patients treated for infection the treatment&#xD;
      was successful. No sever adverse effects were reported, Fever was developed in 8 cases and in&#xD;
      one case there was exacerbation of colitis after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To investigate whether use of FMT will bring improvement of at least 2 points in&#xD;
      partial mayo score in ulcerative colitis patients, or 75 points in CDAI of patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's colitis. One month after FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement will be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Ulcerative colitis: a decrease of at least 2 points in the partial mayo score, and a&#xD;
      decrease of at least 1 point in endoscopic Mayo score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Crohn's disease: A decrease of at least 70 points in Crohn's disease activity index&#xD;
      (CDAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients aged &gt;18 years, with histological and endoscopic diagnosis of ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC) or CD who did not respond to either thiopurines or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flare will be defined as partial mayo score higher then 3, with either C reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) higher than 6 or endoscopic mayo score &gt;1 in ulcerative colitis and CDAI higher them&#xD;
      220 and CRP higher than 6 in Crohn's colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool will be donated by the patients choice either from a relative, preferably a partner to&#xD;
      minimize possible transference of an infective agent, alternatively samples will be ordered&#xD;
      from &quot;open biom&quot;.&#xD;
