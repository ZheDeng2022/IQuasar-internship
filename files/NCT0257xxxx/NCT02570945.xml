  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of all elderly (65 and older) patients hospitalized at the&#xD;
      Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke. The patients who present a&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic problem will be randomly allocated between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. Practically, the relevant data will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Record&#xD;
      (EMR) on a daily basis and analysed by a Computerized Alert System (CAS) to identify&#xD;
      pharmacotherapeutic problems. These problems will be analysed a pharmacist specialised in&#xD;
      geriatrics to determine their clinical relevance and the modifications that can be made.&#xD;
      Clinically relevant pharmacotherapeutic problems will be discussed by the pharmacist and&#xD;
      treating physician to establish the changes needed to optimize drug therapy. A geriatrician&#xD;
      will also be available to assist the pharmacist in his initial assessment for particularly&#xD;
      complex cases. For control patients, a CAS analysis will be conducted to identify patients&#xD;
      with a pharmacotherapeutic problem but there will not be a formal discussion amongst the&#xD;
      health care providers (usual care) and the physicians of the control group will provide usual&#xD;
      care to their patients. The investigators believe that it is ethical to provide usual care to&#xD;
      the control group since the beneficial impact on patients outcomes of the investigators'&#xD;
      intervention has not been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapeutic problems were prioritized by the CHUS Elderly Adapted Care-medication&#xD;
      committee and are based on the Beers criteria with an emphasis on drugs involved in the&#xD;
      development of delirium. Selected pharmacotherapeutic problems are: 1) For patients 75 and&#xD;
      older: i) taking a PIM; ii) concomitant use of 4 or more drugs from a list of drugs active at&#xD;
      the CNS; iii) positive test for delirium with a PIM; 2) For patients 65 years and older: i)&#xD;
      taking levodopa (Parkinson indicator) with a PIM; ii) taking cholinesterase inhibitor or&#xD;
      memantine (indicators of dementia) with a PIM. The use of levodopa, a cholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitor or memantine are frailty indicators.&#xD;
