  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial are to pragmatically investigate whether participation in a&#xD;
      comprehensive CR (i.e., exercise with education) program in a Latin American MIC results in&#xD;
      better functional capacity, cardiovascular risk factor control, health behavior,&#xD;
      disease-related knowledge, depressive symptoms and lower mortality when compared exercise&#xD;
      only CR or wait list control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a single-blinded, single-site pragmatic superiority RCT with 3 parallel arms:&#xD;
      comprehensive CR (education and exercise) versus exercise-based CR (no education, as&#xD;
      delivered in Brazil) versus wait list control (i.e., no CR). Patient assessments will be&#xD;
      undertaken pre-randomization and again at 6 and 12 months later (in accordance with the end&#xD;
      of CR). Mortality will be ascertained at 6 months and 1 year post-recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main program is 6 months in duration, with 36 1-hour exercise sessions offered at the&#xD;
      following frequencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. participants come to CR for 12 sessions, 3x a week (total of 4 weeks of intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. participants come to CR for 8 sessions, 2x a week (total of 4 weeks of intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. participants come to CR for 12 sessions, 1x a week (total of 12 weeks of intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive an individualized exercise prescription based on a grade&#xD;
      exercise stress test. Participants will be exercising between 50 and 80% of heart rate&#xD;
      reserve. In all stages patients will be requested to exercise in their community other days&#xD;
      of the week, to accumulate 30 or more minutes of physical activity at a moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity 5 or more days per week, as recommended in the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the comprehensive CR arm, 24 sessions education will be offered, of 30 minutes duration.&#xD;
      More specifically, the education component consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weekly group education sessions, which are strategically mapped based on patients'&#xD;
           information needs and sequenced to support the program learning outcomes. Education&#xD;
           sessions are delivered by a health educator team. See table 1 for the CR program&#xD;
           schedule, including educational topics (e.g.. diet, medication and exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A comprehensive education workbook to accompany the sessions, containing 20 chapters.&#xD;
           The empirically-validated English version has been translated and culturally-adapted to&#xD;
           Brazilian-Portuguese. Clinicians and patients have reviewed the material, and a plain&#xD;
           language and clear design review was completed in preparation for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for Brazilian adults with CVD does not include access to CR for all&#xD;
      patients, given the gross lack of capacity. All participants will have follow-up appointments&#xD;
      with their physician as deemed medically appropriate. Consistent with CONSORT guidelines,&#xD;
      usual care will be described in detail for each participant (e.g., number of health visits -&#xD;
      both inpatient and outpatient, other treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients approached and date will be recorded, as well as the reasons for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion. With informed written consent from the patient and CR clearance from the&#xD;
      physician, potentially eligible participants will be scheduled to come on-site to complete&#xD;
      pre-test assessments. Participants will be asked to complete a sociodemographic&#xD;
      questionnaire, to establish the generalizability of the sample, among other surveys. Clinical&#xD;
      information will be extracted from participants' charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the 3 groups. The randomization sequence&#xD;
      was generated using the random.org website in random blocks of 4, with a 1:1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio. To ensure allocation concealment, the local principal investigator has the allocation&#xD;
      sequence in a password-protected file, and will only provide randomization information to the&#xD;
      student once it is confirmed the participant is eligible. Due to the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention, participants and the doctoral student cannot be blind to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of functional capacity will be assessed again at 6 months. All other&#xD;
      post-test assessments will be undertaken 6 months post-randomization. Mortality will be&#xD;
      ascertained from hospital charts and family phone call at 6 months and 1-year. With regard to&#xD;
      the baseline and 6 months assessments, participants will be invited to come to the study&#xD;
      center to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. undertake the shuttle walk test as the indicator of functional capacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. undertake assessments of secondary outcomes including a blood draw for lipids, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. complete surveys related to tertiary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A master's student blinded to random allocation will undertake post-test assessments, outcome&#xD;
      ascertainment and data entry. To minimize loss to follow-up, investigators will send mail and&#xD;
      telephone reminders for patients to come on-site for these assessments, based on the Dillman&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Participants will be asked to complete a sociodemographic questionnaire. Clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be extracted from the medical charts, including sex, age, risk factors,&#xD;
      cardiac history, cardiac test results, comorbidities and medications. These are based on the&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society core element and demographic data definitions. CR session&#xD;
      attendance will be extracted from program charts at post-test for participants randomized to&#xD;
      the CR arms.&#xD;
