    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of using an end-of-life conversation game (called&#xD;
      &quot;My Gift of Grace&quot;) as a community engagement activity series to help caregivers, patients&#xD;
      with chronic illness, and/or their families perform advance care planning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While many patients and caregivers of individuals with chronic illness recognize the&#xD;
      importance of advance care planning, many feel uncomfortable initiating end-of-life&#xD;
      conversations with loved ones. Few tools exist that effectively engage caregivers and address&#xD;
      their particular concerns and needs. The investigators have preliminary data showing that an&#xD;
      easily implementable intervention (a conversation game) effectively engages healthy&#xD;
      participants in realistic and satisfying ACP conversations. However, the investigators have&#xD;
      not yet tested the acceptability or feasibility of using the game in a population of&#xD;
      caregivers and/or patients with chronic illness. This pilot project will enable us to engage&#xD;
      community-based patients and caregivers to determine if they find the game a satisfying,&#xD;
      acceptable, relevant, and effective tool for advance care planning.&#xD;
