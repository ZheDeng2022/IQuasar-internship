  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single center, single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way&#xD;
      crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SST-6007 in women with FSAD. A&#xD;
      sufficient number of participants will be enrolled to yield 30 (approximately 15&#xD;
      pre-menopausal and 15 post-menopausal) participants to complete the SST-6007/Placebo&#xD;
      Double-Blind, Dosing Phase of the study (Visit 2 and Visit 3).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will first complete a telephone screen (&lt; 28 days prior to Visit 1, Medical&#xD;
      Screening) and will be scheduled for Visit 1 if eligible. After consent is obtained, study&#xD;
      participants will undergo Visit 1 at a local gynecology clinic to determine their eligibility&#xD;
      for continued study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      they will be scheduled for Visit 2 and Visit 3 of the SST-6007/Placebo Double-Blind, Dosing&#xD;
      Phase to be conducted at the Sexual Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of Texas at&#xD;
      Austin. Visit 2 must be within 5 (±2) days of Visit 1. One visit will evaluate the&#xD;
      participant's response to SST-6007 and the other will evaluate the participant's response to&#xD;
      placebo cream, using the VPP, the Arousometer, and neutral-erotic film presentations. The&#xD;
      sequence of dosing will be randomly assigned (i.e., placebo cream then SST-6007 or SST-6007&#xD;
      then placebo cream) according to a computer-generated, randomization. There will be a 4-8 day&#xD;
      washout period between Visits 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each experimental session, physiological and subjective sexual arousal will be&#xD;
      assessed simultaneously and continuously using the VPP and the Arousometer. Electrical&#xD;
      activity of the heart will be assessed with an ECG. ECG data will be used to process the VPA&#xD;
      data. Immediately following completion of each erotic film, subjective sexual arousal,&#xD;
      subjective perception of genital arousal, and positive and negative affect will be evaluated&#xD;
      using a self-report 7-point Likert Scale (Film Scale) and the Positive and Negative Affect&#xD;
      Schedule (PANAS).&#xD;

&#xD;
        19. Participant has moderate to severe current vaginitis, a vaginal infection including&#xD;
        bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. The diagnosis of yeast infections should be made&#xD;
        by the Sub-Investigator based on the physical and gynecological exams; the objective is to&#xD;
        exclude women that are symptomatic. If the woman is not complaining of symptoms but the&#xD;
        Sub-Investigator observes discharge, than the vaginal wet mount test should also be&#xD;
        performed to confirm a diagnosis of yeast infection.&#xD;
