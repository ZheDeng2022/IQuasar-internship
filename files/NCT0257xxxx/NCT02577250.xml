  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between depression and trauma is well established. Co-occuring depression&#xD;
      and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with more severe symptoms and lower&#xD;
      levels of functioning. Veterans with both depression and PTSD have been shown to be at much&#xD;
      higher risk of suicide than individuals with only one of these disorders. Ketamine has been&#xD;
      shown to have rapid antidepressant effects and also therapeutic action over PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether ketamine, when given as repeated infusions, can&#xD;
      produce quick and sustained improvement in depression and PTSD symptoms for individuals who&#xD;
      have not had their symptoms effectively treated by current treatments.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a pilot study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of serial&#xD;
      ketamine infusions among veterans with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as well as&#xD;
      chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The investigators hypothesize that six&#xD;
      infusions of ketamine will be effective in decreasing severity of depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      maintaining response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be male/female veterans (18 to 75 years old) of any era or military&#xD;
      background who suffer from TRD and chronic PTSD. Potential participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from Mental Health clinics and screened for eligibility using a two stage process&#xD;
      (phone/chart review, followed by interview). Participants will receive six ketamine infusions&#xD;
      on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule over 2 weeks. On the day of infusion, participants will&#xD;
      be required to stay at the clinical site for 3 hours after the medication has been given.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur at different time points over the course of 2 months after the&#xD;
      two week infusion period has been completed.&#xD;
