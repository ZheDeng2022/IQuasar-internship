      Primary aim: Evaluating the effect of Asthmatuner on patients´ self-reported asthma control&#xD;
      test (ACT/C-ACT)compared with conventional asthma management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: Evaluating patients´ health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) medical adherence&#xD;
      by using Asthmatuner compared with conventional management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size: Stratified study population consisting of 43 females and males with&#xD;
      diagnosed asthma at the age of at least 6 years pediatric specialist care and 43&#xD;
      females/males in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled, cross-over trial over&#xD;
      to at least 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Two stratified groups of participants with uncontrolled asthma will be recruited;&#xD;
      (1) children and adolescents from Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital, and (2) adolescents and adults from the primary health care sector in&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden. The asthma control test (ACT/C-ACT) will be applied for evaluation of&#xD;
      asthma control, a score less than 20 will be required for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Asthmatuner is an app supporting self-management evaluating symptoms and lung&#xD;
      function with external spirometry. The app gathers the information to define patients´ asthma&#xD;
      control. Subsequently, Asthmatuner provides the patient with a treatment recommendation based&#xD;
      on the individual treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants are randomized (1:1) into the one of two-arms of asthma&#xD;
      self-management with Asthmatuner - conventional or conventional - Asthmatuner. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will collect information about asthma control, HR-QoL, Medicine adherence report scale (MARS)&#xD;
      and history of medical health concerning health care utilization and personal costs and&#xD;
      income.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The study hypothesis will be tested by examining difference in patients´ change in&#xD;
      asthma control (ACT/C-ACT) and HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ). Results will be summarized at each&#xD;
      management period as mean scores and analysed by paired t-tests.&#xD;

      2. Background Clinical gaps hamper proper asthma management, and leads to delayed or&#xD;
      undiagnosed disease, poor adherence to treatment, inadequate self-care abilities, inadequate&#xD;
      understanding of disease severity, poor patient education, inadequate measurement of lung&#xD;
      function, and inconsistent evaluation of symptoms. To improve the patient's ability to&#xD;
      self-manage and to overcome clinical gaps, evidence emphasizes clinics to offer comprehensive&#xD;
      patient education. The national Finish asthma programme (1994-2004) focused on applying&#xD;
      effective strategies of asthma management, as a result, patient's self-management was&#xD;
      improved, and cost-effective through limited demands on the health-care and social security&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel applications embodied in smartphones are straightforward alternative to facilitate&#xD;
      health care and support patients with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma.&#xD;
      Asthmatuner is a smartphone app that enables evaluation of lung function and symptoms. The&#xD;
      app provides patients with a daily treatment plan adjusted for symptoms and lung function.&#xD;
      Additionally, information is accessible and can be assessed by health care providers through&#xD;
      a back-end system. Future versions of Asthmatuner will be enabled through patient's own&#xD;
      medical record. Self-management apps with hands-on guidance for self-management of asthma&#xD;
      present a promising future for closing clinical gaps, but the overall benefits of using the&#xD;
      service in the treatment of asthma need comprehensive evaluation that answers scientific&#xD;
      questions and end-user opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Aims The primary aim is to evaluate Asthmatuner and the clinical effect on patients´&#xD;
      self-reported asthma control test (scores of ACT/C-ACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect on patients´ and HR-QoL and medical adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes The primary outcome will be scores of ACT/C-ACT and Paediatric asthma&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) or Mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (Mini-AQLQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes The secondary outcomes are scores of Medicine adherence report scale&#xD;
      (MARS) and costs of prescribed dose and type of control medication and total amount of direct&#xD;
      and indirect costs for patient/caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Material and methods Study design: Multicenter randomized controlled physician blinded&#xD;
      crossover trial, where study participants were randomized to start with AsthmaTuner or&#xD;
      conventional treatment, and a washout period between treatments, Figure 1. Primary outcome of&#xD;
      asthma control test (ACT) or Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) were measured two times in&#xD;
      each treatment period, at baseline and at follow-up visit, equal or more than 8 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment started. The participating centers were recommended to comply with Swedish national&#xD;
      treatment and management of asthma, which closely resemble with Global Initiative for Asthma&#xD;
      (GINA). A study nurse at each site performed the randomization by open a sealed envelope&#xD;
      indicating the start of either AsthmaTuner or conventional treatment. The physician was&#xD;
      blinded for the order of given treatments when one paper personalized treatment plan and one&#xD;
      individual treatment plan for AsthmaTuner were arranged to each patient according to levels&#xD;
      of controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma. The regional board of Ethical&#xD;
      Committee in Stockholm (number: 2015/1527-31/1 and 2016/1546-32) and Swedish Medical Products&#xD;
      Agency (number 5.1-2016-19829) both approved the study. The study was registered at&#xD;
      ClinicalTrial.gov&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Asthmatuner is a CE-marked cloud-based system with healthcare interface and a&#xD;
      downloaded patient app (Android or iOS). The intended use of Asthmatuner is to automate and&#xD;
      facilitate self-management of asthma, by letting patient register symptoms and to measure&#xD;
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) with a Bluetooth spirometer (MIR, SmartOne).&#xD;
      The patient receives an immediate feedback on asthma control and treatment recommendation&#xD;
      with an image of the correct inhaler to use and the dose. Asthma control is defined based on&#xD;
      to GINA and a summary of lung function; liter to percentage of personalized best FEV1 using&#xD;
      cutoff equal or less than 80%, and asthma symptoms last week in terms of; need for recue&#xD;
      medication more than twice, daytime symptoms, nocturnal symptoms/awakenings and limitation of&#xD;
      activities. Furthermore, Asthmatuner offers patient and asthma care provider a longitudinal&#xD;
      data view of prescribed treatments, lung function and experienced symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects, children from 6 years and adults, with doctor's diagnosis of asthma and ACT&#xD;
      or C-ACT score below 20 points, were included in the region of Stockholm, Sweden. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in the primary health care sector and in asthma clinics specialised for&#xD;
      children and adolescents in Stockholm. Patients were included at Liljeholmen Health Care&#xD;
      Centre, Sophiahemmet Health Care Centre, and Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital (Lung- and&#xD;
      Allergy Department in Solna and Children and Adolescents Health Care Department in Huddinge)&#xD;
      during the years of 2016-2018. Exclusion criteria were other ongoing comorbidity impairing&#xD;
      the asthma control, participation in other drug trial, and a patient or all caregiver(s) (in&#xD;
      case the patient is a child) incapable to read Swedish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A health questionnaire completed at the first visit will provide information regarding&#xD;
           asthma medical history, health utilization, annual income and employment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACT will be used to assess asthma control in patients 12 years or older, and C-ACT in&#xD;
           children of age 6 to 11 years. A mean score equal or below 19 indicates uncontrolled&#xD;
           asthma. Scores above 19 defines asthma to be controlled in both tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HR-QoL will be applied in patients from 6 to 11 years of age using the validated Swedish&#xD;
           translated Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), and the mini Asthma&#xD;
           Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ) in patients from 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported medication adherence will be measured with five-item MARS, developed to&#xD;
           assess adherence with asthma medication. The MARS comprises statements about medication&#xD;
           use behaviors. The patient is asked to answer each behavior with a score between 1-5&#xD;
           based on of following alternatives; &quot;always&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot;.&#xD;
           A mean MARS score will then be calculated, and a score of 4.5 or greater indicates good&#xD;
           adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time consume, utility and satisfaction using Asthmatuner will be asked&#xD;
           patient/caregiver, nurses and physicians in relation to applied management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis The power analysis is based on our previous analysis of ACT/C-ACT and HR-QoL&#xD;
      scores in schoolchildren with uncontrolled severe asthma [21]. The scores for severe&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma were on average for ACT 17 (SD 3.3) and for PAQLQ 5.4 (SD 0.77). Thus, an&#xD;
      estimated improvement of ACT from 17 to 19 (two points) or PAQLQ from 5.4 to 5.9 (0.5 points)&#xD;
      requires 38-43 patients in each group (Asthmatuner vs. conventional management) to attain an&#xD;
      80 % power at 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Eligibility of participants will be checked. The patient will be given information&#xD;
      about the study procedures and must sign the informed consent form. At the visit the&#xD;

      from baseline in asthma control (ACT/C-ACT), HR-QoL (PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ), and in MARS scores&#xD;
      between asthma management groups. Results will be summarized between each group as mean&#xD;
      scores and analysed by paired t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.8 Withdrawal A patient should be withdrawn from the trial if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient. In any&#xD;
      circumstances the reasons for withdrawal should be documented in the Study termination&#xD;
      report. Participants who discontinue from the study for any reason will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.9 Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participants using or not using&#xD;
      Asthmatuner. AE include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All suspect adverse reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All reactions from medical overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apparently unrelated illness, including the worsening of a preexisting illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injury or accident&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation&#xD;
           unless they are associated with an already reported clinical event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preexisting conditions In this trial, a preexisting condition i.e. asthma, should not be&#xD;
      reported as an adverse event unless the condition worsens or episodes increases (i.e.&#xD;
      exacerbations) in the frequency during the adverse event reporting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Diagnostics and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery,&#xD;
      should not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which the&#xD;
      procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. The AE&#xD;
      reporting period begins upon starting the use of Asthmatuner or conventional management&#xD;
      (visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be questioned about AE for each visit 2 and 3. All AE that occur in the&#xD;
      trial should be reported to investigator and specified in the participants´ medical journal&#xD;
      and in a separate AE form with following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association with Asthmatuner (No/Yes/Unknown)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gravity (Serious or Non-serious)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reporting time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up (resolved or unresolved)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gravity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each AE is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non-serious. This&#xD;
      classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedure to be followed.&#xD;
      An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria is classified as serious:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital anomaly/birth defect All serious AE should directly be reported to&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Ethics The trial will be performed in accordance with the World Medical Assembly Helsinki&#xD;
      recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects [26]. It&#xD;
      is the responsibility of the investigators to obtain approval of the trial from regional&#xD;
      ethic committee´.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the responsibility of the investigators to give each patient prior to inclusion in the&#xD;
      trial, full adequate information regarding the trial and the procedures. The patient must be&#xD;
      informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time. Written patient&#xD;
      information must be given to each patient before enrollment. In addition, it is the&#xD;
      responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed informed consent from all participants.&#xD;
