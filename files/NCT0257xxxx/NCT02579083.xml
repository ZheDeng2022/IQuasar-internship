  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of MB66, a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody film for vaginal application that is being developed to potentially reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, Phase 1, randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled, two-segment&#xD;
      study to assess the safety of the MB66 vaginal film. After appropriate screening,&#xD;
      approximately 43 healthy women will be enrolled. The study will be divided into two&#xD;
      sequential Segments. The first, Segment A, is a single-arm, single-dose, open label design.&#xD;
      The 8 Segment A participants will receive a single dose of one full MB66 film. After dosing,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to maintain sexual abstinence and will be evaluated in person on Day 1&#xD;
      (24-hours post MB66 administration), by telephone on Day 3 or 4 and in person on the Day 6-10&#xD;
      Exit Visit, after which subjects will be allowed to resume sexual activity with&#xD;
      study-provided condoms until three weeks after last exposure to film (to avoid male exposure&#xD;
      to residual drug product). A placebo arm is not included in Segment A, because the very low&#xD;
      risk of toxicity of the placebo film makes it unlikely that any toxicity observed in Segment&#xD;
      A would be wrongly attributed to the active agents (mAbs) in the MB66 film. This conclusion&#xD;
      is based on the known tolerance of the very similar vehicle used in a commercial polyvinyl&#xD;
      alcohol (PVA)-based vaginal film (VCFÂ®), and the absence of toxicity of the MB66 placebo film&#xD;
      in the very sensitive rabbit model after substantially higher dosing intensity and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of Segment A and a safety review of Segment A adverse events will trigger the&#xD;
      initiation of Segment B, a repeat dose, randomized, two arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups (15 evaluable subjects per group) and&#xD;
      be treated once daily with either 1 MB66 film or 1 vehicle control placebo film for seven&#xD;
      consecutive days. For five days before, and for 7 days after the dosing period, subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain a period of sexual abstinence. Subjects will be evaluated in person on&#xD;
      Day 0 (at 1 and 4 hours post MB66 in-clinic dosing), again on Day 1 (24 hr post dosing), by&#xD;
      telephone on Day 3-4, and evaluated again in person on Day 7-8, after which, subjects will be&#xD;
      allowed to resumed sexual activity with condoms required until three weeks after last film&#xD;
      insertion. Subjects will be evaluated a last time on the Day 12-16 Exit Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to safety measures, pharmacokinetic evaluations will be done on Day 0, Day 1, and&#xD;
      Day 7 in both Segments, and additionally on Day 14 for Segment B. Specifically, this study&#xD;
      will evaluate the rate of MB66 film dissolution, the vaginal concentrations of the MB66&#xD;
      antibodies, and the degree of systemic absorption of the MB66 antibodies. A number of of&#xD;
      exploratory objectives will also be evaluated, including assessment of the antiviral effect&#xD;
      of the MB66 antibodies ex vivo in cervicovaginal lavage fluid from participants after dosing&#xD;
      with MB66 film, the effects of MB66 and placebo films on the cervicovaginal microbial&#xD;
      environment using pH, Nugent score, and bacterial ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR), and comparison of the effect of MB66 and placebo films on cervicovaginal immune&#xD;
      mediators by Luminex and ELISA assays. Segment B participants will also be asked to assess&#xD;
      the acceptability of the MB66 vaginal film after 7 days of use.&#xD;
