  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims towards investigating the efficacy of a near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS)-based neurofeedback training in a virtual reality (VR) classroom in schoolchildren&#xD;
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The investigators are especially&#xD;
      interested in the training's impact on academic performance, executive functioning (EF) and&#xD;
      behavioral ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, the investigators aim at examining the influence of&#xD;
      teachers' instructional behavior on children with ADHD's learning in a short virtual reality&#xD;
      classroom scenario. Several studies provide evidence that poor academic achievement in ADHD&#xD;
      is mainly due to impairments in EF and ADHD behavior (e.g., Frazier, Youngstrom, Glutting, &amp;&#xD;
      Watkins, 2007; Miller et al., 2013). Furthermore, studies show that these factors are related&#xD;
      to neurophysiological characteristics found in electroencephalographic (EEG) or functional&#xD;
      NIRS (fNIRS) examinations (e.g., Barry, Clarke, &amp; Johnstone, 2003; Barry, Johnstone, &amp;&#xD;
      Clarke, 2003; Loo &amp; Barkley, 2005; Negoro et al., 2010). Neurofeedback trainings aim at&#xD;
      improving these neurophysiological as well as cognitive-behavioral deficits (Gevensleben,&#xD;
      Moll, Rothenberger, &amp; Heinrich, 2014), and are expected to improve academic performance in&#xD;
      children with ADHD accordingly. Training in a VR classroom, from the investigators'&#xD;
      perspective, facilitates generalization of self-regulation competences to real-life academic&#xD;
      situations and at the same time increases the effort invested into the training compared to a&#xD;
      training in 2D settings. Consequently, training in a VR classroom is hypothesized to lead to&#xD;
      greater improvement in academic performance, EF and a greater decrease of ADHD symptoms than&#xD;
      a training in a 2D setting. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that these effects are&#xD;
      more pronounced in children who receive a NIRS-based neurofeedback training compared to&#xD;
      children receiving a biofeedback training based on an electromyogram (EMG).&#xD;

      1. Strategies 90 schoolchildren from Grade 1 to 4 that meet criteria for a DSM-V diagnosis&#xD;
           of ADHD (any presentation) will be recruited. The design will involve three groups (n =&#xD;
           30 per group; N = 90) to which recruited children will be assigned randomly, but matched&#xD;
           for age, gender, and medication. In addition to VR NIRS NF and VR EMG biofeedback&#xD;
           groups, a third group will experience the NIRS NF in the exact same 2D classroom&#xD;
           environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Study 2.1. Testing Protocol Informed consent discussion: Parents of children&#xD;
           pre-diagnosed with ADHD will not undergo a screening process. However, parents whose&#xD;
           children have not been pre-diagnosed with ADHD before, will be provided with the German&#xD;
           version of the Conners-3 parent ADHD-Index (C3-AI). Only if the screening indicates that&#xD;
           the child is at an increased risk of having ADHD, will the investigators proceed with an&#xD;
           informed consent discussion. If the screening indicates that it is unlikely that the&#xD;
           child has ADHD, the investigators will exclude the child from the study. After the&#xD;
           meeting, if the child was either pre-diagnosed with ADHD before, or the screening&#xD;
           indicates an increased likelihood for the child to have ADHD, parents will have enough&#xD;
           time to think about whether they want to give written informed consent to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents give written informed consent, the next step will be a session in which the ADHD&#xD;
      diagnosis is verified. For this session, parents will be informed about three opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic session in the scope of their participation in a second study at the&#xD;
           pediatric clinic in Tübingen at the same time that they participate in our biofeedback&#xD;
           study. This study is called &quot;Aufmerksamkeit und Kognition bei Kindern mit&#xD;
           Neurofibromatose Typ 1&quot;, which is still searching for children with ADHD only (without&#xD;
           neurofibromatosis type 1) to form a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic session in the scope of the &quot;Spezialsprechstunde ADHS&quot; in the outpatient&#xD;
           clinic of the department of child and adolescence psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic session within the scope of this biofeedback study as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic session: For a standardized confirmation as well as a characterization of the&#xD;
      diagnosis, the long versions of the Conners-3 parent and teacher rating scales (3-P and 3-T)&#xD;
      will be applied. Furthermore, the German version of the Strengths- and Difficulties&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SDQ-Deu) is going to assess the severity of the symptoms as well as&#xD;
      comorbidities from class teacher as well as parental perspective. In order to assess the&#xD;
      actual quality of life of parents and child parents and children will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      the Kiddy-Kindl in its appropriate version. Moreover, surrounding variables such as&#xD;
      medication, prior treatment, other clinical diagnoses etc. will be assessed with a&#xD;
      questionnaire. As neuropsychological variables, intelligence will be assessed using the short&#xD;
      version of the Culture Fair Test (CFT 1-R or CFT 20-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 of the pre-test is going to assess executive functions of the participants and&#xD;
      requires a washout of methylphenidate (MPH) as well as amphetamines. MPH and amphetamines&#xD;
      should be washed out for at least 48 hours over the weekend so that the pre-test can take&#xD;
      place on Mondays. Atomoxetine does not need any washout as the effects of medication are not&#xD;
      directly related to the drug level in the blood. In this first session, a combined&#xD;
      EEG/NIRS-measurement will take place as the investigators would like to provide information&#xD;
      about whether changes caused by the BF intervention are also reflected in changes that can be&#xD;
      measured with EEG and NIRS during the following tasks: a Go/No-Go Task (10 min.), a verbal&#xD;
      fluency task (10 min.) and an n-back task (10 min.). Furthermore, the participants'&#xD;
      performance on a digit span task (forward &amp; backward) (10 min.) will assess verbal WM whereas&#xD;
      a matrices span task (15 min.) and the Corsi Block Tapping Task (forward &amp; backward) (10&#xD;
      min.) will assess visual-spatial WM performance. Inhibition will be once more assessed using&#xD;
      the Stop Signal Task (10 min.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 (without medication washout) will assess academic performance using one of the&#xD;
      appropriate DEMAT 1+-4 (20-40 Min.) assessing mathematical performance and the SLRT-II (25-35&#xD;
      Min.) assessing reading and writing performance. Furthermore, sustained attention will be&#xD;
      assessed with the Conner's CPT (15 min.). Questionnaires assessing self-control and academic&#xD;
      self-efficacy will be filled out by the children (ca. 20 min.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, an accelerometer that is worn on the non-dominant side of the body (hip),&#xD;
      attached to the waistband with a light belt, for ten consecutive days will objectively assess&#xD;
      motor hyperactivity. During this time, parents will be called once per day to assess ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms with the Global Index ADHD (ADHS-GI) and to check whether the accelerometer is worn&#xD;
      and works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and teachers will be asked to fill out the BRIEF as well as the SDQ-Deu, the long&#xD;
      versions of the Conners-3 parent and teacher rating scales (3-P and 3-T) and the Kiddy-Kindl.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will ask the parents to fill out an adapted version of the FERT&#xD;
      as well as an adapted version of the brief self-control scale in order to assess their&#xD;
      expectancies of the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midway-Test: After eight sessions, participants will have a break of two to three weeks in&#xD;
      which no NF or BF training takes place. ADHD behavior will be assessed by asking parents as&#xD;
      well as teachers to fill out the Conners 3-P/ 3-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Test: The post-test will follow the procedure already applied in the pre-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up-Test (6 months after the last training session): The Follow-Up-Test will follow the&#xD;
      course of the post-test exactly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every session. During every session, the investigators will assess the participant's&#xD;
      motivation with a short questionnaire measuring joy, effort and enthusiasm. Furthermore,&#xD;
      heart rate variability (HRV) will be recorded as it has been shown to be related to&#xD;
      motivational processes. Accelerometer data from knee and wrist will be recorded to examine&#xD;
      hyperactive behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Training Plan and Protocol The NIRS- and EMG-based NF and BF training protocols of this&#xD;
      study will include 15 training sessions in total, two to three per week. Every training&#xD;
      session will last about 60 minutes including the biofeedback training itself and a&#xD;
      preparation phase at the beginning, in which the NIRS cap and its optodes are fitted to the&#xD;
      head in the case of a NF training, or the EMG electrodes are placed above both Musculi&#xD;
      supraspinatus in the case of a BF training. Furthermore, the head-mounted display (HMD) for&#xD;
      the VR is mounted (in the VR 3D classroom groups only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every training session with NIRS- and EMG-based NF/BF consists of three runs, of which the&#xD;
      first and the second are with continuous performance feedback (feedback condition). In the&#xD;
      third run, no feedback is provided (transfer condition). Lighting in the 3D VR or 2D&#xD;
      classroom increases with activation and decreases with deactivation. During the first eight&#xD;
      training sessions, the training will follow a protocol with 50% activation and 50%&#xD;
      deactivation trials. For the second half of the training sessions, the protocol will change&#xD;
      to 80% activation and 20% deactivation trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eight sessions, participants will have a two to three week break that aims at further&#xD;
      supporting transfer to a real-life setting by using stimulus cards with screenshots of the&#xD;
      training setting and instructions to practice activation and deactivation at home on a daily&#xD;
      basis. The stimulus cards show the image of the classroom participants see during the&#xD;
      training and will be introduced in the laboratory setting directly after the training&#xD;
      sessions 6, 7 and 8. That means, with the help of these cards and while looking at them,&#xD;
      participants should practice brain or muscular activation several times (depending on whether&#xD;
      they belong to the NIRS-NF or EMG-BF group) like they learned in the training, i.e. they&#xD;
      should imagine to increase the lighting in the room when looking at the stimulus cards for&#xD;
      two to four minutes. After this activation task, they solve some mathematical tasks or&#xD;
      riddles matching their age and knowledge. In the second half of the training sessions, after&#xD;
      the break, participants are asked to continue practicing activation at home before doing&#xD;
      their homework as well as in other situations requiring attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Experimental Paradigm Participants that receive a NIRS-based NF training have to&#xD;
      increase the BOLD signal (activation) or decrease it accordingly (deactivation). Analogously,&#xD;
      participants in the BF training condition will have to increase and decrease muscular&#xD;
      activity measured with EMG. Every session consists of three runs. In the first and the second&#xD;
      run, contingent performance feedback is provided, but no feedback is given in the third run.&#xD;
      Feedback will be provided to the participants via a continuous change of the lighting within&#xD;
      the room; the room will brighten with increasing activation and dim with increasing&#xD;
      deactivation. Additional feedback from an animated teacher as well as a scoreboard will&#xD;
      provide them with positive reinforcement at the end of every trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual, auditory and mixed distractors such as, for instance, paper planes flying through the&#xD;
      room, fellow students whispering, or people knocking on the door and coming into the room,&#xD;
      will be introduced in every run from the fourth training session onwards. The distractors&#xD;
      appear with a distance of at least 60 seconds between two distractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline of the first, second and third run will be calculated from the BOLD signal in&#xD;
      the last two seconds before the trigger (arrow) appears. Reinforcement will be provided with&#xD;
      1 smiley when the participant spent 60% of the time of the second half of the trial on the&#xD;
      required side of the baseline (i.e., below, if deactivation is required, or above, if&#xD;
      activation is required). Analogously he/ she will receive 2 smileys with 70% and 3 smileys&#xD;
      with 80% of the second half of the trial in the required direction. Reinforcement for the&#xD;
      second run changes adaptively with the performance in the first run. If the participant&#xD;
      scored between 40-60 % success rate (getting at least 1 smiley), the second block will remain&#xD;
      exactly like the first. If the participant scores lower than 40% success rate, the threshold&#xD;
      will decrease to 0.8 standard deviations (STD) in either direction relative to the baseline,&#xD;
      so that the normalization of the light makes it more sensitive to performance. In addition,&#xD;
      the threshold for getting a smiley would decrease to 50%, 60%, and 70% for one, two or three&#xD;
      smileys respectively. If the participant scores higher than 60 % success rate in the first&#xD;
      run, then the threshold would increase to 1.2 STD above and below the baseline. In addition,&#xD;
      the percent of time that is spent above the baseline or below the baseline would need to be&#xD;
      0.1 STD above or below the baseline to count towards the overall percentage. The third run is&#xD;
      the same as the second in calculation.&#xD;
