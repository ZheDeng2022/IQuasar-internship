  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a Whole Food Intervention reduces the frequency or severity&#xD;
      of esophagitis in patients receiving treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Whole Food Intervention consists of yogurt, butter, honey, vanilla, and glutamine with 3&#xD;
      portioning cups, equal to approximately 12 ounces, taken daily before starting radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      The proposal is a one center, open label, randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and compliance of a Whole Food Intervention with Standard of Care for patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer. The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether patients will use a Whole Food Intervention 4-6 times daily, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the Whole Food Intervention will reduce the incidence of grade 2 or&#xD;
           greater esophagitis from 75% historically seen to 25% .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether Whole Food Intervention will reduce the incidence of treatment&#xD;
           breaks from &gt;19% to &lt; 10% (see section 9 for comments)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Whole Food Intervention will be taken by mouth before the start of radiation therapy,&#xD;
      with or without chemotherapy and for the entire treatment therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagitis-related pain and reduction of oral intake will be quantified by using validated&#xD;
      assessment tools. Weight loss or gain, diarrhea, constipation or no change in bowel function&#xD;
      and the use of conventional medication for radiation-induced esophagitis will be recorded.&#xD;
      Chart review and patient questionnaires will be used to establish whether a treatment break&#xD;
      or dose reduction for radiation of chemotherapy was required due to radiation&#xD;
      esophagitis-related symptoms. Complete Chemistry Profile and Complete Blood Count will be&#xD;
      extracted from the patients' medical oncologist's or radiation oncologist's records. The&#xD;
      patient will continue to use standard esophagitis therapies if desired as prescribed by the&#xD;
      treating oncology physician.&#xD;
