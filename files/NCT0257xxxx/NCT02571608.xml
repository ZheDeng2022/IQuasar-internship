  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II Diabetes Mellitus patients having surgery who adhere to their regular scheduled&#xD;
      metformin dosing and take this medication on the morning of surgery will have better glycemic&#xD;
      control peri-operatively and potentially suffer less morbidity compared to individuals taking&#xD;
      a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative hyperglycemia has been linked to numerous negative adverse consequences,&#xD;
      including wound infection, impaired wound healing, endothelial dysfunction, neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, sepsis, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. This has been shown in&#xD;
      numerous studies as outlined in our detailed research proposal. The peri-operative period&#xD;
      includes a timeframe ranging from 12 to 72 hours around the time of surgery according to&#xD;
      definition. Our study is examining glycemic control in the peri-operative period which we are&#xD;
      defining as approximately 48 hours around the time of surgery. The majority of the patients&#xD;
      with type II diabetes take oral medications, such as metformin, to control their blood sugar.&#xD;
      These patients have historically held their doses on the day of the surgery to avoid possible&#xD;
      low blood sugar and lactic acidosis while fasting. However, numerous recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that individuals who are fasting without renal, heart and liver failure are safe to&#xD;
      take metformin. The most recent guidelines from the American diabetes association suggest&#xD;
      that patients should take their dose of metformin on the day of surgery. Despite these&#xD;
      recommendations most anesthesiologists continue to withhold metformin on the day of surgery,&#xD;
      as no studies exist to show the benefit of continuing metformin. If we are able to show that&#xD;
      patients taken metformin have better glycemic control during this time we can extrapolate&#xD;
      that result mean they may have a lower incidence of the consequences linked to poor glycemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
