      This feasibility study aims to enroll ten subjects who will undergo deceased donor uterine&#xD;
      transplantation at Cleveland Clinic. We estimate that fifty to one hundred patients with&#xD;
      uterine factor infertility will need to be screened to identify 10 appropriate subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are seven phases involved in this study: Primary and Secondary Screening, Medical&#xD;
      Evaluation, IVF, Transplantation, Embryo Transfer, Pregnancy/Delivery and Follow up&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine factor infertility (UFI) is one of the few irreversible causes of female infertility.&#xD;
      Until recently, no medical or surgical options have been available for women with this&#xD;
      diagnosis. UFI is defined by the lack of a functional uterus; this condition can either be&#xD;
      congenital (e.g. Rokitansky syndrome, where a woman is born without an intact uterus) or&#xD;
      acquired (e.g. resulting from hysterectomy or damage to the uterus from procedures or&#xD;
      infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine infertility affects 3-5% of the female population. It is estimated that there are at&#xD;
      least 50,000 women of reproductive age with uterine infertility in the United States.&#xD;
      Existing options for women affected by UFI are limited to adoption or maternal surrogacy.&#xD;
      Surrogacy involves harvesting eggs from the UFI patient and fertilizing these eggs in a lab&#xD;
      with the intention of implanting fertilized embryos into a third party who will carry the&#xD;
      pregnancy. Adoption and surrogacy are considered acceptable options for many women with UFI.&#xD;
      For others, due to social, ethical, cultural and/or religious reasons, these options are not&#xD;
      permissible. In many countries around the world, maternal surrogacy is illegal, leaving no&#xD;
      option for UFI patients to conceive a biological child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, uterine transplantation has been proposed as an alternative method of treating UFI.&#xD;
      Uterine transplantation is intended as a life enhancing procedure, not a life saving&#xD;
      procedure, and is considered to be similar to transplants of the face, extremities and&#xD;
      pancreas. Interestingly, uterine transplantation is considered an &quot;ephemeral&quot; transplant, and&#xD;
      is not intended to last for the duration of the life of the recipient. The transplant is&#xD;
      maintained for only as long as is necessary to produce one or two offspring for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for novel approaches to UFI is clear and exciting work from a team of investigators&#xD;
      in Sweden has finally demonstrated this year that uterine transplantation can result in the&#xD;
      successful delivery of healthy infants with minimal risk to the mother. After careful&#xD;
      collaboration with this Swedish group, we now aim to bring the first uterine transplantation&#xD;
      protocol to the United States using a multidisciplinary team of investigators from within the&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been 11 uterine transplants performed in humans worldwide. The first uterine&#xD;
      transplant was performed in Saudi Arabia in 2000. The living-donor graft survived for 3&#xD;
      months and was subsequently removed due to graft failure. The failure of the graft was&#xD;
      attributed to thrombosis (blood clots affecting the circulation to the organ). Pregnancy was&#xD;
      never attempted using the transplanted uterus prior to it being removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This year, Brännström M. et al. published their experience with the first clinical trial of&#xD;
      human uterine transplantation in a series of 9 women. The clinical trial, based in Sweden,&#xD;
      began in 2012 under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the University of&#xD;
      Gothenburg. The nine women in the study group received uteri from living donors and the&#xD;
      report, published in Fertility and Sterility in May 2014, described that seven out of the&#xD;
      nine transplants were viable after six months of follow up. Nonviability of the two grafts&#xD;
      was reportedly due to uterine artery thrombosis. In most cases, donors were the recipient's&#xD;
      mother. Eight of the recipients had Rokitansky syndrome. One recipient had undergone a&#xD;
      hysterectomy for cervical cancer. There were no immediate perioperative complications and all&#xD;
      patients with successful grafts began to have spontaneous menstrual periods within a few&#xD;
      months of transplantation. Mild rejection appeared to be treatable with steroids. All&#xD;
      recipients had 10 viable embryos produced by in vitro fertilization performed prior to&#xD;
      uterine transplantation. Those embryos were then transferred into the transplanted uterus to&#xD;
      achieve pregnancy. This research has now resulted in the first published report of a human&#xD;
      live birth from uterine transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Gothenburg experience, the donor operation consisted of a hysterectomy including the&#xD;
      uterine arteries and veins with the branches of the internal iliac artery and vein and vault&#xD;
      of vagina. The first segment of the ovarian veins caudad to the ovaries (in order to protect&#xD;
      their outflow) was also included. The explanted uterus was perfused with chilled University&#xD;
      of Wisconsin (UW) solution and prepared for implantation. The implantation was achieved by&#xD;
      anastomosis into the iliac vessels bilaterally, in some cases the donor ovarian veins where&#xD;
      included. The vault of the donor vagina was anastomosed into the existing vagina or&#xD;
      neovagina. Immunosuppression following uterine transplantation included induction with&#xD;
      thymoglobulin and maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and oral steroids.&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued before pregnancy attempts as it is contraindicated in&#xD;
      pregnancy. This immunosuppression regimen is similar to the regimen proven effective in&#xD;
      kidney transplantation, another solid organ graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Andreas Tzakis has been working closely with the Gothenburg group through both early&#xD;
      animal models as well as the recent clinical trial in humans. Below is a summary of this&#xD;
      group's published relevant findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two grafts were lost (one soon after transplant and the other 4 months later) due to&#xD;
           uterine artery thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One donor had a surgical complication, her ureter was injured during removal of the&#xD;
           uterus, and she required a late ureteral reimplantation due to ischemic damage of her&#xD;
           ureter&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Five recipients developed mild rejection of the graft. This was detected by cervical&#xD;
           biopsy and was treated successfully with steroids in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Menstruation occurred regularly in all seven subjects with a successful transplant&#xD;
           within a few months of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. One documented subject had one live birth by Cesarean section; this pregnancy was&#xD;
           complicated by preeclampsia (high blood pressure of pregnancy) at 31.5 weeks gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Pregnancy after Solid Organ Transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since only one live birth in human uterine transplant recipients has been reported, the&#xD;
      pregnancy risks are not firmly established; however pregnancies and deliveries after uterine&#xD;
      transplantation of healthy offspring have been accomplished in small and large animals (mice,&#xD;
      rats, sheep, nonhuman primates). In addition, pregnancy after other solid organ transplants&#xD;
      in humans is well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of immunosuppressive medication is well studied in pregnancy after solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation as well as in women with certain rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine are among the most widely used in pregnancy. Birth&#xD;
      defects with cyclosporine or tacrolimus occur at an incidence of 4-5% which is no different&#xD;
      than the general population. Cyclosporine is associated with low birth weight but does not&#xD;
      appear to impact long term outcomes including intelligence quotient (IQ). Mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF) is associated with a specific pattern of birth defects including facial&#xD;
      malformations, finger abnormalities and heart defects. This medication should not be used in&#xD;
      the first trimester of pregnancy. Azathioprine does not cause birth defects. Corticosteroids&#xD;
      are considered safe however high doses can increase the risk of premature rupture of&#xD;
      membranes. Immunosuppression is also noticed in infants exposed to these medications during&#xD;
      pregnancy including low immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte counts. Most of these deficits&#xD;
      seem to normalize by the sixth month of life, with no noted impact on the infants' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal transplant is the most common solid organ transplant after which pregnancy has been&#xD;
      reported. In these women over 90% achieve successful pregnancy outcomes after the first&#xD;
      trimester. Pregnancy risks include low birth weight, preterm delivery and preeclampsia. It&#xD;
      has consistently been shown that pregnancy does not adversely affect the graft function or&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent maternal complication in this patient population is pregnancy induced&#xD;
      hypertension. Management of such pregnancy complications uterine transplant recipients should&#xD;
      follow standard obstetric guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prematurity is the main fetal complication, which affects nearly 40% of live births. The mean&#xD;
      reported gestational age at delivery is 36.5 weeks, while the mean birth weight is&#xD;
      approximately 14% less than general population (6 lb 5 oz vs 7 lb 4 oz). Other fetal&#xD;
      complications that have been observed include intrauterine growth restriction (approximately&#xD;
      20%), prenatal infections, and birth defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 400 pregnancies after liver transplantation have been reported. Similar risks are&#xD;
      reported in these women including preeclampsia preterm birth and low birth weight. Less data&#xD;
      is available from women who have undergone less common transplants. Kidney-pancreas&#xD;
      transplant is associated with a higher complication rates. Hypertension is reported and 75%&#xD;
      in addition there is a 55% risk of infection and 68% risk of low birth weight. These studies&#xD;
      are limited by lack of consideration of the original disease of the organ recipient or the&#xD;
      functional status of the transplanted organ. Women undergoing uterine transplantation will&#xD;
      have no significant preexisting medical conditions unlike women undergoing other solid organ&#xD;
      transplantations. Both these elements are likely to have an influence on the incidence of&#xD;
      complications of the pregnancy and have not been included in previous large analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to The American Society of Transplantation, pregnancy is allowable in renal organ&#xD;
      transplantation one year after transplantation if there has been no signs of rejection, the&#xD;
      transplanted organ has adequate function, there is no active infection (particularly&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus infection) and the immunosuppression dose has been stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waiting one year after the transplantation prior to conception decreases the risk of acute&#xD;
      rejection and infection. During the pregnancy it is important to monitor blood pressure and&#xD;
      treat hypertension diligently, maintain strict glycemic control, monitor for signs of&#xD;
      infection, and assess maternal levels of immunosuppressive medications more frequently.&#xD;
