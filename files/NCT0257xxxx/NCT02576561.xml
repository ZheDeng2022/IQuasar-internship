  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      investigational study vaccine, called TVGV-1. The study will test the vaccine in women with&#xD;
      high grade HPV cervical infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 2a Study VAX 02-01 is to assess the safety and activity of TVGV-1&#xD;
      vaccine construct in achieving the absence of histologic HSIL (CIN2/3) (regression to LSIL or&#xD;
      less) as assessed by biopsy at last study Visit 11, Day 270.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the TVGV-1 program is to develop a non-surgical alternative that is&#xD;
      reliable, safe, and would avoid potential surgical risks such as preterm birth, perinatal&#xD;
      mortality, risk of infertility, incontinence and disfigurement, as well as reduced cost and&#xD;
      inconvenience for an otherwise economically productive young subject population.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analysis for efficacy will be a comparison between subjects treated with and without the PEK fusion protein with respect to the percentage who present regression of HSIL at Day 270. Separate comparisons within each cohort will be performed using Fisher's exact test (or an appropriate analogue). No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be employed in these analyses. Additionally, a corresponding comparison across all study subjects combined will be performed, based on Cochran-Matel-Haenszel test stratified for cohort.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of cutaneous toxicities (i.e., size, induration and time to resolution of skin reactions to vaccine).</measure>
    <time_frame>DAY 270</time_frame>
    <description>Summaries of the data pertaining to the primary safety outcome of skin toxicity will be provided. Summaries will be provided for the within-cohort subsets of subjects treated with the active, and with the adjuvant alone; and the combined subsets across all three cohorts of subject treated with the active, with the adjuvant alone, and with the placebo. Serious adverse events will be described in narrative with the participant's demographics, treatment date, event, onset date, relationship to the study treatment and the descriptions of the actions and outcomes during this event. Any deaths occurring in the study will be summarized in narrative with the demographics, treatment duration, cause of death, date of death and additional information surrounding that serious adverse event.</description>
