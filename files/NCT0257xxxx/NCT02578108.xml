  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic painful knee OA is a major cause of disability in older adults. In patients whose&#xD;
      symptoms are refractory to conservative management but who do not wish to undergo TKA or,&#xD;
      alternatively, are not operative candidates, genicular nerve RFA represents a promising&#xD;
      treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will determine if patients with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis experience&#xD;
      meaningful and long-term improvement in pain, function, and analgesic use, as well as&#xD;
      prevention of TKA after RFA of the genicular nerves. Investigators will also determine&#xD;
      whether zero versus one set of diagnostic genicular nerve blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering these questions will help determine if genicular nerve RFA is indeed a worthwhile&#xD;
      treatment for chronic painful knee OA. Additionally, this will help determine the optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic protocol for patient selection for this procedure, which has implications for&#xD;
      improving treatment success rates, preventing unnecessary procedures, and decreasing&#xD;
      healthcare cost savings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common conditions and causes of disability in&#xD;
      older adults, with an estimated prevalence of symptoms in 20-30% of individuals over 65 years&#xD;
      of age. Pain associated with knee OA may have a central nervous system component, but&#xD;
      intra-articular chemical pain mediators such as Substance P and Calcitonin-gene related&#xD;
      peptide, possible intra-articular ischemic pain due to vasospasm, mechanical compression or&#xD;
      irritation of the richly innervated subchondral bone, periosteum, synovium, and joint&#xD;
      capsule, as well as peripheral genicular nerve sensitization have largely been implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee OA, in general, is treated conservatively with weight loss (when indicated), physical&#xD;
      therapy, oral analgesic medications, and intra-articular corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      injections. If this approach fails to provide adequate pain relief and functional&#xD;
      restoration, patients may be offered total knee arthroplasty (TKA), if they are surgical&#xD;
      candidates. While, TKA is generally a safe procedure, like any major open surgery, it is&#xD;
      associated with a risk of serious complications; a large cohort study of 83,756 patients&#xD;
      demonstrated the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (0.6%), myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (0.5%), stroke (0.5%), and a 90 day mortality (0.7%) to all be significantly higher than the&#xD;
      general population. Furthermore, some patients are not candidates for TKA due to&#xD;
      co-morbidities such as morbid obesity or cardiopulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for knee joint denervation represents a promising intervention&#xD;
      for patients with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis who have failed conservative management&#xD;
      and are either not willing or not eligible for TKA. During RFA a thermal lesion is created by&#xD;
      applying radiofrequency energy through an electrode placed at a target structure. RFA has&#xD;
      been used to disrupt sensory afferent nociceptive nerve fibers supplying the zygapophyseal&#xD;
      (facet) joints of the spine as well as the sacroiliac joint with excellent pain reduction and&#xD;
      functional improvement when performed appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are only two published studies that have investigated knee joint denervation&#xD;
      by RFA for the treatment of chronic painful OA. In a randomized prospective study (n=35),&#xD;
      Choi et al. found that genicular nerve RFA resulted in clinically meaningful pain improvement&#xD;
      in approximately 60% of patients at 6 month follow-up. Improvement in function was also&#xD;
      observed. Bellini and Barbieri report a series of 3 patients with chronic painful knee OA,&#xD;
      two of whom who experienced meaningful pain and functional improvement after genicular nerve&#xD;
      RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no evidence-based algorithm established which provides a means of properly selecting&#xD;
      which patients would benefit from genicular nerve RFA. In the study performed by Choi et al.,&#xD;
      only one set of diagnostic genicular nerve blocks with a threshold of 50% pain relief to be&#xD;
      considered a &quot;positive response&quot; was used. In contrast, a well developed literature regarding&#xD;
      selection of patients for medial branch RFA for facet-mediated pain indicates that two sets&#xD;
      of diagnostic medial branch nerve blocks with a threshold of &gt;80% pain reduction to be&#xD;
      considered a &quot;positive response&quot; increased positive predictive value for both meaningful pain&#xD;
      and functional outcomes to 80-90%. While the diagnosis of facet-mediated pain can be&#xD;
      challenging given the variety of potential pain generators in the spine, diagnostic&#xD;
      uncertainly is far less likely when evaluating the knee as a pain generator. In fact, it is&#xD;
      unclear that any diagnostic blocks of the genicular nerves are needed given that this&#xD;
      increase the potential for complications and healthcare costs compared to proceeding directly&#xD;
      to the ablation procedure. It is vital that evidence-based selection criteria are developed&#xD;
      for genicular nerve RFA in order to optimize clinical outcomes and minimize healthcare costs.&#xD;
