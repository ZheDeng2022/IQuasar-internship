    <textblock>
      African American men infected with HIV are living longer and are acquiring the same chronic&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases affecting the general population of African American men age 40&#xD;
      years and older. African American men have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon&#xD;
      cancer, but HIV is associated with an increased risk for co-morbidity from these conditions,&#xD;
      a risk heightened by not only HIV infection itself, but also its treatment with&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). The risk for many of these chronic diseases is tied to&#xD;
      behavior: risk is increased by physical inactivity and unhealthful diet. Although the high&#xD;
      risk for behavior-linked chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized,&#xD;
      there is a lack of evidence-based interventions specifically tailored to their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the broad objective of this research is to identify strategies to empower HIV positive&#xD;
      African American men to engage in behaviors that reduce their risk of chronic diseases. This&#xD;
      research will test the efficacy of a theory-based, contextually appropriate health promotion&#xD;
      intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked to risk of chronic diseases&#xD;
      among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and will identify the&#xD;
      theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are&#xD;
      receiving ART for HIV will be randomized to the Men Together Making a Difference Health&#xD;
      Promotion Intervention, which consists of three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions, or the&#xD;
      1 session Health Awareness Control Group. The Men Together Making a Difference Health&#xD;
      Promotion Intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach&#xD;
      integrated with formative research. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately post, and&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months post intervention. The trial will test whether the Men Making a Difference&#xD;
      Health Promotion Intervention increases self-reported physical activity compared with the&#xD;
      Health Awareness Control Group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans are heavily burdened with preventable and treatable diseases, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted&#xD;
      diseases (STDs), and cancers. African Americans have the highest age-adjusted death rates for&#xD;
      heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS compared with other Americans. The broad&#xD;
      objective of this research is to identify strategies to empower African American men to&#xD;
      engage in healthful behaviors in an effort to help eliminate health disparities.&#xD;
      Specifically, this research addresses the urgent need for health promotion interventions&#xD;
      targeting African American men who are living with HIV. Despite the high risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and other behavior-linked diseases, including diabetes and certain&#xD;
      cancers, no studies have developed and tested interventions to encourage behaviors to reduce&#xD;
      risk of chronic disease in African American HIV positive men, a sub-group comprising the&#xD;
      largest segment of people living with HIV in the US. Moreover, irrespective of race and sex,&#xD;
      few studies have tested interventions to increase behaviors to reduce risk of chronic&#xD;
      diseases in people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2005 through 2007, the estimated number of persons living with HIV rose steadily in the&#xD;
      37 states with confidential name-based HIV infection reporting. At the end of 2007, an&#xD;
      estimated 580,371 persons in these states were living with HIV infection, including 48% who&#xD;
      were African-American and 73% who were men. In 2008, African Americans accounted for 52% of&#xD;
      all new diagnoses of HIV infection in the 37 states with confidential name-based reporting.&#xD;
      The estimated rate of diagnoses of HIV was higher in African American men (132 per 100,000)&#xD;
      than in White men (17 per 100,000), Hispanic men (52 per 100,000), and African American women&#xD;
      (56 per 100,000). In Philadelphia, where this study will be conducted, two-thirds of the&#xD;
      people living with HIV/AIDS were African American in 2008, two-thirds were male, and one-half&#xD;
      were age 45 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been available, there has been durable suppression of&#xD;
      HIV replication, prevention of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and malignancies, and&#xD;
      higher survival and life expectancy rates in people living with HIV. In the US, 67% of people&#xD;
      living with HIV in 2007 were age 40 or older. Because of the aging of the HIV positive&#xD;
      population, several chronic non-HIV-related conditions are becoming increasingly important in&#xD;
      the clinical treatment of HIV. Several reviews have drawn attention to the prevention and&#xD;
      control of chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular, liver, and&#xD;
      kidney diseases, affecting people living with HIV. Mounting evidence suggests that both HIV&#xD;
      disease and its treatment with ART can accelerate the risks for chronic diseases associated&#xD;
      with aging, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Studies indicate that&#xD;
      as HIV-infected patients live longer, they increasing experience mortality from causes not&#xD;
      directly attributable to HIV. For instance, among people with HIV, the proportion of deaths&#xD;
      not directly attributable to HIV increases with age from 36% among 30-year olds to 53% among&#xD;
      40-year olds and 72% among 50-year olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quite apart from HIV infection, African Americans have higher mortality rates for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes than do Whites. Some evidence&#xD;
      also suggests that rates of hypertension and kidney disease are higher among HIV-infected&#xD;
      African Americans than among HIV-infected Whites. Indeed, in a cohort study, the incidence of&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease in people without HIV or diabetes was 2.3 times higher among African&#xD;
      Americans than Whites, in those with diabetes but no HIV it was 2.3 times higher among&#xD;
      African Americans than Whites, whereas in those with HIV but no diabetes, it was 8.1 times&#xD;
      higher among African Americans compared with Whites. African Americans also have the highest&#xD;
      mortality rates and the shortest survival rates for most cancers of any racial/ethnic group&#xD;
      in the US. The death rate from colon cancer, the third most common cancer among African&#xD;
      Americans, has decreased over the past 15 years, but incidence and mortality rates are still&#xD;
      disproportionately high among African Americans, particularly men. The colon cancer incidence&#xD;
      in African American men was 1.21 times higher than in White men and 1.31 times higher than in&#xD;
      African American women, and the mortality rate in African American men was 1.44 times higher&#xD;
      than in White men and 1.42 times higher than in African American women. The poor survival&#xD;
      rates for colon cancers in African American men are linked to later stage at diagnosis and&#xD;
      less access to appropriate and timely treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that regular physical activity or physical fitness is associated with&#xD;
      reduced risk of early mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and colon cancer.&#xD;
      Consuming fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      certain cancers, but only 35% of African Americans report consuming fruit the recommended 2&#xD;
      or more times per day and only 24% report consuming vegetables the recommended 3 or more&#xD;
      times per day. These findings underscore the need for interventions to encourage physical&#xD;
      activity and fruit and vegetable consumption among African Americans. Screening is important&#xD;
      to detect diseases in the early stages, but African Americans are less likely than Whites to&#xD;
      report being screened for colon cancer. Reinhold et al. found that, despite significantly&#xD;
      more visits with their primary care provider, HIV-infected patients age 50 years or older&#xD;
      were less likely to have ever been screened for colon cancer than age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      HIV-negative controls, and Bini et al. reported that HIV-infected individuals have a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of colonic neoplasms and develop advanced neoplasms at a younger age than do&#xD;
      uninfected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined health behaviors among HIV positive individuals, and fewer still&#xD;
      have tested the efficacy of interventions that target behaviors linked to chronic diseases.&#xD;
      This research will address this gap in the literature. It will test whether a health&#xD;
      promotion intervention increases physical activity and other healthful behaviors compared&#xD;
      with a health-awareness control group. The participants will be HIV positive African American&#xD;
      men age 40 years and older who are ART patients. Participants will be recruited through the&#xD;
      Clinical Registry of the Penn Center for AIDS Research, AIDS clinics and service&#xD;
      organizations, HIV care providers, advertisements in a local newspaper, and word of mouth&#xD;
      from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design. Computer-generated random number&#xD;
      sequences will be used to randomly assign the men to the Men Together Making a Difference&#xD;
      Health Promotion Intervention or the Health Awareness Control Intervention. The theoretical&#xD;
      basis of the Men Together Making a Difference Health Promotion Intervention is social&#xD;
      cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach. The intervention will seek to increase&#xD;
      self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, behavioral skills, and risk-reduction knowledge for&#xD;
      behaviors linked to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer, including&#xD;
      physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, fat consumption, and colon-cancer&#xD;
      screening. The intervention will help men assess their health behavior, identify personal&#xD;
      barriers to engaging in the behaviors, develop strategies for surmounting those barriers, and&#xD;
      gain support for behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete assessments before the intervention, immediately post and 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months post-intervention. Self-report measures will be collected using audio&#xD;
      computer-assisted self-interviewing. The primary outcome is a binary variable indicating&#xD;
      whether the participant met the 2008 Department of Health and Human Services physical&#xD;
      activity guideline of engaging in muscle-strengthening activity on 2 days and engaging in&#xD;
      either 20 min of vigorous-intensity activity on at least 4 days or 30 min of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity activity on at least 5 days in the previous 7 days. The study tests&#xD;
      whether the Men Together Making a Difference Health Promotion Intervention increases&#xD;
      adherence to physical activities guidelines during the post-intervention period compared with&#xD;
      the Health Awareness Intervention control group and whether social cognitive theory and&#xD;
      reasoned action approach variables mediate the effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was used to calculate the sample size needed to detect a clinically&#xD;
      significant difference in adherence to physical activity guidelines of 9.1 percent, a&#xD;
      relative increase of 58.0%. Based on the sample of HIV positive men age 40 or older in&#xD;
      Project Eban, estimated correlation among physical activity guideline adherence rates at 3-,&#xD;
      6-month, and 12-month follow-up is intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.314. Assuming a 2-tailed&#xD;
      test, alpha = 0.05, ICC = 0.314, 20% attrition, and a 9.1% increase in physical activity&#xD;
      guideline adherence from 15.7% in the control group to 24.8% in the health promotion&#xD;
      intervention group, a total N of 384 men enrolled will yield statistical power of 0.82.&#xD;
