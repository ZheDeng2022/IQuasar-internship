  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the ACOSOG Z9001trial, imatinib received market authorization in Europe for&#xD;
      patients with GIST at significant risk of relapse in the adjuvant setting, according to the&#xD;
      classifications of Miettinen and Joensuu. Thereafter, the SSG XVIII / AI trial proved the&#xD;
      need to revise the recommendations of the European Society for Medical Oncology regarding the&#xD;
      optimal duration of treatment, which is currently three years. Patients at low risk of&#xD;
      recurrence should not receive adjuvant treatment with imatinib and recommendations cannot be&#xD;
      made from the literature data as to the indication of adjuvant treatment for patients with an&#xD;
      intermediate risk of relapse. The provision of prognostic molecular markers in this group of&#xD;
      so-called intermediate-risk subjects would facilitate the identification of responders to&#xD;
      imatinib and avoid overtreating some patients and undertreating others who would benefit from&#xD;
      Imatinib. Recently, Lagarde et al. have shown that the Genomic Index (GI = A ² / C, where A&#xD;
      is the total number of alterations gains or losses and C is the number of chromosomes&#xD;
      involved in these alterations in Comparative Genomic Hybridization array(CGH array)) could&#xD;
      have prognostic value in GIST, particularly in intermediate risk GISTs. More recent work by&#xD;
      the same author in 100 cases of GISTs with intermediate prognosis according to the&#xD;
      classification of Miettinem identified two prognostic groups based on GI. The rate of&#xD;
      metastatic relapse at 2 years was 30.6% in the group with GI greater than 10 versus 5.4% in&#xD;
      the group with GI less than 10 (manuscript under preparation). Thus, it is legitimate to set&#xD;
      up a randomized trial to study the effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with imatinib in the&#xD;
      GIST population at intermediate risk of relapse and with a high GI. This study is a&#xD;
      prospective randomized clinical trial: a phase III, open-label, 2 parallel groups,&#xD;
      multicenter study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of adjuvant&#xD;
      Imatinib on rate of metastatic relapse at 2 years in patients with intermediate-risk&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting a high Genomic Grade Index. The second objectives&#xD;
      of this study are to compare the two therapeutic approaches in terms of metastasis-free&#xD;
      survival at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, overall survival, clinical and biological tolerance,&#xD;
      safety and Quality of life of patients and caregivers. The eligible subjects must meet all of&#xD;
      the following criteria : subject with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, intermediary risk&#xD;
      from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology classification [Miettenen 2006], subject with&#xD;
      Genomic Grade Index higher than 10 determined by CGH array, subject with surgery for primary&#xD;
      tumor performed from 2 weeks to 2 months before starting adjuvant Imatinib mesylate, subject&#xD;
      with no evidence of residual macroscopic disease after surgery and with a medical decision to&#xD;
      prescribe imatinib. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled :&#xD;
      subject who have experienced spontaneous tumor rupture before surgery, subject whose tumor&#xD;
      has a PDGFRA D842V mutation evidenced by sequencing from tumor Block and subject whose&#xD;
      mutational status meets the wild phenotype definition as evidenced by sequencing from tumor&#xD;
      Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Standard Group will receive adjuvant imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day for a period of&#xD;
      3 years. Patients will be assessed for metastases every three months for three years with&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal and pelvic CT scan. The Experimental Group will receive the same&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal and pelvic CT scan. The estimated proportion of subjects relapsing at 2&#xD;
      years will be 30% in the experimental group and 2.5% in the standard group: alpha risk, 5%,&#xD;
      power 80%. A total of 80 subjects (40 in each arm) will be included. This is a trial&#xD;
      combining two learned societies that already are taking part in many clinical trials in&#xD;
      France (French Sarcoma Group and French Digestive Cancer Federation). The expected benefits&#xD;
      for patients are : not treat subjects for whom this treatment would offer too little benefit&#xD;
      weighed against the disadvantages and treat subjects in whom this treatment would provide a&#xD;
      real benefit and reduce the cost of treatment in patients who would not benefit from being&#xD;
      treated by imatinib. The originality of this study is that it will include molecular data in&#xD;
      the therapeutic decision and demonstrate the concept of individualized treatment in this&#xD;
      patient population. This could ultimately change the current recommendations.&#xD;
