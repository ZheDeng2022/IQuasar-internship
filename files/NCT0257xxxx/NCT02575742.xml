  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason chronic constipation (CC) becomes commoner with age is not fully understood. New&#xD;
      studies suggest that bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre and gut bacteria are important&#xD;
      and may differ in older people. Since CC reduces quality of life and is a major reason why&#xD;
      elderly are admitted to hospitals and residential care, there is a need to understand how&#xD;
      these factors change with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, placing a pressure sensing catheter inside the large intestine (pancolonic&#xD;
      manometry) is the gold standard way to measure how well it contracts. However this involves a&#xD;
      camera test (colonoscopy) which is invasive with risks of bowel perforations (~80/100,000).&#xD;
      The risk is higher with age (64-80yr: ~90/100,000; 80+yrs: ~120/100,000), making it unethical&#xD;
      for elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technique called the 3D-Transit System has been developed, involving a small ingestible&#xD;
      capsule, containing a 'trackable' electromagnet. By tracking movements of the capsule&#xD;
      swallowed by participants, it provides precise detailed information on the capsule&#xD;
      progression inside the whole gut and large bowel's contractile activity in real-time. It is&#xD;
      minimally-invasive and radiation-free, making it possible to assess elderly for the first&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess how bowel contraction patterns, dietary fibre intake and gut&#xD;
      bacteria differ between young and older adults (with and without CC), to better understand&#xD;
      why CC is more common in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a pilot, 4 arm, single centre, observational study involving 60 women aged 18-40 years&#xD;
      and 70-90 years (15 non-constipated and 15 with CC for each age group). The study lasts 3&#xD;
      weeks, containing 2 weeks of run-in period and 1 week of study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four groups participants will be asked to: swallow 2 capsules to assess their large&#xD;
      bowel's contractile function using the 3D-transit system; provide stool samples to analyses&#xD;
      their gut bacteria; and complete questionnaires to assess their gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
