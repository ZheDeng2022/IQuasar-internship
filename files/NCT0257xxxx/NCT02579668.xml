  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United Kingdom, the language of the Deaf community is British Sign Language (BSL). A&#xD;
      small proportion of Deaf young people who use BSL as their first or dominant language have&#xD;
      specific language difficulties and would benefit from language therapy provided in sign&#xD;
      language by adults who are fluent in BSL and may be Deaf. Some Deaf adults are currently&#xD;
      employed in education and health services to support children's BSL development. However&#xD;
      there is little training or information available to these adults about language assessment,&#xD;
      diagnosis of language difficulties or intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have highlighted language difficulties and therapy in sign as an issues and&#xD;
      begun to explore Deaf adults understanding of language difficulties and disorder. This&#xD;
      project aims to extend knowledge in this area by supporting Deaf practitioners to understand&#xD;
      and develop language therapy skills and co-develop language therapy intervention resources.&#xD;
      The study will pilot training for practitioners and language therapy interventions for young&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be in three phases. The design has been discussed at regular Language Working&#xD;
      Group Meetings with Deaf practitioner colleagues who may want to volunteer to be involved in&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, information will be sought from Deaf practitioners in focus groups and from&#xD;
      questionnaires about the strategies and resources they currently employ when working with&#xD;
      Deaf young people with language difficulties. This information will be compared to evidence&#xD;
      based models of therapy for spoken English to see whether similar themes emerge. The findings&#xD;
      will also be used to identify themes for other strategies and resources Deaf practitioners&#xD;
      use which are not present in spoken English language therapy. The data gathered will be&#xD;
      included in planning the next phase of the project. Scenarios and questions similar to those&#xD;
      planned for the focus group and questionnaire have been trialed at Service training days and&#xD;
      feedback has been gathered from staff involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will involve working with Deaf practitioners to develop and define strategies and&#xD;
      resources for language therapy in BSL. These will be with a small group of three or four Deaf&#xD;
      practitioners. Dynamic assessment and mediated learning principles will be used to identify&#xD;
      key skills and resources for Deaf practitioners in providing language therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process, including pre and post involvement questionnaires, will use video observation&#xD;
      and reflective practise tools. Analysis of a language therapy intervention session by a Deaf&#xD;
      practitioner will provide a snapshot or 'assessment' of their initial skills and knowledge.&#xD;
      Then, over a period of six sessions, videos of the Deaf practitioner working with a young&#xD;
      person on language activities will be jointly analysed and reflected upon to identify&#xD;
      strategies and resources that are or would be useful in this working context. This joint&#xD;
      analysis between the researcher, a qualified Speech and Language Therapist, and the Deaf&#xD;
      practitioner will provided teaching, learning and reflection opportunities. Finally the video&#xD;
      analysis by the Deaf practitioner, without reflection with the researcher, will be repeated&#xD;
      to give a second 'assessment' of the Deaf practitioner's skills and knowledge. The Deaf&#xD;
      practitioner will be asked to give feedback on this process, identifying helpful strategies&#xD;
      discussed, issues with the process and information they feel would be useful to other Deaf&#xD;
      practitioners completing similar work with young people. Deaf practitioners will work with&#xD;
      deaf young people who are currently on their clinical caseload and have previously been&#xD;
      identified as having language difficulties. These young people and their families will be&#xD;
      informed about the project and, if they consent to participate, will participate in the six&#xD;
      sessions led by the Deaf practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information gained from this process will identify useful strategies and resources.&#xD;
      Validation will be sought by comparing evidence based language therapy strategies and&#xD;
      resources from spoken English with those identified by Deaf practitioners in Phase 1 and&#xD;
      those found to be useful by Deaf practitioners in Phase 2. These will be used to develop a&#xD;
      training package containing strategies, resources and guiding principles for Deaf&#xD;
      practitioners using BSL for language therapy delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 3, single case studies will be undertaken. These will include training other Deaf&#xD;
      practitioners to use strategies and resources with Deaf young people. Qualitative information&#xD;
      from Deaf practitioners and young people, as well as quantitative information from pre and&#xD;
      post intervention language assessments and sample video clips, will be analysed to ascertain&#xD;
      whether the training in strategies and resources enables Deaf practitioners to use identified&#xD;
      intervention strategies and develop the language skills of Deaf young people. The qualitative&#xD;
      data will be gathered through the use of reflective logs and questionnaires. The quantitative&#xD;
      data will be gathered through the use of structured language assessment activities. Young&#xD;
      people and their parents will also provide qualitative information about the process through&#xD;
      questionnaires or interviews, depending on their communication mode (English, another spoken&#xD;
      language or BSL) and their preference.&#xD;
