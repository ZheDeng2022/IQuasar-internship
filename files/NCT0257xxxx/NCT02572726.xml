  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neurophysiological tool for studying cortical&#xD;
      functions, and in addition, has an analgesic therapeutic effect whose underlying mechanism is&#xD;
      unknown. The proposed research will use TMS in conjunction with brain imaging and&#xD;
      electrophysiology to examine cortical plasticity and connectivity modifications induced by&#xD;
      repetitive TMS (rTMS) targeted to affect cortical regions associated with endogenous&#xD;
      analgesia (EA). This will be carried out in both healthy and chronic pain (fibromyalgia)&#xD;
      states. rTMS analgesic intervention, targeted to the motor cortex (M1) will be preceded and&#xD;
      followed by structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and Diffusion Tensor&#xD;
      Imaging (DTI). This will be done in order to examine alterations of cortical and brainstem&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in EA and to investigate connectivity changes between cortical and&#xD;
      sub-cortical regions of the EA networks. The latter as well as EA efficiency and pain-related&#xD;
      personality variables will be used to assess individual differences in neuroplasticity within&#xD;
      the EA systems in both healthy subjects and chronic pain patients.&#xD;
