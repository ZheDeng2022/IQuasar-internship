  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) or relapsed or refractory Richter Syndrome (rrRS) will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL and rrRS&#xD;
      will be evaluated. The primary study hypothesis is that intravenous (IV) administration of&#xD;
      single agent pembrolizumab to the rrPMBCL cohort will result in an Objective Response Rate&#xD;
      (ORR) of greater than 15% using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria&#xD;
      (Cheson, 2007) by independent central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective with Protocol Amendment 04, enrollment into the rrRS cohort was closed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for a maximum of 35 administrations (approximately&#xD;
      2 years) or until documented disease progression by investigator assessment, unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse event(s) (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of&#xD;
      treatment, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with&#xD;
      study treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 27 months (Database Cutoff: 28MAY2019)</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR was assessed by independent central review utilizing the International Working Group [IWG] response assessment criteria per Cheson 2007 of pembrolizumab in participants with rrPMBCL. For participants with rrRS, IWG criteria with special considerations for RS was used for progression. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a response (complete response, CR or partial response, PR) prior to disease progression. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. In the rrPMBCL cohort, an exact binomial test was conducted versus a fixed historical control rate. For the rrPMBCL cohort, the ORR was estimated as well as a 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method whereas the rrRS cohort was estimated with a 90% 2-sided CI.</description>

PD is the appearance any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved site from nadir. The analysis consisted of Kaplan-Meier estimates. DOR data was censored on the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of PD for participants who did not have tumor progression and were still on study at the time of an analysis, were given antitumor treatment other than the study treatment, or were removed from study prior to documentation of tumor progression.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Assessment Criteria Per Independent Central Review</title>
        <description>The ORR was assessed by independent central review utilizing the International Working Group [IWG] response assessment criteria per Cheson 2007 of pembrolizumab in participants with rrPMBCL. For participants with rrRS, IWG criteria with special considerations for RS was used for progression. The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a response (complete response, CR or partial response, PR) prior to disease progression. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. In the rrPMBCL cohort, an exact binomial test was conducted versus a fixed historical control rate. For the rrPMBCL cohort, the ORR was estimated as well as a 95% 2-sided exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method whereas the rrRS cohort was estimated with a 90% 2-sided CI.</description>

          <description>The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have achieved a CR, PR or SD response prior to PD. CR is the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is the regression of measurable disease and no new sites. SD is the failure to attain CR/PR or PD. PD is the appearance any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved site from nadir. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders.</description>
