  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients are often hypothermic (temperature &lt; 35 °C) upon arrival at the hospital.&#xD;
      Hypothermia is with hypotension and hypoxia, perfectly known to be directly responsible for&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothermia is responsible, with acidosis and coagulopathy, of the &quot; lethal triad&quot; of trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is clearly established that hypothermia is directly associated with poor prognostic&#xD;
      in trauma patients. In a recent study, mortality rate reached 100% for trauma patients&#xD;
      arriving at the hospital with a body temperature below 32°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weather, the severity of the trauma and medical (or paramedical) interventions are&#xD;
      responsible for the onset of this hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, continuous monitoring of the patient's temperature, active protection against&#xD;
      hypothermia with a metal blanket, the warming (and measure the temperature of) infusion&#xD;
      fluids, the warming (and measure the temperature of) the ambulance should improve patient's&#xD;
      outcome. As hypothermia is associated with mortality of trauma patients, the control must&#xD;
      lead to reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Due to the use of a global management strategy with combination of several&#xD;
      specific interventions and the need for special equipment (heating devices infusion fluids),&#xD;
      randomization will be done by investigator center: interventional center (combining the&#xD;
      different interventions) and standard management (without modification, except measurements&#xD;
      of the patient's and air temperature at inclusion and on arrival at a receiving center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is also crucial that the weather conditions, the characteristics of&#xD;
      trauma and patients were similar in both groups. Also, 12 investigation centers will be&#xD;
      classified based on annual local average temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main collected data Demographics and morphological traits (age, sex, body weight, and height&#xD;
      of the victim), the nature and circumstances of the accident (date, time, place), the&#xD;
      victim's presentation on mobile intensive care unit (MICU) arrival (trapped or not, seated or&#xD;
      lying down, on the ground, unclothed, wet, or covered by a blanket, environmental conditions,&#xD;
      clinical factors, and care provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental conditions included air (indoors or outdoors) temperature, and rain at the site&#xD;
      of the accident as well as mobile intensive care unit temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical factors included: the site and nature of the lesions (fracture, wound, contusion),&#xD;
      heart rate, the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) + systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure + respiratory rate), oxygen saturation or oxygen delivery, and tympanic temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever applicable: vascular filling (infusion fluid temperature and volumes), catecholamine&#xD;
      and morphine administration, any other drugs (with doses), orotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Times from the accident to MICU arrival and from MICU arrival to hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Primary endpoint: rate of patients arriving at the hospital with a&#xD;
      temperature &lt;35°C. These data will be analyzed by model of multi-level logistic regression to&#xD;
      again consider the cluster design of the study. A secondary analysis will enter the model&#xD;
      known a priori factors that may affect hypothermia. The parameters corresponding to the&#xD;
      secondary objectives will be entered in a model of logistic regression multivariate thereby&#xD;
      specifically test their effect on the criteria studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Binary secondary endpoints will be analyzed by model of multi-level&#xD;
      logistic regression. Quantitative secondary endpoints will be analyzed by mixed model ANCOVA&#xD;
      introducing randomness in the center. The variables may be processed before analysis for&#xD;
      non-Gaussian distribution. In case of failure of the normalizing transformation, exact&#xD;
      procedure may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients to include The calculation of the sample size was based on our previous&#xD;
      study.* The incidence of hypothermia on arrival at the hospital was 14%. By selecting&#xD;
      high-risk patients, the investigators expect an incidence of about 20%. The objective is to&#xD;
      achieve a reduction of one third of hypothermia (i.e. from 20 to 13 %). Using a two-tailed&#xD;
      test at α risk of 0.05 and 1 - beta 0.8, the calculation of required number of patients is&#xD;
      440 per group. Assuming a moderate inflation factor of about 1.35 related to the cluster&#xD;
      randomization (our experience shows that intra-cluster correlation coefficients are low) the&#xD;
      total number of patients per group will be 600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of N = 1,200 patients for the study.&#xD;
