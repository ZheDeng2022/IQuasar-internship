  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Pilot study to evaluate the combination of Vigil™ and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Patients undergoing a&#xD;
      standard of care surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection) and meeting&#xD;
      procurement eligibility criteria may have tumor harvested for Vigil™ vaccine manufacture.&#xD;
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that vaccination with Vigil™ will induce cancer-specific&#xD;
      T cell immunity in these patients. Addition of pembrolizumab to Vigil™ treated patients will&#xD;
      further augment these immune changes on sequential biopsy when comparing post-Vigil™ but&#xD;
      pre-PD-1 inhibitor to post-PD-1 inhibitor biopsies, and the combination therapy will be&#xD;
      associated with reduction of tumor volume on clinical exam and/or imaging.&#xD;

      This is an open label Pilot study to evaluate the combination of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell&#xD;
      immunotherapy and pembrolizumab PD-1 inhibitor in patients with incurable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma. Patients undergoing a standard of care surgical procedure (e.g., tumor&#xD;
      biopsy, palliative resection) and meeting procurement eligibility criteria may have tumor&#xD;
      harvested for Vigil™ vaccine manufacture. Patients subsequently meeting study enrollment&#xD;
      criteria including manufacture of a minimum of 4 doses of Vigil™ and agreement to provide on&#xD;
      treatment tumor biopsies will receive (i) Vigil™ 1 x 10e7 cells intradermal on Days 1, 15,&#xD;
      29, 43 and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 9 total doses of Vigil™ and (ii) pembrolizumab&#xD;
      2 mg/kg IV starting on Day 43 and every 3 weeks thereafter for up to 6 months from study&#xD;
      enrollment. Day 1 of study treatment must be within 6 weeks of tumor procurement. Tumor&#xD;
      biopsy and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for correlative studies will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline (before tumor procurement), and at Week 7 and Week 16 while on study.&#xD;
      PBMCs will also be collected at Week 1 (pre-Vigil™) and end of treatment (EOT). Radiological&#xD;
      assessment of tumor by immune related Response Criteria (irRC) and RECIST criteria will be&#xD;
      obtained at screening (after tumor procurement) and at Week 13 and EOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to characterize and compare CD8+ T cell density, PD-1+ T cell&#xD;
      density, and PD-L1 expression on tumor biopsy at baseline, following 3 doses (approximately 6&#xD;
      weeks) of single agent Vigil™ and again following 3 doses of pembrolizumab. Secondary study&#xD;
      objectives include evaluation of tolerability and safety of the combination, and to determine&#xD;
      and compare IFNγ-ELISPOT result pre-procurement, at screening, after single agent Vigil™, and&#xD;
      after Vigil™ plus pembrolizumab combination. Additional study objectives include determining&#xD;
      best ORR by irRC criteria.&#xD;
