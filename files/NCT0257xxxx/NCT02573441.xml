      The study will examine whether school liaison services and home-based parental tutoring can&#xD;
      help with academic difficulties of paediatric brain tumour survivors who received cranial&#xD;
      spinal radiation and have returned to school. Forty-five patients will participate in the&#xD;
      project. All patients will receive psychology liaison services to link resources at the&#xD;
      hospital with those in the community. Patients will participate in one of two tutoring&#xD;
      programs designed to directly or indirectly improve math skills over 12 weeks. Weekly phone&#xD;
      calls will be used to support parents using the program. Patients will be tested before,&#xD;
      immediately after, and six months following each tutoring program to assess growth in&#xD;
      mathematics and working memory abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paediatric brain tumour survivors who receive cranial spinal radiation have learning&#xD;
      problems, particularly in mathematics and working memory. Working memory is often described&#xD;
      as a &quot;mental workspace&quot; where relevant information is held in mind and processed. Working&#xD;
      memory is important in mathematics for holding in mind relevant information and carrying out&#xD;
      steps necessary to solve problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine whether school liaison support and home-based parental tutoring can&#xD;
      help address the academic difficulties of paediatric brain tumour survivors who have received&#xD;
      cranial spinal radiation and who have returned to their community school. Forty five patients&#xD;
      will participate in the project. First, all patients will receive psychology liaison services&#xD;
      to link resources at the hospital with those in the community in order to provide information&#xD;
      regarding the effects of pediatric cancer on learning and facilitate the implementation of&#xD;
      appropriate assistive technology and remediation programs. Patients will then participant in&#xD;
      one of two tutoring programs over the course of a 12 week period. One group of patients will&#xD;
      participate in a program that addresses working memory with the intent of indirectly helping&#xD;
      with mathematics skills. This program will be delivered over the internet. Another group of&#xD;
      patients will participate in a program using a work book to directly help improve mathematics&#xD;
      skills. Weekly phone calls will be used to support parents in doing the program. Patients&#xD;
      will be tested before, immediately after, and six months following each tutoring program to&#xD;
      assess growth in mathematics and working memory abilities. The two intervention programs will&#xD;
      be compared to a waitlist control group that receives only the liaison service (including&#xD;
      academic support through weekly phone calls over the 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will provide evidence about the type of intervention that is&#xD;
      most effective at helping paediatric brain tumour survivors improve their mathematics skills&#xD;
      and working memory ability.&#xD;
