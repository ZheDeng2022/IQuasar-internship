  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity of&#xD;
      preoperative HBOT in patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenal resection for premalignant and&#xD;
      malignant tumors of the common bile duct, periampullary and duodenum.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with premalignant and malignant tumors of the common bile duct,&#xD;
      periampullary and duodenum will be screened for eligibility within 4 weeks of their scheduled&#xD;
      surgery. Initiation of therapy is defined as the first day of HBOT for patients receiving&#xD;
      HBOT therapy (Arm A) and the day of surgery for patients not receiving HBOT (Arm B). Patients&#xD;
      will be considered &quot;enrolled into study&quot; once the consent form has been signed, all screening&#xD;
      procedures have been undertaken and all the eligibility criteria are met. The fifty eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio the same day of the screening process. The&#xD;
      eligible subjects undergoing HBOT will be treated with up to 2.4 Atmospheres Absolute (ATA)&#xD;
      of oxygen (O2), for a maximum of 90 minutes each day with or without air breaks, as deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the investigator, for two days. Patients who are deemed ineligible will receive&#xD;
      the same standard of care without any exceptions. The start day of the week to commence HBOT&#xD;
      will be Monday through Wednesday, as the second and final day of HBOT treatment will be the&#xD;
      day in which the patient undergoes pancreaticoduodenectomy. The subjects who complete the&#xD;
      HBOT regimen must undergo subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy within five hours of termination&#xD;
      of HBOT. If there is more than a five hour delay from completion of the HBOT to commencement&#xD;
      of operation, the subject will be considered &quot;off study treatment&quot;. However, &quot;off study&#xD;
      treatment&quot; patients will continue to be followed up every six months for the first thirty&#xD;
      months, and annually thereafter. During the postoperative period, clinical data and&#xD;
      questionnaire forms will be collected on day 1, day 3, day 5, and one month (± 2 weeks)&#xD;
      during the first year. As for secondary objectives, the investigators will collect clinical&#xD;
      data from patients during their follow up visits in the office, by contacting them on the&#xD;
      phone, or by mailing them the protocol specific questionnaires every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients diagnosed via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration&#xD;
             (FNA) or CT-guided biopsy with periampullary adenocarcinoma, duodenal cancer,&#xD;
             premalignant lesions of the pancreas (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia,&#xD;
             intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) and cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor)&#xD;
             undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more comorbidities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetes Mellitus Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Cardiac Disease: history of angina,&#xD;
        myocardial infarction, previous percutaneous cardiac intervention, or cardiac surgery,&#xD;
        dysrhythmia Peripheral Vascular Disease: history of revascularization or amputation, rest&#xD;
        pain, or gangrene Neurological Disease: history of stroke with or without residual deficit,&#xD;
        seizure disorder, transient ischemic attack, hemiplegia, paraplegia, or impaired sensorium&#xD;
        Dyspnea Bleeding Disorder Metabolic Disease (e.g. BMI ≥ 35) Renal Insufficiency Hepatic&#xD;
        Insufficiency Another comorbidity that in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient&#xD;
        compromised&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nutritionally depleted. Albumin level ≤ 3.5 grams/deciliter (g/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500 / (microliter) mcL Platelets &gt;100,000 / mcL Total&#xD;
        bilirubin &lt;2.5 time upper limits of normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine&#xD;
        transaminase (ALT) &lt;2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal&#xD;
        institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/ per Cockcroft-Gault equation for&#xD;
        patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of asthma. There is some evidence that the administration of some&#xD;
             bronchodilators may increase the incidence of gas embolism to the brain through&#xD;
             pulmonary vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital spherocytosis. Increased risk of massive hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High grade fever at time of screening (more than 38.5 degree Celsius tend to lower the&#xD;
             seizure threshold due to oxygen toxicity and may result in the delay of relatively&#xD;
             routine therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Optic neuritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper respiratory tract infection and viral infection (relative contra-indications due&#xD;
             to the difficulty such patients may have in clearing their ears and sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emphysema with carbon dioxide retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Viral infection. There are controversial clinical evidences whether the hyperbaric&#xD;
             oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be helpful in eliminating viral infections or otherwise&#xD;
             viral infections may be considerably worsened after HBOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cisplatin therapy (some evidence that this drug retards wound healing when combined&#xD;
             with HBOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disulphiram therapy. Evidence suggests that this drug blocks the production of&#xD;
             superoxide dismutase. This may severely affect the body's ability to neutralize oxygen&#xD;
             free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Doxorubicin therapy. This chemotherapeutic agent becomes increasingly toxic under&#xD;
             pressure. Animal studies suggest at least a one-week break between last dose and first&#xD;
             treatment of HBOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia. Some degree of confinement anxiety has been reported.&#xD;
