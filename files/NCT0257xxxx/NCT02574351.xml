      To study whether the immune response as directed by regulatory T cells is different between&#xD;
      obese asthmatics, normal weight asthmatics and healthy controls.&#xD;

      The investigators hypothesize that the increase in asthma severity in obese patients is, at&#xD;
      least in part, related to a defective number or function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). That&#xD;
      is in the obese asthmatic subject a defective Treg profile would augment the inflammation of&#xD;
      asthma (a synergistic effect). Alternatively, that Treg dysfunction in obesity might affect&#xD;
      asthma independently (an additive effect). To test these hypotheses, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to conduct an observational controlled study to compare Treg profile in obese and&#xD;
      normal-weight individuals with and without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study to investigate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether Treg number and function differs between obese and normal-weight&#xD;
           individuals with and without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether serum leptin levels differ between obese and normal-weight&#xD;
           individuals with and without asthma.&#xD;
