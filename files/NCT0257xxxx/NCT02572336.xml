  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the experimental drug &quot;THR-18&quot; given together with the drug &quot;tissue&#xD;
      plasminogen activator&quot; for the treatment of stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is also&#xD;
      called &quot;tPA&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strokes often result from blockade of blood supply caused by blood clots forming within the&#xD;
      blood vessel feeding the brain. Such strokes are called &quot;Ischemic strokes&quot;. Treatment of&#xD;
      these strokes is aimed at breaking up the blood clot(s) and renewing the blood flow before&#xD;
      further parts of the brain die. Breaking up the blood clot is possible with the drug tPA when&#xD;
      it is injected into a vein shortly after the stroke starts. However, along with breaking up&#xD;
      the blood clot, tPA sometimes causes adverse effects, for example, it may cause bleeding.&#xD;
      THR-18, the drug tested in this study, is meant to reduce tPA's adverse effects without&#xD;
      stopping tPA's breaking up of the blocking blood clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to evaluate the safety of THR-18 in acute ischemic stroke patients&#xD;
      who are treated in parallel with tPA, to measure tPA's effect on blood clot dissolution when&#xD;
      this drug is given with and without THR-18, and to study the effects THR-18 may have on&#xD;
      signals of brain damage as seen on brain computerized tomography (a type of brain x-ray)&#xD;
      after treatment with tPA with and without THR-18. Patients will also be evaluated for their&#xD;
      ability to perform daily activities after the stroke following tPA treatment with and without&#xD;
      THR-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of THR-18 in this study will be done in comparison to placebo. Placebo is a&#xD;
      drug that looks exactly like THR-18 but has no activity. One dose of THR-18 will be tested,&#xD;
      in 20 patients. In parallel, 20 other patients will receive placebo. In total, 40 patients&#xD;
      are planned to participate in this study. The decision whether a patient will receive THR-18&#xD;
      or placebo will be based on chance (this procedure is called &quot;randomization&quot;). This clinical&#xD;
      study will be conducted only at one hospital, in the Republic of Moldova. The patients will&#xD;
      be in the hospital for at least 3 days after receiving the study treatment. Then, about 1&#xD;
      month later, they will be invited for a last follow-up visit.&#xD;
