      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies nicotine delivery from novel non-tobacco&#xD;
      electronic system (ENDS) in smokers. Studying the levels of nicotine delivered by various&#xD;
      types and brands of ENDS to the bloodstream, and comparing this to the levels delivered from&#xD;
      conventional cigarettes (the participant's own brand) may help provide information about the&#xD;
      use of nicotine-containing products that may help inform/reform current tobacco policy,&#xD;
      practice, and harm reduction approaches.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the levels of nicotine effectively delivered by various types and brands of ENDS&#xD;
      to the bloodstream and compare them to levels delivered from conventional cigarettes. (Study&#xD;
      1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the effect of flavorings added to nicotine solution on puffing topography and&#xD;
      nicotine delivery and, assess and compare short-term &quot;functional&quot; nicotine effects of the&#xD;
      different products by using subjective measures such as relief of craving and withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms. (Study 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the amounts of nicotine present in various brands and types of ENDS. (Study 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine nicotine yields in vapors from various types of ENDS under laboratory&#xD;
      conditions. (Study 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Develop a standardized testing protocol for ENDS that will reflect users' puffing behavior&#xD;
      and product characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Develop and validate the analytical method for analysis of nicotine content in the vapor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Propose a standardized puffing regimen for generating vapors for analytical purposes:&#xD;
      Such a testing protocol will reflect the puffing behavior observed among ENDS users and&#xD;
      should be specific to ENDS type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (Study 1): Participants are asked to smoke ad lib a single cigarette of their own brand&#xD;
      and provided with a different type of ENDS product at each visit (e-cigarette, disposable&#xD;
      e-cigarette, eGo, personal vaporizer, e-cigar, and e-pipe) over 3.5-4 hours at least 7 days&#xD;
      apart for 7 weeks. Participants are provided with cartridges of the same amounts of nicotine&#xD;
      with regular (tobacco) or menthol flavor according to smoker's preference, instructed on how&#xD;
      to use the product, asked to practice using it for 7 days, and return to the study center for&#xD;
      their next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (Study 2): Participants are asked to smoke ad lib a single cigarette of their own&#xD;
      brand and provided with the BLU e-cigarette ENDS product with nicotine solution of one of&#xD;
      five flavors over 3.5-4 hours at least 7 days apart for 6 weeks. Participants are provided&#xD;
      with cartridges of maximum available amounts of nicotine and different flavors at each visit,&#xD;
      instructed on how to use the product, asked to practice using it for 7 days, and return to&#xD;
      the study center for their next visit.&#xD;
