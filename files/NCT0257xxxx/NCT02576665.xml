  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate changes in immune activity relative to baseline&#xD;
      following treatment with Toca 511 and Toca FC in patients with solid tumors (including&#xD;
      recurrent high grade glioma [rHGG]) or lymphoma. This is a multicenter, open-label study of&#xD;
      Toca 511 and Toca FC. Patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, for whom curative&#xD;
      options are not available, will be enrolled into the study, subject to all entry criteria.&#xD;
      Tumors must be accessible to biopsy and/or resection. Patients will be qualified based on the&#xD;
      presence of specific molecular characteristics, documented by Foundation Medicine (or&#xD;
      equivalent) genomic profile report, and specific tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection followed by (1) intratumoral injection&#xD;
      following biopsy or (2) injection into the resection cavity wall following planned resection&#xD;
      in the case of rHGG or brain metastases. Toca FC will be administered orally in cycles of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not undergoing resection of brain tumors will undergo 2 biopsies to allow assessment&#xD;
      of baseline and follow-up immune activity in the tumor. Changes in immune activity in&#xD;
      peripheral blood will be measured in all patients.&#xD;
