  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine patient satisfaction and spectacle independence using a survey in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone uncomplicated cataract surgery with a presbyopia-correcting lens&#xD;
      at least 2 years prior to administration of the survey.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To compare patient-reported satisfaction with a multifocal vs an accommodating&#xD;
      presbyopia-correcting at least two years following implantation of either type of implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study subjects: 200 (half with multifocal and half with accommodating lens&#xD;
      implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will send a secure, online questionnaire to patients who have previously&#xD;
      undergone cataract surgery at least two years previously. Patients will receive an email&#xD;
      invitation, and by clicking the embedded link and verifying their identity with date of birth&#xD;
      and phone number, they will be directed to a survey. The survey will ask the following types&#xD;
      of questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall satisfaction with the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  would they do the same surgery again?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  would they choose the same (elective) lens implant again?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for what types of activities (reading newspaper, driving, driving at night, fine print)&#xD;
           do they require glasses to see clearly?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do they experience glare and halo symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how bothered is the patient by these symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be stored on a secure server. Statistical analysis will be done by a&#xD;
      statistician, using a student's t-test to determine statistical significance of any&#xD;
      difference between patients with different types of lens implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention will be planned with patients, other than analyzing the survey results. All&#xD;
      patient identifying (demographic) information will be carefully protected according to HIPAA&#xD;
      and HITECH standards.&#xD;
