  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) dose-escalation study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and&#xD;
      preliminary antitumor activity of DCC-2618, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase, and an&#xD;
      expansion phase. All active patients (from both dose-escalation and expansion phases) will&#xD;
      then transition into an extension phase.&#xD;
