      This project will assess the feasibility of treating advanced cancer using the immune system,&#xD;
      without any anti-cancer drug. In this pilot study, the investigators propose combining&#xD;
      low-dose radiotherapy, in lung cancer patients, with allogeneic immune cells obtained from a&#xD;
      donor. The patients will receive radiotherapy directed to one of the patient's tumors, as&#xD;
      well as an immunomodulatory drug called cyclophosphamide. Thereafter, they will receive the&#xD;
      infusion of donor immune cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic lung cancer remains incurable despite numerous studies and treatments tried,&#xD;
      including chemotherapy and, more recently, targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer can escape immune surveillance through different mechanisms: low levels of tumor&#xD;
      associated antigens (TAA), regulatory T cells, and immunosuppressive cytokines. Non-cytolytic&#xD;
      doses of radiation have been shown to reverse some of these pathways in experimental models.&#xD;
      It up-regulated the density of the MHC molecules presenting TAA and increased the T cell&#xD;
      infiltration of the tumor (1). Patients with lymphoma, liver or prostate cancer were treated&#xD;
      with radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, in the form of a TLR9 agonist, autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cells or a prostate-specific antigen vaccine (2, 3, 4). These trials have shown an&#xD;
      induction of T cell reactivity against TAA. Another form of immunotherapy, used for patients&#xD;
      with refractory hematologic malignancies is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) (5). Its success has relied on cell infusions from a donor,&#xD;
      demonstrating the immunologic control sustained by allogeneic cells (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach investigated in this study uses the immune cells from a donor to induce a tumor&#xD;
      destruction reaction. This will be amplified by the immunological effects of radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Many oncogenes are present in lung cancers and low-dose radiation increases their expression&#xD;
      on the surface of the tumor cell. In addition, radiation has the property to stimulate the&#xD;
      production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the irradiated site. Finally, the&#xD;
      donor's immune cells shall respond physiologically by migrating to the site of inflammation.&#xD;
      This will trigger an immune reaction directed against the abnormal cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 patients are expected to be recruited over the study period, estimated to be 3&#xD;
      years. The allogeneic cells will be obtained from one of two possible donor types. For&#xD;
      patients having a living donor, the immune cells will be harvested through a collection&#xD;
      procedure called apheresis. The living donor should be a sibling with 3/6 or less HLA&#xD;
      compatibility with the patient, at the A, B and DRB1 loci. For patients who do not have such&#xD;
      a living donor, allogeneic cells from a cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) unit will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment course will be the following: low-dose radiotherapy will be delivered to a&#xD;
      single tumor site, which could be either the primary tumor or one of its metastases. Low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide will be given to decrease regulatory T cell activity and increase anti-tumor&#xD;
      responses. Allogeneic immune cells will be administered thereafter, according to the&#xD;
      treatment arm the patient has been assigned.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation by follow-up clinic visits, including medical questionnaire, physical exam &amp; blood tests: complete blood count, electrolytes, renal &amp; liver function tests. AE will be graded using National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria version 3 (7). Evaluations will take place twice a week for the first 2 weeks, weekly for 2 weeks, every 2 weeks for 2 months &amp; every month for 3 months.
