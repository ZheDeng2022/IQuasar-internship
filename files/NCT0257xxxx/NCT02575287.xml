    <textblock>
      White light endoscopy remains the gold standard technique to evaluate gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is defined as presence of reflux symptoms (heartburn&#xD;
      and regurgitation) associated or not with lesions in esophageal mucosa. Based on findings at&#xD;
      videoendoscopy GERD patients can have a complicated reflux disease (erosive esophagitis) or&#xD;
      not and be considered as a non erosive reflux disease (NERD). 60% of GERD patients have&#xD;
      normal endoscopy (NERD) and requires further studies to achieve a definitive diagnosis. Based&#xD;
      on this fact is that the study will be focus on NERD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently an image-enhanced endoscopic technology using a pre-processor band-limited light&#xD;
      called Optical Enhancement system (OE system™), was developed (Pentax Medical). This new&#xD;
      technology combines digital signal processing with optical filters that limit the spectral&#xD;
      characteristics of the illumination light. The new innovated optical filters achieve higher&#xD;
      overall transmittance by connecting the peaks of the hemoglobin absorption spectrum (415 nm,&#xD;
      540 nm and 570 nm) creating a continuous wavelength spectrum. There are two modes with&#xD;
      different OE filters (Mode 1 and Mode 2). Mode 1 is designed to improve visualization of&#xD;
      microvessels with a sufficient amount of light, and Mode 2 is designed to improve contrast of&#xD;
      white-light observation by bringing the color tone of the overall image closer to that of&#xD;
      natural color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, new scopes has been developed which combines high definition images with optical&#xD;
      magnification called Magniview™. These scopes increase the image up to 136 times with a&#xD;
      better quality of image than standard scopes without optical zoom. Sharma et al. evaluated&#xD;
      esophageal changes in NERD patients using a similar pre-processor filter called Narrow Band&#xD;
      Imaging (NBI). They found that a significantly higher proportion of patients with NERD had an&#xD;
      increased number, dilation and tortuosity of the microscopic intrapapillary capillary loops&#xD;
      (IPCLs), and were considered the best predictors for diagnosing NERD. They used optical&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy technology (NBI) associated to magnification scopes (Olympus GIF Q240Z,&#xD;
      115x), but they did not evaluated if the contribution with this technology to the&#xD;
      observations found in GERD patients were as a result of the NBI or the magnification scopes.&#xD;
      The investigators opinion is that chromoendoscopy is useful but is the magnification what&#xD;
      makes up the difference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sharma et al. described in detail the changes of the intrapapillary capillaries seen with&#xD;
      reflux inflammation. In the normal esophageal mucosa, submucosa all vessels are connected to&#xD;
      the arborescent vascular network. Intrapapillary capillaries arise from the fourth branch of&#xD;
      the arborescent vessels into the epithelial papillae and form single loops called IPCLs. It&#xD;
      has been shown that IPCLs dilate and elongate along with an increase in the number and&#xD;
      density of arborescent vessels in mucosal cancer. These changes are similar to those observed&#xD;
      in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated enrollment: 100 patients (NERD group: 50 patients and control group: 50 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an observational and analytical cross-section, population - based&#xD;
      survey study, with prospective case collection, non-randomized and simple blind, performed in&#xD;
      a Tertiary Academic Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allocation: Non randomized, simple blind&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endpoint Classification: Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Model: Non interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Purpose: Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Instituto Ecuatoriano de Enfermedades Digestivas (IECED), OmniHospital Academic&#xD;
      Tertiary Center. We will include patients from September 2015 to November 2015. Patients will&#xD;
      be recruited from the gastroenterology unit (IECED). The study protocol and consent form has&#xD;
      been approved by the IRB and will be conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Patients will sign an informed consent and answer a questionnaire that includes&#xD;
      constitutional data (sex, age, weight (Kg), height (m), BMI (Kg/m2), chronic diseases,&#xD;
      medication and main reflux symptom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria: Patient selection was done after the&#xD;
      following analysis. Each patients that had reflux symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) and&#xD;
      8 or more points at the Spanish version of GERD questionnaire validated by Zavala-González et&#xD;
      al., underwent an upper videoendoscopy using initially high definition white light and then&#xD;
      virtual chromoendoscopy (I-Scan™) in the three different image algorithms. After performing&#xD;
      an upper endoscopy completely and reach the line Z, the entire esophagus was evaluated&#xD;
      (upper, middle and lower esophagus). If they had any signs of reflux as ulcerative&#xD;
      esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett's esophagus or any erosive sign according to Los&#xD;
      Angeles classification (Grade A to D), they were classified as GERD patients and were&#xD;
      excluded from the protocol. The endoscopies were performed by the same three endoscopist that&#xD;
      will carry on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the esophagus was normal and no changes were seen by these two techniques, they were&#xD;
      considered as NERD patients and a pH-impedanciometry was performed as gold standard study, in&#xD;
      order to diagnosis reflux disease. GERD diagnosis was considered when there were more than 73&#xD;
      episodes of reflux episodes in 24 hours or acid exposure time (AET) abnormal with ph &lt;4&#xD;
      measured in more than 4,2%of the time over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this phase, the investigators could discriminate patients that had a normal&#xD;
      pH-impedanciometry and no reflux disease from the real NERD patients with reflux disease&#xD;
      proven by a positive pH-impedanciometry with symptoms and no lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups were selected. One was the control group and included patients that agreed to be&#xD;
      part of the study and for whom we have certainty that they have no GERD (reflux symptoms but&#xD;
      negative upper endoscopy with high definition white light or I-Scan and negative&#xD;
      Ph-impedanciometry). The other group includes NERD patients with reflux symptoms, a positive&#xD;
      Ph-Impedanciometry but a negative upper endoscopy with high definition white light or I-Scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey: It will be use the Spanish version of the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire survey, validated in Mexico by Zavala-González et al., but in an Ecuadorian&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How often did you have a burning feeling behind your breastbone (heartburn)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How often did you have stomach contents (liquid or food) moving upwards to your throat&#xD;
           or mouth (regurgitation)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How often did you have pain in the center of the upper stomach?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How often did you have nausea?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How often did you have difficulty getting a good night's sleep because of your heartburn&#xD;
           and/or regurgitation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How often did you take additional medication for your heartburn and/or regurgitation,&#xD;
           other than what the physician told you to take (such as Tums, Rolaids and Maalox)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic technique: All the patients included in the protocol (NERD group and control&#xD;
      group) will be studied by upper endoscopy with Magniview™ scopes and EPK-i7010 processor (OE&#xD;
      system™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique involves the use of a distal rubber hood (OE-A58) at the tip of the scope&#xD;
      (EG-2990Zi). After reaching the line Z, the four quadrants of the three levels of the&#xD;
      esophagus (upper, middle and lower esophagus) will be evaluated in the same way. The cup will&#xD;
      contact to the esophageal mucosa and water will be instilled. Initially only the OE system™&#xD;
      will be used (mode 1) If there is no evidence of minimal changes, the optical magnification&#xD;
      will be implemented through the actions of a button on the Magniview scope. Finally the OE&#xD;
      system™ will be off and only the Magniview™ will be used with white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All changes seen will be recorded (by video and pictures) in the specific phase of the study&#xD;
      (OE system™ alone, OE system™ with Magniview™ or Magniview™ alone). Finally, biopsies will be&#xD;
      taken in both groups (one of each esophagus level randomly and one targeted biopsy to any&#xD;
      lesion). The endoscopies will be performed by three endoscopist blind to the group selection&#xD;
      and trained on this new technology (all of them with more than 10 procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal minimal changes will be evaluated as the Sharma et al. classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IPCLs (number, dilatation, and tortuosity). Dilatation of IPCLs will be recognized as a&#xD;
           change in the pattern characterized by increased size or caliber of individual IPCLs.&#xD;
           Tortuosity is define by the presence of corkscrewing or the twisted nature of individual&#xD;
           IPCLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of microerosions (definitive mucosal breaks not visible at standard endoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vascularity at the squamocolumnar junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of columnar island in the distal esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ridge-villous pattern below the squamocolumnar junction characterized by the presence of&#xD;
           uniform, longitudinally aligned ridges alternating with a villiform pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interobserver and Intraobserver Agreement: A data set containing pictures of the three&#xD;
      esophagus levels in the three phase of the study (OE system™ alone, OE system™ with&#xD;
      Magniview™ or Magniview™ alone) will be presented to three blinded endoscopists, who will&#xD;
      confirm or not the findings. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility will be measured based&#xD;
      on comparison of still images between the three investigators. To evaluate the intraobserver&#xD;
      agreement each investigator will assess the images three times and the answers will be&#xD;
      compared. To evaluate the interobserver agreement all answers between the three investigators&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Baseline characteristics as age, gender, body mass index, symptoms will&#xD;
      be compared between case and control group using Chi-square o Fisher Test for categorical&#xD;
      variable, and for continuing variables, we will use the Mann-Whitney Test. Diagnosis efficacy&#xD;
      will be measured thought sensitive, specificity and accuracy. All the statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS software suite v.22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only patients with typical reflux symptoms will participate in the study (heartburn or&#xD;
           regurgitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The protocol will be performed in only one center.&#xD;
