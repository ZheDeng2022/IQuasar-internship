      Introduction: Intravenous infusion of amino acids during cesarean delivery in mothers and&#xD;
      neonates improves neonatal growth. Amino acid before and during anesthesia also prevents&#xD;
      hypothermia and associated untoward effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: After ethical approval, this prospective randomized double blind controlled study is&#xD;
      being conducted in the university hospital of BPKIHS. Seventy six parturients (ASA 1 &amp; 2)&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean delivery without fetal distress, intrauterine growth retardation,&#xD;
      congenital malformation or premature labor will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a period starting from approximately one hour prior to spinal anesthesia, Group 1 and&#xD;
      Group 2 patients will receive 200 ml of amino acid and lactated ringers solution respectively&#xD;
      at 2 ml/kg/hr. The ambient operating room temperature will be maintained near 23º C. No&#xD;
      heating methods will be applied apart from covering with a blanket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be neonatal rectal temperature at 0, 5 and 10 min after birth.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be APGAR scores and suckling reflex in the newborn, change in&#xD;
      rectal temperature relative to baseline and discomfort related to cold sensation in the&#xD;
      mother and the occurrence of shivering both in the mother and newborn.&#xD;

      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothermia is common during peri-operative period (1). It can lead to shivering (2),&#xD;
      sympathetic stimulation (3), ischemic cardiac events (3), coagulation disturbances (4,5)&#xD;
      delayed recovery from anesthesia (6,7), altered immune system with impaired wound healing&#xD;
      (8,9) and prolonged hospitalization (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amino acid infusion before and during surgery is known to prevent peri-operative hypothermia&#xD;
      as a result of increased thermogenesis (10,11) without additional sympatho-adrenal activity&#xD;
      (12). The mechanism is based on nutrient induced thermogenesis; i.e., nutrient intake,&#xD;
      especially proteins and amino acids, stimulates resting energy expenditure and heat&#xD;
      production (13). This effect is more pronounced during general anesthesia than neuraxial&#xD;
      block (14). It has also been proved that amino acid infusion before and/or during anesthesia&#xD;
      and surgery decreases intra-operative blood loss (15), improves peri-operative recovery (16)&#xD;
      and shortens the duration of hospital stay (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of intravenous amino acid infusion during cesarean delivery was long ago&#xD;
      established (18,19).While maternal intravenous administration of amino-acids led to increased&#xD;
      levels of amino acids in maternal venous blood and fetal umbilical cord blood plasma, there&#xD;
      was no increase in fetal uptake of amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of amino acid in the first day of life after delivery has also already been proved&#xD;
      (20,21). It has been used to achieve positive protein balance in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period in neonates undergoing abdominal surgery (20). Aggressive therapy of intravenous amino&#xD;
      acid in preterm infants during 12 hrs to two weeks after birth enhanced their growth and&#xD;
      improved their nutritional status during hospitalization (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to prevent the development of hypothermia during anesthesia is to stimulate&#xD;
      endogenous heat production. Energy expenditure increases after ingestion or infusion of&#xD;
      nutrients. The amount of energy expended over baseline, or thermic effect of food mainly&#xD;
      represents the energy cost of nutrient absorption, handling, and storage. Among the different&#xD;
      nutrients, proteins elicit the largest increase in energy expenditure and heat production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have found that intravenous amino acid infusions exert enhanced thermogenic&#xD;
      effects during general anesthesia (10) The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully&#xD;
      understood, although nutrient intake stimulates energy expenditure, and hence heat&#xD;
      production, in the awake state (13). The administration of proteins/amino acids in awake&#xD;
      individuals results in an approximately 20% increase in whole-body heat content and a&#xD;
      significant increase in body temperature (22,23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since amino acid transfer across the placenta depends upon its concentration in maternal&#xD;
      blood (21,24), the investigators hypothesize that by increasing its concentration in the&#xD;
      maternal blood, the amino acid level in newborn will be increased. The amino acid induced&#xD;
      increased thermogenesis in the mother is likely to increase maternal temperature and thus&#xD;
      fetal temperature. Also amino acids that have crossed the placenta may increase thermogenesis&#xD;
      in the fetus, further enhancing neonatal temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After getting approval from the institutional research ethics committee and written informed&#xD;
      consent, this prospective randomized double blind study was conducted in the University&#xD;
      hospital of B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS). Parturients belonging to&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II scheduled for elective&#xD;
      cesarean delivery were enrolled. Pregnancy with fetal distress, intrauterine growth&#xD;
      retardation, congenital malformation or premature labor were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of computer generated random numbers, each consecutive eligible patients&#xD;
      scheduled for cesarean delivery were assigned to one of the two groups to receive 200 ml of&#xD;
      intravenous amino acid (Active drug) (n=38) or nutrient free standard ringers lactate&#xD;
      solution (active comparator) (n=38) at 2 ml/kg/hr approximately one hour before spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. Amino acid solution used was a balanced mixture of 18 pure crystalline amino&#xD;
      acids, eight of which are essential amino acids (Alamin SN ®, Albert D Limited, Kolkata,&#xD;
      India).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the pre-anesthetic visit one day prior to surgery, all the patients were explained about&#xD;
      the nature of the study and the various questions to be asked during the study. Approximately&#xD;
      90 minutes prior to surgery, each patient was taken to the pre-operative room inside the&#xD;
      operation theater. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and SpO2 were monitored&#xD;
      continuously and non invasive blood pressure every five minutes. To maintain blinding, all&#xD;
      the infusion bags were covered with an opaque plastic sheet and labelled as 'infusion bag'&#xD;
      and hanged on the infusion stand near the patient by an anesthetist not involved in the&#xD;
      management or data collection thereafter. Intravenous infusion of amino acid solution or&#xD;
      ringer's solution was started approximately one hour prior to spinal anesthesia after&#xD;
      recording the baseline vital parameters. Each patient received a total of 200 ml at 2&#xD;
      ml/kg/min. Both the patients and the assessor were unaware of the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one hour of infusion, each patient was transferred to the operating room. The ambient&#xD;
      temperature of the operating room was maintained near 23°C. The monitoring of non invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and rectal temperature&#xD;
      were continued at the same intervals. Spinal anesthesia was induced with 2 ml of 0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine at L 3-4 inter-space applying aseptic precautions with the patient in the lateral&#xD;
      position. After administration of spinal anesthesia, both groups received Ringers solution&#xD;
      15-20 ml/kg/hr maintained at ambient temperature via a separate venous access. All the&#xD;
      patients were covered with a blanket, but no other heating methods were applied. Amino acid&#xD;
      infusion were continued till the completion of 200 ml the solution contained in the infusion&#xD;
      bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternal rectal temperature were recorded before infusion (baseline), prior to spinal&#xD;
      block, at the time of delivery, at half an one hour after spinal block, and at the end of&#xD;
      infusion of 200 ml of study solution. At the end of surgery, each mother was asked about her&#xD;
      perception of cold and its related discomfort on a 0-2 subjective scale (0= No perception, 1=&#xD;
      Tolerable perception, 2=Intolerable perception).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rectal temperature and APGAR scores were assessed at 0, 5 and 10 minutes and suckling&#xD;
      reflex at 10 minutes of the birth of baby. The occurrence of shivering and duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay were noted for both the mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameters was the neonatal rectal temperature at 0, 5 and 10 minutes after&#xD;
      birth. Secondary outcome parameters included neonatal APGAR scores at 0, 5 and 10 minutes&#xD;
      after birth, the number of newborn having suckling reflex; number of neonates who developed&#xD;
      shivering within 10 minutes after birth; change in maternal rectal temperature relative to&#xD;
      baseline at various time points during study drug infusion, maternal temperature at the time&#xD;
      of delivery during intraoperative period; number of mothers developing cold sensation related&#xD;
      discomfort during the intra-operative period; number of mothers who developed shivering&#xD;
      during intra-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous report showed that the mean rectal temperature of new born immediately after&#xD;
      delivery following spinal anaesthesia was 37.7°C. (22) With the help of STATA, it was&#xD;
      estimated that a sample size of 26 in each group could achieve a power of 95% to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 0.5 °C (with common standard deviation of 0.5) in the outcome measure of new&#xD;
      born rectal temperature, assuming type 1 error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary outcome, the sample size was calculated using online statistical calculator&#xD;
      G power (R) version 3.0.1. Cohen d was used to calculate the effect size based on the&#xD;
      findings of a previous study.(14) The mean final core temperature 90 min after induction of&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia was 35.8 (SEM 0.1)°C in the saline group and 36.6 (0.1)°C in the amino&#xD;
      acid group.(14) It was estimated that a sample size of 34 in each group could achieve a power&#xD;
      of 80% to detect an effect size of 0.69 in the outcome measure of maternal core body&#xD;
      temperature, assuming type 1 error of 0.05. We enrolled 38 patients in each group to&#xD;
      compensate for dropout cases and shifting from normality in data distribution.&#xD;
