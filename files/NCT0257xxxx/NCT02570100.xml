  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From a cellular perspective, breast cancers appear to develop hierarchically from a small&#xD;
      contingent of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The presence of CSCs in tumor tissue is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis, as well as a worse prognosis. Thus,&#xD;
      these CSCs exhibit resistance to conventional anti-tumor treatments such as radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Moreover, these treatments would favor the emergence of these CSCs and the&#xD;
      reprogramming of non-CSCs in CSCs. It has been demonstrated in neoadjuvant that the&#xD;
      proportion of CSCs before any treatment is correlated with chemoresistance and that a&#xD;
      resurgence of CSCs after chemotherapy is correlated with a poor prognosis. However, the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the emergence of CSCs by reprogramming of non-CSCs are not yet known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oscar Lambret Center proposes a monocentric prospective interventional study based on the&#xD;
      cellular and molecular analysis of the tumor, serum and circulating cells, before, during and&#xD;
      at the end of the treatment for each patient receiving a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer. The identification of the mechanisms contributing to the enrichment of CSCs resistant&#xD;
      to chemotherapy could lead to therapeutic solutions.&#xD;

      Patients responding criteria for selection will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the initiation of chemotherapy, a tumor specimen (under echographic control) and four&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected. The chemotherapy consists of 3 cycles of (F)EC100 spaced 21&#xD;
      days apart :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epirubicin, 100 mg/m² in intravenous (IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m² in IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  +/- 5-fluorouracile (5FU), 500 mg/m² in IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followed by 3 cycles of Taxotere (Docetaxel, IV, 100 mg/m²) spaced 21 days apart +/-&#xD;
      Herceptin (Trastuzumab, IV, 8 mg/kg during C1 and then 6 mg/kg) for 1 year in the case of&#xD;
      overexpression of the HER-2 oncoprotein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the (F)EC100 treatment, at the&#xD;
      time of the usual ultrasound examination), a tumor specimen and four blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy (that is to say at the end of the Docetaxel +/-&#xD;
      Trastuzumab treatment), four blood samples will be collected. A partial or total mastectomy&#xD;
      could be performed during the 6 cycles of chemotherapy. During surgery, a tumor specimen will&#xD;
      be taken. The indication of breast surgery will remain at the discretion of the&#xD;
      pluridisciplinary committee of the participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination&#xD;
      and will undergo laboratory examinations. On day 1 of the fourth cycle and after the sixth&#xD;
      cycle of chemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination and will undergo laboratory&#xD;
      examinations. After three cycles of chemotherapy, at the time of the intermediate breast&#xD;
      ultrasound, patients will have paraclinical examinations. Finally, at the end of the study&#xD;
      (after partial or total mastectomy), anatomopathological examinations will be performed on&#xD;
      the operative specimen.&#xD;
