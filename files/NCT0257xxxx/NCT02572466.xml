      This study objective is to compare the high sensitive troponin-I level in end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease patients received hemodialysis without acute cardiovascular event with healthy&#xD;
      population. The investigators also determine the effect of hemodialysis on troponin I level&#xD;
      as the secondary objective.&#xD;

      Human cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) is an composition of Troponin which is found in heart muscle&#xD;
      cells. Molecular weight of cTnI is 23,875 Dalton consisting of 209 amino acids. [1,2] The&#xD;
      cTnI have been used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction(AMI). [3,4,5] According&#xD;
      to ESC / ACCF / AHA / WHF, diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction rely on the data from&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, Electrocardiogram (EKG) changes in the specific pattern, such as&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation / depression, new left bundle branch block, and cardiac biomarker level&#xD;
      rise over the 99th percentile upper reference limit, which makes the cTnI level was used to&#xD;
      help in making diagnosis for patient coming with symptoms of angina in emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current cTnI detecting test has developed more and more high sensitive(called&#xD;
      &quot;high-sensitive troponin-I; hsTnI&quot;) which can detected in the range 10-50,000 pg / ml (ng /&#xD;
      L) [6], and it can detected cTnI level even in normal people unlike cTnI, which only reported&#xD;
      positive or negative or lower than the limit of detection. Due to ARCHITECT stat High&#xD;
      sensitive Troponin-I (Abbott diagnostic) capabilities, hsTnI level can be detected in normal&#xD;
      people up to 96 percent.[7] The reference range of hsTnI which has been researched by Apple&#xD;
      FS, et al.(2012) studying the 19 types of cardiac troponin I and T measurement was&#xD;
      established. The 99th percentile values for general healthy population without hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, kidney disease and myocardial infarction, aged 18-64 years was 36 ng / L in men (N&#xD;
      = 272), 15 ng / L in women (N = 252) [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, research to find the reference of hsTnI in some groups , especially in patients with&#xD;
      kidney disease is still limited and the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction also use the&#xD;
      99th percentile as the reference source which was researched in healthy population[7] which&#xD;
      makes it difficult to interpret. Sometimes doctors may concluded that patients with rising&#xD;
      hsTnI because of kidney disease. According to the research in the next section, there are&#xD;
      both support and against in this idea. Therefore, the researchers aim to study hsTnI in&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease received hemodialysis compare with normal population.&#xD;
