    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPRIV therapy (60 units per&#xD;
      kilogram [U/kg] every other week [EOW]) in treatment-naive participants with type 1 Gaucher&#xD;
      disease on change from baseline in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score as&#xD;
      measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) after 24 months of treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the results will be converted to Z-scores appropriate for age, sex, and race. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range, race and with the same sex. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 51, and 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow burden (BMB) score is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system for assessing the extent of bone marrow involvement in Gaucher disease. BMB scores will be calculated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the LS and femurs, and will be converted to between 0 and 8. A higher BMB score indicates more severe bone marrow involvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severity of Bone Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51 and 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone pain will be measured by questions taken from the Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-SF©). The BPI is developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. It will assess pain on scales for the severity of pain (0=No pain to 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine), impact of pain on daily function (0=Does not interfere to 10=Completely interferes), location of pain (area that hurts the most), pain medications (if any), and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week (0=No relief to 100=Complete relief).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 51 and 103 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall fatigue will be measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI is a 9-item questionnaire developed to assess subjective fatigue. Each question asks the respondent to rate the level of their experienced fatigue over the past 24 hours on an 11-point (0-10) scale. The first three questions measure fatigue severity at current, usual, and worst levels, respectively, with 0 indicating &quot;no fatigue&quot; and 10 indicating fatigue &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The following six questions assess the level fatigue interference with daily activities including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (both inside and outside the home), relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. A score of 0 corresponds to no interference while a score of 10 indicates complete interference.</description>

    <description>As per WHO BMD Classifications, bone mineral density will be classified based on LS T-scores as Normal for score &quot;-1.0 or greater&quot;; Low bone mass (osteopenia) for score &quot;Between 1-.0 and .2.5&quot;; Osteoporosis for score &quot;-2.5 and below&quot; and Severe osteoporosis for score &quot;-2.5 and below + fragility fracture&quot;.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Severe vitamin D deficiency to the level that would be expected to result in&#xD;
             osteomalacia (vitamin D &lt; 10 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL] [25 nanomoles per liter&#xD;
             {nmol/L}]). If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency at screening (vitamin D greater&#xD;
             than [&gt;] 10 and &lt; 30 ng/mL) treat with 4000 IU vitamin D per day for 1 month and&#xD;
             rescreen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has previously interrupted ERT for safety reasons.&#xD;
