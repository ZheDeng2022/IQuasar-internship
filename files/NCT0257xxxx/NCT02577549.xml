      This study aims to develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of a systematic, practical,&#xD;
      cost-effective diet-induced weight loss and exercise intervention in both urban and rural&#xD;
      communities that can reduce pain and improve other clinical outcomes in knee OA patients.&#xD;
      This pragmatic community-based trial will determine if the investigators previous findings&#xD;
      translate to real-world settings and will address common concerns about barriers to&#xD;
      effectiveness/ implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA), and weight loss is an&#xD;
      effective non-pharmacologic treatment to reduce pain. Recently, the investigators determined&#xD;
      that under ideal, highly controlled circumstances, a diet-induced weight loss of 10% combined&#xD;
      with exercise was significantly better at reducing pain than either intervention alone.&#xD;
      Compared to the investigators previous longterm weight loss and exercise trials of knee OA,&#xD;
      the diet-induced weight loss and exercise group was twice as effective at relieving pain.&#xD;
      Whether the investigators results can be generalized to less rigorously monitored patient&#xD;
      cohorts is unknown. Thus the challenge the investigators now face is to provide the practical&#xD;
      means to implement this proven treatment in the community setting. This study aims to develop&#xD;
      and demonstrate the effectiveness of a systematic, practical, cost-effective diet-induced&#xD;
      weight loss and exercise intervention in both urban and rural communities that can reduce&#xD;
      pain and improve other clinical outcomes in knee OA patients. This pragmatic community-based&#xD;
      trial will determine if the investigators previous findings translate to real-world settings&#xD;
      and will address common concerns about barriers to effectiveness/ implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 820 ambulatory, community-dwelling, overweight and obese men and women&#xD;
      who meet the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for knee OA. The primary aim&#xD;
      is to determine whether a pragmatic, community-based 18-month diet-induced weight loss and&#xD;
      exercise intervention implemented in three North Carolina counties with diverse residential&#xD;
      (from urban to rural) and socioeconomic composition significantly decreases knee pain in&#xD;
      overweight and obese adults with knee OA relative to an attention control group. Secondary&#xD;
      aims will determine whether this intervention improves self-reported function, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and mobility. The investigators will also establish the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of this pragmatic, community-based, multimodal diet-induced weight-loss and exercise program&#xD;
      by conducting cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact analyses using data from the current&#xD;
      trial in a validated computer-simulated model of knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many physicians who treat people with knee OA have no practical means to implement weight&#xD;
      loss and exercise treatments. This study is significant in that it will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a long-awaited and much needed community-based program that will serve as a&#xD;
      blueprint for clinicians and public health officials in both urban and rural communities to&#xD;
      implement a weight loss and exercise program designed to reduce knee pain and improve other&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in overweight and obese people with knee OA that can be sustained long-term&#xD;
      and at a reasonable cost.&#xD;

Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
