  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. About 40%&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer patients were diagnosed as locally advanced unresectable status without&#xD;
      distant metastasis. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was a reasonable treatment modality&#xD;
      for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, several adverse events of chemoradiation&#xD;
      could lead unfavorable treatment results, which included unique gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      toxicities, such as ulcer and hemorrhage in the stomach and duodenum that are included in the&#xD;
      radiation field. According to the study in the investigators hospital, 45% of locally&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with CCRT suffered from GI ulcers, and among&#xD;
      them, 65% of the patients experienced the significant hemorrhage events. Although these GI&#xD;
      toxicities, the studies for radioprotective agents were limited. Albis® is a newly developed&#xD;
      drug comprised of ranitidine, bismuth and sucralfate. The investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      radioprotective effect of Albis® for locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      CCRT.&#xD;
