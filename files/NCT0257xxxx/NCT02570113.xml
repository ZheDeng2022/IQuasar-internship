  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ablative Solutions, Inc. Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is a catheter-based device&#xD;
      which is intended to be used to ablate the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves serving&#xD;
      the kidneys. The catheter is inserted via the femoral artery, steered into the renal artery,&#xD;
      and then delivers, by infusion from its distal end, a neurolytic agent. This targets the&#xD;
      nerve bundles, which are in the adventitia - a sheath surrounding the artery. The aim is to&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure in cases of hypertension, including seriously elevated blood pressure&#xD;
      which does not respond to drug treatment. This study will evaluate the safety and performance&#xD;
      of the device.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence in the published literature that the renal nerves are important&#xD;
      contributors to hypertension, and that their ablation does not have adverse side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature provides technical, clinical and scientific evidence supporting the use of&#xD;
      perivascular renal denervation for a carefully defined patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An existing device (the Medtronic Symplicity catheter) was initially shown to be safe and&#xD;
      effective for achieving perivascular renal denervation by delivery of radio-frequency energy.&#xD;
      The results of early nonrandomized clinical studies (HTN-1, HTN-2) found that perivascular&#xD;
      renal denervation by radio-frequency energy delivery was an effective therapy, associated&#xD;
      with very low risks. In other contexts, denervation can also be safely and effectively&#xD;
      achieved by neurolytic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASI Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter and the denervation procedure in general is&#xD;
      similar enough to the Medtronic Symplicity catheter to enable the use of published data to&#xD;
      establish the validity of the design concept of the Peregrine System and estimate the likely&#xD;
      levels of risk of side effects. It can be concluded from the literature that the ASI&#xD;
      Peregrine System™ will achieve percutaneous renal denervation with a low risk of procedural&#xD;
      complications (comparable to accepted percutaneous interventional therapies) and without&#xD;
      long-term impairment of renal artery or kidney function or other serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous premarket clinical trials have provided support for the safe and effective use of&#xD;
      the Peregrine Catheter for the treatment of patients with hypertension. The Peregrine System&#xD;
      Infusion Catheter is currently CE marked and the indication for use is &quot;The Peregrine System™&#xD;
      Infusion Catheter is intended for the infusion of a neurolytic agent to achieve a reduction&#xD;
      in systemic blood pressure in hypertensive patients.&quot; Based upon the literature and previous&#xD;
      clinical data, chemical denervation is an appropriate treatment for the specified study&#xD;
      population of adults who have hypertension despite taking at least 3 anti-hypertensive drugs&#xD;
      of different classes including at least one diuretic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this post-market study are to collect additional safety and performance&#xD;
      data pertaining to renal denervation by using dehydrated alcohol as a chemical neurolytic&#xD;
      agent delivered into the adventitial/peri-adventitial area of the renal arteries for the&#xD;
      purpose of renal denervation, using the Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter, in patients with&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for the study to be valid, only one chemical neurolytic agent can be used. The&#xD;
      Coordinating Investigator has chosen to use dehydrated alcohol (not less than 95% by volume)&#xD;
      for therapeutic neurolysis, therefore all participating sites will usethis agent.&#xD;
