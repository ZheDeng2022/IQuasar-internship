    <textblock>
      The prognosis of peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer has recently improved with&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Although&#xD;
      outcomes are further improved when early stage peritoneal metastases are treated, adjuvant&#xD;
      HIPEC has not yet been thoroughly addressed. This prospective pilot study assessed&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of HIPEC performed simultaneously with primary curative&#xD;
      surgery in colorectal cancer patients with primary tumor-related risk-factors for the&#xD;
      development of metachronous peritoneal metastases.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Peritoneal surfaces are the second most common site of disease progression for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC), following liver metastases. Historically, prognosis of CRC&#xD;
      peritoneal metastases (PM) was only about 6 months with palliative systemic chemotherapy or&#xD;
      supportive care. Survival improvements have been reported with cytoreductive surgery and&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). However, CRS/HIPEC is more effective&#xD;
      and safe when early-stage CRC-PM are treated and most patients are not suitable for&#xD;
      CRS/HIPEC, due to extensive peritoneal and/or systemic disease. Also, in the palliative&#xD;
      setting, modern systemic therapies appear to be less effective for PM, than non-PM metastatic&#xD;
      CRC and absence of symptoms and current limitations of imaging hamper early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of PM. These points would support the use of adjuvant HIPEC to prevent the&#xD;
      outgrowth of occult peritoneal seeding into macroscopic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This tudy to assesses feasibility and safety of an integrated approach of&#xD;
      curative surgery and adjuvant HIPEC performed at the same time as primary surgery in patients&#xD;
      with primary CRC at high risk for the development of metachronous PM. Patients are&#xD;
      prospectively selected on the base of preoperative clinical and radiological work-up. At&#xD;
      surgery, careful exploration of all peritoneal the cavity, and intra-operative pathological&#xD;
      examination are carried out to confirm clinical-pathological risk-factors for PM development&#xD;
      Standard adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is intended in the postoperative setting. A matched&#xD;
      control group will be selected among patients with colorectal cancer undergoing curative&#xD;
      surgery and standard adjuvant systemic chemotherapy at the same institution and during the&#xD;
      same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Patients with colorectal cancer undergoing intentionally curative resection&#xD;
      for primary tumors infiltrating the visceral serosa (T4a) or directly invading adjacent&#xD;
      organs (T4b), with positive peritoneal washing cytology or resected ovarian or minimal&#xD;
      peritoneal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION Adjuvant HIPEC procedure is performed under general anaesthesia after the&#xD;
      completion of the surgical procedures. Colon resections for primary tumors are performed&#xD;
      according to the oncologic principles of adequate lymph-adenectomy.Greater and lesser&#xD;
      omentectomy and adhesiolysis (if necessary) are performed routinely to ensure optimal&#xD;
      perfusion during the HIPEC. Tumor deposits on visceral and parietal surfaces are surgically&#xD;
      removed by formal peritonectomy procedures and/or organ resections, as needed. HIPEC is&#xD;
      performed with cisplatin (25 mg/m2/l of perfusate) and mitomycin-C (3•3 mg/m2/l of perfusate)&#xD;
      at 42•5°C for 60 minutes according to the closed-abdomen .technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES Primary end-point is the sensitivity and false positive rate of&#xD;
      preoperative/intraoperative assessment of primary tumor-related risk-factors for the&#xD;
      development of peritoneal metastases in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing curative&#xD;
      surgery..Secondary endpoints are number of participants with adverse events as a measure of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability, Cumulative incidence of PM, overall and progression-free survival&#xD;
      are assessed in comparison with matched controls.&#xD;
