  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 2, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label trial in participants with Multi-drug&#xD;
      Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Only participants who completed Trial 242-07-204&#xD;
      (NCT00685360) were eligible. The trial was performed globally at 14 sites qualified to treat&#xD;
      MDR-TB. All 434 participants who completed Trial 242-07-204 were eligible for this trial if&#xD;
      there was still potential clinical benefit to them and all inclusion criteria and no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were met.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 14 investigative sites in the Philippines, Latvia, Estonia, South Korea, Peru, China, and Japan from 26 March 2009 to 27 October 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a Pre-treatment, Treatment, and Follow-up Period. The Pre-treatment Period consisted of a screening and baseline visit. This was followed by a 26-week Treatment Period. There was also a Follow-up Period (28 to 32 days) for the collection of Adverse events (AEs).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Vital signs included weight (kg), body temperature (degree Celsius), heart rate [beats/minute (bpm)], systolic and diastolic blood pressure [millimetre of mercury (mm Hg)]. The criteria for clinically significant abnormal value for: weight was decrease or increase of &gt;=5% in body weight, heart rate was &lt;=60 bpm and decrease of &gt;=15 bpm; &gt;=120 bpm and Increase of &gt;=15 bpm, systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;=90 mm Hg and decrease of &gt;=20 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;=50 mm Hg and decrease of &gt;=15 mm Hg, all vital signs relative to Baseline. Baseline is Study 204 completion visit (Day 84) for participants who complete the baseline visit within 7 days of completing Study 204. Only categories with data for potentially clinically significant abnormal vital sign parameter values are reported.</description>

          <description>Vital signs included weight (kg), body temperature (degree Celsius), heart rate [beats/minute (bpm)], systolic and diastolic blood pressure [millimetre of mercury (mm Hg)]. The criteria for clinically significant abnormal value for: weight was decrease or increase of &gt;=5% in body weight, heart rate was &lt;=60 bpm and decrease of &gt;=15 bpm; &gt;=120 bpm and Increase of &gt;=15 bpm, systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;=90 mm Hg and decrease of &gt;=20 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;=50 mm Hg and decrease of &gt;=15 mm Hg, all vital signs relative to Baseline. Baseline is Study 204 completion visit (Day 84) for participants who complete the baseline visit within 7 days of completing Study 204. Only categories with data for potentially clinically significant abnormal vital sign parameter values are reported.</description>
          <population>Safety Population included all participants treated with at least one dose of Delamanid in this study. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analyses at the given time point.</population>

        <description>Laboratory assessments included parameters for serum chemistry (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase, potassium, sodium, triglycerides, uric acid), hematology (white blood cell count eosinophils, absolute, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, absolute, mean corpuscular volume, neutrophil, bands, neutrophils, neutrophils, absolute, platelet count, red blood cell (RBC) count, reticulocyte count) and urinalysis (blood, epithelial cast, granular cast, hyaline cast, RBCs per high power field (RBC/HPF)). The participants were categorized based on the clinically significant laboratory values as per predefined criteria. The categories with at least one participant with clinically significant value outside the normal range for laboratory assessments are reported.</description>

Participants were administered OBR as directed by the given investigator based on WHO guidelines and clinical judgment. A participant may have been titrated to delamanid 200 mg BID after an initial hospitalization of 2 weeks.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant/clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. A TEAE is any new AE or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of study drug. An SAE is an AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life-threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Treatment Non-responders Using the MGIT Culture System</title>
        <description>Non-responders were defined as participants classified as non-converter or reverter. Non-converters were defined as participants without SCC at baseline and who did not achieve SCC during the 26-week trial period whereas reverters were participants with SCC at baseline and at least one positive post-baseline result. The total percentage of treatment non-responders was calculated as the number of reverters plus the number of non-converters divided by the total number of participants in the analysis population. Efficacy was assessed by the MGIT sputum culture system (ie, sputum culture conversion)</description>
