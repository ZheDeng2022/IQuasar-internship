      Introduction This study evaluates the effect on glucose, lipid and bone metabolism following&#xD;
      knee orthopedic procedures in healthy and physically active individuals. The sedentary&#xD;
      rehabilitation period following these procedures may impact negatively on glucose, lipid and&#xD;
      bone metabolic pathways, whereas the more physically active rehabilitation period instituted&#xD;
      6 weeks after surgery is hypothesized to impact positively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective This study will establish whether the well-known effects on glucose, lipid and&#xD;
      bone metabolism of a sedentary lifestyle can be observed already following 6 weeks of&#xD;
      physical inactivity in otherwise healthy and physically fit young and middle aged&#xD;
      individuals. Investigators will thereby add knowledge to previous findings following strict&#xD;
      bed-rest in healthy individuals on glucose, lipid and bone metabolism. In a clinical&#xD;
      perspective it is important to examine the extent to which healthy individuals deteriorate in&#xD;
      various metabolic pathways to better understand the pathophysiology behind these defects both&#xD;
      in healthy individuals and in patients, who undergo bed rest or an equal reduction in&#xD;
      physical activity as part of their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design 16 physical active non-diabetic individuals of age 18 - 50 years who are&#xD;
      undergoing knee surgical procedures at the Arthroscopic Center at Amager/Hvidovre Hospitals&#xD;
      are recruited as cases for this case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 non-diabetic control subjects matched for age, gender and physical activity are recruited&#xD;
      to establish a reference level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The individuals will bring in morning spot urine for measurement of soluble urokinase&#xD;
           plasminogen activating receptor (suPAR), creatinine, albumin and orosomucoid. Weight and&#xD;
           height and waist and hip circumference will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with ingestion of 75 g glucose during 5 min from&#xD;
           baseline (0 min). Plasma for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, non-esterified fatty acid&#xD;
           (NEFA) will be drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before OGTT blood will be drawn for measurement of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL,&#xD;
           triglyceride, Na, K, creatinine, hemoglobin (HgB), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes,&#xD;
           alanintransaminase (ALAT), alkaline phosphatase, Ca++, D vitamin, TSH, bone turnover&#xD;
           markers (BTM), suPAR, interleukin 6 (IL6), TNFa, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein&#xD;
           (hsCRP), lipid density profiling and lipid particle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of hip, lumbar columna, visceral and subcutaneous&#xD;
           fat is measured by Hologic Discovery scanner.&#xD;

      Hypothesis Implementation of a sedentary lifestyle with almost no physical activity in&#xD;
      otherwise physical active individuals undergoing knee orthopaedic surgical procedures will&#xD;
      during 6 weeks (4 to 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  derange insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease disposition index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  imply hyper-secretion of incretin hormones and glucagon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compensatory decrease in insulin clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease lipid oxidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase number of low density lipoprotein particles and a decrease the particle size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase immune and low grade inflammatory response as measured in plasma and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  induce bone loss in hip as measured by bone mineral density (BMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase bone resorption and decrease bone formation as measured by selected bone&#xD;
           turnover markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed negative changes in bone, lipid and glucose metabolism are thought to reverse at&#xD;
      least partly so, during active physical rehabilitation during week 6 through week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Ten days of bed rest in 13 healthy young individuals showed a 20% (P&lt;0.05)&#xD;
      significant decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 50% (P&lt;0.05) reduction in lipid oxidation.&#xD;
      Thirty-one days of bed rest in 8 healthy women was significantly associated with bone loss in&#xD;
      total hip (2.07%, P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the present study does not imply strict bed rest but exhibit a longer sedentary period of&#xD;
      following up as the above studies and include a larger number of participants we are very&#xD;
      likely to exhibit a power &gt; 80% at significance level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The study is approved by the local scientific ethical committee and the Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency. The study adheres to the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data&#xD;
      and, Danish Act on Health and the Helsinki II convention of clinical trials. The study will&#xD;
      be announced at the clinicaltrials.gov homepage. All participants are informed about the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, all ethical issues and a written consent is obtained before&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data from patient medical files will be accessed by principal investigator to gather&#xD;
      information concerning the knee injuries in order to identify and characterize the knee&#xD;
      injury for each subject. Personal data concerning demographic relations such as gender and&#xD;
      age will be accessed as well to ensure the case subjects meet the inclusion criteria and for&#xD;
      statistically use. To make assessments on study participation, the principal investigator&#xD;
      will also gain access to relevant data from the patient s medical files concerning illnesses&#xD;
      or conditions the case subject might report. The X-ray radiation from 1 DXA scan equals 1 day&#xD;
      of background radiation in Denmark. Thus 3 DXA scans throughout the study period are equal to&#xD;
      3 days of background radiation. This amount of radiation is 30-fold less than that of a&#xD;
      single standard CT-scan of abdomen. In other words the dose of radiation is so low that a&#xD;
      calculation of risk is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of blood drawn during the approximately 16 weeks of participation in the study is&#xD;
      less than 500 ml, which is the standard amount of blood drawn at a single donation of blood&#xD;
      from a blood donor. The use of intravenous cannula can cause irritation or infection of vein&#xD;
      or insertion site. All procedures will be performed as described in SOP.&#xD;
