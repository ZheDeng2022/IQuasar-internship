  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system,&#xD;
      accompanied by varying inflammatory manifestations, demyelinization and axonal loss. With&#xD;
      chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting disease onsets persons with MS (pwMS)&#xD;
      progressively develop impaired functional capacity and show reduced physical activity and&#xD;
      cognitive decline compared to healthy controls. The primary aims of rehabilitation in pwMS&#xD;
      are therefore to increase levels of activity and participation leading to increase&#xD;
      independence of the participants. In general exercise ranges from passive physiotherapy-based&#xD;
      interventions to submaximal endurance training sessions. Current recommendations advise pwMS&#xD;
      that exercise should be matched with the individual performance capacities. Exercise training&#xD;
      in pwMS then has the potential to target and improve many components outlined in the&#xD;
      ICF-model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines and neurotrophic factors have received increased attention in MS research and&#xD;
      addressed the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as an important mediator of neuronal&#xD;
      regeneration linking the effects of exercise with MS pathogenesis. Data show positive&#xD;
      connections between elevated neurotrophin concentrations, induction of neuroplasticity,&#xD;
      recovery of the motor and cognitive functions and the applied training intensities.&#xD;
      Similarly, intensive and progressive exercise bouts seem to have greater benefits on&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness and maximum voluntary strength in elderly and seniors with&#xD;
      dementia. Therefore, specific exercise prescriptions may be necessary for targeting the&#xD;
      specific impairments also in pwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate two different training modalities (intensive versus normal) in&#xD;
      pwMS. It is expected that both modalities will improve cardiorespiratory fitness and&#xD;
      cognitive functions in pwMS. Based on the findings that higher training intensities&#xD;
      facilitate greater benefits, it is expected that pwMS will tolerate the intensive training&#xD;
      intensities and show positive connections to elevated neurotrophin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will to help to clearer understand the benefits of each type of exercise conveyed&#xD;
      for pwMS and will assist in the development of patient-specific exercise prescriptions.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate two different training modalities (intensive versus normal) in&#xD;
      pwMS. It is expected that both modalities will improve cardiorespiratory fitness and&#xD;
      cognitive functions in pwMS. Based on the findings that higher training intensities&#xD;
      facilitate greater benefits, it is expected that pwMS will tolerate the intensive training&#xD;
      intensities and show positive connections to elevated neurotrophin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are the acute (after CPET) and chronic (3-week training intervention)&#xD;
      changes of neurotrophic factors and cognitive functions. All other measures are secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (Training values: VO2peak, Workload, Heart rate; Fatigue: FSMC; Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression: HADS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are eligible if they hold a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (revised&#xD;
      McDonald criteria), an EDSS score of 1.0 -6.0, they give no written consent, severe&#xD;
      cardiovascular exacerbations (RR &gt; 240/120, HR above the age predicted maximum of 220-Age)&#xD;
      are persistent, they hold severe cognitive impairments, they face severe disease progression&#xD;
      or relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main measurements and procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: Blood samples (10ml) of the primary outcomes will be taken by vein puncture&#xD;
      from the antecubital vein in a seated position before the exercise bout and straight after&#xD;
      reaching VO2peak during cool down, with the participant still seated on the ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before samples are taken the participant will be required to relax for 10 minutes, blood&#xD;
      sampling will take approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET): Cardiorespiratory fitness is assessed through a&#xD;
      progressive CPET performed at baseline on a cycle ergometer at t1 and is repeated the day&#xD;
      prior to discharge at t2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol consists of (a) first 3 minutes at rest (no pedalling) on the cycle&#xD;
      ergometer; (b) 3 minutes of unloaded pedalling as a warm up; (c) testing phase until the&#xD;
      participant reaches a symptom limited maximum. Workload is continuously ramp type increased&#xD;
      by 5-10 Watts every minute to ensure 8-12 minutes of testing; (d) the final 3 minutes are&#xD;
      unloaded pedalling to cool down. Heart rate (Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland) and blood&#xD;
      pressure (Riva-Rocci) are monitored for the last 10 seconds every 2 minutes during the test.&#xD;
      The 10-point BORG scale therapy short-form assesses the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) at&#xD;
      phases (c) and (d). Blood samples are drawn at rest prior to phase (a) and at the end of CPET&#xD;
      phase (d) at t1 and t2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessments: Cognitive assessments will be performed using the German version of&#xD;
      the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS). Additionally,&#xD;
      the German version of the Trail-Making-Pencil-Test versions A/B (TMT-A/B) and Go/noGo (TAP&#xD;
      version) will be used. Cognitive assessments will be performed at baseline (t1) and repeated&#xD;
      at t2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue: Fatigue is assessed with the multidimensional FSMC scale before CPET under resting&#xD;
      conditions. FSMC has defined cut-off scores to classify mildly, moderately and severely&#xD;
      fatigued patients. Cut-off for fatigue is set for the total score at 43 and for the motoric&#xD;
      and cognitive sub-scores at 22. The scale has a proven test-retest liability and has been&#xD;
      translated into multiple languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and Anxiety: Depression and anxiety are assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-assessment questionnaire for adults with physical&#xD;
      ailments that assess anxiety and depression. The questionnaire consists of 14 items seven for&#xD;
      anxiety seven for depression with higher scores indicating anxiety or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: Endurance training in both groups consisted of physiologically defined heart rate&#xD;
      controlled cycling at 50-60 rounds per minutes (rpm) and progressive resistance training. All&#xD;
      participants will be stratified according to their cardiorespiratory fitness and level of&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue in to group Intensive Training (IT) and Normal Training (NT). Training&#xD;
      groups differ in the applied intensities and frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IT will train less frequent but training sessions will be more intensive in its effects.&#xD;
      Training will be performed daily in six sessions (three morning and three afternoon&#xD;
      sessions), synchronized and individually matched to a ratio of active versus passive sessions&#xD;
      of 2:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NT is the normal training performed out of the daily routine and outlines the usual care&#xD;
      of the Valens clinic. Training will be performed in maximal eight training sessions and will&#xD;
      not be synchronized and not individually matched to a ratio of active versus passive&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
