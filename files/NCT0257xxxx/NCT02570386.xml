  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present randomized controlled study is to compare clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of freezing all embryos followed by frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) compared&#xD;
      to fresh embryo transfer, in women undergoing IVF treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 800 infertile women undergoing IVF treatment will be randomized into one of the&#xD;
      following two groups by computer-generated random numbers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh embryo transfer group: a single fresh embryo transfer FET group: a single FET following&#xD;
      freezing of all embryos in the stimulated IVF cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      All techniques of IVF including ovarian stimulation, harvesting of oocytes, insemination with&#xD;
      specially prepared sperm and embryo culture in the laboratory will be according to local&#xD;
      protocols. Once the embryos have been cultured up to day 2 or 3, women with 3 or more&#xD;
      suitable quality embryos will be randomized to either fresh embryo transfer (control arm) or&#xD;
      FET (Intervention arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm Women allocated to the control arm will either undergo embryo transfer at&#xD;
      cleavage stage or extended culture and transfer at blastocyst stage according to local&#xD;
      policy. A maximum of 2 embryos or blastocysts will be replaced according to the standard&#xD;
      protocol under transabdominal ultrasound guidance. Luteal phase support is given according to&#xD;
      local protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm For those allocated to the intervention arm fresh embryo transfer will not&#xD;
      be undertaken. Embryos will be frozen by vitrification or slow freezing at cleavage or&#xD;
      blastocyst stage according to standard agreed local protocols. Women will be contacted after&#xD;
      4 weeks and arrangements made for frozen embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least 4 weeks women will attend the IVF clinic for the transfer of thawed frozen&#xD;
      embryos, either in a natural cycle (in ovulatory women who have regular menstrual cycles) or&#xD;
      in a hormonally supported cycle using physiological doses of estrogen and progestogens to&#xD;
      mimic normal cyclical changes within the endometrium. The choice between replacing&#xD;
      frozen-thawed embryos in a natural or hormonally mediated cycle will be a decision driven by&#xD;
      the clinical circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryos or blastocysts will be thawed according to local protocols. The transfer is performed&#xD;
      by the team clinician with a maximum of 2 embryos or blastocysts being replaced according to&#xD;
      the standard protocol under transabdominal ultrasound guidance. Luteal phase support is given&#xD;
      at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy test will be carried out 2 weeks after embryo transfer in both arms. All women&#xD;
      who have a positive pregnancy test 2 weeks after embryo transfer will undergo a transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound scan to identify the presence and number of a gestation sac with a fetal heart&#xD;
      signifying an ongoing pregnancy. Pelvic scan will be repeated at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks&#xD;
      and 36 gestation for fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on all pregnancy outcomes including early pregnancy losses such as miscarriage or&#xD;
      ectopic pregnancy will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve consistency with respect to the collection of outcome, standardised case&#xD;
      report forms (CRF) will be completed for each woman at each centre. These CRFs will include&#xD;
      details on treatment received, pregnancy outcomes, complications in pregnancy, mode of&#xD;
      delivery and birth outcomes.&#xD;
