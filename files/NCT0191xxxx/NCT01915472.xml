  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial to study the safety and efficacy of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed&#xD;
      of a drug attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a&#xD;
      common chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by&#xD;
      the immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to&#xD;
      the body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal&#xD;
      cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the&#xD;
      laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts&#xD;
      for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is&#xD;
      safe and effective.&#xD;
