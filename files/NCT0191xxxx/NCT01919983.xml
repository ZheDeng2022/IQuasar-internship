    <textblock>
      Despite pharmacologic advances for the treatment of congestive heart failure (HF), sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death (SCD) and pump failure remain the leading causes of mortality in patients with&#xD;
      HF. Although, SCD is poorly understood, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) have been&#xD;
      shown to be an effective, but costly therapy in preventing SCD. At present, left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction is our best independent predictor of SCD, but only moderately predicts&#xD;
      those patients who will eventually benefit from the placement of an ICD and, in most cases,&#xD;
      left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is a non-modifiable risk factor once acquired. As&#xD;
      a result, there exists an intensive search for biomarkers that could improve the prediction&#xD;
      of SCD and have the potential for risk factor modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and clinical evidence has established that inflammation plays a critical role in&#xD;
      stable coronary disease, plaque rupture, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and SCD.&#xD;
      Studies at our institution have demonstrated that elevated levels of hsCRP and Interleukin-6&#xD;
      are predictive of arrhythmic SCD; however, the mechanism of causing this increased risk is&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another well-known risk factor for SCD is abnormal sympathetic innervation. The most robust&#xD;
      clinical test of sympathetic innervation to date is Iodine-123 Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)&#xD;
      imaging with gamma scintigraphy. MIBG imaging has emerged as one of our strongest predictors&#xD;
      of SCD by detecting sympathetic nervous system abnormalities in patients with HF. Preclinical&#xD;
      and clinical evidence suggests that myocardial inflammation adversely affects myocardial&#xD;
      innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, the investigators hypothesize that elevated levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers are associated with abnormal sympathetic innervation as measured by MIBG imaging.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to establish the strength of this association. This proposal will&#xD;
      leverage unique access to the largest, most extensively phenotyped cohort of patients who&#xD;
      have undergone ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCD, the PRospective Observational&#xD;
      Study of the ICD in SCD, (PROSE-ICD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Determine if inflammation is associated with abnormal cardiac sympathetic&#xD;
      innervation in patients enrolled in the PROSE-ICD study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale/Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that patients with increased biomarkers&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation have abnormal cardiac sympathetic innervation as measured by MIBG&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the investigators will: Image 100 patients from the PROSE-ICD cohort, 50 each&#xD;
      from the highest and lowest quartiles of hsCRP levels and determine whether patients with&#xD;
      biomarker evidence of increased inflammation also have abnormal sympathetic innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will pursue the following secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if inflammation, measured by IL-6, is associated with abnormal cardiac&#xD;
           sympathetic innervation, measured by MIBG imaging, in patients enrolled in the PROSE-ICD&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the association of CRP and MIBG with ICD therapies in PROSE-ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare several MIBG imaging metrics of sympathetic innervation, in addition to the late&#xD;
           H/M ratio, including the early H/M ratio and the MIBG washout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare MIBG imaging to ECG metrics of sympathetic innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine the relationship between inflammation and regional myocardial innervation and&#xD;
           rest myocardial perfusion using quantitative and qualitative SPECT imaging.&#xD;
           Specifically, the investigators will aim to determine if inflammation is associated with&#xD;
           perfusion/innervation mismatch.&#xD;

        Patient Population - This proposal will enroll patients from the PROSE-ICD cohort who have&#xD;
        undergone ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCD. PROSE-ICD is a multicenter&#xD;
        prospective observational cohort study designed to identify risk factors for SCD in&#xD;
        high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria The entire PROSE-ICD population with ischemic and non-ischemic&#xD;
        cardiomyopathy will be divided into quartiles based on previously measured hsCRP levels in&#xD;
        the PROSE-ICD database. The study sample for this study will include 50 randomly selected&#xD;
        PROSE-ICD participants from the lowest hsCRP quartile and another 50 randomly selected&#xD;
        participants from the highest quartile. PROSE-ICD includes patients greater than 18 years&#xD;
        old who have a history of acute MI at least 4 weeks old (confirmed by persistent pathologic&#xD;
        Q waves on ECG, CPK-MB &gt; three times the upper limit of normal, or a fixed perfusion defect&#xD;
        on nuclear imaging) or non-ischemic LV dysfunction for at least 9 months who have an EF ≤&#xD;
        35% and who have undergone implantation of an FDA-approved ICD for primary prevention of&#xD;
        SCD within 2 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria Exclusion criteria for PROSE-ICD include an indication for ICD&#xD;
        implantation for secondary prevention; inability or unwillingness to provide informed&#xD;
        consent; women &lt;50 years old with anatomic child-bearing potential who are unwilling to use&#xD;
        contraceptives; NYHA class IV HF; patients with permanent pacemakers; and unsuccessful ICD&#xD;
        implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for PROSE-ICD patients enrolled in MIBG imaging will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive pregnancy test in women with child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of a medication for non-cardiac conditions that may interfere with MIBG that&#xD;
             cannot be safely withheld for five half-lives before study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Renal insufficiency (GFR &lt;30 ml/dl or creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dl) or dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hypersensitivity to iodine.&#xD;
