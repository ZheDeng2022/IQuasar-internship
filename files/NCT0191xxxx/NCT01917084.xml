      To determine if an exercise program of passive range of motion (ROM) is safe and feasible in&#xD;
      infants with single ventricle (SV) physiology after their Norwood procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an exercise&#xD;
      program in hospitalized infants with single ventricle physiology. Following the Norwood&#xD;
      procedure, the intervention will be administered for up to 21 days or until discharge,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Data will be collected daily during hospitalization and at a follow-up&#xD;
      visit at 3 months of age. Sources of data will include medical record review. Twenty subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled at three Pediatric Heart Network study sites (Utah Primary Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Texas Children's Hospital). Subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each institution and&#xD;
      parental/legal guardian consent.&#xD;
