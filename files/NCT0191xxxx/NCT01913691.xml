      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Ipilimumab is a drug used to treat melanoma that cannot be treated surgically. It targets a&#xD;
      molecule found on T-cells in the human immune system. Blocking these molecules on the T-cells&#xD;
      might allow the cells to help destroy melanoma cells more effectively. This drug has also&#xD;
      been studied in other cancers such as prostate cancer and lung cancer, but not yet in Merkel&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (MCC). Researchers think therapy like ipilimumab that enhances the immune&#xD;
      system may be effective against MCC. They want to study how safe the drug is and its effect&#xD;
      on the immune system and tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the number of subjects with MCC who take the study drug that remain alive 12&#xD;
      months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years and older who have metastatic MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive the study drug 4 times, one dose every 21 days. After the 4&#xD;
           visits, participants will receive a maintenance dose of the drug every 12 weeks until&#xD;
           the drug is no longer beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will receive the drug through a plastic tube usually inserted in a vein on the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will take 90 minutes to give each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At all visits, participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and&#xD;
           blood tests. Any tumors on their skin will be measured and photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 12 weeks during the study and maintenance period, participants will have a CT&#xD;
           scan. Throughout the study and maintenance period, they will have blood and skin tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine cancer of the skin with a&#xD;
      mortality of approximately 33%. Approximately one-third of patients present with metastatic&#xD;
      disease, for which there is no effective treatment. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), a DNA&#xD;
      virus that expresses T antigen oncoproteins, was found to be clonally integrated into the&#xD;
      genome of the majority of MCC tumors. MCC tumor progression is believed to be associated with&#xD;
      the development of immune evasion, and multiple lines of evidence (higher incidence in&#xD;
      immunocompromised populations, reports of spontaneous regression, responses to immune&#xD;
      modulators, and improved prognosis associated with CD8+ intratumoral lymphocytes) suggest&#xD;
      that immunotherapy may improve outcomes in patients with advanced MCC. Ipilimumab is a&#xD;
      recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to cytotoxic Tlymphocyte- associated&#xD;
      antigen 4 and has shown efficacy in metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine overall survival at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the best overall response rate, as assessed by modified RECIST immunerelated&#xD;
           response criteria, at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine median survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab in patients with metastatic MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess biomarkers of immune activation and MCV-specific immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients (age greater than or equal to 18 years) with metastatic MCC (AJCC stage 3b or&#xD;
           4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunocompromised individuals and patients with autoimmune disease are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will enroll at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD (primary site) or at a&#xD;
           study sub-sites Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; University of&#xD;
           Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; or University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab will be given at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 90-minute intravenous infusion on&#xD;
           day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. After 4 doses, patients may receive a&#xD;
           maintenance dose every 12 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, for&#xD;
           up to an additional 4 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging scans will be done at week 12, and every 12 weeks on study starting week 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will remain on-study for follow-up for 96 weeks after the last of the initial 4&#xD;
           doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response and progression will be evaluated using modified RECIST immune-related response&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;

             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must receive at least one line of chemotherapy and achieve partial&#xD;
             response(30% reduction in tumor burden) or better prior to enrollment. EXCEPTION:&#xD;
             Patients with asymptomatic tumors showing no or minimal progression (&lt;20% tumor&#xD;
             burden) within the last 2 months can be enrolled without prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than equal 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of ipilimumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded&#xD;
             from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Prior treatment with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients who are immunocompromised as listed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus infection, or Hepatitis B or C infection, due to the&#xD;
             unknown effects of ipilimumab on viral replication and immune function and the&#xD;
             potential for severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as daily or every other day for continued use &gt;14&#xD;
             days) of systemic corticosteroids (including steroid eye drops) or other immune&#xD;
             suppressive drugs, within 14 days of the first planned dose of ipilimumab. Nasal, or&#xD;
             inhaled steroid, and topical steroid creams for small body areas are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Splenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients with history of, or active autoimmune disease that has required treatment, such&#xD;
        as Addison's disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, Grave s disease, systemic lupus erythematous,&#xD;
        rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma and variants),&#xD;
        autoimmune vasculitis, autoimmune neuropathies (such as Guillain-Barr(SqrRoot)(Copyright)&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCEPTIONS: Patients with a history of autoimmunity that has not required systemic&#xD;
        immunosuppressive therapy or does not threaten vital organ function including CNS, heart,&#xD;
        lungs, kidneys, skin, and GI tract will not be excluded. Patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
        mellitus, or vitiligo, or endocrine deficiencies such as hypothyroidism will not be&#xD;
        excluded if the condition is well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active malignancies within the past 12 months. EXCEPTIONS: Patients with&#xD;
             adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma&#xD;
             of the cervix or bladder will not be excluded. Patients with low or intermediate-risk&#xD;
             CLL (Rai stage 0-II, Binet stage A or B) without progressive or symptomatic disease,&#xD;
             who are being monitored without therapy will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             to enrollment, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure ( (Bullet) NYHA III).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the patient's&#xD;
             respiratory tolerance to the study drug (e.g., interstitial lung disease, severe&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of serious or life-threatening intercurrent medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic or progressive (progression within the last 3 months) brain&#xD;
             metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and&#xD;
             because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI&#xD;

             perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because, based on animal studies,&#xD;
             ipilimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full&#xD;
             participation in this trial (including the long-term follow-up), or would interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of the trial endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of chemotherapy or an investigational agent within 21 days (or 60 days for an&#xD;
             antibody-based therapy) of the first planned dose of study drugs.&#xD;
