  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to develop a technique based on a single dose of a calcium isotope,&#xD;
      which enables to determine the effect of a nutritional intervention on bone calcium&#xD;
      metabolism. For this purpose nutritional interventions with calcium, vitamin D and vitamin K&#xD;
      will be applied in postmenopausal women. Treatment effects will be determined by the urinary&#xD;
      excretion of the calcium isotope and related to classical bone markers.&#xD;

      In the present proposal a method is described that may enable studying the effect of&#xD;
      nutrition on bone calcium turnover far more accurate, within a shorter time frame and&#xD;
      therefore less intensive for the volunteers in clinical studies as compared to presently&#xD;
      existing methods. This method will enable screening for promising food concepts for combating&#xD;
      osteoporosis within a relatively short time. Recent developments show that use of the nuclide&#xD;
      41Calcium (41Ca) and measurement by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) has great potential&#xD;
      in measuring effects on bone level within a relatively short period of time. When introducing&#xD;
      a diet change (intervention) the bone metabolism of calcium may change resulting in a changed&#xD;
      41Ca-signal in the urine. So far a few medication studies with osteoporotic volunteers have&#xD;
      been performed and it appears that this ultrahigh sensitive technique may also be applicable&#xD;
      for nutrition studies in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
