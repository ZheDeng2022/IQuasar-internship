  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wound infection rate in the groin after vascular surgery has been denoted to be high&#xD;
      since the wound surveillance register started in 2005. The current wound infection rate based&#xD;
      on a validation study was 22.9% (24/105 patients with groin incision(s) between 1 March to 30&#xD;
      June in 2012). This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate if negative pressure wound&#xD;
      therapy on closed inguinal incisions (INPWT) after vascular surgical procedures can reduce&#xD;
      the risk for surgical site infections and other wound complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As published in the study´s rational and design paper (DOI: 10.4236/ss.2015.612080), we&#xD;
      conducted a reanalysis of the material that the original power calculation was based on and&#xD;
      included elective cases only which led to a slightly different number of cases needed.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it became clear that there were big differences in the infection rates of EVAR&#xD;
      (endovascular aortic repair) and open vascular procedures and therefore the need to split the&#xD;
      study into two arms, an EVAR arm and an OPEN arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prove a significant effect of the treatment intervention in the EVAR arm with a wound&#xD;
      infection rate reduction from previously 4.4% to 1%, 80% power, 5% significance level and&#xD;
      Including a margin for loss to follow-up, the EVAR arm requires 497 inguinal incisions.&#xD;
      Assuming a surgical site infection rate reduction from 30% to 10% in the OPEN arm of the&#xD;
      study, 80% power and 5% significance level, a total of 147 inguinal incisions is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted an unannounced interim analysis for a conference presentation that was conducted&#xD;
      by the study's principal investigators Stefan Acosta and Julien Hasselmann. Staff in charge&#xD;
      of the day-to-day activities of the trial were not involved or actively informed of this. We&#xD;
      believe that using an objective wound assessment tool (ASEPSIS score) minimizes any potential&#xD;
      bias associated with the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the vascular center Malmö has started using closure-devices for almost all EVAR cases&#xD;
      and thereby creating virtually no wounds to assess, we have started a multi center extension&#xD;
      of the EVAR arm to Örebro University Hospital to be able to include the outstanding cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has been funded by public Swedish funds stemming from the Southmost region in&#xD;
      Sweden (Region Skåne), the Skåne University Hospital and the Hulda Almroth foundation since&#xD;
      2015 and adds up to a total of 2.81 million SEK (about 311,000 USD). In addition the research&#xD;
      group received an unrestricted unconditional research grant of 15,550 USD and a donation of&#xD;
      100 PICO dressing kits from Smith and Nephew in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALF (Agreement on medical education and research) funding has been granted for the time&#xD;
      period 2019 - 2022 but has not yet been defined monetarily.&#xD;
