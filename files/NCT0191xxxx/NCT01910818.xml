  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy, an essential modality in cancer treatment, frequently induces a fibrotic&#xD;
      process in the skin which can lead to increased risk of malignancy, poor wound healing, pain&#xD;
      and limitation of movement, and permanent loss of skin appendages with&#xD;
      hyper/hypopigmentation, decreased sweating and xerosis, posing significant cosmetic and&#xD;
      quality of life issues. Advances in laser therapy has led to the use of fractional laser&#xD;
      treatment (FLT) to treat fibrosis associated with in hypertrophic scars and morphea, leading&#xD;
      to tissue repair, scar remodeling. The investigators propose a pilot clinical study to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that FLT can normalize the fibrotic process and induce normal scar remodeling&#xD;
      in patients affected by chronic radiation injury. Understanding and correcting this&#xD;
      underlying fibrotic process can help restore normal skin functions in patients affected with&#xD;
      chronic radiation dermatitis (RD) and other debilitating fibrotic diseases in dermatology&#xD;
      such as scleroderma, morphea, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.&#xD;

      We propose to treat 22 patients with significant radiation induced fibrosis (RIF) and skin&#xD;
      changes. Each patient will receive fractional treatment (FLT) using the Lumenis Ultrapulse&#xD;
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser as well as control (no treatment) randomized to site. Patient age,&#xD;
      type of cancer, method/dosage of radiation, latency between radiation treatment and start of&#xD;
      study, and characteristics of skin changes will be recorded, including fibrosis surface area,&#xD;
      depth, color, and compliance. Assessments will be conducted before each treatment, after each&#xD;
      treatment, and 3-12 months after the last treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy males and females between 18 and 80 years of age with radiation-induced&#xD;
             fibrosis and depigmentation. The fibrosis must have occurred at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
             the date of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be closed&#xD;
             for at least two months. The scars must be deemed stable for a period of 3 months or&#xD;
             have a suitable contralateral control before initiation of treatment. This will be&#xD;
             determined by objective measurements of scar erythema, pliability, induration,&#xD;
             thickness at enrollment and again at 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI;&#xD;

         10. If it is determined that the contracture is due to a deeper process involving the&#xD;
             muscles, ligaments or bones.&#xD;
