  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the study to test combination regimen of Nilotinib and Ruxolitinib therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is resistant to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies&#xD;
      with BCR-ABL kinase inhibition activity. Ruxolitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking&#xD;
      alternative pathway independent of BCR-ABL mediated pathway, thus having a potential to&#xD;
      overcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in Philadelphia positive CML or ALL patients.&#xD;
      Phase I study will be conducted to define a recommended phase II dose (RPTD) and phase II&#xD;
      study will examine the hypothesis that combinational approach will increase response rate of&#xD;
      resistant CML/ALL patients, thus evaluating efficacy of the combination regimen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be treated with&#xD;
      combination approach of Nilotinib with Ruxolitinib which may block alternative pathway&#xD;
      besides BCR-ABL kinase inhibition in Ph positive leukemia, esp against JAK2-STAT5 pathway.&#xD;
      First step is to define the dose of Ruxolitinib with fixed dose of Nilotinib which had been&#xD;
      approved at the dose of 400mg bid for imatinib failed CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase I part of the study,dose escalations will be decided on the basis of DLTs&#xD;
      observed hence the exact sample size could not be predicted with certainty but will range&#xD;
      between 9-12 patients. Three patients will be enrolled per dose level. Accordingly 9 patients&#xD;
      are expected to be enrolled. If a DLT is observed, 3 more patients will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      dose level in which the DLT occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at multiple sites across Canada and enrollment will be&#xD;
      competitive. Once 3 patients are enrolled in a cohort, that dose level will be closed to&#xD;
      enrollment until safety assessment of the 3 subjects is performed at the end of cycle 1. This&#xD;
      procedure will be performed for each dosing cohort. Patients will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      based on authorization from the sponsor in collaboration with Ozmosis Research Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the phase II part of the study, once the RPTD has been established in the phase I portion&#xD;
      of this trial, the phase II will begin. The phase II portion will be a two-stage, single arm,&#xD;
      unblinded study investigating the potential efficacy of the combination of Ruxolitinib and&#xD;
      Nilotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued in the phase II portion. Those patients treated in&#xD;
      the phase I portion of this trial at the RPTD will be included in the analysis of the Phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
