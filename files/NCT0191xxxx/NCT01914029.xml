      The purpose of the study is to add to the knowledge of mechanisms of immune health.&#xD;
      Parameters of the immune system will be followed over time in volunteers allergic to dust&#xD;
      mites and bee sting after receiving immunization therapy. This information will be compared&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers without allergy. We aim to bring new understanding of immune processes&#xD;
      by this comparison.&#xD;

      The process of immunization as a treatment for allergic disease brings about changes that are&#xD;
      not all well understood and the understanding about them is developing constantly. In our&#xD;
      study we plan to check a large number of immunological parameters to broaden the scope of&#xD;
      knowledge of evaluating individuals for immune health across multiple sub fields of medicine&#xD;
      and for advancing a basic understanding of immune cell signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 70 participants between ages 18-45 of both sexes. Persons enrolled to&#xD;
      the study will have been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis caused by dust mite or persons who&#xD;
      developed a systemic reaction following bee sting who are candidates to be treated by&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verification of diagnosis of allergic condition and decision to start immunizations,&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn from participants before immunization weekly for 24 weeks. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed in order to identify immune cell subset differences that change in&#xD;
      response to allergy immunotherapy. Comparisons will be made of baseline and&#xD;
      stimulation-induced status of protein phosphorylation individuals over the time-series course&#xD;
      in which they receive allergy immunotherapy to pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      desensitization. Evaluations will be made of cellular mechanisms of allergy immunotherapy by&#xD;
      comparing over time and between groups, through serum cytokine profiling and blood gene&#xD;
      expression of individuals undergoing allergy immunotherapy shots.&#xD;
