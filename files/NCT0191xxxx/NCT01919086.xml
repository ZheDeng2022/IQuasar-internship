  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if researchers could get the same good results with less&#xD;
      toxicity by using this new approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We already know that the three drugs bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone given&#xD;
      together at the same time are effective. Most physicians therefore treat patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma with the 3 drug combination. However, the researchers also know that the&#xD;
      three drugs given together result in more side effects than when only 2 drugs (bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone) are given. The researchers believe that all&#xD;
      patients may not necessarily need the three drugs to have good results. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers will first treat your disease with bortezomib and dexamethasone. If the disease&#xD;
      is not well controlled with these 2 drugs, only then the third drug, lenalidomide, will be&#xD;
      added. By using this sequential approach we may reach the same good results with fewer side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
