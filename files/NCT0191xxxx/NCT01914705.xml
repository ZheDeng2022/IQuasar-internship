      The objective of the study is to investigate whether or not there will be a significant&#xD;
      difference between landmark vs. ultrasound guided approach during Subclavian Central Venous&#xD;
      Catheter (SCVC) placement in terms of the success rate, the time it takes to perform the&#xD;
      procedure and the complication rate. By using ultrasound to identify anatomical structures&#xD;
      that are not seen during the landmark approach, the investigators hypothesize that both the&#xD;
      procedural time and the complication rate of ultrasound guided approach should be lower than&#xD;
      the landmark approach. The investigators hypothesize that the success rate will be higher in&#xD;
      the ultrasound group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) is a common critical care procedure performed by&#xD;
      emergency physicians in the Emergency Department (ED.) Numerous studies have shown that&#xD;
      physicians are able to reduce the time required, the complication rates, and the number of&#xD;
      attempts, and to increase the overall success of CVC placement with the use of ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. Thus, ultrasound guided CVC placement is being increasingly utilized in the ED. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a study to investigate the utility of ultrasound guidance for placement&#xD;
      of subclavian CVC (SCVC) in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are numerous studies, including prospective randomized trials, comparing&#xD;
      landmark and ultrasound guided placements of Internal Jugular(IJ) and Femoral CVC, both in&#xD;
      the ED and in the ICU settings. However, there has not yet been a prospective randomized&#xD;
      trial that has similarly looked at SCVC placement in the ED setting. There are a few studies&#xD;
      looking at ultrasound guided SCVC placement performed in critical care settings, but these&#xD;
      trials had methodological limitations. Recently, a large (401 patients), randomized,&#xD;
      prospective study from an ICU in Greece was published in which the landmark approach was&#xD;
      compared to ultrasound guided SCVC placement. The authors found that ultrasound guided SCVC&#xD;
      was superior to the landmark approach in success rate, time to cannulation, and complication&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to conduct a similar prospective randomized study in the ED, in&#xD;
      which the investigators compare the success rate, the procedural times and the complication&#xD;
      rates between landmark and real-time ultrasound guided approaches to SCVC placement. In&#xD;
      contrast to the recent Greek study, this study will involve a different patient population.&#xD;
      The Greek study only looked at ventilated ICU patients, and this study will look at adult&#xD;
      patients in the ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an independent clinical decision has been reached to place an SCVC by the ED attending&#xD;
      physician, the study investigators will be contacted to enroll the patient. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either landmark or ultrasound guided SCVC placement. In the&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance group, a two person technique will be utilized in which the ultrasound&#xD;
      machine will be operated by one of the investigating physicians, and the catheter will be&#xD;
      placed by the ED physician caring for the patient. The investigators will employ real time&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance using both the transverse and longitudinal views to help direct the&#xD;
      needle to the vein. Once the vascular structures are identified on ultrasound by the&#xD;
      investigating physician, the physician placing the SCVC will be directed to puncture the skin&#xD;
      at the optimal location as determined by the investigating physician. Ultrasound will be used&#xD;
      throughout the entire procedure to cannulate the underlying vein. In the landmark group, the&#xD;
      SCVC will be placed using anatomic landmarks to locate the puncture site by the physicians&#xD;
      working clinically in the ED. The Seldinger technique used for SCVC placement is the same for&#xD;
      both the landmark and ultrasound guided approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a stopwatch, the investigating physician will document a &quot;Begin Time&quot; just after the&#xD;
      patient and the equipment have been prepped under full sterile precautions. In both groups,&#xD;
      the timer would start at the same point in time - - when the needle is ready to puncture the&#xD;
      skin. Complications will also be noted by the investigating physician during and after the&#xD;
      SCVC placement, including number of puncture attempts, success/failure of blood return from&#xD;
      the SCVC ports, occurrence of catheter tip misplacement, arterial puncture, and incidence of&#xD;
      hematoma, hemothorax, or pneumothorax. As per routine protocol, a post-procedure chest x-ray&#xD;
      will be obtained and will be reviewed for evidence of complications. The final Radiology&#xD;
      Attending interpretation of the chest xray will also be recorded.&#xD;
