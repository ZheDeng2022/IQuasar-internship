    <textblock>
      Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare disease that affects 1 in 3500 newborn. This&#xD;
      condition is detected consistently since the late 1970s in France, which has led to early&#xD;
      care and a significant improvement in prognosis and intellectual stature of these children.&#xD;
      However neurodevelopmental disorders persist in 10-15% of cases. More associated diseases&#xD;
      have been reported in approximately 10% of cases. These observations are in most cases poorly&#xD;
      understood. The family nature of the CH is now well recognized and a dozen genes involved up&#xD;
      to now. However, in the majority of cases (HC not due to a disorder of the organification of&#xD;
      iodine), few mutations have been found in the reported number of patients (5-10%), suggesting&#xD;
      the involvement of other genes. Some of the genes have been implicated in particular specific&#xD;
      syndromic forms but many pathological associations remain unexplained. Also, a more complete&#xD;
      genetic elucidation of CH would enable a better understanding of its etiology and thus its&#xD;
      risk of familial recurrence (frequently asked questions by parents of children with CH) and&#xD;
      secondly the presence of associated pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goal: to describe the population with CH (not due to a disorder of the organification of&#xD;
      iodine) not only on clinical, biological and radiological (phenotypic analysis) but also on&#xD;
      the genetic level to establish a genotype / phenotype correlation.&#xD;

      Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare disease that affects 1 in 3500 newborn. This&#xD;
      condition is detected consistently since the late 1970s in France, which has enabled early&#xD;
      care and a significant improvement of the intellectual stature and prognosis of these&#xD;
      children. However neurodevelopmental disorders persist in 10-15% of cases. More associated&#xD;
      pathologies have been reported in nearly 10% of cases. These observations are in most cases&#xD;
      poorly understood. The family nature of the HC is now well accepted and a dozen genes is now&#xD;
      involved. However in the majority of cases (HC not due to a disorder of the organification of&#xD;
      iodine), few mutations have been found relative to the number of patients (5-10%), suggesting&#xD;
      the involvement of other genes. Some of the genes have been implicated in such specific&#xD;
      syndromic forms but many pathological associations remain unexplained. Also, a more complete&#xD;
      elucidation of genetic HC enable a better understanding of its etiology and thus share the&#xD;
      risk of familial recurrence (frequently asked by parents of children with questions) and&#xD;
      secondly the presence of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To describe the population with HC (not due to a disorder of the&#xD;
      organification of iodine) not only on clinical, biological and radiological (phenotypic&#xD;
      analysis) but also at the genetic level to establish a genotype / phenotype correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. study the frequency of malformations and / or pathological associations in patients with&#xD;
           HC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify groups of patients with syndromic forms in whom early treatment may improve the&#xD;
           prognosis of children&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to search for mutations in genes known to be involved in the pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to search for new loci and / or genes involved&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to determine the optimal genetic strategy to adopt before a HC case.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      If treatment with L-thyroxine has been stopped without relapse (that is to say, always with a&#xD;
      TSH &lt;5 mU / ml with different controls), hypothyroidism is called transient, whatever the age&#xD;
      of discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No earlier or neonatal goitre by palpation or ultrasound examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  negative perchlorate test (ie rate of iodine salting &lt;10% at 2 hours from the injection&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of foreign origin returned to their country will be excluded from the study, even&#xD;
      those who are lost to follow or refuse to perform additional tests requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acts / medical examinations carried out in taking care of but usually within the scope&#xD;
           of the search if not done in the care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound thyroid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid scintigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data on thyroid function: minimum values of FT3, FT4 and TSH plasma last blood test and&#xD;
           current treatment (dose of L-T4)&#xD;

           for all patients (10 ml EDTA blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Search for new genes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. cases of consanguineous families, a genome-wide study will be looking for&#xD;
                homozygous regions shared by affected members (or homozygosity mapping autozygotie&#xD;
                mapping).&#xD;
&#xD;
                (in related first degree blood sample of 10 mL EDTA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. for patients with one or more diseases associated with HC, seeking a number&#xD;
                variation (CNV) of a gene or locus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If abnormality found in the patient, blood samples of two parents 10 ml EDTA search CNV&#xD;
      variation to exclude inherited CNVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      350 patients with HC followed by endocrinologists and / or French pediatricians. Note that a&#xD;
      majority of patients has been identified in the database of more than 10 years in the INSERM&#xD;
      U845 (Necker Hospital, Paris).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned duration of the test: 42 month Time inclusions: 18 months Duration of follow-up: 2&#xD;
      years The patient may be contacted with the agreement at any time to perform additional tests&#xD;
      required and / or a new blood sample for further genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multinational cross-sectional study In a first period, it will accurately describe patients&#xD;
      phenotypically and in a 2nd period, find a genetic cause. This will be facilitated by the&#xD;
      presence of DNA already collected for the majority of them in one national bank in France,&#xD;
      established in laboratory research center U845 (biocollection DC-2008-596, Faculty Necker,&#xD;
      Paris)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiological type of congenital hypothyroidism: athyrose, ectopia, hemiagnÃ©sie,&#xD;
           hypoplastic gland in place of normal shape and size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence and type of cytogenetic abnormalities and / or genetically presence and type of&#xD;
           pathology associated with HC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of neuropsychological abnormalities (including delayed psychomotor development)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be considered in this chapter all the elements that can cause psychomotor retardation&#xD;
      (3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time management of hypothyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of the treatment of hypothyroidism: delay normalization of TSH and T4,&#xD;
           number of TSH&gt; 15 mU / ml during follow-up, adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of an earlier complication and / or neonatal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will include the following main chapters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the population (anamnestic data, clinical, hormonal status at diagnosis&#xD;
           and at follow-up imaging data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the determinants of psychomotor development (see criteria secondary&#xD;
           outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the genetic study (type of mutated gene and nature of the mutation or genetic&#xD;
           location of a deletion or duplication) An analysis of the observed association between&#xD;
           mutations and phenotypes of patients will be performed by the methods of comparison&#xD;
           genotype frequencies in different groups of subjects (chi-square test or Pearson 2 if&#xD;
           necessary by the Fisher exact test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hazard ratios associated with the risk of occurrence of each event will be estimated with&#xD;
      confidence intervals at 95%. Comparisons of events between different mutations will be tested&#xD;
      using the log-rank test. All tests will be bilateral and a value of p &lt;0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 42 month, the study will identify the responsible genes in a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients with congenital hypothyroidism (excluding disorders organification of iodine), to&#xD;
      establish a genotype-phenotype correlation and propose early genetic screening (through&#xD;
      systematic newborn screening) to patients and their families. The study of the frequency of&#xD;
      associated diseases and genetic elucidation will also provide recommendations for early&#xD;
      treatment (possibly &quot;preventive&quot;) from other later predictable and potentially negative&#xD;
      repercussions associated with hypothyroidism&#xD;
