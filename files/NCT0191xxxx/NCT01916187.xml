  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of imetelstat when given alone for&#xD;
      patients with neuroblastoma and also when given in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because imetelstat has been shown to slow the growth of tumours&#xD;
      in animals and may also be doing so in adults, but we are not sure if it can also slow tumour&#xD;
      growth in children and offer better results than standard treatment. Laboratory studies&#xD;
      suggest imetelstat may increase the activity of 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is used to treat&#xD;
      neuroblastoma, although this is not yet proven in patients.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological verification of neuroblastoma at either original diagnosis or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma with either measurable or&#xD;
             evaluable disease (defined by a positive nuclear scan such as bone scan or&#xD;
             metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan). If a lesion is isolated and /or previously&#xD;
             irradiated and stable, a proven positive biopsy will be required to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current disease state must be one for which there is no known curative therapy or&#xD;
             therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have recovered from the acute effects of prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or&#xD;
             radiotherapy prior to study entry as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 3 weeks from completion of last active cancer therapy and recovered from&#xD;
                  toxic effects of that therapy to ≤ grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks post hematopoietic stem cell rescue following myeloablative&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 3 months must have elapsed if prior total body irradiation, craniospinal&#xD;
                  XRT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks from prior MIBG therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 months and ≤18 years at the time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients ≤10 years: Lansky ≥50 Patients &gt;10 years: Karnofsky ≥60% - Laboratory&#xD;
        Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate Bone Marrow Function, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L (transfusion independent defined as not receiving platelet&#xD;
             transfusions within 7 days prior to registration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥80 g/L (may receive RBC transfusions) Patients with known bone marrow&#xD;
             metastatic disease will be eligible for the study and may receive transfusions,&#xD;
             provided ≤25% of bone marrow is involved, and provided they are not known to be&#xD;
             refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible as long as blood count criteria are met. If patients then&#xD;
        experience prolonged myelosuppression, bone marrow examination can be requested to&#xD;
        determine if the low blood counts are due to malignant infiltration of the marrow or to&#xD;
        therapy induced hypoplasia/aplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate Renal And Cardiac Function, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal for age or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measured GFR ≥70 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST and ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit normal for age&#xD;

&#xD;
        • PTT &lt;1.2 x upper limit normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or guardian consent must be obtained on all patients according to local&#xD;
             Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirements. Children&#xD;
             &gt; 8 years old whose parent or guardian has signed consent on their behalf may also&#xD;
             sign assent if desired. It will be the responsibility of the local participating&#xD;
             investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to indicate in writing to&#xD;
             the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has been obtained, before the trial&#xD;
             can commence in that centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: two hour's driving distance)&#xD;
             placed on patients being considered for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt;25% bone marrow involvement will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to take oral medication and have no gastrointestinal&#xD;
             abnormalities (e.g. bowel obstruction or previous gastric resection) which would lead&#xD;
             to inadequate absorption of 13-cisretinoic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imetelstat animal and in vitro studies suggest it is not genotoxic or teratogenic.&#xD;
             However, 13-cis-retinoic acid is known to be teratogenic. Pregnancy tests must be&#xD;
             obtained in girls who are post menarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential&#xD;
             may not participate unless they have agreed to use two reliable contraceptive methods.&#xD;
             Pregnant or breast-feeding females will not be entered on this study due to the&#xD;
             potential fetal and teratogenic adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients receiving other investigational agents will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient receiving other anti-cancer agents will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with CNS metastasis will need to submit to a baseline MRI obtained&#xD;
                  within 21 days prior to registration. Patients with evidence of current or prior&#xD;
                  CNS hemorrhage will be excluded. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
                  may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study&#xD;
                  will not be enrolled.&#xD;
