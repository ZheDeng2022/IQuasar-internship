  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive bacterial infection is a dangerous but relatively uncommon disease where bacteria&#xD;
      spread deep into the body causing diseases like blood poisoning ('bacteraemia'), pneumonia,&#xD;
      meningitis and others. The various bacteria of the streptococcus family are an important&#xD;
      cause, often leading patients to require intensive care despite which, for some strains, one&#xD;
      in five patients die. One notable form is called necrotising fasciitis, a condition where&#xD;
      bacteria rapidly spreads through and destroys the layers of tissue just under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As individuals vary greatly in their risk of developing such serious infections,&#xD;
      investigating how the genome, the inherited blueprint of our bodies, of these patients&#xD;
      differs from that of healthy volunteers can help to explain why the disease develops in some&#xD;
      and not others. For some streptococcal bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae this&#xD;
      approach is already proving successful; for others such as the &quot;Group A&quot; strain&#xD;
      (Streptococcus pyogenes) it has yet to be explored but carries excellent potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have secured the support of the Lee Spark Necrotising Fasciitis Foundation&#xD;
      to recruit from their membership survivors of streptococcal infections and some of their&#xD;
      family members. The investigators will also ask infection specialists from NHS hospitals to&#xD;
      invite patients they have looked after. The investigators also have a small existing&#xD;
      collection. Taking part would involve registering information on a website, discussing the&#xD;
      study on the telephone and then providing us with a sample of saliva from which the&#xD;
      investigators can isolate DNA. The investigators would prepare the sample for analysis of the&#xD;
      genome and compare the patients with both their family and an existing reference collection&#xD;
      from healthy volunteers using technology that reads the DNA code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be a first key step in renewing efforts to understand the determinants of&#xD;
      invasive streptococcal infection, which is important for developing better treatments and&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;

    <description>This is an observational study comparing genetic data from cases (inclusion criteria 1) vs unaffected family members (inclusion criteria 2-4) and publically available genetic data from health volunteers in existing reference databases (e.g. UK10K - http://www.uk10k.org/). The case's illness (as defined in inclusion criteria 1) may have occurred anytime between 1st January 1980 and enrolment. The outcome is measured by genetic testing using a sample collected on enrolment. There is no follow-up period.</description>

      Primarily we will collect saliva from which DNA will be isolated. Secondly, from a subset of&#xD;
      individuals, we will request follow-up blood samples from which we will extract RNA and&#xD;

        Participants will be identified through an invitation sent to the Lee Spark Necrotising&#xD;
        Fasciitis Foundation and by infection specialists at NHS hospitals who will invite patients&#xD;
        whose care they have been directly involved in. In addition, a small collection of existing&#xD;
        samples held at Imperial College London will be used.&#xD;

        Participants for the genetics study are divided into cases/survivors and family members&#xD;
        (relatives and parents).&#xD;
&#xD;
        To participate as a survivor, the individual must meet criteria 1A. Their illness can have&#xD;
        occurred anytime from birth up until enrolment, providing it happened after 1st January&#xD;
        1980. Family members can only take part if invited to do so by the survivor from their&#xD;
        family at the request of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In families in which two or more survivors are identified, all the remaining first- and&#xD;
        second-degree relatives of the survivors will be eligible to participate. The recruitment&#xD;
        team subdivide those relatives on enrolment into healthy (Criteria 2) or intermediate&#xD;
        (Criteria 3) phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In families in which there is only a single survivor, the recruitment team will assess&#xD;
        whether the survivor meets criteria 1B. If so the parents of that survivor are eligible to&#xD;
        participate if they have a healthy phenotype (Criteria 4).&#xD;
