      The purpose of this 5-year interventional study is to design, implement, and evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an intervention aimed at facilitating prognosis communication and&#xD;
      end-of-life care decision-making to increase the extent of congruence between the patient's&#xD;
      preferred and actual EOL care received and patients' and family caregivers' QOL and&#xD;
      psychological well-being, reduce futile aggressive healthcare resources utilization at&#xD;
      end-of-life, and facilitate bereavement adjustment.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled trial with a tailored, multifaceted intervention will be conducted on&#xD;
      a convenience sample of 231 dyads of terminally ill cancer patients and caregivers with the&#xD;
      same number of attention controlled group to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: There was no interventional study directly investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness in increasing the extent of congruence between patient preferred and actual&#xD;
      end-of-life (EOL) care received by terminally ill cancer patients; therefore sample size&#xD;
      estimation will be based on the effectiveness of holding EOL care discussions between&#xD;
      patients and physicians on the extent to increase congruence between the patient's preferred&#xD;
      and actual EOL care received. Patients who reported having EOL care discussions with their&#xD;
      physicians significantly more likely to receive EOL care consistent to their preferences&#xD;
      (OR=2.26; p&lt;.0001) and received significantly fewer aggressive medical interventions near&#xD;
      death, with lower rates of CPR (0.8% vs 6.7%; AOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.80), mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation support (1.6% vs 11.0%; AOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.83), and ICU care (4.1% vs&#xD;
      12.4%; AOR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.90), respectively. A sample size of 124-195 dyads per group&#xD;
      achieves 80% power to detect a difference between the interventional and control group by a&#xD;
      two-sided hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05. In compensating the 18.5% of&#xD;
      attrition rate found in our previous longitudinal study, 147-231 dyads per group are needed.&#xD;
      The proposed sample size will be targeted on 231 dyads per group to ensure adequate power to&#xD;
      detect the hypothesized effects of the proposed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8-10 new dyads of terminally ill cancer patients and their family caregivers&#xD;
      were recruited in each month. In order to recruit the targeted 462 dyads (231 dyads in each&#xD;
      treatment group) of subjects, after development of detailed study protocol, subjects will&#xD;
      start to enter into the study at the beginning of the 6th month of the study through the 54&#xD;
      th month and be followed through the 5th year of the proposed study period. We will enroll&#xD;
      and randomly assign eligible dyads of terminally ill cancer patients and their family&#xD;
      caregivers into intervention or attention controlled group in a 1:1 fashion without&#xD;
      stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures: Assessments will be performed prospectively and continue until&#xD;
      patient death, loss to follow-up, study withdrawal, or when the patient can no longer be&#xD;
      interviewed. An every-3-week time frame will be used in this study for repeated QOL and other&#xD;
      outcomes assessments for both patients and their family caregivers bases on the review of&#xD;
      literature to cover the most rapid change of patient physical conditions and demanding period&#xD;
      of caregiving until the death of the patient. After each patient's death, a chart review and&#xD;
      postmortem interview with patients' caregivers will be performed to confirm the type of&#xD;
      medical care received at the EOL. Bereavement interviews will be conducted 1, 3, 6 and 13&#xD;
      months after the time of death in order to avoid contamination on the basis of anniversary&#xD;
      grief reactions.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strategies will be taken to ensure research fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proposed intervention requires professionals skilled in the content, techniques, and&#xD;
           delivery of the intervention. Built on her previous oncology and hospice care&#xD;
           experiences, a competency-based educational approach will be used to train the&#xD;
           facilitator. The training will include an overview of the study protocol and procedures,&#xD;
           a review of the developed workbook and video, and instructions in motivational&#xD;
           assessments. The principal investigator (PI) will serve as a role model for the&#xD;
           facilitator to coach her how to assess and motivate participants at different stage of&#xD;
           the readiness for engagement in ACP and cooperate with physicians in coordinating and&#xD;
           facilitating EOL care discussions. The facilitator needs to successfully demonstrate&#xD;
           predefined competencies and consistency to delivery of the ACP intervention after&#xD;
           training and receipt of individual feedback from the PI before formal interventions can&#xD;
           be conducted. Thereafter the study team will meet biweekly to review the facilitator's&#xD;
           notes on interventional sessions and to provide feedback on difficult subject management&#xD;
           issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interventions provided to subjects assigned to the intervention group will be compared&#xD;
           with those received by those who assigned to the control group every 3 months. Randomly&#xD;
           selected dyads of terminally ill cancer patients and their family caregivers in each&#xD;
           treatment group will be interviewed by the PI to check the extent to which treatments&#xD;
           provided to them consistent with the protocol for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To avoid bias, separate data collectors will be hired and trained for the study to&#xD;
           collect data for the intervention and the control group independently. Training will&#xD;
           include screening subjects, obtaining consents, and administering the project&#xD;
           instruments without offering information; research assistants (RAs) will be blinded to&#xD;
           treatment conditions. Procedures will be implemented to insure the standardization of&#xD;
           data collection. RAs reliability will be established by comparing data collected by the&#xD;
           RAs with that recorded by the PI on five pilot cases. Ninety-five percent agreements&#xD;
           will be required before data collection for main study can begin. Failure to reach this&#xD;
           agreement rate will require additional training until the acceptable reliability level&#xD;
           is reached. Intermittent reliability checks will be carried out by the PI throughout the&#xD;
           study to maintain a 95% agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be organized to ensure&#xD;
           continuing patient safety as well as the validity and scientific merits of the trial.&#xD;
           The DSMB will constitute a biostatistician experienced in statistical methods for&#xD;
           clinical trials, a nursing researcher experienced in conducting RCTs, and a&#xD;
           physician-scientist experienced in cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will monitor and address the following issues: (1) sufficient and appropriate&#xD;
      enrollment of subjects, including compliance with the eligibility criteria for each dyad of&#xD;
      terminally ill cancer patients and family caregivers enrolled in the trial, (2) appropriate&#xD;
      implementation of randomization, (3) comparability of baseline data between treatment groups,&#xD;
      (4) protocol compliance, including treatments delivered to each treatment group and the data&#xD;
      collection schemes,(5) adverse events (AEs), quality assurance for data validation and&#xD;
      registry procedures for Clinical Trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A databet that records number of recruitment each month and the baseline information will be&#xD;
      maintained to ensure sufficient and appropriate enrollment of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dataset that captures the values the personnel used to randomize participants will be&#xD;
      maintained, thereby allowing the process of treatment allocation to be reproduced and&#xD;
      verified later. The DSMB will monitor the appropriate implementation of randomization by&#xD;
      reviewing this dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions delivered to subjects assigned to the intervention and the attention-controlled&#xD;
      group will be compared every 6 months by interviewing randomly selected dyads of terminally&#xD;
      ill cancer patients and their family caregivers in each treatment group to check treatments&#xD;
      provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs will be recorded and submitted by the study team in written to the DSMB monthly, with&#xD;
      immediate reporting of serious AEs to the DSMB and an oncologist with expertise in cancer&#xD;
      care. Site reports AEs/SAEs to its IRB will be dictated by local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data will be analyzed before the study ended. Access to interim results, including results&#xD;
      according to study arm will be limited to the DSMB members and the statistician who prepared&#xD;
      the reports only. The DSMB will review study data every 6 months and the DSMB' summary&#xD;
      recommendations will be directed to the PI. A summary of the review of reported AEs/SAEs will&#xD;
      be sent to the local IRB to ensure that the participating center will be informed of any&#xD;
      pertinent safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biostatistician will be responsible for ensuring quality of data submitted to the&#xD;
      registry against the predefined range of each independent and dependent variable and&#xD;
      assessing the accuracy and completeness of registry data by comparing the submitted data to&#xD;
      the original data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All data will be scored and entered into a computer spreadsheet by an administrative&#xD;
           assistant blinded to the group allocation of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In order to test for baseline group equivalence, differences between study groups in&#xD;
           baseline characteristics and identified outcomes will be assessed with the use of&#xD;
           two-sided Fisher's exact tests and chi-square tests for categorical variables and&#xD;
           independent-samples Student's t-tests for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intention-to-treat regression analyses will be performed with generalized estimating&#xD;
           equations (GEE) to examine the effectiveness of intervention. In the intention- to-treat&#xD;
           regression analyses, all participants will be analysed in the treatment group to which&#xD;
           they are initially allocated regardless of whether they complete or withdraw from the&#xD;
           treatment until the patient dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The extend of congruence of the terminally ill cancer patients' preferred and actual EOL&#xD;
           care received will be obtained by comparing the agreement between the preferences of EOL&#xD;
           care elicited at the last assessment and actual EOL care received by the patient by the&#xD;
           percentage of overall agreement and kappa coefficients to assess the extent of&#xD;
           congruence to correct for the amount of agreement that can be expected to occur by&#xD;
           chance alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Multivariate logistic regression by the GEE will be used to examine the impact of&#xD;
           intervention on improving the extend of congruence between terminally ill cancer&#xD;
           patients' preferred and actual EOL care received, and secondary outcomes, namely&#xD;
           increasing prognosis awareness, EOL care discussion, and the extent of patient-family&#xD;
           agreement on preferences of EOL care, decreasing use of futile aggressive EOL care, and&#xD;
           facilitating hospice use and early hospice referral, with simultaneously adjusting for&#xD;
           confounding factors. The moderation effects of prognosis awareness, EOL care discussion,&#xD;
           and patient-family agreement on preferences of EOL care on extend of congruence between&#xD;
           terminally ill cancer patients' preferred and actual EOL care received, decreasing use&#xD;
           of futile aggressive EOL care, and facilitating hospice use and early hospice referral&#xD;
           between interventional group and the attention controlled group also will be examined in&#xD;
           the GEE model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Multivariate multiple regression by the GEE will be used to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intervention in improving patients' and family caregivers' QOL and psychological well-being&#xD;
      (anxiety and depression), and family bereavement outcomes (including QOL, depression, and&#xD;
      grief reactions), with simultaneously adjusting for confounding factors. The moderation&#xD;
      effects of prognosis awareness, EOL care discussion, and patient-family agreement on&#xD;
      preferences of EOL care on the differences in patients' and family caregivers' QOL and&#xD;
      psychological well-being before the patient's death, and family bereavement outcomes between&#xD;
      intervention group and the attention controlled group also will be examined in the GEE model.&#xD;
      How limiting futile aggressive EOL care and the extent of congruence between terminally ill&#xD;
      cancer patients' preferred and actual EOL care received will moderate the intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness on improving patients' and family caregivers' QOL and psychological well-being&#xD;
      before the patient's death and family bereavement outcomes also will be examined in the GEE&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
