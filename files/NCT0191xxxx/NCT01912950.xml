    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, open-label pilot study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of a novel intense pulsed light (IPL) device for removal of unwanted fine body&#xD;
      hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a designated treatment area on one forearm divided into four equal-size&#xD;
      quadrants. One quadrant will serve as the un-treated control area and the other 3 quadrants&#xD;
      will be treated with the Cutera Prowave LX IPL. Subjects will receive 3 IPL treatments,&#xD;
      spaced 8 weeks apart, on the designated area and will be followed at 12-weeks post-final&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
