      The purpose of the study is to show that the standardized sending of SMS improve the bone&#xD;
      mineral density (BMD) screening of patients seen in the Emergency department for low trauma&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a significant health problem in the older population affecting at least 40%&#xD;
      of women and 15 % of men over the age of 50 years. Fracture leads to increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and healthcare costs as well as predisposing to future fractures. Patients with a&#xD;
      history of low-energy fracture are at significantly increased risk for further fractures in&#xD;
      the short-term. There is a universal consensus supported by high-quality randomized trial&#xD;
      evidence for secondary prevention: patients with low-trauma fragility fractures should have&#xD;
      BMD testing and most of them would benefit from anti-osteoporotic treatment There is,&#xD;
      unfortunately, also a well-documented and near-universal gap between evidence-based best&#xD;
      practice and usual care for patients with fragility fractures. Although osteoporotic fracture&#xD;
      indicates a two- to threefold increased risk of future fracture, only one in five patients&#xD;
      receive medical intervention after sustaining an osteoporotic fracture. Diverse post fracture&#xD;
      interventions have been developed for improving osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment:&#xD;
      provided educational materials to patients and/or primary physician, use of medical&#xD;
      reminders, more intensive interventions using osteoporosis case manager (nurse, doctor) and&#xD;
      fracture liaison service. the most effective post fracture interventions are those which are&#xD;
      more proactive, complex, time consuming, coordinator manager dependant, and costly. Taking&#xD;
      account the costs and the humans resources needing, we propose to improve post fracture&#xD;
      patient management using mobile telecommunication already used for other chronic diseases&#xD;
      management. There is no study about the use of phone short message service (SMS) support in&#xD;
      the field of osteoporosis, especially in the post-fracture management: bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) screening, anti-osteoporotic treatment initiation and monitoring and improvement of&#xD;
      adherence. One of the limitations could be the use of phone mobile in these older patients.&#xD;
      We assessed the number of mobile phone users among 100 consecutive subjects who were&#xD;
      hospitalized for non vertebral fracture (mean age 69.5 years (50-98); 58 women and 42 men) in&#xD;
      the Emergency department of Cochin hospital: 61 % had a mobile phone and used SMS; 61% have a&#xD;
      mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to assess the efficacy of the use of SMS support to improve the screening and the&#xD;
      initiation of antiosteoporotic treatment in patients with low trauma non vertebral fracture,&#xD;
      who consult in Emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of current care, monocentric, randomized, open. 170 patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 6 months. The group control will receive the usual recommendations to make an appointment&#xD;
      of realization of bone densitometry. The SMS group will receive 3 SMS (at 15 days, 5 weeks&#xD;
      and 3 months) after consulting the time of consultation in Emergency department, and will be&#xD;
      called during 10 minutes at 6 months by a nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will have an important impact for the postfracture management in&#xD;
      the field of osteoporosis . Indeed, if we demonstrate that the use of SMS improves the BMD&#xD;
      screening and antiosteoporotic treatment initiation, we plan to assess in a large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial whether mobile phone communication can decrease the risk of new fracture&#xD;
      comparatively to usual care in patients with low trauma fracture could use.&#xD;
