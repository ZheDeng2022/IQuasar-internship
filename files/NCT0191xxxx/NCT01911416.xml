  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is considered a rare form of cancer with about 277,000 new cases diagnosed&#xD;
      in 2008 world-wide, which is about 2.5% of all forms of cancer. However, pancreatic cancer is&#xD;
      more common in developed countries where the rate of this tumor is on the rise compared to&#xD;
      other types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDE225 is a new medicine that blocks a cellular pathway (called Hedgehog pathway) that is&#xD;
      thought to be changed in some patients with pancreatic cancer. LDE225 is a medicine which has&#xD;
      not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with your medical condition. The&#xD;
      medicine being tested in this study is currently not &quot;on the market&quot; (available to buy) in&#xD;
      any country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see the effect LDE225 has on blood and tumors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or borderline resectable&#xD;
             disease that after neoadjuvant treatment are considered appropriate candidates for&#xD;
             resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG or Performance Status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, as specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 80 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN(upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasma creatine phosphokinase (CK) &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour clearance ≥ 50ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any study specific screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with their&#xD;
             participation in the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to take oral drugs or with lack of physical integrity of the upper&#xD;
             gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with systemic LDE225 or with other Hh&#xD;
             pathway inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a) Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular&#xD;
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on&#xD;
             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as&#xD;

             used with extra caution. b) Patients who are planning on embarking on a new strenuous&#xD;
             exercise regimen after initiation of study treatment. NB: Muscular activities, such as&#xD;
             strenuous exercise, that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels&#xD;
             should be avoided whilst on LDE225 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             initiating treatment with LDE225.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment&#xD;
             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at&#xD;
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             treatment with LDE225.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;

             sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control&#xD;
             methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a&#xD;
             hormonal method. Adequate barrier methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Diaphragm, condom (by the partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge&#xD;
             or spermicide. Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that&#xD;
             includes an estrogen and/or a progestational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 3 months&#xD;
             after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
