      Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) are the most commonly used hormonal form of birth&#xD;
      control in the United States with at least 87% of women of reproductive age reporting oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use at some point in their lives (9). Despite their frequent use, the six and&#xD;
      twelve month discontinuation rates for oral contraceptive pills are 31 and 47 % respectively&#xD;
      (17), with common reasons for discontinuation attributed to the side effects of abnormal&#xD;
      bleeding, headache, and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, COCs are contraindicated in certain groups of women as outlined by The Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control Medical Eligibility Criteria (11). Given the high prevalence of oral&#xD;
      contraceptive users who commonly discontinue use secondary to side effects or who are not&#xD;
      eligible for use as a result of underlying health conditions, the development of novel oral&#xD;
      non-hormonal methods that are equally effective at pregnancy prevention are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to evaluate the effect of an FDA approved drug, Cilostazol, on human&#xD;
      oocyte maturation. Such a study has not been conducted to date. If Cilostazol demonstrates an&#xD;
      ability in humans to affect resumption of meiosis, then this non-hormonal agent could be uses&#xD;
      as a possible contraceptive agent in the future. This knowledge would have profound&#xD;
      reproductive health implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that women undergoing treatment with the FDA approved dose of 100mg&#xD;
      PO every 12 hours of Cilostazol will demonstrate an impairment of egg maturation in&#xD;
      comparison to paired historic controls following ovarian follicle stimulation.&#xD;

      Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) are the most commonly used hormonal form of birth&#xD;
      control in the United States with at least 87% of women of reproductive age reporting oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use at some point in their lives (9). Despite their frequent use, the six and&#xD;
      twelve month discontinuation rates for oral contraceptive pills are 31 and 47 % respectively&#xD;
      (17), with common reasons for discontinuation attributed to the side effects of abnormal&#xD;
      bleeding, headache, and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, COCs are contraindicated in certain groups of women as outlined by The Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control Medical Eligibility Criteria (11). Given the high prevalence of oral&#xD;
      contraceptive users who commonly discontinue use secondary to side effects or who are not&#xD;
      eligible for use as a result of underlying health conditions, the development of novel oral&#xD;
      non-hormonal methods that are equally effective at pregnancy prevention are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for the development of non-hormonal contraception has been present in the&#xD;
      scientific literature since the 1980s at which point the critical components of gametogenesis&#xD;
      of the mammalian oocyte were being classified. Bornslaeger and colleagues discovered that&#xD;
      high concentrations of intracellular cAMP, an important second messenger for many biological&#xD;
      processes, inhibited resumption of meiosis I in mouse oocytes (3). Later studies demonstrated&#xD;
      that phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors, capable of preventing the breakdown of cAMP, were able&#xD;
      to prevent resumption of meiosis in mouse oocytes cultured in vitro (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1980s, additional studies have examined phosphodiesterase inhibitors and their role&#xD;
      in prevention of oocyte maturation. Tsafriri and colleagues showed that phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors were able to exert their effects selectively via type specific isoforms. This&#xD;
      study revealed that granulosa cells exert effects via type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitors and&#xD;
      oocytes respond to signals via type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitors such that oocyte&#xD;
      maturation was prevented in the presence of PDE3 inhibitors yet ovulation was unaffected&#xD;
      (15). Most recently, Jensen and colleagues examined both in vitro and in vivo effects of a&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor ORG 9935 on oocyte maturation in rhesus monkeys. In these&#xD;
      animal studies, it was found that in vitro, ORG 9935 at a concentration of 1.0umol/l was able&#xD;
      to completely inhibit oocyte maturation (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo models demonstrated a similar reduction in oocyte maturation, with the most dramatic&#xD;
      reduction in monkeys treated with an extended dose regimen of ORG 9935 (200mg/kg/d) prior to&#xD;
      ovulation (8). Additionally, pregnancy rates in macaques treated with ORG 9935 was studied&#xD;
      and compared to controls. Overall, there was not a statistically significant decrease in&#xD;
      pregnancy rates in those macaques treated with PDE3 inhibitor; however, there did appear to&#xD;
      be evidence of a dose response as no animal became pregnant who had serum ORG 9935 levels&#xD;
      above 300nM/L (9). Despite a clear dose response, authors of this study acknowledge that&#xD;
      PDE3-Is have systemic effects that are also dose-limiting. At higher doses, adverse effects&#xD;
      such as tachycardia and hypotension were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors have additionally been studied in vitro to assess oocyte&#xD;
      maturation in humans. Human oocytes cultured in the presence of ORG 9935 (1um) for 24 hours&#xD;
      demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in germinal vesicle breakdown (an early&#xD;
      marker of oocyte maturation) in comparison to control oocytes (12). However, no human in vivo&#xD;
      models assessing oocyte maturation following treatment with a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cilostazol, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of intermittent claudication, is a class&#xD;
      IIIa phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Its systemic effects in humans include vasodilation,&#xD;
      decrease in platelet aggregation, reduction in triglyceride levels, and increase in HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol levels (4). Human clinical trials did not address fertility and pregnancy rates;&#xD;
      however, manufacturer product labeling reports that no fertility effects occurred in rats.&#xD;
      Most recently, however, two animal in vivo studies examining pregnancy rates of mice treated&#xD;
      with Cilostazol were conducted (1,10). In both of these studies, mice treated with Cilostazol&#xD;
      were shown to be completely infertile at follow up; however, once the drug was discontinued,&#xD;
      all mice that were unable to conceive during treatment with cilostazol were subsequently able&#xD;
      to have pregnancies of normal litter sizes. It is important to mention that in the study by&#xD;
      Albarzanchi, mice received PO cilostazol at a dose of 7.5 or 15 mg PO for three days (1). In&#xD;
      the study by Li conducted in China, the maxium dose was higher (300mg/kg) (10). Pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes for both studies were the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies demonstrate two important aspects of a contraceptive method: efficacy and&#xD;
      reversibility. Additionally, the investigators who published Cilostazol's fertility effects&#xD;
      in mice published an abstract demonstrating a similar effect in swine (2). When a human dose&#xD;
      of 100mg bid of Cilostazol was given prior to ovulation, no documented pregnancies occurred.&#xD;
      Following cessation of study drug, all swine were able to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the success of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in both in vivo and in vitro models for&#xD;
      prevention of oocyte maturation and pregnancy in animal models, it is reasonable that we&#xD;
      further examine this potential non-hormonal oral contraceptive method. Given the many FDA&#xD;
      clinical trials that need to be conducted, new contraceptive methods take decades to develop.&#xD;
      However, since Cilostazol is an approved FDA medication with an acceptable side effect&#xD;
      profile, we believe that it is appropriate to complete initial studies of this drug in humans&#xD;
      using an in vivo technique validated in macaques, a model with the same timing of&#xD;
      peri-ovulatory events as women, to ascertain its possible use as a non-hormonal oral&#xD;
      contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the research study is to determine if women taking Cilostazol&#xD;
      demonstrate impairment of oocyte maturation in comparison to paired historic controls&#xD;
      following ovarian follicle stimulation. For the purposes of our study, oocyte maturation will&#xD;
      be assessed using the oocyte maturational stages of prophase I, metaphase I, and metaphase&#xD;
      II. Thus, we will be assessing the percent of oocytes aspirated from follicles during&#xD;
      controlled ovarian stimulation that progress beyond the germinal vesicle stage (e.g. GVBD) in&#xD;
      those women receiving cilostazol and compare this to the maturation of oocytes obtained from&#xD;
      the same women who underwent ovarian follicle stimulation previously while not on study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that women undergoing treatment with the FDA approved dose of 100mg PO BID of&#xD;
      Cilostazol will demonstrate an impairment of oocyte maturation in comparison to paired&#xD;
      historic controls following ovarian follicle stimulation.&#xD;
