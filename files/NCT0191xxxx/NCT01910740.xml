    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical&#xD;
      activity in frail older people during hospital based rehabilitation is associated with better&#xD;
      mobility outcomes compared to usual care. A second aim is to investigate whether this&#xD;
      physical activity intervention is associated with improvements in health related quality of&#xD;
      life. Finally we plan to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical activity&#xD;
      during rehabilitation is cost effective, measured from a health system perspective, compared&#xD;
      with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older people receiving inpatient rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to an intervention&#xD;
      group, who will receive extra physical activity on weekdays and weekends or a control group,&#xD;
      who will receive additional activities based on social interaction. The activity sessions&#xD;
      will be individualized to the particular participant. Both groups of people will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, discharge from hospital and at 6 months following discharge. The intervention&#xD;
      group will be provided with one or two extra sessions on weekdays and two extra sessions on&#xD;
      weekends for the duration of their rehabilitation stay. To account for the extra&#xD;
      physiotherapy time that the intervention group receives, the people in the control group will&#xD;
      spend the same amount of time performing other activities, such as cards, board games or&#xD;
      reading, whilst seated. To ensure the safety of the participants in this study, each physical&#xD;
      activity session will be supervised by either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The primary hypothesis is that, compared with usual care, increasing the amount&#xD;
      of physical activity in frail older people during rehabilitation will lead to more optimal&#xD;
      mobility at discharge, as measured by gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are that, compared with usual care, increasing the amount of physical&#xD;
      activity during rehabilitation will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: lead to significantly greater improvements in mobility and function both at&#xD;
      discharge and six months following discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: lead to better quality of life six months following hospital discharge,&#xD;
      measured using the EuroQol Health (EQ5D) Questionnaire and the EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (EQ-VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: be cost effective compared to usual care&#xD;
