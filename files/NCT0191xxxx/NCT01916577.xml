      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug Plerixafor (Mozobil) can lead to&#xD;
      clinically relevant efflux of CD117+ stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood&#xD;
      of normal controls and patients awaiting lung transplantation. The investigator's hypothesis&#xD;
      is that Plerixafor (Mozobil) will lead to significant mobilization of CD117+ stem cells to&#xD;
      the peripheral blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a new therapy utilizing a stem cell found in the bone marrow&#xD;
      that is defined by cell surface expression of the protein &quot;cluster of differentiation antigen&#xD;
      117&quot; (CD117). Studies utilizing these stem cells in a mouse heart transplant model have&#xD;
      demonstrated significantly improved survival of transplanted hearts, (as much as more than 5&#xD;
      times that seen with untreated heart transplants). In vitro studies in mice also show that&#xD;
      these cells work to inhibit the immune system by inhibiting T cell activation/proliferation&#xD;
      by both paracrine (primary) and contact-dependent (lesser) mechanisms. Importantly, these&#xD;
      stem cells are taken from the intended transplant recipient (autologous) and since these&#xD;
      cells are part of their own body normally (in small numbers); these cells are theoretically&#xD;
      without risk to the patient. This is very different from other stem cell therapies, which are&#xD;
      taken from the donor and as such put the patient at significant risk of developing&#xD;
      potentially life-threatening immune reactions. Because the use of our own stem cells is&#xD;
      potentially safe - the rapid study, development, and implementation of autologous CD117 stem&#xD;
      cell (SC) therapy in human transplant patients is theoretically possible. Therefore, these&#xD;
      cells have high impact potential for the field of tissue and organ transplantation as well as&#xD;
      auto-immunity - to potentially improve tissue/cellular engraftment, decrease acute rejection,&#xD;
      and/or to promote organ transplant tolerance (lack of rejection despite no concomitant&#xD;
      immune-suppression). Prior to full clinical development (efficacy trials in humans), the next&#xD;
      step is to develop a safe and efficacious means for obtaining relatively large quantities of&#xD;
      these cells from potential human recipients. As bone marrow biopsy for cell capture is not&#xD;
      without risk (especially to ill potential lung transplant recipients), the investigators&#xD;
      propose to use Plerixafor (Mozobil), a CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-inhibitor to cause&#xD;
      efflux of bone marrow-derived CD117+ cells to the peripheral blood for capture by&#xD;
      apheresis/positive selection. If successful, the next step will be to perform initial safety&#xD;
      studies in human patients awaiting transplantation and normal controls (not a goal of this&#xD;
      initial protocol however). These studies have the potential to lead to large-scale clinical&#xD;
      efficacy trials and ultimate indication/implementation for human disease(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure: The number of circulating CD117+ cells per milliliter (ml) of&#xD;
      peripheral blood at baseline and following Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment (change in&#xD;
      peripheral blood CD117+ cells per ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.) The number of Plerixafor (Mozobil) related adverse events (AEs). ii.) The number of&#xD;
      patients with Plerixafor (Mozobil) related AEs iii.) The number of Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      related serious adverse events (SAEs). iv.) The number of patients with Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      related serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As listed in the package insert, the most common adverse reactions (â‰¥10%) during&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell mobilization were: diarrhea (37%), nausea (34%), fatigue (27%),&#xD;
      injection site reaction (34%), headache (22%), arthralgia (13%), dizziness (11%), and&#xD;
      vomiting (10%). It should be noted that the majority of these occurred in patients also&#xD;
      undergoing apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure Time Frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure Time Frame: At baseline and at 8 hours post-Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures Time Frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.): Continuously for the first 30 minutes post-Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment, at 1 week&#xD;
      post-Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment, and up to 1 year post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.): For the first 30 minutes post administration, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      treatment and up to 1 year post treatment, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment, and&#xD;
      up to 1 year post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii.): For the first 30 minutes post administration, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      treatment and up to 1 year post treatment, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment, and&#xD;
      up to 1 year post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv.): For the first 30 minutes post administration, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil)&#xD;
      treatment and up to 1 year post treatment, at 1 week post-Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment, and&#xD;
      up to 1 year post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether Plerixafor (Mozobil) will mobilize CD117+ progenitor cells from the bone&#xD;
      marrow in patients with chronic lung diseases on the lung transplant waiting list (versus&#xD;
      normal controls). We will compare baseline counts of CD117+ cells with cell counts 8 hrs&#xD;
      after Plerixafor to determine the efficacy of mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary results will be used to determine the number of rounds of apheresis that may be&#xD;
      required to isolate sufficient cells for reinfusion at later timepoints in a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators can mobilize a sufficient number of autologous CD117+ cells, they will&#xD;
      eventually re-infuse them at the time of transplant to determine whether we can abrogate&#xD;
      acute rejection following human lung transplantation (future study). The investigators&#xD;
      believe these are safer than allogeneic stem cells as there is no risk for graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) with autologous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments should demonstrate the effectiveness of CD117+ stem cell mobilization from&#xD;
      the bone marrow to the peripheral blood (PB) via CXCR4 antagonism (Plerixafor) and whether&#xD;
      end-stage lung disease affects the ability to mobilize stem cells. Additionally, these&#xD;
      results will be used to mathematically extrapolate approximately how many rounds of&#xD;
      peripheral blood apheresis will be required to attain adequate stem cell numbers for clinical&#xD;
      infusion (10e7) for a future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments will involve taking blood from consented patients awaiting lung transplantation&#xD;
      (as well as normal controls) prior to Plerixafor (Mozobil) treatment (240mcg/kg&#xD;
      subcutaneously) and then 8 hours after treatment as in Table 1.&#xD;
