    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics of RO6870868 in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive single ascending doses of either RO6870868 or placebo, with or without&#xD;
      food.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive. Healthy status is&#xD;
             defined by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a detailed&#xD;
             medical and surgical history and a complete physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-childbearing potential including women who have undergone hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy and postmenopausal females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must be willing to use effective contraception as defined by protocol&#xD;
             for the duration of the study and for one month after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) at screening of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers, or use of &lt; 10 cigarettes (or equivalent nicotine-containing product) per&#xD;
             day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No medical or social conditions that would potentially interfere with the subjects&#xD;
             ability to comply with the study visit schedule or the study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating women, and male partners of women who&#xD;
             are pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or symptoms of any significant disease including (but not limited to)&#xD;

             systemic anti-neoplastic (including radiation) or immunomodulatory treatment&#xD;
             (including systemic oral or inhaled corticosteroids) &lt;/= 6 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug or the expectation that such treatment will be needed at any time&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed significant allergic reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis) against any&#xD;
             drug, or multiple drug allergies (non-active hay fever is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant psychiatric disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant acute infection, e.g., influenza, local infection, acute gastrointestinal&#xD;

             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastrointestinal disease including inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer&#xD;
             disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Positive for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History (within 3 months of screening) of alcohol consumption exceeding 14 units per&#xD;
             week on average (1 unit = 10 grams of alcohol). Alcohol consumption will be prohibited&#xD;
             at least 48 hours before screening, 48 hours before admission, 48 hours after each&#xD;
             dose, and 48 hours before each scheduled visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with,&#xD;
             or for which the treatment of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that&#xD;
             would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had received IFN or peginterferon within 8 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other clinical studies of a new chemical entity within 60 days prior&#xD;
             to study randomization&#xD;
