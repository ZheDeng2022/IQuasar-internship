  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, placebo (vehicle) -controlled phase&#xD;
      I study to evaluate the photoallergic potential of Clindamycin-Tretinoin Gel. The design&#xD;
      consisted of the following periods: screening, induction, rest, challenge, and rechallenge&#xD;
      (if indicated). Induction visit 1 was to occur within 5 days of screening visit 2. The study&#xD;
      expected to enroll approximately 62 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were to receive&#xD;
      repeated 24-hour study patch applications; after patch removal, the sites were irradiated&#xD;
      with ultraviolet B light (UVB) and visible light (VIS) during the induction period&#xD;
      (consisting of 6 consecutive induction phases), and ultraviolet A light (UVA)/ UVB and VIS&#xD;
      during the challenge and rechallenge periods. Each application site was observed&#xD;
      approximately 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours later for signs of inflammation.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary endpoint will be inflammatory response or superficial effect at challenge period. Inflammatory responses (erythema and local skin reactions) or superficial effects (if observed) will be scored according to the grading scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 44 - 65</time_frame>
    <description>In cases where the patch area is larger than the irradiated area, only the irradiated areas will be scored unless reactions outside the irradiated area exhibit unusual responses. Scores represent the presence of clinically significant effects on at least 25% of the test site. Questionable, barely perceptible, or minimal reactions involving less than 25% of the test site will not be considered significant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The capability of understanding and providing signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any&#xD;
             protocol-specific procedures were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects aged from 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possessed Fitzpatrick skin type I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns&#xD;
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately, tans gradually) that would not&#xD;
             interfere with the reading of any skin responses. Determination of skin types was&#xD;
             based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their&#xD;
             responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential who agreed to use a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product. A woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential was defined as one who was biologically capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant, including perimenopausal women who were less than 2 years from their last&#xD;
             menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods started at&#xD;
             least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was started less than 2&#xD;
             months prior to screening, then a form of non-hormonal contraception was to have been&#xD;
             added until the third continuous month of hormonal contraception was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two forms of non-hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices or properly&#xD;
             used barrier methods (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap).&#xD;
             Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy,&#xD;
             were to have used a form of non-hormonal contraception. A barrier method or&#xD;
             sterilization plus spermatocide were acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who were not currently sexually active or lactating agreed to use a medically&#xD;
             accepted method of contraception is she became sexually active while participating in&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently diagnosed with cancer or had a previous history of cancer, including skin&#xD;
             cancer, or severe photodamaged skin. Severe photodamaged skin was characterized by&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participated in a previous study of the same study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, may have&#xD;
             affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffered from any disease or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             have affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
