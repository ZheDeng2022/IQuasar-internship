  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate immunomodulatory effects of perioperative application of omega-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids in gastric cancer surgery, the effects of postoperative recovery, the improvement&#xD;
      of nutritional status, incidence rate of related complications, and whether it can reduce the&#xD;
      average postoperative hospitalization days.&#xD;

      Methods: Choose from 6 to 2013-2013-12 gastric cancer patients, according to inclusion&#xD;
      criteriaS to choose the objectS of study from the gastric cancer patients coming to our&#xD;
      hospital 2013-06 to 2013-12 .The included patients will be randomly divided into two groups A&#xD;
      and B, two groups of patients 4 days before operation begin to give parenteral nutrition: A:&#xD;
      the control group of normal intravenous nutrition. B: the trial group,add Omega-3&#xD;
      Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg to parenteral nutrition, no use on the day of surgery,&#xD;
      postoperative 2 days continue to add Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg. Detect and&#xD;
      compare CRP、TNF-α、IL-1、IL-4、lL-6、 IL-8、lL-10 levels of two groups in days before parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition and applicating 3rd day and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 5th,and detect liver function&#xD;
      in preoperative and postoperative 2nd,5th,7th day. Record postoperative anal exhaust time,&#xD;
      postoperative complications, postoperative hospital days, preoperative and postoperative body&#xD;
      weight.Results: Trail group patients compared with the control group,Omega-3 Polyunsaturated&#xD;
      Fatty Acids can reduce early postoperative inflammatory cytokines release, reduce the&#xD;
      postoperative fever time, reduce the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome,&#xD;
      promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve the nutritional state of patients,&#xD;
      reduce infection and related complications after the surgery and reduce postoperative&#xD;
      hospitalization days. Conclusions: Perioperative application of omega 3 PUFA can reduce the&#xD;
      release of inflammatory cytokines, regulating cell and humoral immunity, reduce the&#xD;
      postoperative fever time, reduce the local inflammation medium that inhibit the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal peristalsis, promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve the&#xD;
      nutritional state of patients, thereby reducing the occurrence of postoperative infection and&#xD;
      related complications, reduce postoperative hospitalization days.&#xD;
