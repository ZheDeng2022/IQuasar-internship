  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending (increasing) and multiple doses of GWP42006 compared with placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group dose&#xD;
      escalation, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) study of single escalating and&#xD;
      multiple doses of GWP42006 in healthy volunteers. The study consists of 5 single dosing&#xD;
      occasions, and a five day repeated dose period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Single Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four parallel groups of 11 subjects will participate in the oral single dosing, dose&#xD;
      escalation study phase. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight&#xD;
      subjects receive active and three subjects receive placebo. It is planned for Groups 1 and 2,&#xD;
      that a staggered 'sentinel' dose design will be used, with two sub-groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first will comprise of one placebo and one active subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second, seven subjects will receive active and two will receive placebo after a&#xD;
           review of the 24 h post-dose safety data of the first group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel subject dosing will be performed in higher-dose groups if there is no measurable&#xD;
      plasma GWP42006 in Group 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group within the single dosing part (Group 3/dose level 3) will then receive an&#xD;
      intravenous administration of 5 mg GWP42006 to allow assessment of bioavailability. There&#xD;
      will be a minimum of seven days between doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to three further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess additional&#xD;
      dose levels or food effect. The need for additional groups will be based on a review of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and PK data by the safety advisory committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels are 25 mg (Group 1/dose level 1), 75 mg (Group 2/dose level 2), 200&#xD;
      mg (Group 3/dose level 3) and 400 mg (Group 4/dose level 4), with a maximum dose of 800 mg.&#xD;
      Administration of each successive dose will be dependent on safety, tolerability and PK data&#xD;
      of previous doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Multiple Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses and dose regimens assessed in Part 2 will be selected based upon the safety, and PK&#xD;
      data from Part 1 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that one group of 11 subjects will participate in the multiple dose phase, and&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active and three receive&#xD;
      matching placebo. Each subject will receive the selected dose of GWP42006 or placebo once,&#xD;
      twice or three times daily for a total of five days, with the final dose administered on the&#xD;
      morning of Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess a different&#xD;
      dose level or a different dosing frequency. As for single dosing, the decision to include&#xD;
      further groups will be taken based on safety, tolerability and PK data. All further groups&#xD;
      would be added on blinded information.&#xD;
