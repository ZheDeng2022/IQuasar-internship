      -  This is a single centre, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
           crossover, dose escalating study of P7435 using single and multiple doses, to be&#xD;
           conducted in healthy male and female (Non child bearing) subjects having BMI between 19&#xD;
           to 40 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in 2 parts as follows: Part A will consist of the Single&#xD;

    <description>In Part A, there will be up to 6 cohorts of 8 subjects each (for the 2 cohorts undergoing food effect study, there will be 12 subjects in each cohort).

The randomization scheme will ensure that no subject undergoes the placebo period twice.&#xD;
In Part B, there will be up to 3 cohorts of 10 subjects each. Each of the 3 cohorts will participate in two study periods of 10 days of dosing in each (one period with active, P7435 and the other period with matching placebo or vice versa) separated by appropriate wash-out period.</description>
