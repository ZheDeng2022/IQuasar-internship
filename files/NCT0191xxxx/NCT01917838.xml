      The goal of this two-year R34 treatment development grant is to develop a mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth) application that will both advance theory in and clinical practice of homework (HW)&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HW can be described as between-session exercises where the client practices specific skills&#xD;
      learned within-session in order to promote skill acquisition, which ultimately leads to&#xD;
      improved acute- as well as longer-term therapeutic benefits on targeted outcomes,&#xD;
      generalization of treatment effects and maintenance of treatment gains. Despite data&#xD;
      demonstrating that HW is critical to achieving maximal benefits from evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments, very little theory-driven approaches have been conducted focusing on improving&#xD;
      the HW process. Through utilizing self-determination theory as a guiding framework and&#xD;
      integrating principles from the field of &quot;gamification&quot; and goal-setting, the aim is to&#xD;
      develop a two-component mHealth HW application (My MFG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first component focuses on delivering HW via a highly engaging, multiplayer, interactive,&#xD;
      cooperative, and skill-building game platform aimed at improving the &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Do&quot;&#xD;
      process of HW. The second component focuses on targeting factors putatively related to poor&#xD;
      HW implementation within the &quot;Do&quot; process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of the development of My MFG will be guided by the clinic and community&#xD;
      development model and iterative software development process to maximize the feasibility and&#xD;
      sustainability of My MFG within practice settings often characterized by limited resources.&#xD;
      Findings from this study have broad implications for evidence-based treatments for youth and&#xD;
      adult mental health disorders that emphasize HW as the link between treatment and&#xD;
      improvements in targeted outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to develop a theory-informed mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      application for urban caregivers attempting to improve their children's oppositional and&#xD;
      conduct related difficulties (i.e., disruptive behavior disorders; DBDs). The majority of&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments (EBTs) targeting youth DBDs emphasize change in specific&#xD;
      parenting/family-level processes empirically linked to the maintenance of DBDs. Existing EBTs&#xD;
      frequently include at-home-practice-exercises (i.e., homework; HW) to reinforce parent skill&#xD;
      acquisition and maximize use of new skills with children at home. Poor quantity and quality&#xD;
      of HW completed by parents significantly attenuates the effect of EBTs. This is a significant&#xD;
      limiting-factor in many EBTs attaining full public health impact. Given the robust effect of&#xD;
      HW on outcomes from EBTs across a range of behavioral health difficulties and populations,&#xD;
      there is a call for moving beyond the question of whether HW is important to questions such&#xD;
      as what processes are involved in HW implementation and how best to support these processes.&#xD;
      Minimal investigation has been focused on these critical questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model of HW has recently been proposed to better understand the process of HW&#xD;
      implementation, as well as guide critically needed supports for at-home practice exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This model proposes four HW processes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Designing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assigning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doing, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DADR model proposes that specific social, cognitive and behavioral factors related to the&#xD;
      HW task, as well as to the provider and the adult caregiver may affect the quality of each&#xD;
      phase and ultimately to the quantity and quality of HW completed. Methods to better&#xD;
      understand, support, and impact these processes are essential to advancing theory and&#xD;
      offering solutions to HW completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through features available on smartphones (e.g., camera/video/voice recording; simple message&#xD;
      service; internet-access; global positioning system), there are novel methods to interface&#xD;
      with and support clients outside of defined treatment sessions. Through the use of these&#xD;
      features, mHealth applications can be used to engage, educate, connect, track, and remind&#xD;
      clients. These applications can use push (send communications) or pull (client's access tools&#xD;
      on their own) mechanisms to engage the client in behavioral change activity. mHealth&#xD;
      applications that integrate push and pull methods offer a significant opportunity to enhance&#xD;
      outcomes across a range of health and behavioral health challenges and populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this two-year R34 treatment development grant is in response to RFA-MH-13-061&#xD;
      (Harnessing advanced health technologies to drive mental health improvement) to develop a&#xD;
      mHealth application that will both advance theory in and clinical practice guided by the DADR&#xD;
      model of HW implementation. Specifically we aim to utilize mHealth to improve the &quot;Design&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;Do&quot; process of HW within the context of the Family Groups for Youth with Behavioral&#xD;
      Difficulties (MFG) intervention, an EBT for DBDs in youth and their families who seek&#xD;
      assistance at outpatient mental health clinics in urban communities. To date, efforts at&#xD;
      utilizing mHealth within the context of HW have been minimal and have not taken a systematic,&#xD;
      theory-driven approach, thereby limiting the advance of knowledge and clinical application.&#xD;
      Through utilizing self-determination theory as a guiding framework and integrating principles&#xD;
      from the field of &quot;gamification&quot; and goal-setting, the aim is to develop a two-component MFG&#xD;
      mHealth HW application (My MFG). The first component focuses on delivering MFG HW via a&#xD;
      highly engaging, multiplayer, interactive, cooperative, and skill-building game platform&#xD;
      aimed at improving the &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Do&quot; process. The second component focuses on targeting&#xD;
      factors putatively related to poor HW implementation within the &quot;Do&quot; process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of the development of My MFG will be guided by the clinic and community&#xD;
      development model and iterative software development process to maximize the feasibility and&#xD;
      sustainability of My MFG within practice settings often characterized by limited resources.&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop My MFG through an iterative process informed by the perspectives of key&#xD;
           stakeholders&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the impact of MFG plus My MFG relative to MFG-alone on the DADR process and HW&#xD;
           quantity and quality. It is hypothesized that the MFG plus My MFG will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Greater quality of the &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Do&quot; process rated by therapists, parents, and&#xD;
                independent coders&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Greater quantity and quality of HW assignments rated by therapists and parents&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Greater quality of the &quot;Review&quot; process as rated by therapists, parents, and&#xD;
                independent coders as a function of improved HW quantity and quality&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Greater satisfaction with treatment as rated by the parent, target child, and&#xD;
                therapists NIMH has specifically called for acceleration of research to maximize&#xD;
                the ability of current treatments to reduce symptoms, improve adherence and&#xD;
                functioning while improving quality of and lowering the cost of care. The mHealth&#xD;
                application and methods proposed herein serve as systematic, theory-driven&#xD;
                approaches to significantly advance understanding of how best to support the HW&#xD;
                process-a common element of many EBTs across various disorders and&#xD;
                populations-ultimately resulting in greater effectiveness of EBTs, maintenance and&#xD;
                generalization of behavioral skills learned during EBTs.&#xD;
