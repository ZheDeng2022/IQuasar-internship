      The purpose of this study is to determine upon administering GABA orally to a person how it&#xD;
      is absorbed, distributed, as well as the drug's pharmacological effects on the body such as&#xD;
      glucose levels, serum C-peptide and/or insulin levels (referred to as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics). We will conduct experiments in normal subjects to address&#xD;
      these questions.&#xD;

      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the progressive loss of pancreatic&#xD;
      insulin-secreting beta-cells. This consequently leads to a lack of insulin and elevation of&#xD;
      blood sugar, namely hyperglycemia, which is a major cause for the development of diabetes and&#xD;
      its acute or chronic complications. The current treatment for type 1 diabetes requires a&#xD;
      life-long dependency on daily insulin injections, causing inconvenience and burden to&#xD;
      patients. Drug-induced hypoglycemia is also common as it presents a major challenge in&#xD;
      insulin therapy. Furthermore, although insulin therapy is lifesaving, it is not a cure as it&#xD;
      neither reverses the progression of the disease nor prevents the development of serious&#xD;
      complications associated with this disease. New treatments are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated that a natural chemical found in the brain,&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also produced in large quantities by pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cells, has beta-cell regenerative and immunoregulatory effects. Importantly, GABA&#xD;
      prevented and partially reversed diabetes in type 1 diabetes mouse models. It is important to&#xD;
      address essential questions regarding the potential effects of GABA in diabetic patients in&#xD;
      humans. Given the largely unknown mechanism of action of GABA in the pancreas, and the&#xD;
      limited information on how GABA is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the human body,&#xD;
      we plan to examine these issues (referred to as pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) in normal&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of this study will provide useful information on the mechanism of action of GABA&#xD;
      in human subjects.&#xD;

      This is an open-labeled, 3-phase, self-control study. In phase 1, blood is sampled from&#xD;
      volunteers who will take placebo to obtain the baseline value. In phase 2, volunteers will&#xD;
      take a single oral dose of 2000 mg GABA. There are at least 7 days between the two phases. In&#xD;
      phase 3, volunteers will take a repeated oral dose of 2000 mg GABA (thrice daily for seven&#xD;
      days). There are at least 5-7 days between phase 3 and phase 3. In each phase, individuals&#xD;
      will be observed for 24 hours to obtain the complete concentration time curve. 4 ml of blood&#xD;
      will be sampled at the following time-point for predose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hour postdose.&#xD;
