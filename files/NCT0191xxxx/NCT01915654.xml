  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the transfusion of packed red blood cell is to overcome acute or chronic&#xD;
      anemia cause tissue hypoxia. It increases hemoglobin concentration and consequently increase&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. The perioperative period of major surgery is a field&#xD;
      particularly favorable to the development of tissue hypoxia, which is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality and postoperative morbidity. Optimization of oxygen transport to tissues&#xD;
      at the preoperative period is accompanied by a significant reduction of these major&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical complications (infectious or otherwise) related to transfusion of caps Red Blood&#xD;
      cells Caps (RBC)are well known. Many studies seem to evidence the potentially deleterious&#xD;
      effect of transfusion, especially in patients with poor condition, related to storage time.&#xD;
      Indeed, during storage, impaired blood-related storage is created. It is metabolic,&#xD;
      biochemical and molecular levels. Many studies, carried out in particular in cardiac surgery&#xD;
      where patients are suitable for transfusion RBC, have focused on the effect of transfusions&#xD;
      on consumption and the transport of oxygen to demonstrate the impact of conservation lesions&#xD;
      on their role in vivo. In particular, a single-center retrospective American study showed&#xD;
      reduction of postoperative complications in patients who received RBC under 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However one of the confounding factors present is that all transfused RBCs are not&#xD;
      leukoreduced (unlike the French transfusion policy). In addition, the greater part of the&#xD;
      clinical studies are controversial. That is why we aim to assess, through a retrospective&#xD;
      study of data, the impact of transfusion of red red blood cells within 14 days of&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity and mortality, compared to the usual transfusion practice in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients.&#xD;
