      Periampullary carcinoma and carcinoma head of pancreas are common causes of obstruction at&#xD;
      the lower end of the common bile duct. Whenever possible, surgical resection in the form of&#xD;
      Whipple Pancreaticoduodenectomy (WPD) is the treatment of choice. However, this operation is&#xD;
      associated with a substantial postoperative morbidity and mortality. With advances in&#xD;
      surgical techniques and postoperative care there has been a decrease in the operative&#xD;
      mortality. However, the postoperative morbidity remains high varying between 5%-64%. Of the&#xD;
      various risk factors, the degree of jaundice as indicated by the serum bilirubin levels has&#xD;
      been associated with an increased risk of complications. Preoperative biliary drainage has&#xD;
      been tried to decrease the serum bilirubin levels and consequently decrease postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Internal biliary drainage can be achieved by surgical&#xD;
      cholecystojejunostomy or endoscopic bile duct stenting. Endoscopic stenting can be done as a&#xD;
      day care procedure under conscious sedation, but involves insertion of a foreign body&#xD;
      (stent), which results in introduction of bacteria into the bile and problems of&#xD;
      postoperative infection. Also, endoscopic stenting before surgery may result in difficulty in&#xD;
      dissecting around the common bile duct during the surgical procedure. While the surgical&#xD;
      bilioenteric bypass has the advantage that no foreign body is inserted into the biliary tree&#xD;
      and hence the likelihood of sepsis is low, it requires anesthesia and involves a surgical&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic and surgical drainage in&#xD;
      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy. We plan to compare the outcomes of preoperative&#xD;
      endoscopic biliary drainage with surgical drainage in patients undergoing&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.&#xD;

      Hypothesis preoperative biliary decompression by Cholecystojejunostomy will reduce infective&#xD;
      complication by 23% as compared to endocopic stenting INTRODUCTION Pancreaticoduodenectomy&#xD;
      has been associated with a substantial postoperative morbidity and mortality. Advances in&#xD;
      surgical techniques and postoperative care have led to a decrease in the operative mortality.&#xD;
      However, the postoperative morbidity has remained high varying between 5%-64%.1 Of the&#xD;
      various risk factors, analyzed in the retrospective studies, the degree of jaundice as&#xD;
      indicated by the serum bilirubin levels has been associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      complications.2-5 Preoperative biliary drainage has been tried to decrease the serum&#xD;
      bilirubin levels and consequently decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality. However,&#xD;
      its role remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External biliary drainage using percutaneous transhepatic insertion of a catheter has been&#xD;
      used.6,7 The disadvantages of external bleary drainage include the risk of spontaneous&#xD;
      catheter dislodgement, inflammation and pain at the puncture site, leak of ascitic fluid and&#xD;
      bile around the catheter, and loss of fluid and electrolytes. Moreover, bile has an&#xD;
      antibacterial action and its loss has been associated with sepsis and renal failure. Hence,&#xD;
      internal biliary drainage is considered more appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal biliary drainage can be achieved by surgical cholecystojejunostomy or endoscopic&#xD;
      bile duct stenting. The internal drainage provides a more physiological route for drainage of&#xD;
      bile into duodenum or jejunum, which prevents any loss of electrolytes and bile salts, and&#xD;
      reduces the risk of endotoxemia. Two studies using endoscopic bilary drainage have shown&#xD;
      benefit in terms of reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality.7,8 However, it involves&#xD;
      the insertion of a foreign body (stent), which results in occurrence of bacteria in bile with&#xD;
      its attendant problems of postoperative sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the availability of the endoscopic and percutaneous methods, surgical bilioenteric&#xD;
      bypass was the only method for preoperative biliary decompression. The disadvantage of this&#xD;
      method is that it requires anesthesia and involves a surgical incision. However, its&#xD;
      advantages are that no foreign body is inserted into the biliary tree and hence the&#xD;
      likelihood of sepsis is low. Also, endoscopic stenting before pancreaticoduodenectomy may&#xD;
      result in difficulty while dissecting the common bile duct. Historically, Whipple conceived&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy as a two staged procedure. The first stage was surgical decompression&#xD;
      of biliary tract to reduce the level of the hyperbilirubinemia to minimize mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity after extirepative surgery and the second stage was a definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic and surgical drainage in&#xD;
      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy. We plan to carry out a randomized trial comparing&#xD;
      the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage with surgical drainage in patients&#xD;
      undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;

      surgery and medicine OPD at AIIMS will be evaluated with a detailed history and clinical&#xD;
      examination, liver function tests and an ultrasound abdomen. Those patients who have liver&#xD;
      function tests and an ultrasound suggestive of lower end block will be further evaluated with&#xD;
      a contrast enhanced CT and side viewing endoscopy (biopsy whenever possible) to characterize&#xD;
      the nature of block.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Preprocedural preparation10&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent: The patient will be explained about the course and nature of disease,&#xD;
           alternatives methods of treatment available, outcome with and without treatment. The&#xD;
           procedure will be explained completely to the patient including the risks and&#xD;
           complications involved and then consent will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigations The following investigations will be done in all the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Prothrombin time&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Liver function tests (LFTs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Baseline haematological, biochemical and radiological investigations done in all&#xD;
                patients as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Haemogram ii) Kidney Function Test iii) Electrolytes iv) Blood sugar v) Chest X-ray&#xD;
           vi) ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prophylactic antibiotics: All patients will receive prophylactic antibiotics (Inj&#xD;
           cefaperazone + sulbactam 1 gm) 2 hours before the procedure and these will be continued&#xD;
           upto 72 hours after the procedure. Patients will be kept nil orally for 8 hours prior to&#xD;
           the procedure, and will be well hydrated with i.v. fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endoscopic stenting (EBS)11 A therapeutic duodenoscope and a standard sphincterotome&#xD;
           will be used for canulation of the bile duct. A hydrophilic guidewire (Terumo, 0.032&quot;&#xD;
           dia or Jag wire 0.035&quot; dia, microvasive) will be used to cross the malignant stricture.&#xD;
           After the stricture was crossed with the help of a guidewire, the wire will be removed&#xD;
           and bile will be aspirated. A small sphincterotomy will be done with a wire-guided&#xD;
           sphincterotome to facilitate the passage of the stent. The sphincterotome will be&#xD;
           removed and a guide catheter will be passed over the guidewire and then a 10 F 7 cm long&#xD;
           straight plastic stent will be inserted across the stricture over the guidewire. A&#xD;
           maximum of three attempts will be allowed for insertion of the stent after which it will&#xD;
           be categorized as procedural failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cholecystojejunostomy (CJ) Cholecystojejunostomy will be done under local anesthesia&#xD;
           using a small subcostal incision made over the distended gall bladder. The anastomosis&#xD;
           will be done in 2 layers using 3-0 vicryl and 3-0 silk sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any complications related to both procedures and following them will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up On day 5 following the endoscopic or surgical bypass, the patients will be&#xD;
      reassessed clinically and with hematological and biochemical parameters with special&#xD;
      reference to haemogram and LFTs to know whether the biliary drainage is effective. After 4&#xD;
      weeks along with clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters, nutritional parameters&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be considered for definitive procedure at least after 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      biliary drainage procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative difficulty, amount of blood loss, number of transfusions required and operative&#xD;
      time during definitive surgery will be recorded. Following pancreaticoduodenectomy, the&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be evaluated in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Technical success: Passage of a stent across the stricture, along with flow of bile&#xD;
           through the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Successful drainage: A decrease in bilirubin of at least 20% of the pretreatment value&#xD;
           within 5 days after procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure-related complication: was defined complications directly related to stent&#xD;
           insertion/CJ&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intraoperative assessment: The operative difficulty, amount of blood loss, number of&#xD;
           transfusions required and operative time during definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;

                leucocytosis, fistula or abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Bile leak: Clinical bile leak or elevated bilirubin level in drain fluid with&#xD;
                normal serum level.&#xD;
&#xD;

           discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stastistical analysis Baseline characteristic will be expressed in mean (SD). The Pearson chi&#xD;
      square test and Fischer exact test will be used for to compare the categorical data as&#xD;
      appropriate. The Student t-test will be used to compare the continuous variables.&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be done using logistic regression tests. Length of hospital stay&#xD;
      will be compared using the log-rank test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A pvalue of &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be taken as significant.&#xD;
