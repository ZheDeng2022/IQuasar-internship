  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine how an oral iron supplement (Feramax®)&#xD;
      influences fatigue during early postoperative recovery (at three months) among CABG patients&#xD;
      and, the effects on recovery outcomes (e.g. quality of life, functional capacity, anemia, and&#xD;
      medication adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that CABG surgery patients receiving oral iron (Feramax®) 150mg orally&#xD;
      (once a day therapy) will have a 15% reduction in POF (measured by the Identity Consequence&#xD;
      Fatigue Scale (ICFS)), compared to patients receiving a placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative fatigue (POF) is one of the main complaints in approximately 39-80% of CABG&#xD;
      surgery patients. POF can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      and recovery. The objectives are to examine how an oral iron (Feramax®) influences fatigue&#xD;
      during early postoperative recovery (at three months) among CABG patients and determine the&#xD;
      effects on recovery outcomes (e.g. QoL, functional capacity, anemia, and medication&#xD;
      adherence). To achieve these objectives the research will aim to answer the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is oral iron effective in reducing POF measured by the Identity Consequence Fatigue&#xD;
           Scale (ICFS) over 12 weeks?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If oral iron is effective, how effective was it on improving fatigue, functional&#xD;
           capacity, QoL, and anemia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To what degree do patients taking oral iron adhere to the prescription? A prospective,&#xD;
           randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, single-center study was chosen for this&#xD;
           study. Three hundred participants who are scheduled for an isolated CABG surgery will be&#xD;
           recruited from the QEII Health Sciences Centre (QEIIHSC), Halifax, Nova Scotia. All&#xD;
           study participants will be followed for three months following hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at five time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 1 Baseline -Patients are screened in the preadmission clinic or nursing unit and&#xD;
      recruited for the study. During this visit, the patient will be assessed for eligibility,&#xD;
      demographic data and blood work collected and three questionnaires and six minute walk test&#xD;
      completed by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 2 Discharge/Randomization-Patients will be randomized to either FeraMAX® or&#xD;
      placebo at hospital discharge. The treatment will be taken once daily for 84 days starting&#xD;
      Day 1 (day after discharge from hospital). The questionnaires, six minute walk test and blood&#xD;
      work will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 3 -Post testing 7 to 14 days post discharge A follow up telephone call to reminder&#xD;
      patients to take medications and fill put side effects diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Point 4 Six week Follow up-Blood work will be collected and three questionnaires and six&#xD;
      minute walk test completed by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Point 5-End of treatment-The questionnaires, six minute walk test, blood work, collect&#xD;
      side effects diary and pill count will be repeated during a clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue will be measured with the ICFS and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia(&#xD;
      FACT-An) questionnaire. The Short Form-36 is used to measure QoL and the six minute walk test&#xD;
      to measure functional capacity. Standard of care laboratory tests including (hemoglobin (Hgb)&#xD;
      level, reticulocyte count, ferritin, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin&#xD;
      saturation, and C-Reactive Protein levels will be drawn. Medication adherence to the will be&#xD;
      assessed by pill count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be analyzed using ANOVA for repeated measures to compare level of&#xD;
      fatigue of two groups at baseline, discharge, six weeks and 12 weeks. For the secondary&#xD;
      endpoint, a subgroup analysis will be performed and reported on participants with and without&#xD;
      iron- deficiency anemia to determine if any efficacy of iron on POF is restricted to this&#xD;
      population or to a more general population post CABG surgery. Results will be reported using&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation when appropriate and median (interquartile range) for&#xD;
      nonparametric data. Categorical variables will be compared using Fisher exact test or t test&#xD;
      when appropriate. Level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral iron is inexpensive and effective treatment for iron deficiency that occurs from&#xD;
      surgical blood loss. Currently there is no specific drug used to treat POF. Standard of care&#xD;
      for POF consists of treating and eliminating the underlying symptoms.&#xD;
