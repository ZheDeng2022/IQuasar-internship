    <textblock>
      Patients who empty their stomach slowly may have what we call &quot;Slow gastric emptying&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;gastroparesis&quot;. These patients can have some changes in the thickness of their stomach wall.&#xD;
      In addition, they may have loss of some important nerve cells in their stomach muscles. The&#xD;
      loss of these cells can cause slow emptying of the stomach. Obtaining a sample from the&#xD;
      stomach wall to examine the loss of these cells can help in diagnosing gastroparesis. Up to&#xD;
      now, the only way to obtain a tissue sample from the stomach muscle was to undergo an&#xD;
      operation in the surgery suite and be hospitalized for several days after the procedure.&#xD;
      Usually, we obtain this sample while these patients are having a surgery for another purpose&#xD;
      such as placement of a gastric stimulator (a machine which is inserted in the stomach wall to&#xD;
      control the stomach rhythm and thus help the stomach to empty faster). Endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      is an endoscope (a tube with a source of light and ultrasound installed in the tip of the&#xD;
      tube) that can measure how thick the stomach wall is and can provide sample &quot;biopsies&quot; of the&#xD;
      stomach wall which can be studied for the loss of these specialized muscles and cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing that samples obtained by the endoscopic ultrasound can be sufficient to&#xD;
      diagnose &quot;gastroparesis&quot; and can replace the need for obtaining samples by surgery.&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound is an outpatient procedure which is not as invasive as surgery.&#xD;

      EUS Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) Biopsies of the Muscularis Propria (MP) of the gastric wall&#xD;
      in patients with gastroparesis (GP) could replace the routine use of surgical full thickness&#xD;
      biopsies (FTB) for assessing loss of Interstitial Cell of Cajal (ICC) and cellular&#xD;
      infiltrates in the myenteric plexus. The principal investigator investigated the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of EUS Fine Needle Aspiration biopsies of the Muscularis Propria of the stomach antrum&#xD;
      in gastroparesis and compared the tissue to a surgically obtained full thickness biopsies in&#xD;
      the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective, nonrandomized, feasibility trial. Patients with gastroparesis who&#xD;
      were undergoing gastric neurostimulator placement were enrolled. Patients had a gastric wall&#xD;
      measurement by radial EUS in the body and antrum of the stomach followed by linear EUS&#xD;
      examination and FNA of the muscularis propria in the antrum by using a 19-gauge core needle.&#xD;
      Within 24 hours, a full-thickness biopsy specimen of the antrum was obtained surgically&#xD;
      during neurostimulator placement. Endoscopic and surgical specimens were compared for tissue&#xD;
      morphology, number of ICCs (c-kit stain) and enteric neurons (S-100 stain), and fibrosis&#xD;
      (trichome) for each patient. The correlation coefficient of the ICC count per high-power&#xD;
      field was used to compare both specimens. Continuous data were compared by using a t test.&#xD;

    <description>After the subjects meet the criteria for enrollment in the study, gastroparetic patients will undergo linear EUS examination of the stomach wall one day prior to their surgery to obtain single or multiple core biopsies of the stomach body wall using the 19-gauge core biopsy needle under EUS guidance. The pathologist will be in the room to assess the adequacy of the sample after each pass. Once the pathologist deemed that the obtained sample is sufficient, the procedure will be terminated</description>
