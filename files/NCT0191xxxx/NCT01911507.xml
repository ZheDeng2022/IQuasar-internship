      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of c-Met inhibitor INCB028060 and&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride when given together in treating patients with previously treated&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. C-Met inhibitor INCB028060 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of INC280 (c-Met inhibitor INCB028060) plus&#xD;
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with met proto-oncogene (MET) expressing&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicity profile of INC280 plus erlotinib. II. To determine the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of INC280 plus erlotinib. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      behavior of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect blood and tumor samples for exploratory analysis of the MET and epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive c-Met inhibitor INCB028060 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
