    <textblock>
      Observational evidence indicates that intradialytic hypertension is associated with high&#xD;
      morbidity &amp; mortality. The investigators impression is that this problem may be more&#xD;
      prevalent than initially suspected. To the investigators knowledge, there are no studies on&#xD;
      intradialytic hypertension in the South African haemodialysis population.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradialytic hypertension (IDH) is the paradoxical rise in blood pressure (BP) during or&#xD;
      immediately after haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrologists have yet to arrive at a standard definition of IDH. Definitions vary widely&#xD;
      from systolic blood pressure rises of ≥ 10mmHg, rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during&#xD;
      dialysis &gt; 15mmHg to hypertension that appears resistant to ultrafiltration during or&#xD;
      immediately after dialysis.1 Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of IDH varies&#xD;
      between 5-15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phenomenon may appear trivial to the inexperienced doctor. However, IDH increases the&#xD;
      risk of hospitalization and death as reported in the Crit-Line Intradialytic Monitoring&#xD;
      Benefit Study (CLIMB) and United States Renal Data System (USRDS) haemodialysis study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of IDH is unclear. A number of factors have been implicated and probably&#xD;
      work synergistically to promote the rise in BP. These include: subclinical volume overload,&#xD;
      activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, sodium gain during dialysis, use of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) and&#xD;
      removal of anti-hypertensive agents during dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of IDH relies heavily on control of sodium and fluid dynamics. There are no&#xD;
      randomized controlled studies to guide management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Determine the prevalence of IDH at four haemodialysis units in the Western Cape&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To examine the association between IDH and the following potential risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradialytic weight gain, the presence and/or degree of fluid overload as assessed by&#xD;
      bioimpedance monitoring, quantity and timing of anti-hypertensive drugs, ESA dose and route&#xD;
      of administration, time-averaged sodium concentration, dialysate calcium concentrations and&#xD;
      haemodialysis modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre, cross-sectional study on chronic haemodialysis patients at four adult dialysis&#xD;
      units in the Western Cape will be conducted.IDH will be defined as a rise of ≥10mmHg in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure between pre- and post-dialysis in at least 4 out of six dialysis&#xD;
      sessions. Patients screened as eligible for inclusion in the study will be identified from&#xD;
      haemodialysis charts by the primary investigator (PI). They will then be approached by the&#xD;
      PI, who will try to obtain informed consent. Once informed consent has been obtained and no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are present, the patient will be enrolled. A study ID number will be&#xD;
      allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a standard operating protocol (SOP), weight, BP, pulse rate, bioimpedance,&#xD;
      ultrafiltration rates and volumes will be determined before, hourly during dialysis and 30&#xD;
      minutes after completion of dialysis. Timing and use of antihypertensive drugs, ESA use,&#xD;
      dialysis modality, intradialytic calcium and time averaged sodium levels will be determined.&#xD;
      All data extracted will be captured onto a standardised data sheet.&#xD;
