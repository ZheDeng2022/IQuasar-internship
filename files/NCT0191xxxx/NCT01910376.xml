  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a disease of the elderly. Cancer incidence is 11-fold higher in persons over the&#xD;
      age of 65, than in younger ones. Approximately 60% of all cancers and 70% of cancer mortality&#xD;
      occurs in people older than 65 years. Moreover, due to the aging of the population in the&#xD;
      Western world the number of elderly people is expected to increase and therefore the number&#xD;
      of older cancer patients is expected to rise. Despite this rapid increase in cancer incidence&#xD;
      and cancer-related mortality with age, our knowledge about ageing and cancer and about&#xD;
      optimal treatment for older cancer patients is still far from adequate. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      clear that cancer in the elderly is a major and increasing health problem. A key problem in&#xD;
      geriatric oncology research is the important selection bias because very old/frail patients,&#xD;
      are very rarely included in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the patterns of health care delivery have shifted the care of the elderly from&#xD;
      acute care settings to the community and long-term care facilities. As the European&#xD;
      population ages, more and more people will become nursing home residents, many of whom will&#xD;
      have a suspicion of, or be diagnosed with, and eventually die from, cancer. Although cancer&#xD;
      is very common in elderly nursing home residents, it is poorly studied. This lack of&#xD;
      information may impact on clinical decision making and the appropriateness of treatments&#xD;
      offered and therefore collection of this information is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has two main objectives. The first objective is to report on demographics,&#xD;
      referral patterns and motives for non-referral, anti-cancer treatments and outcome of&#xD;
      patients in nursing homes with suspected or diagnosed active invasive cancer where a&#xD;
      diagnostic or treatment decision has to be taken. The second objective is to develop better&#xD;
      prognostic tools (for survival) including biological markers of ageing to help treatment&#xD;
      decisions in the elderly.&#xD;

&#xD;
