    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of intraoperative intravenous dextrose&#xD;
      in preventing POV in pediatric population undergoing dental day surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative vomiting (POV) in children is a frequent complication. Studies using&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) fluids containing dextrose in the perioperative period have shown&#xD;
      improvement of POV in adults. Similar studies have not been done in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing that Intravenous (IV) fluids containing dextrose are safe and commonly used in the&#xD;
      paediatric population, this intervention could potentially reduce the amount of rescue&#xD;
      antiemetic medications and improve recovery in same-day surgery paediatric patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-inferiority randomized control trial of healthy children (3-9 years old) undergoing&#xD;
      ambulatory dental surgery was conducted to investigate the efficacy of intraoperative IV&#xD;
      fluids containing dextrose for antiemetic prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (146 participants) received dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV) and ondansetron&#xD;
      (0.05 mg/kg IV); the intervention group (144) received dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg IV) and&#xD;
      intravenous 5% dextrose in 0.9% normal saline (D5NS) as per a weight based maintenance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients underwent a general anesthetic maintained with a volatile anesthetic. There was not&#xD;
      a standardized protocol for anesthetic induction and maintenance, and all types and doses of&#xD;
      anesthetic medications were chosen and administered at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Intraoperative administration of any other antiemetic medications&#xD;
      constituted protocol violation and excluded the patient from analysis. There were no&#xD;
      modifications to the planned dental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once IV access was established and the patient was intubated, the maintenance study solution&#xD;
      was connected and infused throughout the operative period. Additional fluid (Ringer's&#xD;
      Lactate) was available to the anesthesiologists to administer as per their preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug was administered to the patient by the anesthesiologist at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure, when the throat packing was removed and the IV maintenance study solution was&#xD;
      stopped. Before emergence from anesthesia, the researcher measured and recorded the patient's&#xD;
      blood sugar via a chemstrip (AccuCheck aviva Â®). Ringer's Lactate IV fluid, not part of study&#xD;
      protocol, was continued in recovery based on the anesthesiologist's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were transferred to the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure. Discharge from the PACU was based on the Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System&#xD;
      (PADSS) and institutional guidelines. Nursing staff and researchers recorded the presence and&#xD;
      incidence of POV in the PACU. Analgesics and antiemetic agents were prescribed by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist during the recovery period and given according to nursing assessment based&#xD;
      on institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers phoned participants 24 hours after discharge to inquire about incidence of emesis&#xD;
      and any need to seek medical attention after being discharged from the institution.&#xD;
