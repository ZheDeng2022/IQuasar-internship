    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a range of single oral&#xD;
      doses of LGD-6972 in healthy subjects. Additionally, the study will characterize the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic profile in healthy subjects under fed and fasted conditions and in subjects&#xD;
      with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus under fasted conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, sequential, ascending, single oral&#xD;
      dose study conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will consist of evaluation of LGD-6972 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects (6 groups of 8 subjects each),and will be followed by Part 2, evaluation of LGD-6972&#xD;
      in subjects with T2DM (1 group of 8 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a Screening Period of up to 30 days. Subjects who qualify for Group G (T2DM)&#xD;
      will discontinue any anti-diabetic medication on Day -9 (1 week prior to confinement) for&#xD;
      that group. Subjects in Groups A, B, C, D, E and F will be admitted to the study site on Day&#xD;
      -1 , and Group G will be admitted to the study site on Day -2. Groups of 8 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either LGD-6972 or placebo (6 active:2&#xD;
      placebo) as a single dose. Group D will receive treatment under fasted and fed conditions&#xD;
      separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and up to 21 days. Each subject will be&#xD;
      administered a specified dose of LGD-6972 or placebo under fasting conditions (and fed&#xD;
      conditions for Group D to evaluate the effects of food on the LGD-6972 PK profile) and will&#xD;
      be observed through the morning of Day 3 (48 hour post dose assessment). Safety assessments,&#xD;
      LGD-6972 PK sample collection, and PD assessments will occur during this time. Subjects will&#xD;
      be discharged from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to the study site&#xD;
      on Day 7 for a follow up evaluation. After the follow up evaluation for each subject and&#xD;
      evaluation of all safety and tolerability data, and any available PK data, the dose for the&#xD;
      next group of subjects will be determined by the Safety Monitoring Panel (SMP).&#xD;
