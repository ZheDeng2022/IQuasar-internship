    <textblock>
      The main goal for this pilot level study is to correlate ultrasound elastography technique&#xD;
      with more standard clinically based outcome measures within the setting of a small sample&#xD;
      sized group of patients affected by moderate-to- severe, chronic (&gt; 6 months) midsubstance&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy (AT). Investigators will conduct a 24-week, 2-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      pilot study to determine whether novel elastography techniques (AE) and shear wave imaging&#xD;
      (SWI), a new quantitative method of ultrasound (US) imaging, correlate with valid clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures (VISA-A and conventional US). Methods will be based on recently published&#xD;
      clinical trials of autologous blood injections for treating AT and will incorporate novel US&#xD;
      outcome measures of Achilles tendon appearance and stiffness, i.e. elasticity. The results of&#xD;
      this multi-disciplinary pilot study will be used to help plan a separate larger scaled study&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy for Achilles tendinopathy in&#xD;
      which elastography will be included as a potential outcome measure and also correlated with&#xD;
      standard clinical outcome surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and function will be evaluated by self-report using a validated clinical outcome&#xD;
      questionnaire (VISA-A). Disease modification will be assessed by novel US-based AE and SWI&#xD;
      methods for stiffness changes (biomechanical) and correlated with morphologic changes using&#xD;
      conventional US. A larger study that will evaluate the effects of PRP in healing AT, while&#xD;
      correlating with elastography assessment, will include a sham injection arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Subjects assigned to the PRP group will then receive the PRP injection under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. The injection will take about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a palpatory and ultrasound Achilles tendon exam. Tender areas&#xD;
      associated with the Achilles tendon will be identified. Physical exam will be followed by&#xD;
      Achilles tendon ultrasound which will serve as visual guidance for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the injection session, the research nurse will perform a single standard antecubital blood&#xD;
      draw (35 mL). The PRP will be obtained from this sample using a two-stage spinning technique:&#xD;
      the 1st separates red blood cells from platelets, and the 2nd concentrates the platelets to&#xD;
      yield approximately 4 mL of concentrated autologous platelet. This layer of platelet rich&#xD;
      plasma will be placed in the syringe by the centrifuge machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet counts of subjects' whole blood and PRP processed blood will be analyzed. Platelet&#xD;
      counts in whole blood vary by individual. The optimal quantity of platelets and growth&#xD;
      factors required for tissue healing is not known, but a clinically effective concentration&#xD;
      has been described as being greater than 4 times baseline autologous whole blood platelet&#xD;
      concentrations. Therefore, platelet concentration yield may have important implications in&#xD;
      clinical outcome correlation. In order to validate consistent platelet concentration yields&#xD;
      across subjects, investigators will sample 1 mL of whole blood (approximately one lab&#xD;
      Vacutainer) and an additional 1 mL of platelet rich plasma for lab analysis of platelet&#xD;
      concentration using a standard lab automated analyzer. This extra 1 ml of whole blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at the same time that the 35 ml described above is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 ml of platelet rich plasma will be injected into the subject's Achilles tendon. The&#xD;
      specimens will not be kept or stored. The blood will be analyzed on the same day as the&#xD;
      procedure is being performed. This will not require storing of the specimen and prevent&#xD;
      erroneous labeling of platelet concentration with a different subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the injections, the subject will rest for 5 minutes. Participants will be given&#xD;
      acetaminophen for &quot;as-needed&quot; analgesia and will be telephoned after 3 days to inquire about&#xD;
      side effects or adverse events. Subjects will be placed in a boot for two weeks with gradual&#xD;
      return to activity. Subjects will also be provided crutches to be non-weight bearing for 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan The data and safety monitoring plan to be implemented in this&#xD;
      study consists, in part, of a monthly staff meeting to discuss subject enrollment, safety,&#xD;
      and retention. These meetings are intended to monitor participant study flow from initial&#xD;
      eligibility assessment to study completion. Standing agenda items for these meetings will be&#xD;
      side effects, adverse events and participant retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unanticipated adverse events and complications will be evaluated and treated if necessary by&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and the primary Co-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following processes will help ensure the timely detection, evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Principal Investigator and the primary Co-Investigator will screen subjects for&#xD;
           adverse events prior to treatment with PRP. Standardized forms will be used for&#xD;
           monitoring and reporting of adverse events. The PI will be immediately available to&#xD;
           staff via cell phone in case of a serious adverse event. The PI will immediately report&#xD;
           serious adverse events to the UW Research Subjects Advocate using standardized forms.&#xD;
           Reports will be made using the subject identification number without other identifying&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Autologous injection of PRP has been found to be safe. The system being used was chosen&#xD;
           for its closed system to prevent contamination and for its ease of use. Although safe,&#xD;
           internal monitoring of PRP injection safety will also be performed. The study&#xD;
           coordinator will assess each PRP injection subject 3 days after treatment with the&#xD;
           following question during a brief telephone interview: &quot;Do you think that you have had&#xD;
           any side effects from the injection you've received?&quot; [If &quot;Yes&quot;] &quot;Please tell me more&#xD;
           about that.&quot; Information regarding side effects and adverse events will be made&#xD;
           available to the PI, who will decide if the subject requires further medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators do not expect serious adverse events (SAEs) but are well equipped to manage&#xD;
      them. Investigators have not seen significant adverse events in combined (UW Radiology and&#xD;
      Sports Medicine) clinic use of PRP. Subjects with reactions to acetaminophen or injections&#xD;
      have the option to call study personnel at any time. The PI and the primary Co-Investigator&#xD;
      will share on-call duty for subjects with adverse events through a pager on a 24/7 basis.&#xD;
      Subjects who require significant evaluation and care will be referred to the UW Hospital&#xD;
      Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events from a diagnostic ultrasound are extremely unlikely because ultrasound is&#xD;
      considered to have non-significant risk by the FDA. All study procedures will be monitored&#xD;
      and documented, and in the unlikely situation where an adverse event occurs, it will be&#xD;
      followed to resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI(a Board-Certified radiologist) will assess whether the findings should be reported to&#xD;
      subjects. Findings that would be reported are those considered clinically relevant. Findings&#xD;
      that are considered normal variants (eg. variant anatomy) or clinically insignificant (eg.&#xD;
      simple hepatic cyst) will not be reported. Clinically relevant findings will be reported to&#xD;
      the subject within 24 hours of the scan, and will also be reported to the subject's physician&#xD;
      according to whether the subject has indicated a desire for this in the consent form.&#xD;
