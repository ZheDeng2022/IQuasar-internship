  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall project goal is to build a database of childhood cancers associated with&#xD;
      developmental anomalies; it aims at identifying new syndromes of genetic predisposition and&#xD;
      at enabling the further study of their molecular basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the solid cancers arising in the childhood develop from embryonic tissues. The&#xD;
      frequent association of paediatric cancers and abnormalities of the development underlines&#xD;
      the link between oncogenesis and embryogenesis. However, beside the known malformative&#xD;
      syndromes predisposing to one or several types of tumours with a variable penetrance (NF1,&#xD;
      Wiedemann-Beckwith, Denys-Drash, Fanconi disease), associations between abnormalities of the&#xD;
      development and tumours are badly known and little investigated, and are not listed at&#xD;
      present systematically in the registers of child cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytogenetic exploration of malformative syndromes associated to tumours historically&#xD;
      allowed to describe constitutional chromosomal abnormalities of major interest for the&#xD;
      understanding of oncogenesis pathways of the most frequent sporadic tumours (del 11p13 and&#xD;
      WT1; del 13q14 and Rb1). So, a rare and even exceptional clinical presentation can enrich the&#xD;
      knowledge of a common pathology. Our objective is to analyze in a detailed and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary way the largest number of possible cases of unusual presentation&#xD;
      associating pediatric Tumor And abnormality of Development (TAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of developmental abnormalities in pediatric patients with cancer&#xD;
           retrospectively and prospectively for a period of three years on a nationwide scale&#xD;
           Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to record tumoral pathologies in known contexts of cancer predisposition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to record tumoral pathologies occurring in association with one or more developmental&#xD;
           anomaly, these associations might have been already described or not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify and locate the biological samples of patients registered in coordination&#xD;
           with the national pediatric biobank project&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to characterize the molecular basis of the identified associations between developmental&#xD;
           abnormalities and tumors. These molecular studies are not straight included in the&#xD;
           present project specifically, but should be further conducted on the basis of the&#xD;
           clinical data and thanks to the biobank network.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a biannual analysis of aggregated data by a steering committee will be done to identify&#xD;
           informative associations that warrant further clinical studies and biological data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological studies will be performed in conjunction with local investigators and&#xD;
           officials of the local biobank, and in coordination with the operation of BIOCAP&#xD;
