    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether two commonly-prescribed antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) have different effects on brain function and&#xD;
      cognition in schizophrenia patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia have significant problems in thinking, referred to as cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, which make it difficult for them to function well, and have no effective&#xD;
      treatment at this time. A number of existing medications currently used in other medical or&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions have been considered, however, none of them has yet shown unequivocal&#xD;
      signs of effectiveness for these problems in schizophrenia. One important reason for this,&#xD;
      that has not been properly tested, is how antipsychotic treatment may affect the impact of&#xD;
      these newer medications for cognition. In the present study, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      how two different antipsychotic medications may have a different impact on the brain&#xD;
      processes that give rise to important cognitive functions that are impaired in schizophrenia.&#xD;
      They will conduct functional MRI in schizophrenia patients while they perform a cognitive&#xD;
      task, both before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone.&#xD;
      Then the investigators will evaluate the effects of a new medication called modafinil, and&#xD;
      how it may improve brain and cognitive function, depending on which antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      the patients are taking. The results of this study may inform researchers, doctors and&#xD;
      patients about how to understand the effects of these drugs on the brain and cognition, and&#xD;
      which treatments might be best to improve cognition in schizophrenia, in order to improve&#xD;
      these patients' ability to function in their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 right-handed adults with schizophrenia and no significant medical or neurological illness&#xD;
      (18-30 years old) will 1) undergo fMRI during performance of a cognitive control task, then&#xD;
      2) randomize to an 8-week, double-blind antipsychotic treatment trial, followed by 3) repeat&#xD;
      fMRI in a single-dose, counterbalanced study of Modafinil (one 200 milligram oral add-on&#xD;
      dose) vs. Placebo (Placebo). Neuroimaging measures will be the primary endpoint, cognition&#xD;
      secondary, and symptoms an exploratory endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnoses will be made by SCID-I and DSM-IV-TR criteria, by a PhD or MD clinician (with&#xD;
      demonstrated reliability), followed by consensus. A research pharmacist will randomly assign&#xD;
      treatment (without stratification), and package ARI and RIS in identical-appearing capsules.&#xD;
      A blinded clinician will measure symptoms within 3 days before antipsychotic initiation and&#xD;
      weekly thereafter; adjust doses based on weekly evaluations of symptoms and side effects, and&#xD;
      evaluate treatment adherence and substance use. The diagnostician, pharmacist and treating&#xD;
      psychiatrist are otherwise uninvolved in the study. Low-dose benztropine (≤2 mg daily),&#xD;
      lorazepam (≤1 mg daily) and antidepressant treatment will be permitted, but not adrenergic&#xD;
      agents or anticonvulsants. Initiation, stepped, and maximal antipsychotic doses will&#xD;
      respectively be: ARI (7.5, 7.5 and 30 mg, daily); RIS (2, 2 and 8 mg daily). If patients do&#xD;
      not tolerate the treatment (at the minimal dose), or exhibit treatment-refractory symptoms&#xD;
      (at the highest tolerated dose), they will discontinue the study, the blind broken, and&#xD;
      transition into naturalistic treatment in the clinic. Receptor antagonist loads (daily dose X&#xD;
      Haldol equivalent) will be computed for patients at unblinding, using indices for α2 and α1&#xD;
      receptors, D2 and muscarinic receptors. In the last half of the 8th week of antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment, subjects will undergo fMRI on two days, separated by one day for modafinil&#xD;
      washout. They will receive modafinil (200 mg po) on one day and Placebo on the other&#xD;
      (double-blind, counterbalanced), each in mid-morning, and scan 3-4 hours later, during the&#xD;
      average peak plasma levels of modafinil 30. All subjects will provide informed consent for&#xD;
      all procedures, approved by the UCSF IRB. This study will meet the CONSORT standard for&#xD;
      clinical trial design, conduct and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      functional MRI. 3 Tesla Siemens Timm Trio with 8 channel coil will be used for event-related&#xD;
      fMRI, with single-shot, T2*-weighted sequence, (TR 2000 ms, TE 30 ms, flip angle 90°, FOV 220&#xD;
      x 220 mm, 36 contiguous axial oblique slices, 3.4 mm isotropic voxels). A structural MRI&#xD;
      (MP-RAGE) will be acquired for normalization of EPI images. Pre-processing will include&#xD;
      spatial realignment, slice timing correction, spatial normalization to T1 template, 8mm&#xD;
      smoothing kernel. The GLM will be used with HRF convolved with a series of delta functions,&#xD;
      and regressors for Task events, for each combination of Modafinil and Placebo and either Cue&#xD;
      or Target. Errors/no-response trials are modeled separately. The functional connectivity&#xD;
      analysis will use an LC-seeded beta series method; each event modeled uniquely and the time&#xD;
      series of betas (segregated by task/treatment condition) correlated with the seed at every&#xD;
      voxel. The LC will be localized in EPI images with a mask in MNI space, derived from voxels&#xD;
      meeting these criteria: A) located in rostrodorsal pons, adjacent to 4th ventricle/sylvian&#xD;
      aqueduct, restricted to an anatomically-defined dorsal pontine mask (e.g., not extending&#xD;
      rostrally into the mesencephalon or superiorly into the 4th ventricle; and B) showing&#xD;
      significant association with in-scanner pupil diameter, using this as a parametric regressor&#xD;
      in GLM of BOLD time series, in an independent, healthy sample without treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To test whether aripiprazole preserves LC, PFC and cognitive control function&#xD;
      to a greater degree than risperidone in schizophrenia outpatients. Hypothesis 1. ARI group&#xD;
      will exhibit greater task-related PFC activity and LC-PFC connectivity than RIS group, after&#xD;
      8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment: (post-antipsychotic Placebo) vs. (pre-antipsychotic&#xD;
      Baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2A. To test whether aripiprazole is superior to risperidone in permitting&#xD;
      modafinil enhancement of LC and PFC activity and cognition. Hypothesis 2A. The ARI group, vs.&#xD;
      RIS group, will exhibit 2A) greater effects of Modafinil (vs. Placebo) on task-related LC&#xD;
      activity and greater cognitive control task improvement. Specific Aim 2B. To test the role of&#xD;
      α2 autoreceptor antagonism by antipsychotic medications as a source of blunted LC response to&#xD;
      Modafinil. Hypothesis 2B. Across groups (ARI+RIS), α2 autoreceptor antagonist load correlates&#xD;
      with impaired Modafinil effects (vs. Placebo) on task-related LC activity and cognitive&#xD;
      control performance. These aims are related but not interdependent: antipsychotic effects on&#xD;
      LC/PFC/cognitive function, vs. antipsychotic effects in moderating modafinil actions on these&#xD;
      same measures, represent distinct research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 will be tested with the contrast indicated as per the Aim 1 Prediction in the&#xD;
      table above. This is analogous to a directional test of the Group-by-Time-by-Task&#xD;
      interaction. Hypothesis 2A will be tested as per the Aim 2 Prediction in the table. We&#xD;
      predict that ARI treatment supports greater task-related Modafinil effects on LC activity,&#xD;
      vs. RIS treatment. Hypothesis 2B will be tested across all patients by correlating α2 load&#xD;
      (by antipsychotics) with mean task-related LC betas from the Treatment X Task Condition&#xD;
      contrast. Significance for all analyses is set at p&lt;.05, FDR-corrected, or using the LC as&#xD;
      SVC, as appropriate. Accuracy and RT cost will be tested by ANOVA.&#xD;
