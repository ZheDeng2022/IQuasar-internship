  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the clinical and cost impact of Rotarix vaccinations among&#xD;
      children aged less than 5 years using insurance claims data from commercial plans and&#xD;
      Medicaid low-income population. The impact of incomplete and complete Rotarix vaccination&#xD;
      will also be examined, overall and stratified by calendar time of Rotarix vaccination (e.g.,&#xD;
      2008 onward).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insurance claims data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database&#xD;
      {MarketScan Commercial (2000-2010)} and the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database&#xD;
      {MarketScan Medicaid (2002-2009)} will be analyzed separately; no merging of the databases&#xD;
      will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The claims data extracts are fully de-identified and compliant with the Health Insurance&#xD;
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (U.S.) (HIPAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be observed from birth to the earliest of end of continuous eligibility&#xD;
      (due to disenrollment, data cut-off, or death) or 5 years of age. Observation time will be&#xD;
      classified using two different definitions of Rotarix vaccination coverage, and analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted for each different scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two definitions for Rotarix vaccination coverage are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization&#xD;
           Practices (ACIP)-specified vaccination window of 6 weeks to 8 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Rotarix prescribing information&#xD;
           (PI) window of 6 weeks to 6 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be analysed for 1) vaccination coverage according to compliance with the&#xD;
      ACIP vaccination window, and 2) vaccination coverage according to compliance with PI&#xD;
      vaccination window; for both Rotarix vaccination coverage scenarios there will be four&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 'complete Rotarix vaccination off-ACIP/off-PI' cohort will be created if more&#xD;
      than 5 percent of total person-time in the four cohorts would be complete vaccination if&#xD;
      vaccine doses outside of the vaccination window were considered.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuously enrolled from birth. (Note: Due to the absence of birth dates in&#xD;
             insurance claims data, this inclusion criterion will be met if a child's year of first&#xD;
             enrollment and year of birth are the same. If so, then the date of first enrollment&#xD;
             will be used as proxy for date of birth.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received both medical and pharmacy benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled in capitation-based health plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For MarketScan Commercial, residence in states with universal vaccination programs&#xD;
             that include the RV vaccine or where RV vaccine inclusion cannot be ascertained (i.e.,&#xD;
             Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Maine, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon,&#xD;
             Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any Rotateq vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lost to follow-up prior to end of vaccination window or had RV prior to end of&#xD;
             vaccination window.&#xD;
