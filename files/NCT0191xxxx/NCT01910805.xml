  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) have a substantially increased risk of&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes. In fact, 50-70% of these women will go on to develop type 2&#xD;
      diabetes within the 20 years following their GDM-complicated pregnancy. Perceived risk of&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes among women with a history of GDM may be particularly important to&#xD;
      altering behavior changes associated with reducing risk. Certain populations have lower&#xD;
      perceived risk of developing type 2 diabetes, despite having a higher prevalence of the&#xD;
      disease. Specifically, African-Americans have a lower perceived risk of developing type 2&#xD;
      diabetes compared to whites, despite their more than doubled risk of developing the disease.&#xD;
      Improvement in awareness of diabetes risk among African-American women at high-risk of&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes, such as those with a history of GDM, could reduce future risk of&#xD;
      this disease among this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, we will conduct a two-armed, pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a&#xD;
      postpartum diabetes education intervention, incorporating nutrition, exercise, and diabetes&#xD;
      risk assessment can improve diabetes risk awareness, diet, and physical activity levels at&#xD;
      1-year post-pregnancy among African-American women with a recent history of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that attendance at a 3-month and 9-month postpartum diabetes education class&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve diabetes awareness as measured using the Risk Perception for Developing Diabetes&#xD;
           among women in the intervention group compared to women in the control group when&#xD;
           measuring at 3-months postpartum compared to 12-months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve dietary habits and physical activity levels in the intervention group compared&#xD;
           to the control group when measuring at 3-months postpartum compared to 12-months&#xD;
           postpartum&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be recruited from the Brigham and Women's Hospital's (BWH)Diabetes and&#xD;
      Pregnancy Program. Obstetricians will assist in the study by introducing the study to women&#xD;
      with gestational diabetes (GDM), who are currently in their third trimester of pregnancy and&#xD;
      asking the women to which race/ethnicity do they self-identify. Those women who self-identify&#xD;
      as Black or African-American will be told by their health care provider that a Research&#xD;
      Assistant from our study would like to speak with them about our study after their&#xD;
      appointment and that the study is only for research purposes and is not mandatory for their&#xD;
      treatment or care at BWH, but is on voluntary basis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Research Assistant will approach all women who self-identify as African-American and have&#xD;
      GDM, who are in their third trimester (as identified by the obstetrician). For women who are&#xD;
      interested in learning more about the study, but do not have time to hear more about it&#xD;
      during the initial contact, the Research Assistant will obtain their contact information to&#xD;
      describe the study and discuss the woman's possible participation at a later point in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those women who have time to learn more about the study immediately following their&#xD;
      obstetrics appointment at BWH, our Research Assistant will take women into a private room&#xD;
      within the obstetrics clinic and provide them with general information about the study. If a&#xD;
      woman is interested, we will ask the woman a set of screening questions to assess their&#xD;
      eligibility. The screening questions will not include any personal identifying information&#xD;
      and will only be collected to determine eligibility and response rates. If eligible for&#xD;
      participation in our study, we will collect the eligible woman's contact information and&#xD;
      provide the woman with an informed consent form to be reviewed and signed either at that time&#xD;
      to our Research Assistant or returned to us by mail using a provided stamped, addressed&#xD;
      envelope within 2 weeks of having received the form. Description of the study, confirmation&#xD;
      of contact information, administration of the screening questionnaire, and receipt and review&#xD;
      of consent documents will occur similarly by phone for those women who were not available to&#xD;
      learn more about the study immediately following their obstetrics visit, but who expressed&#xD;
      interests in learning more about the study at a later time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that women have until 3 months post-pregnancy to be enrolled in our study, we will also&#xD;
      use a flyer with a detachable card and a brochure to try to recruit women during their 6-week&#xD;
      postnatal visit, as well as at the time of delivery, during their hospital stay. These&#xD;
      additional recruitment time points will maximize recruitment efforts. Recruitment at the&#xD;
      6-week postnatal visit will be similar to that described above for the third trimester clinic&#xD;
      visit. For those women that we attempt to recruit at the time of delivery, we will have an&#xD;
      obstetrician notify us of a delivering woman, who has self-identified as African-American and&#xD;
      had GDM during her recent pregnancy. Our Research Assistant will approach women on the Labor&#xD;
      and Delivery floor after the woman's delivery. At this time the study will be explained to&#xD;
      her and the woman will be asked to answer screening questions, if she is interested in the&#xD;
      study. An informed consent will be provided, if the woman is eligible. The woman can either&#xD;
      complete the informed consent at that time or return it to our study staff within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon return of the signed informed consent form, we will enroll the woman in the study and&#xD;
      randomize her to receive either the study intervention or standard care. We will ensure&#xD;
      balance in this process through the use of block randomization. At this time point, our&#xD;
      research assistant will assist with scheduling the woman's 6-week postpartum follow-up visit,&#xD;
      which is a part of her standard medical care. This assistance with scheduling, will aid in&#xD;
      making sure that the potential study participant receives her 6-week postpartum diabetes&#xD;
      screening. If she fails the screening, then she will be notified by a study clinician and&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who do not return the consent form within 2-weeks of having initially received it&#xD;
      from our research assistant, we will re-contact the woman to follow-up with her about her&#xD;
      interest in participating in the study. Eligible women will be re-contacted either by phone&#xD;
      or e-mail, based on the woman's preferred method of contact, up to three times, to obtain the&#xD;
      informed consent. After the third unsuccessful re-contact, we will stop attempts to obtain&#xD;
      the consent form. We will also not re-contact a woman, if they state they are no longer&#xD;
      interested in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, as a part of enrollment into the study, we will obtain e-mail addresses and mailing&#xD;
      addresses of our study participants (see Script C1). We will also obtain telephone&#xD;
      information in order to call or text the woman, if this is her preferred contact method. At&#xD;
      3-months we will send a secure web link for completion of the 3-months web-based&#xD;
      questionnaire to be completed by the woman. For women without internet access or those who do&#xD;
      not wish to complete the questionnaire online, we will mail a paper-version of the&#xD;
      questionnaire at 3-months postpartum. Likewise, a web link or paper questionnaires will be&#xD;
      sent at 6-months, 9-months, and 12-months postpartum. If we have not received the completed&#xD;
      questionnaire, we will contact the study participant by phone to determine whether she&#xD;
      received the initial questionnaire and if she has any questions. All women enrolled in the&#xD;
      study (both the intervention group and standard care group) will be asked to complete these&#xD;
      questionnaires. We will also send a text reminder for those women who listed text as a&#xD;
      preferred method of contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those women enrolled in the intervention arm, the research assistant will contact them&#xD;
      via phone to schedule them for their 3-month and 9-month class to be held at a local&#xD;
      community centers. Two weeks before the class we will send a reminder card either via e-mail,&#xD;
      text message, or postal mail. Two days before the class our Research Assistant will contact&#xD;
      the women by phone to remind them of the class, location, and time. Women will also be&#xD;
      reminded at this time to bring a favorite recipe to the class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will attend classes mentioned at the aforementioned centers. Each&#xD;
      class will take 2-hours and be conducted by a Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative&#xD;
      (CITI) certified registered nutritionist familiar with working in the GDM population and with&#xD;
      extensive experience working in the African-American community. Both classes will include a&#xD;
      cooking demonstration. In addition, the class will include a tour of a local supermarket to&#xD;
      aid women in identifying healthy food choices. The classes will cover the following material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-month class:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introductions: Nutritionist/Life coach will introduce herself and will encourage others&#xD;
           to introduce themselves on a first name basis only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overview of class and class guidelines: Nutritionist/Life coach will provide an overview&#xD;
           of the material to be covered as well as class guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes Risk Awareness: Focus on diabetes risk factors, as well as symptoms of&#xD;
           diabetes, and lifestyle factors that can reduce diabetes risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Review Weight Loss Goals: Subjects will weigh in at each visit: Discuss the benefit of&#xD;
           weight loss on the reduction of risk of future type 2 diabetes in the mom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Good Nutrition, Healthy Plate and Portions: Review portion sizes using handouts. There&#xD;
           will also be a focus on adding fruits and vegetables, learning about healthy versus&#xD;
           unhealthy fat, as well as label reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Infant feeding: Review/discuss the benefits of breastfeeding for mom and the baby&#xD;
           including reducing maternal weight retention, and reducing infant and child obesity.&#xD;
           Review optimal timing of introduction of solid foods and types of foods healthy for your&#xD;
           child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ways to reduce your diabetes risk: Discussion of lifestyle factors that can reduce your&#xD;
           diabetes risk, including physical activity and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Exercise Basics: Review options for moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise and&#xD;
           strength training, including walking and the use of resistance bands, and discuss&#xD;
           exercise goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Making Your Recipes Healthy: Focus on adapting popular recipes, as well as those of&#xD;
           study participants to make them healthy. Participants will be asked to submit one&#xD;
           favorite family recipe at the beginning of the study. The group will work together to&#xD;
           modify all the recipes using healthy substitutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Cooking Demonstration: The nutritionist/group teacher will prepare a healthy meal during&#xD;
           the class time. This will showcase healthy food choices, measuring and food preparation&#xD;
           skills, as well as methods of cooking. Class participants will be welcomed to partake in&#xD;
           the meal, once prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 month class:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of Diabetes and Diabetes Risk Awareness: Review diabetes risk factors, prevention&#xD;
           measures used to reduce diabetes risk, and signs and symptoms of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review Weight Loss Goals: Subjects will weigh in at this time point and discuss the&#xD;
           benefits of weight loss on the reduction of risk of future type 2 diabetes in the mom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Eating Healthy, Healthy Plate and Portions: Review portion sizes using handouts. We will&#xD;
           re-emphasize the importance of adding fruits and vegetables, and discuss healthy and&#xD;
           unhealthy fats based on current dietary habits. Also, focus on label reading&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Supermarket Smarts, Label reading and Dining Out: Tips for making healthy choices at the&#xD;
           grocery store. Review how to make healthier choices when dining out, with instruction&#xD;
           including a sample restaurant menu. In addition, participants will become familiar with&#xD;
           how to read food labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of barriers to healthy lifestyle: Participants will discuss with&#xD;
           nutritionist/group teacher issues surrounding healthy eating, barriers to physical&#xD;
           activity and other healthy lifestyle behaviors associated with reduced risk of diabetes.&#xD;
           Discussion will focus on solutions to overcoming these barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cooking Demonstration: The nutritionist/group teacher will provide a prepare and cook a&#xD;
           health meal during the class time. This will showcase healthy food choices, measuring&#xD;
           and food preparation skills, as well as methods of cooking. Class participants will be&#xD;
           welcomed to partake in the meal, once prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women in the intervention group, onsite childcare at the Boys and Girls Club will be made&#xD;
      a possible option through the use of already-certified childcare providers. We will also&#xD;
      offer women the option of covering childcare at home for 4-hours (to cover commuting time, as&#xD;
      well as the time for the 2-hour class) per session. Description of this compensation will be&#xD;
      discussed below. If necessary, women will be allowed to bring their infant children to the&#xD;
      class to ensure the woman is able to attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the class, the woman will be asked a set of qualitative questions&#xD;
      regarding the class information and structure to better inform a larger, future intervention.&#xD;
