      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Vaginal yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida. Candida can live harmlessly&#xD;
      in the vagina, but most women will have symptoms from a vaginal yeast infection at some point&#xD;
      during their life. Antibiotics increase the risk for yeast infections, but it is unclear why.&#xD;
      They may disrupt the balance of healthy bacteria in the vagina. This could make it harder for&#xD;
      the body to fight off yeast infections. Researchers will give healthy women a common&#xD;
      antibiotic or a placebo. They will study how the antibiotic affects bacteria and yeast in the&#xD;
      vagina and other parts of the body. This will let researchers study the normal changes of&#xD;
      healthy bacteria and yeast over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how the study drug changes healthy bacteria in the vagina, and how these changes may&#xD;
      increase the risk for yeast infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy women ages 18 to 40 who are not allergic to penicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam (including vaginal&#xD;
           exam), blood tests and tests for sexually transmitted diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must take birth control pills for at least 3 months before, and during the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study antibiotic or placebo for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 7 study visits over 3 months. Visits will be timed around&#xD;
           participants menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the visits, participants will answer questions about their health and undergo tests.&#xD;
           These may include swabs of the vagina, mouth and skin as well as blood tests. Vaginal&#xD;
           fluid, saliva and urine will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between visits, participants will collect stool and vaginal samples at home and bring&#xD;
           them to the next clinic visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is a prospective, interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      longitudinal study designed to investigate the microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that&#xD;
      lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in women who receive antibiotics. VVC is the most&#xD;
      common fungal infection affecting women. Although asymptomatic vaginal Candida colonization&#xD;
      occurs in ~10-20% of healthy women, ~75% of women will experience at least one episode of&#xD;
      symptomatic VVC during their lifetime. Nonetheless, the local mucosal factors that allow&#xD;
      Candida to convert from a commensal organism to an opportunistic pathogen are not well&#xD;
      defined. Antibiotic use (particularly beta-lactams) is a well-recognized risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of VVC in healthy women, suggesting that alterations in the endogenous vaginal&#xD;
      microbial flora results in deregulation of local mucosal anti-Candida immune responses.&#xD;
      However, which commensal vaginal microbiota are important for protection against Candida&#xD;
      infection, and the mechanism(s) whereby vaginal microbiota influence the local mucosal immune&#xD;
      response against Candida, remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, healthy women of reproductive age will receive a 10-day course of&#xD;
      amoxicillin (a broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic) or a placeboand will undergo vaginal&#xD;
      sampling for microbiomic and immunologic analyses before, during and after antibiotic&#xD;
      administration over a 90-day period. The hypothesis of this study is that women who develop&#xD;
      amoxicillin-associated VVC will have a characteristic microbiomic profile (as compared to&#xD;
      women with absent or asymptomatic Candida colonization) with associated impairment in local&#xD;
      mucosal anti-Candida immune responses. The aim of this study is to elucidate the vaginal&#xD;
      microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that allow Candida to transition from commensal to&#xD;
      pathogen in the context of antibiotic administration. A better understanding of the role of&#xD;
      specific microbiota and mucosal immune factors in averting Candida infection may lead to the&#xD;
      design of targeted preventive and/or therapeutic interventions against VVC.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females 18-40 years of age must meet the following criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with the procedures of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of regular (approximately 21-35 day) menstrual cycles prior to&#xD;
             initiation of hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On oral contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to sampling (see Participation of&#xD;
             Women below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because menstruation is known to affect the vaginal microbiome and because oral&#xD;
        contraceptives produce predictable menstrual cycles, subjects must be on oral&#xD;
        contraceptives in order to be eligible for the study. Additionally, since amoxicillin may&#xD;
        theoretically reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives, subjects must agree to use an&#xD;
        additional form of contraception (barrier method, abstinence) while receiving the study&#xD;
        drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
