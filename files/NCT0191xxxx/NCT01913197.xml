    <textblock>
      In standard prostate brachytherapy treatment, the seeds are placed throughout the prostate to&#xD;
      treat the entire gland. This is done because, in the past, it was impossible to know where&#xD;
      the cancer was located within the prostate. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      can identify tumor(s) with a high degree of accuracy. This trial will assess whether using&#xD;
      MRI to guide prostate brachytherapy can result in less chronic toxicity by allowing lower&#xD;
      doses to be delivered to the regions of the prostate without tumor while simultaneously&#xD;
      allowing higher doses to the tumor. Subjects enrolled in this study will then be followed&#xD;
      over two years and evaluated for toxicity. In addition, after two years they will undergo an&#xD;
      MRI and a biopsy to assess the cancer control rate of the treatment.&#xD;

      Prostate brachytherapy is a popular treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. In&#xD;
      properly selected patients, it is highly effective with biochemical (PSA) disease free&#xD;
      survival rates of 85-95% at 5-10 years. However, the technique is currently limited by the&#xD;
      inability to localize the cancer within the prostate. The multifocal nature of prostate&#xD;
      cancer is well established. Because of the inability to know where within the prostate the&#xD;
      cancer is located, radiation must be delivered throughout the gland. Although this blind&#xD;
      approach leads to good results, it is clear that there are regions of the prostate and&#xD;
      surrounding tissue that are overexposed to radiation while others are underexposed relative&#xD;
      to their true need based on their tumor burden and their proximity to the tumor areas.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown significant correlation between MRI abnormalities and radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy specimens for determining size and location of cancer foci. MRI images have&#xD;
      already begun to be incorporated into diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for prostate&#xD;
      cancer on an experimental basis by other investigators. The images have been fused with real&#xD;
      time TRUS to successfully perform targeted biopsies. In this study, we propose to use MRI&#xD;
      images in the pre-treatment planning process to identify the tumors within the prostate prior&#xD;
      to the brachytherapy and use these images to direct the dosimetry planning. The primary goal&#xD;
      of this study is to decrease the chronic toxicities as assessed by the Common Toxicity&#xD;
      Criteria Version 4.0 by decreasing the integral dose to the regions of the prostate which do&#xD;
      not have tumor. A secondary goal is to increase the dose to the tumor(s) and demonstrate this&#xD;
      ability while maintaining the urethral and other normal tissue doses. We also wish to perform&#xD;
      dosimetric comparisons of the normal tissues and the tumor(s) when this technique is used&#xD;
      compared to what would have been done if the patient had received a traditional implant.&#xD;
      Finally, we propose to perform a prostate MRI followed by a biopsy to evaluate for&#xD;
      persistent/recurrent disease at 2 years after treatment.&#xD;
