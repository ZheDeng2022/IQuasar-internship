  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asparaginase (Asp) is used during the induction phase of ALL treatment for children and young&#xD;
      adults. Its efficacy is counterbalanced by its toxicity, mainly in patients 40 years or&#xD;
      older. The efficacy rate in older adult population is lower than for children or young&#xD;
      adults. A recent review on outcomes in older adults with ALL pointed out that there were&#xD;
      significantly more drug reductions, omissions or delays in the older group as compared to&#xD;
      younger adults and that asparaginase was the drug most commonly omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product ERYASPASE is a dispersion for infusion of homologous red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBC) encapsulating E. coli L-asparaginase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous European phase I/II clinical study in children and adults (&lt;55 yo) at first&#xD;
      relapse of ALL was conducted to determine the optimal dose of homologous RBC encapsulating&#xD;
      native E. coli Asp (GRASPA®) in 24 patients with relapsed ALL. The activity and safety&#xD;
      profiles of 3 doses of GRASPA® (50, 100 and 150 IU/kg) in combination with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy were compared to free native Asp. The global safety profile is also improved,&#xD;
      reducing hypersensitivity, liver toxicity and coagulation disorders. Study showed that a&#xD;
      single dose of GRASPA® 150 IU/kg induced a depletion in plasmatic asparagine for 18.6 days,&#xD;
      i.e. similar to that obtained with 8 injections of 10,000 IU/m² of free native Asp. A&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence and severity of the allergic reactions and coagulation disorders&#xD;
      were observed with GRASPA® (Domenech 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A French phase II study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of GRASPA® in&#xD;
      combination with a polychemotherapy regimen in ALL patients older than 55 yo at first&#xD;
      diagnosis has been performed, and showed that both 100 and 150 IU/kg doses fulfilled the&#xD;
      predefined criteria for efficacy and tolerability but the better profile of 100 IU/kg dose&#xD;
      was considered the optimal dose in this setting. A phase II/III trial in adult and children&#xD;
      patients with relapsed ALL is currently ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, the combination of ERYASPASE with the CALGB chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      appears to be an attractive combination for the treatment of adults patients with ALL/LBL.&#xD;

      A phase I study to assess the limiting toxicities, global safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      ERYASPASE, using a dose titration design to confirm that the safety profile of ERYASPASE in&#xD;
      combination with the CALGB chemotherapy regimen is similar to that observed in the European&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. PK/PD and immunogenicity parameters will also be evaluated.&#xD;
