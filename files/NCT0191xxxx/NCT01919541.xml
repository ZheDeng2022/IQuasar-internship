    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that individuals who receive a personalized 4 week&#xD;
      prehabilitation program consisting of exercise and nutrition counselling with post-workout&#xD;
      whey protein supplementation will show, before colorectal surgery, improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, inflammatory profile, and substrate utilization compared to baseline measures.&#xD;
      These results will translate into a higher functional capacity before surgery as demonstrated&#xD;
      by an improvement in 6-minute walking test.&#xD;

      Intervention Physical exercise program&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline assessment all patients' physical fitness will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      kinesiologist (exercise specialist). The exercise component will consist of approximately 60&#xD;
      min of resistance and aerobic training, for a minimum of 3 days per week. The exercise&#xD;
      program will be individualized based upon the baseline fitness test (according to the&#xD;
      American College of Sport Medicine, ACMS, standard)50 and will include: a 5 min warm-up,&#xD;
      either 25 min of aerobic exercise (starting at 30- 40 % of heart rate reserve, HRR), and 25&#xD;
      min of resistance training (8 exercises targeting major muscle groups performed at moderate&#xD;
      intensity), and a 5-10 min cool-down and stretching period. All exercises will be clearly&#xD;
      explained and demonstrated by the kinesiologist at baseline. Patients will be asked to carry&#xD;
      out this program at home, unsupervised, but will be monitored with weekly telephone calls.&#xD;
      Training intensity progression will occur when the participant can complete aerobic exercise&#xD;
      on mild exertion and/or when the participant can complete 15 repetitions of a given&#xD;
      resistance exercise. Participants will be provided with resistance bands and an exercise mat,&#xD;
      as well as a pedometer and a heart rate monitor, which can be used by the participant to&#xD;
      monitor progress and by the kinesiologist to monitor daily compliance. A log book will also&#xD;
      be completed to report all activities and frequency of exercises completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kinesiologist will follow (by telephone call) all the participants on a weekly basis to&#xD;
      ensure program compliance and address any barriers that may prevent ongoing participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional counseling The patients' nutritional status and adequacy of dietary intake will&#xD;
      be assessed by a nutritionist using a three day food record, biological indices (e.g.&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin), clinical history, and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global&#xD;
      Assessment tool51. Anthropometric measures, including percentage of lean body mass and fat,&#xD;
      will be measured with bioelectrical impedance and skin calipers. Nutritional care plans will&#xD;
      focus on meeting daily protein requirements (1.2g/kg), management of cancer-related symptoms&#xD;
      (such as diarrhea, constipation), blood glucose control, optimization of body composition&#xD;
      (i.e. weight loss/gain if necessary) and nutrient intake through providing practical&#xD;
      suggestions, based on actual intake, to improve macronutrient distributions of protein, fat,&#xD;
      and carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of dietary protein (amino acid composition), digestibility, amount, timing of&#xD;
      intake, and co-ingestion with other macronutrients can be used to capitalize on post-exercise&#xD;
      induced muscle protein synthesis52. Twenty (20) grams of protein, in liquid form, taken&#xD;
      immediately after resistance exercise is regarded as sufficient to maximally stimulate muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis in healthy individuals52. Whey protein, in particular, is regarded as being&#xD;
      especially effective when ingested after exercise54 because it is rapidly digested and&#xD;
      contains all of the indispensable amino acids including leucine, which is believed to&#xD;
      independently stimulate translation initiation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle52.&#xD;
      Post exercise co-ingestion with carbohydrate does not appear to provide any further anabolic&#xD;
      effect, although does improve protein balance by blunting proteolysis and maximally&#xD;
      stimulating insulin secretion55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritionist will provide patients with a post-workout nutrition prescription consisting&#xD;
      of 20g of whey protein52 and 1g/kg carbohydrates53. Elderly patients require at least a 20g&#xD;
      dose of dietary protein after resistance exercise and approximately 30g doses, in intervals,&#xD;
      within the 24h &quot;window of anabolic opportunity&quot; in order to simulate an anabolic response&#xD;
      52.54,61. Ingestion of 1-1.5g carbohydrate/kg, within the &quot;glycogen recovery window&quot; of 15-30&#xD;
      minutes after exercise, replenishes glycogen stores53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure compliance, patients will be asked to complete daily logs and to return their empty&#xD;
      sachets of whey protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation Strategies The kinesiologists will instruct patients to perform deep breathing&#xD;
      exercises for relaxation purposes. Patients will be instructed to perform these exercises&#xD;
      daily and as needed. Relaxation CD's, including soothing sounds, will also be given to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
