  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone density that increases the risk of fractures;&#xD;
      particularly of the spine, hip and wrist. Osteoporosis is estimated to affect 200 million&#xD;
      women worldwide - approximately one tenth of women aged 60, one-fifth of women aged 70,&#xD;
      two-fifths of women aged 80 and two-thirds of women aged 90. Treating osteoporosis and the&#xD;
      associated fractures costs the NHS more than two billion pounds per annum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teriparatide is a drug currently prescribed for some osteoporosis patients by their doctor to&#xD;
      be taken by injection. It is currently the only drug available which promotes the deposition&#xD;
      of new bone as opposed to preventing resorption. This is the drug treatment we will be&#xD;
      studying in this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is of a type that cannot normally be taken as a swallowed pill. This type of drugs&#xD;
      tends to be delivered by injection, as is currently the case for teriparatide. Injections&#xD;
      have numerous limitations and are disliked by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will assess how well the nasal spray devices work, how long the drug stays in the&#xD;
      nose and also how well the drug enters the bloodstream.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to look at how teriparatide spreads through the nose and into the blood&#xD;
      stream when it is given as a liquid with a nasal delivery system called CriticalSorbâ„¢.&#xD;
      CriticalSorb has been developed by Critical Pharmaceuticals to improve the absorption of&#xD;
      drugs through the nose into the blood stream in the hope that it will replace injections. For&#xD;
      part of the study a radioactive compound (routinely used in the nuclear medicine clinic for&#xD;
      diagnosis) will be added to the formulation in order to investigate how the formulation&#xD;
      spreads through nose after it is sprayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being carried out in postmenopausal females aged greater than 55 years of age as&#xD;
      osteoporosis commonly affects these women. The study will involve 8 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will be to assess eligibility. On visit 2 the participants will receive an&#xD;
      injection of the teriparatide. On visits 2-6 the participants will receive a nasal dose of&#xD;
      teriparatide via nasal devices at different dose levels, blood samples will be taken to&#xD;
      measure drug levels following dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For visits 5 and 6 the nasal dose will have a radioactive marker added and gamma camera&#xD;
      imaging will also be carried out. These visits will also compare two different nasal devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7 will be a follow up visit. There will be one further visit during the study to&#xD;
      acquire a MRI scan of the head that will assist analysis of the scintigraphic images.&#xD;
