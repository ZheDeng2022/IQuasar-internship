  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure to successfully intubate the trachea and secure the airway remains a leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, in the operative [1-2] and emergency settings. [3-4]. When the&#xD;
      concept of endotracheal intubation was developed, 100 years ago the procedure was performed&#xD;
      blindly. Shortly thereafter, laryngoscopes were invented, allowing for direct visualization&#xD;
      of the larynx with a viewing angle of 15 degrees [5]. Insufficient laryngoscopic view&#xD;
      constitutes the main reason for difficult intubations [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video laryngoscopes provide an improved view of the glottis, as the camera is a few&#xD;
      millimeters away from the glottis. The use of Glidescope [7-8] and AirTraq [9] laryngoscopes&#xD;
      has superior glottis view and ease of tracheal intubation compared with the traditional&#xD;
      Macintosh laryngoscope. Unfortunately, the use video laryngoscopes is associated with longer&#xD;
      time to tracheal intubation compared with the traditional techniques which be explained with&#xD;
      the variable learning curves of the practitioners. [10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The King Vision video laryngoscope® (King Systems Company, a division of Consort Medical,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) is a relative newcomer to the video laryngoscopes of devices that&#xD;
      claim to provide the &quot;perfect view&quot; for intubation via use of video and digital technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The King Vision Video laryngoscope is a two piece design. It has a reusable monitor that&#xD;
      attaches to disposable blades. Blades are made of high quality poly-carbonate plastic and&#xD;
      house a complementary semi-conductor (CMOS) micro camera offers a 160 degree of view and LED&#xD;
      light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to best of the authors' knowledge, there is no current published or ongoing randomized&#xD;
      controlled comparative study of the use of King Vision laryngoscope with traditional&#xD;
      laryngoscope and other video laryngoscopes for endotracheal intubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty six ASA I-II patients aged 18-65 years scheduled for elective minor surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia who need tracheal intubation will be included in this prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, single-blind, controlled study at the author's center after obtaining approval of&#xD;
      the local ethical committee and an informed written consent from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of four groups (n=30 for each) namely, Macintosh,&#xD;
      King Vision, Glidescope, or AirTraq groups, by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes containing a software-generated randomization code (Random Allocation Software,&#xD;
      version 1.0.0, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mallampati airway score, thyromental and sternomental distances with neck extension, and&#xD;
      the degree of mouth opening will be evaluated preoperatively as factors predicting difficult&#xD;
      intubation. Patients' monitoring includes pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure&#xD;
      electrocardiography, state and response Entropy (SE and RE) and train of four (TOF) before&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intubators who will participate in the study received a standardized manikin based&#xD;
      training course followed by 10 successful intubations in clinical practice with the use of&#xD;
      Macintosh, King Vision®, Glidescope®, and the Airtraq® laryngoscopes for endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied. After breathing 100% oxygen for 3&#xD;
      min through a facemask in a supine &quot;sniffing&quot; position, all patients will receive intravenous&#xD;
      propofol 2-3 mg/kg and remifentanail 0.05-0.25 µg/kg/min for induction of anesthesia until&#xD;
      loss of consciousness defined as decrease of SE less than 50 and the difference between RE&#xD;
      and SE is less than 10. Rocrunium 0.6 mg.kg will be administered and complete relaxation will&#xD;
      be monitored using a nerve stimulator (TOF-GE, Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium&#xD;
      Corporation, Helsinki, Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied data during intubation will be collected by an independent investigator; the&#xD;
      intubator will not informed about the time taken to achieve any intubations. Tracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be performed with the Macintosh, King Vision, Glidescope, or AirTraq&#xD;
      laryngoscopes, according to the assigned randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to tracheal intubation, defined as the time when the investigated laryngoscope passes&#xD;
      the central incisors to the time when the tip of the tracheal tube passed through the&#xD;
      glottis, will be determined. The duration of laryngoscopy, defined as the time from holding&#xD;
      of the investigated laryngoscope to the appearance of as the first upward deflection on the&#xD;
      capnograph, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each procedure, the capnograph gas sample delay time will be measured and then&#xD;
      subtracted from total recorded duration of laryngoscopy, to correct for the different&#xD;
      sampling times between the capnographs used. [11] The best view during laryngoscopy (using&#xD;
      Cormack and Lehane classification) will be recorded. [12]&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intubation is unsuccessful at the first attempt, took longer than 120 seconds, or if&#xD;
      desaturation noted on the pulse oximeter (defined as SpO2 &lt; 92%) [13], the intubation attempt&#xD;
      will be stopped and the lungs will be ventilated with an oxygen-volatile anesthetic mixture&#xD;
      for 3 min. A second attempt will be allowed with the randomly allocated airway device. If&#xD;
      intubation is unsuccessful after two attempts, the protocol allows intubating the patient&#xD;
      with the anesthesiologist's instrument of choice. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist will be asked to rate the ease of intubation using a 10 cm visual analog&#xD;
      scale (0 for much of ease and 10 for extremely difficult). Hemodynamic parameters (heart&#xD;
      rate, systolic and mean blood pressures) will be recorded at baseline, during the intubation&#xD;
      process, and each 1-min for 5 min and 10 min after tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A careful examination of the oropharynx will be performed after intubation to determine any&#xD;
      lip, dental or mucosal trauma. Following recovery from anesthesia in the post-anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit, a trained anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study and who is blind to&#xD;
      the device used will evaluate all patients for a postoperative sore throat to ensure&#xD;
      consistency and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Serial changes in the&#xD;
      studied data at intubation will be analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be analyzed using Fischer's exact test. Repeated measure analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be used for continuous parametric variables and the differences will be&#xD;
      then corrected by post-hoc Bonferoni test. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA will be performed&#xD;
      for intergroup comparisons for the non-parametric values and post hoc pairwise comparisons&#xD;
      will be done using the Wilcoxon rank sum t test. p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
