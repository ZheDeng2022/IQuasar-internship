      Regional anesthesia is a safe, inexpensive technique, with the advantage of prolonged pain&#xD;
      relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pain clinic the investigators perform different injections as the standard treatment&#xD;
      for chronic pain based on the diagnosis and indications. Local anesthetic like Bupivacaine&#xD;
      with or without Steroids (Depo-medrol) is used for these injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is comparing pain control in different groups adding the magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate 100mg to our compounds as an inexpensive, effective, and safe adjuvant to prolong the&#xD;
      duration of analgesia and reduce the amount of narcotic dose.&#xD;

      N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors are fundamental factors in controlling synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity and memory function and play an important role in transition of acute pain to&#xD;
      chronic intractable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium is physiologic NMDA receptor antagonist. It will stabilized NMDA receptor and&#xD;
      prevents influx of calcium and sodium ion. It has been studied that serum magnesium level is&#xD;
      low in patients with chronic pain. Several studies has been done and shown that Magnesium has&#xD;
      a significant effect in neuroprotection and membrane stabilization. Blocking the NMDA&#xD;
      receptor will prevent activation of first order neurons in periphery or second order neurons&#xD;
      in dorsal horn of spinal cord and then higher pain pathways to third order neurons and&#xD;
      centers of the pain perception. Topical, oral and more effectively intravenous administration&#xD;
      of magnesium has been used widely in treatment of chronic pain. There are limitations of&#xD;
      intravenous administration of magnesium secondary to systemic cardiovascular side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several standardized study it has been shown that using magnesium intrathecally,&#xD;
      epidurally or with interscalene injections can boost up the effect of opioids or local&#xD;
      anesthetics. At the dose of 100 mg, it has been safe and effective to use.&#xD;

      sulfate 100mg to our compounds as an inexpensive, effective, and safe adjuvant to prolong the&#xD;
      duration of analgesia and reduce the amount of narcotic dose. The investigators want to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study with two major&#xD;
      injections (2 different studies with the same concept):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interscalene injection (2 subgroups including A: with Bupivacaine 0.25%(20ml) which is&#xD;
           the standard injection with 1ml saline as placebo vs B: Bupivacaine 0.25%(20ml)+&#xD;
           Magnesium sulfate (100mg in 1 ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epidural injection(2 subgroups including A:Bupivacaine 0.125%(8ml)+ Depo medrol(80mg) as&#xD;
           the standard injection with 1ml saline as placebo vs B: Bupivacaine 0.125%(8ml)+ Depo&#xD;
           medrol(80mg)+ Magnesium sulfate (100mg in 1 ml)&#xD;
