  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The single most distressing symptom for more than 70% of patients with oesophageal cancer is&#xD;
      difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) caused by blockage of the gullet by a tumour. This&#xD;
      causes severe restrictions on food intake, physical activity, social functioning and overall&#xD;
      quality of life. Amongst the more effective treatments for improving swallowing, is the&#xD;
      insertion of a metal stent across the blocked part, which then self-expands to open up the&#xD;
      gullet (Self Expanding Metal Stent or SEMS). The addition of radiotherapy may help to improve&#xD;
      the problems caused by dysphagia and provide an additional survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of adding radiotherapy to SEMS on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the length of time swallow remains improved for&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  survival&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of radiotherapy in addition to&#xD;
      self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement on time to progression of patient-reported&#xD;
      dysphagia in a patient population unable to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible to take part in the trial if they have oesophageal cancer, are in&#xD;
      need of SEMS because of dysphagia, are aged 16 years or older, have been clinically assessed&#xD;
      to be able to receive radiotherapy, have an expected survival of at least 12 weeks and are&#xD;
      able to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      496 patients will be randomised to receive either SEMS alone or SEMS with radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be given as an outpatient either as five treatments (one per day) over one&#xD;
      week, or ten treatments over two weeks. Questionnaires will be completed before treatment,&#xD;
      and at weeks two and four and then monthly for up to one year to assess quality of life and&#xD;
      cost effectiveness. Interviews will be held with trial participants at three time points to&#xD;
      explore their experiences while on the trial. Interviews will also be held with patients who&#xD;
      do not consent to take part in the trial to explore their reasons for non-consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) (Control Arm) SEMS insertion will be undertaken in&#xD;
      accordance with standard local protocols. Covered or partially covered metal stents will be&#xD;
      used and the length type and mode of stent placement will be selected by the clinician.&#xD;
      Insertion will occur within two weeks of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: SEMS plus external beam radiotherapy (Intervention Arm) External beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      (EBRT) is routinely available at regional cancer centres across the UK. For palliation of&#xD;
      dysphagia in oesophageal cancer, a radiotherapy course delivering a tumour absorbed dose of&#xD;
      20Gy in 5 fractions or 30Gy in 10 fractions within 4 weeks of SEMS insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be a qualitative component of the trial will have two aims: i) to explore the&#xD;
      feasibility of patients' recruitment to the trial and ii) to explore participants' experience&#xD;
      of the trial interventions. It will examine their experience of consent and recruitment&#xD;
      including reasons for declining, and examine patients' motivation to accept randomisation to&#xD;
      an intervention which may include extra radiotherapy. This is an optional component and will&#xD;
      require separate consent. Patients who do not consent to the trial, but who do consent to the&#xD;
      qualitative component, will be interviewed about their reasons for not-consenting as soon as&#xD;
      possible after the approach to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants who consent to the qualitative component will be interviewed three times:&#xD;
      at weeks one and four to capture initial decision-making thoughts and then after the&#xD;
      interventions (week 8) to explore patients' experience of interventions and perceptions of&#xD;
      benefit or detriment.&#xD;
