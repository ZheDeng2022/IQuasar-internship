  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive cervical spines movement during endotracheal intubation can result in serious&#xD;
      neurological injury, especially in the patients with unrecognized cervical spines&#xD;
      injury.[1-2] Moreover, direct laryngoscopy may be difficult if spine movement is limited&#xD;
      because of arthritis, disc disease or a small gap between the occiput and the spinous process&#xD;
      of the atlas.[3-4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video laryngoscopes allow for intubation without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and&#xD;
      tracheal axes which minimize the cervical movements, especially in the patients with&#xD;
      restricted cervical movements. [5,6] Compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the use of&#xD;
      AirWay Scope decreases median upper cervical-spine movement during intubation under in-line&#xD;
      stabilization in patients with normal cervical-spine. [6] Unfortunately, the use video&#xD;
      laryngoscopes are associated with longer times to tracheal intubation compared with the&#xD;
      traditional techniques which may be attributed to the variable learning curves of the&#xD;
      practitioners. [7-9]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The King Vision video laryngoscope® (King Systems Company, a division of Consort Medical,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) is an anatomically shaped, rigid laryngoscope that uses&#xD;
      fiberoptic technology to view the larynx with micro camera offers a 160 degree of view&#xD;
      potentially eliminating the need for neck flexion and head extension. [10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no study has evaluated the King vision&#xD;
      laryngoscope regarding the neck movement during routine tracheal intubation under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of King Vision video laryngoscope may reduce the&#xD;
      cervical spines movements during endotracheal intubation compared with the Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical trial aims to compare the effects of the Macintosh and King Vision&#xD;
      laryngoscopes, on cervical spines movement, time to intubation, laryngoscopic view, ease of&#xD;
      intubation, number of intubation attempts, and number of optimization maneuvers during&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, in the patients undergoing minor elective surgery under&#xD;
      propofol-remifentanil-rocuronium anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty two ASA I-II patients who need tracheal intubation will be included in this randomized&#xD;
      cross-over controlled blind comparative study at the author's center after obtaining approval&#xD;
      of the local Ethical Committee and an informed written consent from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mallampati airway score, thyromental and sternomental distances, neck extension, and the&#xD;
      degree of mouth opening will be evaluated preoperatively as factors predicting difficult&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analysis of the previous published data [9] showed that the investigators will&#xD;
      need to study 14 pairs to detect a 10% difference in the cervical spine extension&#xD;
      (occiput-C5) values (25.9 degrees) with a SD of 2.8 degrees, after intubation with of&#xD;
      Macintosh laryngoscope, a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. The investigators will add&#xD;
      10% more patients for a final sample size of 32 patients to account for patients dropping out&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed on the operating room table with a rigid board from the shoulders to&#xD;
      the occiput with the patient's head rested on a pillow in a position judged by the patient to&#xD;
      be neutral. After verification that the patient will be properly centered, the fluoroscopy&#xD;
      unit and operating room table will remain fixed for the rest of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' monitoring includes pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure electrocardiography,&#xD;
      state and response Entropy (SE and RE) and train of four (TOF)stimulation of the ulnar nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied. After breathing 100% oxygen for 3&#xD;
      min through a facemask in a neutral position, anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl&#xD;
      2-3µg/kg/min and propofol 2-3 mg/kg to achieve a SE &lt; 50 and the difference between RE and SE&#xD;
      less than 10. Rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg will be administered for complete relaxation on the TOF&#xD;
      (TOF-GE, Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corporation, Helsinki, Finland). Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be maintained using sevoflurane end-tidal concentrations of 2.5-3.5% in oxygen via a&#xD;
      bag-mask for 3 min before endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard precautions against radiation exposure will be taken, movement of the cervical&#xD;
      spines during endotracheal intubation will be studied and recorded with portable X-ray&#xD;
      machine. Laryngoscopy will be performed twice, once with the King Vision and once with the&#xD;
      Macintosh laryngoscope in random order. For the first device, the patient's mouth will be&#xD;
      opened and the tip of the tracheal tube will be introduced into the glottis. The second&#xD;
      device will be studied in an identical manner, and intubation will be completed with the&#xD;
      second device. The intubators who will participate in the study will receive a standard&#xD;
      manikin based training which will be followed with 50 successful endotracheal intubations in&#xD;
      the clinical practice with the use of Macintosh and King Vision® laryngoscopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied data during intubation will be collected by an independent investigator. The&#xD;
      intubator will attempt to minimize neck movement during both techniques through the&#xD;
      acceptance of the first view [8] that will offer a reasonable opportunity to adequately&#xD;
      position the tracheal tube at the glottis opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three lateral radiographs will be taken with a portable X-ray system provides fixed images&#xD;
      from which hard copies are generated. Patient will be served as their own control with&#xD;
      reference to the first image, which will be obtained after induction of anesthesia before&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and intubation, with the patient in neutral position. A further two images, one&#xD;
      with the Macintosh and one with King Vision laryngoscopes. These images will be taken at the&#xD;
      time of laryngeal exposure, with the tip of the endotracheal tube passing between the vocal&#xD;
      cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each image, lines will be drawn to mark the relative position of the occiput, atlas (C1),&#xD;
      axis (C2) and the fifth cervical vertebra (C5). The angle between each of these lines will be&#xD;
      measured to determine the degree of angulation of C1, C2 and C5 relative to the occiput and&#xD;
      each other. [9] The radiographs will be reviewed by a radiology consultant who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the order of intubation technique and unfamiliar with the laryngoscopes being&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Fisher exact test will&#xD;
      be used for categorical data. Repeated two-way ANOVA and paired t-test will be used to study&#xD;
      the changes in the primary and secondary endpoints during each intervention. The Wilcoxon 2&#xD;
      rank sum test will be used for the non-parametric values. The investigators will avoid the&#xD;
      carryover effect (persistence of the effect of the first intervention on the operative&#xD;
      conditions into the second period) through the comparison of the effects of period (time&#xD;
      effect) and the order of treatment using independent t-tests. Data will be expressed as mean&#xD;
      ± SD, number (%), or median [range]. A value of P &lt; 0.05 will be considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
