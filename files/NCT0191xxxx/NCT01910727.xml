    <textblock>
      The objective of the Together on Diabetes study is to test the efficacy of a pilot&#xD;
      intervention to improve the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes among American&#xD;
      Indian youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of the Together on Diabetes pilot&#xD;
      intervention on youth diabetes risk behaviors, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in youth dietary intake, with a specific focus on reducing the percent of&#xD;
           total calories from fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in youth physical activity, with a specific focus on increasing the number&#xD;
           of minutes of physical activity each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional primary aim of the study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the pilot intervention and evaluation, including program adherence and program satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of collecting data to&#xD;
      determine program impact on a number of physiological measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single group pre-post study designed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a pilot intervention at improving the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes among&#xD;
      American Indian youth. The intervention uses a Family Health Coach model to work with&#xD;
      families of youth with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. Health Coaches visit families in&#xD;
      their homes and conduct intervention sessions with both youth and a designated adult 'support&#xD;
      person' (e.g., parent, guardian, etc). For Youth Participants, the pilot intervention&#xD;
      consists of 12 sessions (45-60 minutes in duration) delivered during a 6-month intervention&#xD;
      phase, plus 6 check-ins delivered during a 6-month follow-up phase. There are also 4 optional&#xD;
      social support visits for the Youth Participants in order to provide necessary assistance&#xD;
      with challenges the youth may be facing. For Support Persons, the pilot intervention consists&#xD;
      of 4 family skill building sessions (20-30 minutes in length) delivered during the first 4&#xD;
      months of the Youth Participant's intervention phase. Support Persons will also be welcomed&#xD;
      and encouraged to attend any of the Youth Participant sessions. All sessions are designed to&#xD;
      be taught at the participant's home, but they may also occur at another location chosen by&#xD;
      the participant (e.g. school, study office, clinic). Outcome data will be collected at&#xD;
      Baseline, 3 months following Baseline, 6 months following Baseline, and 12 months following&#xD;
      Baseline.&#xD;

    <description>The Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, with support from Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Inc. is adapting a Family Health Coach model for diabetes prevention with four southwestern tribal communities. Specifically, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health has designed a paraprofessional delivered pilot intervention aimed at improving the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes among American Indian youth. For Youth Participants, the pilot intervention consists of 12 sessions delivered during a 6-month intervention phase, plus 6 check-ins delivered during a 6-month follow-up phase. For Support Persons, the pilot intervention consists of 4 family skill building sessions delivered during the first 4 months of the Youth Participant's intervention phase.</description>
