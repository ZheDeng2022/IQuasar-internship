  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OSA is a major chronic condition affecting the quality of life of millions of Americans. Per&#xD;
      the Institute of Medicine new treatment adherence strategies are needed to help improve the&#xD;
      quality of care, reduce social and economic costs, and help those with chronic conditions&#xD;
      (such as OSA) live healthier and more productive lives through better management of their&#xD;
      conditions. Using an mHealth tool to help deliver the investigators' Self-Management&#xD;
      intervention and improve the frequency and quality of patient-provider communications is a&#xD;
      central component of that discovery process.&#xD;

      The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a new mobile health (mHealth) system for&#xD;
      patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) that facilitates patient-centered,&#xD;
      collaborative management for patients prescribed the first-line treatment, continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP adherence rates are disappointingly low. The mHealth&#xD;
      system proposed for use in the study is informed by the group's previous interventional&#xD;
      efforts, including that of an interactive website intervention for OSA patients prescribed&#xD;
      CPAP. Limitations of that intervention included use of an immobile desktop computer for&#xD;
      website access and that it was not based on a previously evaluated protocol. The advantages&#xD;
      to the proposed mHealth system are the use of a mobile device to allow for increased&#xD;
      patient-provider communications and the incorporation of the Sleep Apnea Self-Management&#xD;
      Program protocol. The evaluative aspect of this proposal is designed as a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial-Usual Care (control; UC); Self-Management Care (intervention 1;&#xD;
      SM); Self-Management via mHealth (intervention 2; SM-Mobile). The key feature of the&#xD;
      SM-Mobile intervention is the use of a mHealth tool that allows for the provision of the&#xD;
      Self-Management Program through the utilization of audio/visual conferencing,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, and treatment tracking with the patient remotely (i.e., in the non-clinic&#xD;
      environment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of the present project is to examine the effect of this patient-centered,&#xD;
      collaborative care intervention on improving the quality of care, and increasing CPAP&#xD;
      adherence to a clinically meaningful level. The central questions that encompass the&#xD;
      conceptual and empirical contours of the study: Does the SM-Mobile intervention have an&#xD;
      effect on the patient's experience of care, CPAP adherence, and OSA outcomes relative to&#xD;
      Usual Care and Self-Management Care? To answer these research questions, and in the process&#xD;
      address fundamental intervention efficacy and cost issues in telemedicine, the proposed&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial aims specifically to achieve the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the effect of the Self-Management Care delivered by mHealth (SM-Mobile)&#xD;
      intervention compared to Usual Care (SM) and Self-Management Care (SM) on level of CPAP&#xD;
      adherence. The hypothesis is that participants in SM-Mobile group will exhibit higher levels&#xD;
      of CPAP adherence compared to the UC and SM groups over the 2-month intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the effect of the SM-Mobile intervention, compared to Usual Care and&#xD;
      Self-Management Care, on the patient's experience of the quality of patient-centered,&#xD;
      collaborative care (as measured by the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care and the&#xD;
      CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey). The hypothesis is that participants in the SM-Mobile group&#xD;
      will experience a greater improvement in patient-centered, collaborative care compared to the&#xD;
      UC and SM groups over the 2-month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the effect of SM-Mobile, compared to UC and SM, on OSA apnea outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., OSA symptoms and OSA-specific health-related quality of life [HRQOL]). The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that participants in the SM-Mobile group will experience greater improvements in&#xD;
      self-reported OSA symptoms and HRQOL from baseline compared to the UC and SM over the 2-month&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To perform a basic cost analysis of the SM-Mobile intervention compared to Usual Care,&#xD;
      applying a micro-cost methodology of measuring the quantity of inputs used in the production&#xD;
      of care and the unit cost of each. This will be a test against the null hypothesis of no&#xD;
      significant cost differences between groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The project will have a 4-year timeline. Patients and providers at both the VA Pulmonary&#xD;
        Sleep Clinic will participate in this prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients will&#xD;
        participate by completing written informed consent, agreeing to be randomized, completing a&#xD;
        baseline assessment, participating in the study interventional protocol, and completing&#xD;
        follow-up assessments up to one-year post-intervention. The intent is to recruit a study&#xD;
        population that is fairly representative of the overall VASDHS population of patients&#xD;
        diagnosed with OSA. To this end, inclusion criteria are designed to be as inclusive as&#xD;
        possible and are operationalized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age &gt; 18 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  confirmed diagnosis of OSA;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  being newly prescribed CPAP therapy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having chronic symptoms as noted on screening symptom checklist. OSA diagnosis by the&#xD;
             Sleep Clinic has been and is currently consistent with published consensus&#xD;
             statements49 that CPAP treatment is indicated when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI,&#xD;
             number of apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep) is either (1) greater than or equal to&#xD;
             15, or (2) between 5 and 15 AND accompanied by documented sleep apnea symptoms,&#xD;
             including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia,&#xD;
             and documented cardiovascular diseases. Because mild OSA symptoms are at best modestly&#xD;
             correlated with AHI, the research study will focus on patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
             sleep apnea, and therefore inclusion criteria will require AHI &gt; 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria include cognitive impairment sufficient to cause inability to&#xD;
             complete the protocol (MMSE &lt; 24/30);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  residence in a geographical area outside of San Diego County (which could make some&#xD;
             necessary face-to-face contact difficult);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fatal comorbidity (life expectancy less than 6 months as indicated by treating&#xD;
             physician);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant documented substance/chemical abuse; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other participant circumstances that, in the opinion of a consensus of study team,&#xD;
             would interfere with the safety of a prospective participant or their need for&#xD;
             treatment (i.e., clinical needs of patient outweighs needs of research study). No&#xD;
             exclusion criteria or any other study design elements will be used directly or&#xD;
             indirectly to restrict study participation by women, members of minority groups, or&#xD;
             primary language. Because men have a greater risk for OSA (and are identified and&#xD;
             diagnosed at a greater rate) than women, we anticipate a final sample that reflects&#xD;
             the OSA base rate differences on sex. Some minority groups are thought to have higher&#xD;
             OSA prevalence rates than Caucasians, so assuming they are being screened/diagnosed at&#xD;
             the same rates as Caucasians, we expect minority groups to be included in the study at&#xD;
             levels that reflect those rates.&#xD;
