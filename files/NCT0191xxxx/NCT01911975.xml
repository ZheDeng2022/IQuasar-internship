    <textblock>
      Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid with antinociceptive properties in inflammatory and&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, and displays a unique mechanism: it enhances slow inactivation of Nav1.3,&#xD;
      Nav1.7, and Nav1.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nav1.7 is expressed predominantly in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons. Gain-of-function&#xD;
      mutations have been described in Nav1.7 that result in extreme pain disorders such as&#xD;
      SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy. In the disease states genetically linked to a&#xD;
      gain-of-function of Nav1.7, the sodium channel is mutated to increase the sodium influx&#xD;
      resulting in a hyperexcitable sensory neuron, and a resultant sensation of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of lacosamide, a sodium&#xD;
      channel blocker, in patients with pain due to SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy.&#xD;

      Indication Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid with antinociceptive properties in&#xD;
      inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and displays a unique mechanism: it enhances slow&#xD;
      inactivation of Nav1.3, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale A significant body of evidence implicates sodium channels in mediating the&#xD;
      pathophysiological components of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. This is supported by&#xD;
      clinical evidence suggesting that local anaesthetics, anticonvulsants and tricyclic compounds&#xD;
      that block voltage-gated sodium channels may act as useful therapeutics for managing and&#xD;
      treating pain. The use of these sodium channel blockers has, however, been limited by the&#xD;
      lack of selectivity for different sodium channel subtypes with often additional central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular side effects. Therefore, a key to improvement on the&#xD;
      limitations of most existing sodium channel blockers is to selectively target those that are&#xD;
      involved in pain mechanisms whilst sparing those channels involved in cardiovascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nav1.7 is expressed predominantly in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons. The role of this&#xD;
      channel in nociceptive neurons has been characterized by human genetics, which indicates an&#xD;
      essential and non-redundant role in pain transduction and conduction following noxious&#xD;
      stimuli. Gain-of-function mutations have been described in Nav1.7 that result in extreme pain&#xD;
      disorders such as inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD)&#xD;
      and SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy. In the disease states genetically linked to a&#xD;
      gain-of-function of Nav1.7, the channel is mutated to increase the sodium influx resulting in&#xD;
      a hyperexcitable sensory neuron, and a resultant sensation of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lacosamide is a functionalized aminoacid that was synthesized during the development of&#xD;
      anticonvulsant drug candidates and has displayed antinociceptive properties in inflammatory&#xD;
      and neuropathic pain. Lacosamide displays a unique mechanism of action in that it seemingly&#xD;
      selectively stabilizes channels into the slow- inactivated state. Lacosamide inhibited&#xD;
      currents from Nav1.3, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, but only after prolonged depolarizations,&#xD;
      consistent with an enhancement in slow-inactivation with no effect on fast inactivation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, lacosamide was better able to discriminate between resting and inactivated&#xD;
      channels compared to lidocaine or carbamazepine, thus likely allowing for improved&#xD;
      selectivity over neurons with a depolarized membrane potential, with little tonic block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a relatively common disorder of peripheral nerves, primarily&#xD;
      affecting small somatic fibers, autonomic fibers, or both. In a proportion of patients with&#xD;
      SFN, no underlying cause can be identified; these cases are termed idiopathic SFN.&#xD;
      Gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A have recently been reported to be present in 28% of&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic SFN, suggesting an underlying genetic basis for a proportion of&#xD;
      patients with this disease. Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated multiple&#xD;
      gain-of-function changes in the mutant channels with each of the mutations resulting in&#xD;
      hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Moreover, most of these mutations&#xD;
      showed impaired slow inactivation of Nav1.7, a finding that provides a rationale to evaluate&#xD;
      the possible pain reduction potential of lacosamide in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale and Objectives The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of lacosamide, a sodium channel blocker, in patients with pain due to SCN9A-associated&#xD;
      SFN. The proposed study plans to recruit patients with clinically diagnosed SFN, where a&#xD;
      mutation in SCN9A has been confirmed genetically, and where possible, has been demonstrated&#xD;
      on functional testing, to cause hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. This small, precision&#xD;
      medicine population provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide&#xD;
      in treatment of pain due to SCN9A-associated SFN.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subjects with predominantly signs of large nerve fiber involvement, clinically&#xD;
             significant abnormal nerve conduction studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History or presence of illnesses known to cause SFN (excluding diabetes mellitus).&#xD;

             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects taking medications with activity at sodium channels. These medications are&#xD;
             prohibited until the end of the study period and require a washout period of at least&#xD;
             5 half lives (90 days for capsaicin patches) prior to the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF (Fridericia's correction) &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120&#xD;
             msec at Screening. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should&#xD;
             be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Other clinically significant or unstable, or severe acute or chronic medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric/psychological condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the&#xD;
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or&#xD;
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. In the case of incidental findings the patient and his/her treating physician will be&#xD;
             informed and asked to undertake action if necessary. If a patient does not want to be&#xD;
             informed about possible incidental findings, nor wants his treating physician to be&#xD;
             informed, he or she cannot participate in this study.&#xD;
