      The objective of this project is to determine the effects of gait-retraining on articular&#xD;
      cartilage composition, gait mechanics, pain and function in persons with mild to moderate&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;

      Variables of gait mechanics during walking have been linked to the onset and progression of&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis (OA). The knee adduction moment is one key variable that has been&#xD;
      identified as an important indicator of medial compartment loads across the knee joint. Use&#xD;
      of gait-retraining strategies to alter gait movement patterns and lower the knee adduction&#xD;
      movement in persons with knee OA is a new and promising direction for the potential&#xD;
      intervention in a population in which few strategies have worked successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that affect cartilage composition are crucial to understanding the disease mechanisms&#xD;
      in knee OA. A multi-scale approach towards understanding the knee OA disease process by&#xD;
      evaluating tissue compositional changes, joint contact mechanics, whole-body neuromuscular&#xD;
      dynamics, and functional performance. The results will be the first to show the association&#xD;
      between cartilage composition and daily function (performance and patterns) which are&#xD;
      implicated in OA development and progression. With the addition of comprehensive muscle&#xD;
      testing (cross sectional area/volume assessment using MR, strength testing, muscle activation&#xD;
      and co-contraction patterns during daily activities), it will be possible to study the&#xD;
      interaction between all major tissues around the knee.&#xD;

    <description>Everybody walks a little different. Some people walk with their toes pointed outwards (duck-footed) and other with their toes pointed straight or even inward(pigeon-toed). We will work with participants to teach you how to walk with slightly different toe angle. Participants will be randomly assign to each group and will be taught on this new walking pattern.&#xD;
Gait modification is a non-surgical treatment that can reduce the KAM (knee adduction moment). Changes to foot progression angle, tibia angle, hip adduction/internal rotation and trunk sway can reduce the KAM from baseline. Modifications involving simultaneous changes to multiple gait parameters have also been shown to reduce KAM.</description>
