    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major cause of genital herpes. It can also cause&#xD;
      serious infection in newborns and in people with weakened immune systems. It increases the&#xD;
      risk of getting an HIV infection and of spreading HIV to someone else. Therefore, a vaccine&#xD;
      that could prevent genital herpes could improve the general health of the world s population.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study whether a new vaccine, HSV529, which may be used in the future to&#xD;
      prevent herpes infections, is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether a new herpes vaccine is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults 18 40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 vaccination visits, 7 follow-up visits, and 3 follow-up phone&#xD;
           calls over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each vaccination visit will last about 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a blood sample taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given the vaccine or a placebo, by injection from a needle. They&#xD;
           will be monitored for 30 minutes to check for any allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given a diary card to record any symptoms they may feel later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At follow-up visits, participants will give a blood sample and answer health questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phone calls, participants will answer health questions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes and increases the risk of acquisition&#xD;
      and transmission of HIV. An HSV-2 vaccine is not available. We will study a&#xD;
      replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine, HSV529, that is deleted for 2 essential viral proteins,&#xD;
      that can infect, but not replicate in normal cells. The goals of the study are to determine&#xD;
      (a) the safety of HSV529 vaccine in persons with or without HSV infection, and (b) the&#xD;
      ability of the vaccine to elicit immune responses to HSV-2 including virus-specific&#xD;
      antibodies and T cell responses to the virus. Three groups of 20 subjects each will be&#xD;
      randomized and will receive 3 doses of HSV529 (15 subjects per group) or saline placebo&#xD;
      injection (5 subjects per group). Each subject will be followed for 6 months after the last&#xD;
      dose of vaccine. The 3 groups will be (a) subjects who were infected with HSV-2 in the past&#xD;
      but may or may not have been infected with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/-/HSV-2+), (b) subjects who have&#xD;
      been infected only with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/HSV-2-), and (c) subjects who have not been infected&#xD;
      with HSV-1 or HSV-2 (HSV-1-/HSV-2-). Vaccine or placebo will be administered on Day 0 and&#xD;
      approximately 1 month and 6 months after enrollment.&#xD;

             future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception: The effects of HSV529 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
        reason, females subjects must be of non-childbearing potential i.e. either surgically&#xD;
        sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy) or, if of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
        sexually active with a male partner, she must be willing to use a highly effective method&#xD;
        of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device (IUD); oral contraceptives diaphragm or condom&#xD;
        in combination with contraceptive foam, jelly or cream; Norplant, DepoProvera,&#xD;
        contraceptive skin patch or cervical ring) for at least 30 days prior to vaccination and&#xD;
        until 1 month after final vaccination or be in a monogamous relationship with a male&#xD;
        partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior to first dose of study agent.&#xD;
        Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test result prior to injection with HSV529 or&#xD;
        placebo. During the course of the study, if a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is&#xD;
        pregnant, she should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials is restricted, other than&#xD;
        enrollment into observational studies or into the screening protocol. Study staff should be&#xD;
        notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from trial&#xD;
        enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is pregnant or lactating OR planning to become pregnant timeframe that begins&#xD;
             30 days prior to the first vaccination and ends 30 days after the third vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body Mass Index greater than 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device,&#xD;

             planned participation during the study period up to 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             vaccine or placebo. The non-interventional follow-up for an earlier study (e.g.,&#xD;
             long-term surveillance) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe active infection or serious HSV-2 related or unrelated medical conditions that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with 6 or more symptomatic recurrences of genital herpes disease within the&#xD;
             year prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A history of HSV infection of the eye (e.g., herpes simplex interstitial keratitis or&#xD;
             uveitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A history of herpes gladiatorum, herpetic whitlow or eczema herpeticum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A history of lesions caused by HSV on either arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A history of herpes-associated erythema multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A history of a clinically significant autoimmune disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Subjects using corticosteroids (excluding topical, inhaled or nasal) or any&#xD;
             immunomodulating drugs within 42 days prior to the first vaccination. An&#xD;
             immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg&#xD;
             prednisone equivalent per day for greater than or equal to 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects without a spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects receiving immunoglobulin within the past 6 months or anticipated receipt of&#xD;
             immunoglobulin during the 28 days following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would interfere with the subject s participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Prior vaccination against herpes simplex virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known allergy or intolerance to vaccine components [e.g., potassium glutamate&#xD;
             (possible cross-reaction to monosodium glutamate), sucrose] or to a vaccine containing&#xD;
             any of the same substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,&#xD;
             or hospitalized involuntarily.&#xD;

         22. Employee of the NIH or contractor working at the NIH, with direct involvement in the&#xD;
             proposed study as well as family members (i.e. immediate, husband, wife and their&#xD;
             children, adopted or natural) of the employee or of the investigators of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Any condition that the PI thinks might compromise the person s ability to comply with&#xD;
             the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Justification for Exclusion of Women and Children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of HSV529&#xD;
             on the developing human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast-feeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to vaccination of the mother with HSV529, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother will be vaccinated with HSV529.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion of Children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because there are insufficient data regarding dosing or adverse events available in adults&#xD;
        to judge the potential risk in children, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
