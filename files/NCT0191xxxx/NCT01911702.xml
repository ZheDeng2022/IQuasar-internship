      Acute abdomen is the clinical manifestation of irritation of the peritoneum, due to&#xD;
      intra-abdominal generalized infection. With the exception of the primary ones which are the&#xD;
      result of a bacterial translocation from the gastro-intestinal tract or an abdominal&#xD;
      contamination for hematogenous way sometimes treatable with medical therapy alone,&#xD;
      peritonitis represents a complex condition that requires an early surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality linked to the peritonitis is extremely high and variable between 42% and 80% when&#xD;
      associated with a systemic framework of severe sepsis. This variability is linked to a number&#xD;
      of risk factors, including advanced age of the patients, the presence of comorbidity, male&#xD;
      sex, a poor nutritional status, and a number of re-operations; as well as specific&#xD;
      characteristics related to the type of infection, the timing of surgery, the beginning of an&#xD;
      appropriate and early antibiotic therapy.The post-operative treatment of the patient with&#xD;
      peritonitis significantly affects the outcome of the same. The presence of peritonitis and&#xD;
      then the seizure of large volumes of liquids and the possible state of systemic vasodilation&#xD;
      induced by the infectious process, provide a framework of hypovolemia. There is a literature&#xD;
      that identifies in abdominal trauma damage patient's volemic aggressive resuscitation an&#xD;
      element of pejorative outcomes. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the clinical changes&#xD;
      determined by a different volemic strategy.&#xD;

      MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMEN SUBMITTED TO URGENT ABDOMINAL SURGERY: pilot&#xD;
      study randomized multicentre&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Acute abdomen is the clinical manifestation of irritation of the peritoneum, due&#xD;
      to intra-abdominal generalized infection. Mortality linked to the peritonitis is extremely&#xD;
      high and variable between 42% and 80% when associated with a systemic framework of severe&#xD;
      sepsis. This variability is linked to a number of risk factors, including advanced age of the&#xD;
      patients, the presence of comorbidity, male sex, a poor nutritional status, and a number of&#xD;
      reoperations; as well as specific characteristics related to the type of infection, the&#xD;
      timing of surgery, the beginning of an appropriate and early antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative treatment of the patient with peritonitis significantly affects the&#xD;
      outcome of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centers involved in the study will be three:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. post operative intensive care unit (ICU) - Modena University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reanimation unit - Carpi Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. intensive care unit (ICU) - Modena New Civil Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: differences between the two treatment groups with different&#xD;
      fluidic strategy in terms of 30-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: differences between the two treatment groups with different fluidic&#xD;
      strategy in terms of surgical complications, occurrence of organ failure, duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and length of stay in ICU. Please refer to Section 6 for the&#xD;
      definition of the endpoints / response variables for the secondary goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN STUDY Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the following facilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. post operative intensive care unit (ICU) at Modena University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. intensive care unit (ICU) at Modena Baggiovara&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reanimation unit at Carpi Inclusion criteria All patients with acute abdomen undergoing&#xD;
           abdominal surgery under emergency and presenting on arrival in ICU at least a sign of&#xD;
           bad perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the definition of acute abdomen, the following frameworks will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. primary peritonitis: bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity by microorganisms&#xD;
           starting from extra-peritoneal sites (hematogenous in sepsis / bacteremia, from the&#xD;
           female genital tract in the course of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), from the&#xD;
           retroperitoneum); translocation of microorganisms through the bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. secondary peritonitis: bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity as a result of&#xD;
           phlogosis or perforation of the digestive tract or female genital tract:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. acute abdominal infections (appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis,&#xD;
                gallbladder empyema, suppurative cholangitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. other diseases (occlusion of the mesenteric, gastric or duodenal ulcer,&#xD;
                strangulated hernia or volvulus, colic neoplasia, toxic megacolon, ruptured of&#xD;
                intraperitoneal or visceral abscess)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. various intestinal diseases (tuberculosis, typhoid fever, cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
                infection, infection with Clostridium)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. penetrating and not abdominal trauma (rupture or perforation of a hollow internal&#xD;
                organ)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. surgical operation (stomach and duodenum, ileum, colon - rectum, bile - ducts) for&#xD;
                dehiscence of anastomosis and / or sutures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. tertiary or relapsing peritonitis, understood as persistent or recurrent peritonitis&#xD;
           after apparently adequate medical and surgical treatment of secondary peritonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. intestinal ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. pancreatitis with or without evidence of hemorrhagic- necrotic areas&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of hypoperfusion is identified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. perioperative metabolic acidosis that can not be explained by other morbid conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. arterial hypotension with PAM &lt;60 mmHg or less than 15% of the preoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with chronic renal failure already receiving dialysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) &lt;12 months and New York Hearth Classification (NHYA )&#xD;
           class &gt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients judged at the admission not subject to resuscitative measures for severity and&#xD;
           comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with massive hemorrhage in operative room or in the immediate perioperative&#xD;
           with the need for blood transfusions and abundant blood products &gt; 5 units of&#xD;
           Erythrocyte Concentrates (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients scheduled for Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients younger than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the definition of ACS, chest pain of suspected coronary origin with or without ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation are included. According to the classification accepted by the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ESC) and by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the serum dosage of cardiac&#xD;
      troponins can make the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Screening and inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the entrance to the ICU all patients that meet the criteria for inclusion and don't&#xD;
      present exclusion criteria - will be evaluated for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending physician will have to notify the coordinating center as soon deemed to have&#xD;
      identified a patient to be enrolled. The coordinating center is at the Intensive Care Unit of&#xD;
      the University Hospital of Modena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization must be done at the time of admission to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of randomization will be by &quot;parallel group&quot;, the type of simple randomization and&#xD;
      the randomization list will be obtained through the use of a random number generator&#xD;
      computerized in a 1:1 ratio. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria are assigned over the&#xD;
      telephone by medical coordinator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. or to the group receiving volemic standard treatment (conventional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. or to the group receiving volemic small treatment (restrictive) The contact number for&#xD;
           randomization is always 0594224896&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group &quot;conventional&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. arterial pressure mean ≥ 65 mmHg or equal to the pre-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. diuretic rhythm ≥ 1 ml / Kg / h&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. venous saturation in vena cava ≥ 70% or mixed venous saturation as Swan Ganz's catheter&#xD;
           (SG) ≥ 65%&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. base excess (BE) &gt; - 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Central Venous Pression (PVC) ≥ 8 mmHg; for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
           this limit may be raised to 12-15 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the therapeutic goals set out above will be executed a volemic fill until reaching&#xD;
      central venous pressure values of 8-10 mmHg. Crystalloid solutions and specifically balanced&#xD;
      III, Ringer solutions or alternatively glucose solution will be infused at 5% in patients&#xD;
      with serum sodium ≥ 145 milliequivalent (mEq) / L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this group of patients, the overall water balance won't be binding. If after proper&#xD;
      filling the targets aren't yet achieved, the patient will begin infusion of vasoactive drugs&#xD;
      following the practice of department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are unable to get a goal value of venous saturation you can consider:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The chance to infuse additional volumes of fluids&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the chance to transfuse concentrate red blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The chance to infuse dobutamine up to 20 microg / kg / min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group &quot;restrictive&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. arterial pressure mean ≥ 60 mmHg or ≥ 10% less than the preoperative values&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. diuretic rhythm ≥ 0.5 ml / kg / h&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. venous saturation in vena cava ≥ 60% or mixed venous saturation ≥ 55% by SG&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BE&gt; - 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. PVC goal not necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the therapeutic goals set out above will be executed a volemic fill up to values&#xD;
      of PVC ≤ 5 mmHg or at maximum values of 2 mmHg more the incoming If after proper filling the&#xD;
      targets aren't yet achieved, the patient will begin infusion of vasoactive drugs following&#xD;
      the practice of department. If after 12 hours of admission the water balance will be &gt; 10-15&#xD;
      ml / kg / h an infusion of furosemide should be initiated in order to bring the budget of the&#xD;
      patient to 10-15 ml / kg in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Data Collection Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done by compiling data collection forms. In particular, the following&#xD;
      types of data collection formats will be filled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. basal and randomization card (Record Form 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. card to 6 hours after randomization (Record Form 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24 hours card (Record Form 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. daily continuation card (as long as the patient is admitted to Post Operative Intensive&#xD;
           Therapy, Record Form 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Conclusion card (Record Form 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basal card will contain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patient's personal details&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. information according with remote and proximal medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patient's vital parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. patient's therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final board will collect data until it will be verified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patient's discharge from the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. thirtieth day of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patient's death&#xD;
&#xD;
      END POINT / VARIABLE RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary: Mortality at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Number of surgical complications (anastomotic dehiscences, need for re-operation,&#xD;
                need for percutaneous drainages of evacuation, the development of abdominal&#xD;
                hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Occurrence of acute respiratory failure identified with respiratory exchanges with&#xD;
                values of P / F less than 300 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Occurrence of lack of circulation with the use of vasoactive amines in the&#xD;
                post-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Occurrence of acute renal failure (number of extracorporeal treatments and / or&#xD;
                serum creatinine ≥ 1.9 mg / dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Occurrence of hepatic insufficiency with serum total bilirubin values greater than&#xD;
                2.0 mg / dl&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Days of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Days of ICU staying&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the definition of surgical complications all the following situations are included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anastomotic dehiscences&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the need for reoperation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the need to place percutaneous drainages of evacuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. wound infection that requires surgical toilet or with microbiological samples positive&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accepted definition of abdominal hypertension is hypertension of the abdominal cavity of&#xD;
      retroperitoneal, intraperitoneal or parietal origin. The measurement system accepted in the&#xD;
      study is exclusively that one of the intravesical bladder catheterization. The values&#xD;
      considered as reference are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mild abdominal hypertension: 10-20 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. moderate abdominal hypertension: 20-40 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. severe abdominal hypertension: &gt; 40 mmHg The numeric variables which indicate organ&#xD;
           failure shall be guided by the SOFA score for severity score ≥ 2. In extracorporeal&#xD;
           treatments hemo-filtration sessions with both intermittent and continuous methods are&#xD;
           considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIZE OF THE STUDY AND DATA ANALYSIS CRITERIA This is a phase II study, which is exploratory&#xD;
      and estimative and that involves randomization of all recruitable patients during the period&#xD;
      of study all over the three centers involved in the work. The study will begin on January&#xD;
      2010 and will last for 3 years. The sample size has been calculated on the basis of the&#xD;
      available data at the Post-Operative Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital in 2007: these data&#xD;
      showed a mortality of the patients with acute abdomen undergoing abdominal surgery under&#xD;
      emergency and presenting at the moment of arrival to Post Operative Intensive Therapy at&#xD;
      least a sign of hypoperfusion of 30%. Assuming a two-tailed alpha level &lt;0.05 and a power of&#xD;
      80%, we have calculated that 100 patients per arm are needed to detect an absolute reduction&#xD;
      in mortality of 15%. This reduction appears to be significant from the clinical point of view&#xD;
      considering previous trials of fluidic therapy in shocked patients . For comparisons between&#xD;
      the means, the t-student test will be used. For comparison of events frequencies the χ2 test&#xD;
      or Fisher's test - as indicated - will be used. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Static analysis will be performed using version 16.0 of SPSS software.&#xD;
