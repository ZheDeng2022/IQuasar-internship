      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Age-Related Eye Disease 2 Study (AREDS2) looked at two eye diseases. These were&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. Participants in that study took&#xD;
      supplement pills and some participants had additional pictures taken of their eyes. That&#xD;
      study is now over. Researchers want to do a follow-up study after participants finish taking&#xD;
      the pills, to see if they cause long-term effects on AMD. This study will be combined with&#xD;
      follow-up visits of the AREDS2 study if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about the effect of oral supplements on AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who completed the AREDS2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 2 study visits over 6 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each visit will last up to 5 hours. The visits will be combined with annual follow-up&#xD;
           visits in the AREDS2 study if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will undergo an eye exam and photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The eye exam includes testing sight, measuring eye pressure, and checking eye movements.&#xD;
           To examine the inside of the eye, the pupil will be dilated with eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the inside of the eye may be taken during the eye exam and while the eyes&#xD;
           are dilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A contact lens may be placed on the eye briefly to look at the retina at the back of the&#xD;
           eye.&#xD;

      The Age Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) was a multicenter Phase III randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial designed to assess the effects of oral supplementation of high doses of macular&#xD;
      xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or omega-3 LCPUFAs as a treatment for age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration (AMD), cataract and moderate vision loss. In addition to this objective,&#xD;
      the study provided information on the clinical course, prognosis, and risk factors for&#xD;
      development and progression of both AMD and cataract. Other study goals included the&#xD;
      evaluation of eliminating beta-carotene and/or reducing zinc in the original AREDS&#xD;
      formulation on the progression and development of AMD. AREDS2 also sought to validate the&#xD;
      fundus photographic AMD scale developed from AREDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria in AREDS2 resulted in the enrollment of participants with intermediate&#xD;
      AMD, defined by the presence of large drusen, with and without additional pigmentary changes.&#xD;
      Owing to the longitudinal nature of AREDS2 study, anatomical features of AMD in study&#xD;
      participants can be monitored and characterized as a function of time to further understand&#xD;
      the steps in AMD progression. Spectral domain OCT (SDOCT) is a non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      technology that has the speed and resolution to image fine structures such as drusen and the&#xD;
      photoreceptor layers. With annotation and processing of three-dimensional SDOCT scans, focal&#xD;
      AMD pathology such as drusen can be mapped and monitored over time. The AREDS2 Ancillary&#xD;
      SDOCT Study (A2A SDOCT) added the use of novel higher resolution three-dimensional OCT&#xD;
      retinal imaging at four AREDS2 study centers to examine 400 of the participants in the AREDS2&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this ancillary AREDS2 study (study acronym: A2A_SDOCT) is to identify whether&#xD;
      measurable AMD pathology (drusen, photoreceptor layer thickness, early findings of geographic&#xD;
      atrophy (GA) or neovascularization) imaged by spectral domain optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (SDOCT) can predict progression of AMD and vision loss. The A2A_SDOCT study began as an&#xD;
      ancillary AREDS2 study; however AREDS2 had stopped gathering participant data on October 31,&#xD;
      2012 and will be terminated soon. This extension study is needed to complete the AREDS2&#xD;
      dataset by collecting images at one or two additional time points, as the study started over&#xD;
      a year behind the AREDS2 study. The data collection period for the extension will end April&#xD;
      30, 2014. Data analysis will conclude by October 31, 2014. All AREDS2 study procedure&#xD;
      guidelines for data collection will be followed, as described below, even though this visit&#xD;
      falls outside the AREDS2 study timeline.&#xD;
