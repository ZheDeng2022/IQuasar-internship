      The study was approved by the ethics committee of Jinling hospital and the medical school of&#xD;
      nanjing university. This prospective study was performed at a surgical intensive care unit&#xD;
      (SICU), which contain 39 beds, of general surgical departement of Jinling hospital,&#xD;
      affiliated hospital of medical school of nanjing university. Written informed consents were&#xD;
      obtained from the patients or their next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical patients aging from 18 to 80 years old diagnosed with acute lower gastrointestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction were recrutied to the study. The two following criterias should met for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute lower gastrointestinal dysfunction: 1. enteral nutrition intolerance not&#xD;
      due to upper gastriointestinal obstruction; 2. Colonic distension: colonic diameter &gt;6 cm or&#xD;
      ileocecus diameter &gt;9 cm under the view of computed tomography or abdomial X ray. Enteral&#xD;
      nutrition intolerance was defined as enteral feeding &lt; 50% caculated needs or no feeding for&#xD;
      three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with following conditions were excluded: mechanical intestinal obstruction&#xD;
      (including tomor, stercoral obstruction etc); gastrointestinal hemorrhage within 72 hours;&#xD;
      history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease) or radiation&#xD;
      enteritis; pregnancy; having the contradiction of proserine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on demagraphy, diagnosis, treatment as well as APACHE â…¡ and SOFA score within 24 hs of&#xD;
      admission were recorded. The included patients were examined by contrast-enhanced abdominal&#xD;
      CT, and were devided into two groups, colon oriented group and non-colon oriented group,&#xD;
      independently by 2 professionals combining the history and CT results. Non-colon oriented&#xD;
      group should met one of the two following crieria: 1. with a history of nerves damage which&#xD;
      affect colon movement (colon(-innervating) nerves damage) (such as pevic or retroperitoneal&#xD;
      operation, spine injury, cerebral lesion), and non- or mild edema of colonic wall presented&#xD;
      on abdominal CT; 2. without a history of colon(-innervating) nerves damage, whereas no&#xD;
      obvious change can be seen on CT scan. The others were clarified as colon-oriented group&#xD;
      (namely, with a history of colon(-innervating) nerves damage, moderate or more severe edema;&#xD;
      without a history of colon(-innervating) nerves damage, whereas mild or sever edema presented&#xD;
      ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients diagnosed with acute lower gastrointestinal dysfunction were treated&#xD;
      according to the protocol depicted in figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment: firstly, hydro-electrolyte and thyroid function were assessed, and&#xD;
      corrected if abnormal. Maintain the blood glucose at the normal level. Patients proning to be&#xD;
      diagnosed with sepsis were adminstered antibiotics empirically, and adjusted to more targeted&#xD;
      antibiotics according to the ensuing result of blood culture and drug sensitive test.&#xD;
      Patients were subject to fasting, gastrointestinal decompression via stomach and anal tube.&#xD;
      Gastric residual volume (GRV) was assessed per diem. Pharmaceuticals impacting bowel movement&#xD;
      were suspended as far as possible, such as opiate, anticholinergic drugs, and calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers (CCB). Intravenous administration of proserine was considered if cecum diameter &gt; 10&#xD;
      cm after the treatement described above and show no signs of ameliaration in 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopic decompression: colonoscopic decompression was applied when obvious cecum&#xD;
      distension existed (diameter &gt; 10) more than 3 days, and no signs of improvement gained after&#xD;
      24-48 hs of conservative treatment or contradiction of proserine existed. Colonoscopic&#xD;
      decompression was performed by 2 experienced endoscopic physicians at the bedside or in the&#xD;
      endoscope room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical intervention: surgery was indicated when colonic diatension lasted more than 6 days,&#xD;
      or obvious cecal distention (diameter &gt; 10 cm) continued after 48-72 hs of conservative&#xD;
      management and colonoscopic decompression ???or with contradiction of colonoscopy. ileostomy&#xD;
      was performed under epidural or local anesthesia by a team of experienced surgeons. If the&#xD;
      patients had colonic necrosis or perforation, ileostomy was superseded by colectomy under&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SICU, bladder pressure was measured everaday to reflect intraabdominal pressure. And&#xD;
      patients received CT examination at day 1, day 3, day 5 and every eusing week, other than&#xD;
      additional illness-required CT. The measurement of colonic or cecum diameter, and assessment&#xD;
      of intestional eddema, ischemia and perforation were performed by two trained fellows to&#xD;
      record the recovery time. Criteria for colonic recovery were as follows: 1.enteral nutrition&#xD;
      reached or surpass 50% of targeted needs more than 3 days; 2. Restoration of normal&#xD;
      aerofluxus and defecation; 3. Significant improvent of colonic distension or colonic wall was&#xD;
      shown on abdominal CT (colonic diameter &lt; 6 cm or cecum diameter &lt; 9 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence was defined as, patients rediagnosed with acute lower gastrointestional&#xD;
      dysfunction within 72 hrs of recovery after a certain treatment(s).&#xD;
