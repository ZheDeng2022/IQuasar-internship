    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy when given together with capecitabine before surgery in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be&#xD;
      able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy and capecitabine before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce&#xD;
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended-phase-II-dose (RPTD) of stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) at an escalating dose schedule when combined with standard-dose capecitabine as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy for resectable carcinoma of exocrine pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the incidence of overall 30-day post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the radiological response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the pathological response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the rates of resection with negative margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the recurrence free survival (RFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES (OPTIONAL):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define tumor volume (TV), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) pattern and mean apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      imaging (DWI) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant SBRT and&#xD;
      concomitant chemotherapy (ChT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC measurements at baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      versus final pathological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC changes from baseline in MRI done three weeks post-SBRT&#xD;
      versus final pathological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To predict surgical margin status using MRI done at baseline and at three weeks&#xD;
      post-SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC changes from baseline in MRI done post-3rd fraction at&#xD;
      baseline versus final pathological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe in the biopsy and/ or the surgical specimen, expression of following markers:&#xD;
      secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression; distribution of pancreatic&#xD;
      stellate cells (PSC); distribution of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+/ CD8+ T cell, CD56+&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells; other molecular and inflammatory cellular markers may be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To describe changes induced by neoadjuvant therapy by comparison of expression of these&#xD;
      markers between the biopsy and the surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To compare baseline and/ or post-treatment expression with treatment response, toxicity&#xD;
      and clinical survival outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo SBRT every other day over 2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions and receive&#xD;
      capecitabine orally (PO) every 12 hours 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Participants then undergo&#xD;
      definitive surgery after a minimum of 2 weeks from the completion of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 month and 3 months,&#xD;
      every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
