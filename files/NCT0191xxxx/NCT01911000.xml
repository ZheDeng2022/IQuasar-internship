  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT)in patients with HCC is one of the most&#xD;
      significant prognostic factors for poor prognosis, without treatment, their survival is less&#xD;
      than 3 months. In the HCC patients who combined with PVTT, RT showed 50% of local control and&#xD;
      about 10 months survival duration. Despite the standard treatment of the HCC combined with&#xD;
      PVTT is sorafenib, but Korean Liver Cancer Study Group (KLCSG) recommend RT as an option in&#xD;
      those patients. Investigators previously reported the retrospective study that the scheduled&#xD;
      interval TACE followed by RT for HCC combined with PVTT and 60% of the patients showed&#xD;
      objective response without significant elevation of complication. It is reported that&#xD;
      hyperthermia considered as the most valuable radiosensitizer in cancer treatment,&#xD;
      theoretically. Based on those studies, we start this prospective study to evaluate the&#xD;
      objective response and adverse event in the combination treatment of RT and hyperthermia&#xD;
      after Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the unresectable HCC patients who combined&#xD;
      with PVTT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1.1 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and standard treatment HCC is the third most common cause&#xD;
      of cancer death globally. It is also the second cause of cancer mortality in Korea, despite&#xD;
      the incidence of HCC was fifth. The most important cause of this discrepancy is connected&#xD;
      with the fact that the significant portion of the HCC is detected as unresectable status. At&#xD;
      the point of HCC diagnosis, only 30% of the patients could receive standard curative&#xD;
      treatment, like resection, liver transplantation, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), TACE has&#xD;
      been shown in randomized trials to improve survival compared with symptomatic therapy alone,&#xD;
      in the patients without macrovascular involvement, extrahepatic disease and tumor related&#xD;
      symptoms. However, in the recent review of TACE, TACE might be contraindicate or not&#xD;
      recommended in the patients who showed vascular tumor invasion, more than 10 cm size, poor&#xD;
      portal blood flow and/or repeated poor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 HCC with PVTT The presence of PVTT in patients with HCC is one of the most significant&#xD;
      prognostic factors for poor prognosis, without treatment, their survival is less than 3&#xD;
      months. Recently, Sorafenib, which is one of the target agents, showed survival advantage on&#xD;
      unresectable HCC patients in two randomized study. In those study, sorafenib improved&#xD;
      approximately three month overall survival increment, however, the median survival duration&#xD;
      was only 10.7 months in experiment group (received sorafenib), and even 6.5 months in&#xD;
      Asian-Pacific trial. Additionally, the possibility that sorafenib effect could be reduced in&#xD;
      the patients had hepatitis B virus (HBV) was suggested in the subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Radiation therapy (RT) for the HCC The use of RT in HCC is increased with the radiation&#xD;
      technological advances. In the unresectable patients, RT showed 50 to 60% response rate with&#xD;
      the dose response relationship. Especially, in the HCC patients who combined with PVTT, RT&#xD;
      showed 50% of local control and about 10 months survival duration. Despite the standard&#xD;
      treatment of the HCC combined with PVTT is sorafenib, but Korean Liver Cancer Study Group&#xD;
      (KLCSG) recommend RT as an option in those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators previously reported the retrospective study that the scheduled interval TACE&#xD;
      followed by RT for HCC combined with PVTT and 60% of the patients showed objective response&#xD;
      without significant elevation of complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Hyperthermia It is reported that hyperthermia is effective in S phase, Low partial oxygen&#xD;
      pressure (pO2), acidic condition, and low perfusion site which are known as radio-resistant.&#xD;
      Because of these characteristics, it considered as the most valuable radiosensitizer in&#xD;
      cancer treatment, theoretically. Furthermore ,mild hyperthermia (41 to 41.5 ÂºC) can promote&#xD;
      tumor reoxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Purpose of the study Based on those studies, we start this prospective study to evaluate&#xD;
      the objective response and adverse event in the combination treatment of RT and hyperthermia&#xD;
      after TACE in the unresectable HCC patients who combined with PVTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Hypothesis and sample size Several prospective trials showed 50% to 60% of objective&#xD;
      response rate when conventional RT was administered for HCC with PVTT, thus we determined the&#xD;
      objective response rate of conventional RT as 60%. We expect additional 20% increase of the&#xD;
      local progression free rate than conventional RT when treated with combined RT and&#xD;
      hyperthermia for HCC with PVTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine sample size, we designed to have 80% power to detect an absolute difference of&#xD;
      20% points in objective response rate between combined RT and hyperthermia and conventional&#xD;
      RT, with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. A total of 87 patients are required for this study&#xD;
      considering a drop-out rate of 10%.&#xD;
