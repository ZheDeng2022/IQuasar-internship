      The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      product during the eligibility window for that product. The Registry-specified Biogen MS&#xD;
      products being studied are dimethyl fumarate, and Pegylated human interferon beta-1a. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women&#xD;
      with MS who were unexposed to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).&#xD;

      The Biogen Multiple Sclerosis Pregnancy Exposure Registry is a prospective, observational&#xD;
      registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who&#xD;
      were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the eligibility&#xD;
      window for that product. Women of childbearing potential are a considerable segment of the&#xD;
      patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen&#xD;
      MS product around the time of conception and during pregnancy. Biogen completed pregnancy&#xD;
      registries for Avonex and Tysabri; however, formal studies in pregnant women have not been&#xD;
      conducted. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global Pregnancy Registry, how&#xD;
      exposure to a marketed Biogen MS product specified in this Pregnancy Registry may affect&#xD;
      pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective pregnancies (i.e.&#xD;
      enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7 months gestation, and&#xD;
      approximately 4,12, and 52 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The prevalence of&#xD;
      spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes will be&#xD;
      calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the European&#xD;
      Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.&#xD;

        Within each product cohort, approximately 310 to 375 pregnant women exposed to a&#xD;
        Registry-specified Biogen MS product will be enrolled in order to observe 300 prospective&#xD;
        pregnancy outcomes. The infants born to these women will also be part of the population&#xD;
        studied. Patients with prenatal testing prior to enrollment (with the exception of a first&#xD;
        trimester ultrasound to date the pregnancy) will not be counted towards the 300 prospective&#xD;
        pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

             to conception or at any time during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DMT unexposed pregnancy cohort: Never received DMT therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agrees to sign the Release of Medical Information Form, thereby permitting the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The outcome of the pregnancy (i.e., pregnancy loss or live birth) must not be known at&#xD;

             participation in the Registry unless a patient tests positive for a medical condition&#xD;
             associated with negative pregnancy outcomes (e.g., toxoplasmosis screen and syphilis&#xD;
             [venereal disease research laboratory test and rapid plasma reagin test] blood screen)&#xD;
             in the opinion of the healthcare provider (HCP).&#xD;
