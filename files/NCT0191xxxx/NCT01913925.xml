  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to determine if tyrosine, an amino acid found in&#xD;
      protein-containing foods, will mitigate the cognitive deficits and adverse effects on&#xD;
      behavior and mood produced by exposure to military stress. This study was conducted at the US&#xD;
      Navy Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape (SERE) school at Brunswick, Maine (ME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tyrosine is the dietary precursor of the catecholamine norepinephrine, a key brain&#xD;
      neurotransmitter that is critical for the central nervous system (CNS) response to various&#xD;
      types of acute stress. Psychological stress increases catecholamine turnover in the brain,&#xD;
      increasing the requirement for tyrosine to support synthesis of norepinephrine. Animal and&#xD;
      human studies have shown that tyrosine supplementation can produce beneficial effects on&#xD;
      cognitive and physiological functions during exposure to a variety of acute stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will determine if volunteers treated with supplemental tyrosine during stressful&#xD;
      phases of SERE training experience less degradation in cognitive performance and mood than&#xD;
      volunteers treated with placebo. Tyrosine or placebo will be administered in a specially&#xD;
      developed food bar provided to volunteers. The bar is part of a prototype of ration-component&#xD;
      designed for use during assault operations. A between-subjects, double blind experimental&#xD;
      design will be employed. Tyrosine, an amino acid found in most protein-containing foods, has&#xD;
      been tested in hundreds of volunteers without adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 volunteers will be recruited from several SERE classes to ensure up to 80&#xD;
      volunteers complete the study. They will be tested during several portions of SERE. A&#xD;
      comprehensive but brief battery of cognitive tests, as well as saliva samples, and heart rate&#xD;
      data will be collected in a manner that does not interfere with ongoing training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exposure to the stressors of SERE school will adversely impact cognitive performance and&#xD;
           mood of volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The adverse effects of psychological stress on cognitive performance and mood during&#xD;
           SERE school will be reduced when volunteers are given supplemental tyrosine compared to&#xD;
           placebo treatment.&#xD;
