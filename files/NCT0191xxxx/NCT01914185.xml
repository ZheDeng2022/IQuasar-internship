  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives were to 1) make students eat healthier and be more active; and 2) prevent&#xD;
      overweight and obesity. Children will therefore be less likely overweight or obese. Beginning&#xD;
      in January 2008, the Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools&#xD;
      (APPLE Schools) was implemented in 10 schools throughout the Canadian Province, Alberta.&#xD;
      Full-time School Health Facilitators were placed in each of the schools to implement what is&#xD;
      know in Canada as Comprehensive School Health (CSH). In the United States, CSH is more&#xD;
      commonly referred to as &quot;Coordinated School Health&quot;, while the synonymous term &quot;Health&#xD;
      Promoting Schools&quot; is often used in Australia and Europe. The project was evaluated annually&#xD;
      in the spring from 2008 to 2011 and as of 2009 evaluations included the use of time-stamped&#xD;
      pedometers. The comparison group included approximately 150 schools that were randomly&#xD;
      selected to reflect the population of Alberta, Canada. Twenty of these randomly selected&#xD;
      schools also participated in data collection which involved the use of time-stamped&#xD;
      pedometers.&#xD;

      The Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools (APPLE Schools) is&#xD;
      a quasi-experimental pre-post trial with a non-equivalent parallel control group. The&#xD;
      intervention began in January 2008 and lasted through June 2011 and was implemented&#xD;
      school-wide. As out primary interest is to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in&#xD;
      schools, the essential comparisons were across grade five students in differing calendar&#xD;
      years. At each survey all grade five students were invited to participate. The current design&#xD;
      allowed intervention effects to be assessed over time at the school-level. Surveys were&#xD;
      administered in the spring of 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 in intervention schools. And in the&#xD;
      spring of 2008 and 2011 in control schools.&#xD;

    <description>Students' body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1kg using calibrated digital scales and height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height^2 (kg/m^2). Overweight and obesity were defined using the International Obesity Task Force age and sex specific body mass index (BMI) cut-off points.</description>

    <description>APPLE Schools uses a CSH approach to health promotion which addresses health through four inter-related pillars 1) positive social and physical environments 2) teaching and learning 3) healthy school policy 4) partnerships and services. A key component of the APPLE Schools intervention was the placement of a full-time School Health Facilitator in each school. Their role was to facilitate the development and implementation of the project, to ensure that it met the schools' unique needs for health promotion, and that it aligned with the core principles of CSH.</description>
