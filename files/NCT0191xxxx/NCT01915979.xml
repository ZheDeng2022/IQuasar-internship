  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment of&#xD;
      degenerative rotator cuff tendinopathy using the application of plasma rich in growth factors&#xD;
      (PRGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show more effectiveness after 6 months of treatment with PRGF, with an improvement in the&#xD;
      reference test of more than 15% compared to the treatment with corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of the treatment after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification of platelet levels in patients treated with plasma rich in growth factors&#xD;
           and its correlation with the clinical effect.&#xD;

      Study Group. PRGF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood extraction was performed in the pre-surgical area using a vacuum system. A total of 20&#xD;
      ml of blood (4 samples of 5 ml) per patient was collected in sterile sodium citrate tubes.&#xD;
      PRGF was obtained following Anitua's technique. The tubes with citrated blood were&#xD;
      centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 8 min to obtain a concentrate of platelets suspended in plasma,&#xD;
      which was separated into three fractions. Pipetting was carried out with extreme care in all&#xD;
      steps, particularly in the last fraction where, in order to avoid inflammation, leukocytes&#xD;
      present in the lowermost portion of the centrifuged plasma were not aspirated. PRGF was&#xD;
      activated by adding calcium chloride 10%,immediately before infiltration. The proportion&#xD;
      required for PRGF activation is 50 ml of activator per 1,000 ml of PRGF. Separation of plasma&#xD;
      into three fractions and subsequent activation of the fractions for injection was performed&#xD;
      in a laminar flow chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the collection of blood and its subacromial administration must not exceed 90 minutes&#xD;
      to avoid contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Celestone Cronodose® (bethametasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were given 3 infiltrations of 2 cc of Celestone cronodose® (bethametasone) every 21 days&#xD;
      (If necessary, it could be administered after an application of a small quantity of a local&#xD;
      anaesthetic).&#xD;
