    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out more about the mechanism by which neural feedback&#xD;
      from the working muscle affects the development of central fatigue during exercise. Subjects&#xD;
      with chronic heart failure (HF) and healthy subject counterparts will be tested to determine&#xD;
      the mechanisms accounting for the premature fatigue characterizing HF patients during&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial part in limiting exercise and/or physical activity in humans results from the&#xD;
      development of peripheral and central fatigue during physical activity. Peripheral fatigue&#xD;
      comprises biochemical changes within the metabolic milieu of the working muscle leading to an&#xD;
      attenuated response to neural excitation, while central fatigue comprises a failure of the&#xD;
      central nervous system to drive motoneurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HF have overactive group III/IV muscle afferents and an exaggerated development&#xD;
      of central fatigue during physical activity that is not explained by their reduced physical&#xD;
      conditioning or cardiac insufficiency caused by their failing heart. The exact mechanisms&#xD;
      accounting for the exaggerated central fatigue in HF remains elusive, however, the&#xD;
      development of central fatigue during exercise has recently been linked to signaling by group&#xD;
      III/IV muscle afferents. This makes the heightened neural feedback in HF a likely candidate&#xD;
      for these patients' increased susceptibility to central fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower pH, increased lactate and increased adenosine triphosphate has been shown to activate&#xD;
      group III/IV afferents in a physiological manner and thus induce, in a rested and unfatigued&#xD;
      muscle, the intramuscular milieu associated with moderate to heavy exercise. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to quantitate and compare the sensitivity of group III/IV afferents and&#xD;
      associated effects on central fatigue in HF patients and healthy controls when skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is subject to controlled lower pH, increased lactate and increased adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate.&#xD;
