  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a chronic disease associated with an increasing risk of morbidity,&#xD;
      disability, repeated hospitalizations and mortality. Telemedicine could promptly identify&#xD;
      signs of worsening cardiac disease in order to improve elderly patients' home care and&#xD;
      quality of life by reducing the need of hospital admissions and sanitary costs. The&#xD;
      investigators present a randomized, parallel-group trial to test the ability of a&#xD;
      multiparametric remote monitoring system, in addition to standard care, to promptly identify&#xD;
      worsening of heart failure and prevent hospital admission and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The participants were recruited in two settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients discharged with a first diagnosis of heart failure from the Geriatric Acute&#xD;
           Care ward of a teaching hospital (&quot;Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico&quot;, Rome, Italy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a principal diagnosis of heart failure attending the outpatients clinic of&#xD;
           the same hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study using a&#xD;
      multi-dimensional assessment including well validated and routinely used tools to screen&#xD;
      geriatric patients in order to detect global, physical and instrumental autonomy and&#xD;
      consequent degree of dependence, as well as cognitive status. The assessment tool included:&#xD;
      Activities of daily living scale (ADL) and Instrumental activities of daily living scale&#xD;
      (IADL); Abbreviated mental Test; Geriatric Depression Scale; Physical Activity Scale for the&#xD;
      Elderly; Six-minute walking test; The Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); Cumulative Illness&#xD;
      Rating Scale (CIRS); complete list of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once written consent form was obtained, participants were allocated to the study groups in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random list of number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were followed up for six months. Patients in the intervention group were&#xD;
      monitored via a system called PHEBO (Platform for High tech Evaluation of Biometrics&#xD;
      Observation) that consisted of a commercial Android-based smartphone and a kit of measurement&#xD;
      instruments (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter and an electronic scale) with a bluetooth&#xD;
      transmitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smartphone received via bluetooth the readings from the measurement instruments,&#xD;
      communicated in real-time the readings to the central component of the system and issued&#xD;
      reminders for the patient when measurement was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the telemonitoring group received a training session during which they were&#xD;
      instructed on how to use the monitoring system and how to perform measurements in case of&#xD;
      symptoms. At the end of the session correct comprehension of the system functioning was&#xD;
      tested for each patient. A study physician was available on call during office hours to&#xD;
      assist patients needing further instructions. A technician was also available in order to&#xD;
      solve ingoing hardware malfunctioning. Participants unable to properly use the kit were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kit was able to record peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, systolic, diastolic and&#xD;
      average blood pressure, body weight, average physical activity. We set a specific schedule of&#xD;
      the measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate: three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral oxygen saturation: three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight: once a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity: recorded continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data received were evaluated every day by a geriatrician. The monitor system displayed an&#xD;
      alert when a measurement was outside a predetermined range. In case of abnormal readings, the&#xD;
      physician contacted the patient to verify whether their symptoms had worsened or new symptoms&#xD;
      had arose. In this event, the patient's adherence to therapy was checked and, if&#xD;
      unsatisfactory, individually tailored interventions promoting adherence were carried up.&#xD;
      Otherwise, an once appointment (for patients with milder abnormalities or symptoms) or a&#xD;
      hospital admission was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants not included in the intervention group received standard care. In particular,&#xD;
      patients discharged from the acute care ward received detailed instruction about medical&#xD;
      therapy and lifestyle counselling. A follow-up visit was scheduled at 1 month after the&#xD;
      discharge. A geriatrician was available for telephonic support from Monday to Friday, two&#xD;
      hours/day. Patients enrolled in the ambulatory setting were followed by planned visits and by&#xD;
      their general practitioner.&#xD;
