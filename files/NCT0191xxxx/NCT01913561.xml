  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Master Caution Garment is embedded with 10/13 textile dry electrodes that enable&#xD;
      12/15-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrodes are dry, textile ECG electrodes. The garment is designed to position the&#xD;
      electrodes in the appropriate anatomical locations, without any special guidance. The dry&#xD;
      electrodes are made from unique yarns with silver embedded into the garment using a&#xD;
      proprietary technique developed by HealthWatch (HW)that obviates the need for skin&#xD;
      preparation or the application of fluids. The garment can be connected to any standard ECG&#xD;
      device available in the hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Master Caution&#xD;
      Garment for continuous monitoring of ECG signal compared to standard gel electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following endpoints will be evaluated in subjects participating in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the quality of the ECG signal of HW textile electrodes compared to gel electrodes&#xD;
      using standard ECG devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the quality of the ECG signal of HW textile electrodes compared to gel electrodes&#xD;
      when event is detected by the ECG devices.&#xD;

      Part A - ECG in Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the beginning of the study, the following parameters will be measured and documented&#xD;
           in the CRF: blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in&#xD;
           the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient will be dressed with the Master Caution Garment and connected to a 12 lead&#xD;
           ECG device. The procedure takes 5 minutes including data printing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A twelve lead ECG with gel electrodes will be done and data printed. The procedure takes&#xD;
           5 minutes. The patient will stay connected to the monitor for the following hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After an hour the data from the gel electrodes will be printed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient will be dressed again with the Master Caution Garment and connected to a 12&#xD;
           lead ECG device. The procedure takes 5 minutes including data printing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The following parameters will be compared between the gel ECG and the Garment ECG:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart Rate (HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  P wave width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QRS complex width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T wave width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  RR interval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PR interval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - ECG in motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the beginning of the study, the following parameters will be measured : blood&#xD;
           pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Four (4) gel electrodes will be placed on the patient on the following places - Left Arm&#xD;
           (LA), Right Arm (RA), Left Leg (LL) and Right Leg (RL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will be dressed with the Master Caution Garment (MCG)on the 4 gel electrodes&#xD;
           that were already placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The same 4 electrodes in the garment LA, RA, LL and RL will be connected to a standard&#xD;
           of care ECG device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The 4 gel electrodes will be connected to a standard of care ECG device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The ECG devices will be recording the ECG signal from the two sets of electrodes for 24&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every hour in the first 6 hours the data will be printed from both devices. In every&#xD;
           event detected the data will be printed from both devices. the data will be evaluated&#xD;
           for quality comparison between the gel and the textile electrodes using the hospital ECG&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In first 6 hours for every hour and for each event detected by either the gel electrodes&#xD;
           or the MCG textile electrodes the following parameters shell be evaluated at the end of&#xD;
           the study from the hospital ECG printouts for the Master Caution Garment and for the gel&#xD;
           electrodes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart Rate (HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  P wave width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QRS complex width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  T wave width and amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  RR interval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PR interval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  QT interval After first 6 hours for each event detected by either the gel&#xD;
                electrodes or the MCG textile electrodes the above mentioned parameters shell be&#xD;
                evaluated at the end of the study from the hospital ECG printouts for the Master&#xD;
                Caution Garment and for the gel electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to evaluate the safety of the MCG and compare ECG signals&#xD;
      from the Master Caution Garment with the ECG signals from gel electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each time interval and each event detected by the ECG devices, the analysis will&#xD;
      determine its category as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blinded cardiologist's assessment whether at that time interval the patient suffered&#xD;
           from a disorder. This assessment will be based on hospital's recorded data with the gel&#xD;
           electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Master Caution Garment result for that time interval will be categorized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  True Positive (TP) = MCG Alert was right (based on GS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  False Positive (FP) = MCG Alert was wrong&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  True Negative (TN) = No MCG Alert when indeed alert was not necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  False Negative (FN) = No MCG Alert but there was a disorder case&#xD;
