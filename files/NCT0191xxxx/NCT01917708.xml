      This is a single arm, phase I study to assess the tolerability of abatacept when combined&#xD;
      with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil as graft versus host disease prophylaxis in&#xD;
      children undergoing unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant for serious non-malignant&#xD;
      diseases as well as to assess the immunological effects of abatacept. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only viable cure for&#xD;
      children who suffer from a wide variety of rare, serious non-malignant diseases, such as&#xD;
      Fanconi Anemia, Hurler syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A major obstacle to&#xD;
      the success of HSCT is morbidity and mortality from graft versus host disease (GVHD), driven&#xD;
      by donor T cells recognizing and reacting against disparate host antigens. This trial is&#xD;
      being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that the costimulation&#xD;
      blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis regimen,&#xD;
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, to improve disease-free survival after unrelated&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using reduced intensity conditioning for&#xD;
      children with non-malignant diseases (NMD). This study will have the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To conduct a multicenter pilot assessing the tolerability of abatacept&#xD;
      (n=10). Patients will receive four doses (10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14 and +28), a&#xD;
      schedule well tolerated by adolescents and adults with hematologic malignancies in a previous&#xD;
      pilot. Abatacept will be combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To examine the immunological effects of abatacept in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three reduced intensity conditioning regimens that have been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      achieving sustained engraftment in patients with non-malignant diseases are available for&#xD;
      use, depending on the patient's disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Fanconi anemia will receive fludarabine, low dose cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
           anti-thymocyte globulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe aplastic anemia will receive low dose total body irradiation,&#xD;
           fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with other NMD will receive either the low dose total body irradiation regimen&#xD;
           or an alemtuzumab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan regimen.&#xD;

    <measure>Tolerability of Abatacept</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial will be tolerability, defined in terms of the success in administering all prescribed doses of abatacept.&#xD;
Abatacept will be deemed to be poorly tolerated if any of the following conditions are met:&#xD;
More than one dose is withheld.&#xD;
Death from an infection that occurs within 30 days of receiving the last prescribed dose of abatacept, but that is not preceded by systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD&#xD;
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) that occurs within 100 days of receiving the last prescribed dose, but that is not preceded by systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD.&#xD;
If less than 4 patients (of at least 18 evaluable patients) tolerate abatacept poorly, abatacept will be deemed tolerable. If there are fewer than 18 evaluable patients, if 3 of the first 10 patients treated tolerate abatacept poorly, abatacept will be deemed tolerable.</description>
