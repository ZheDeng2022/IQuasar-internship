    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, double blind study of Anucort HC TM&#xD;
      (Hydrocortisone Acetate) 25mg Rectal Suppositories in subjects with symptomatic internal&#xD;
      hemorrhoids. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Test product or Vehicle,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations will be performed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1/Day -3 (-1 day) to Day 1 Screening Visit 2/Day 1 Randomization (Start of Treatment)&#xD;
      Visit 3/Day 8 (-1/+3 days) Interim Visit 4/Day 15 (-1/+3 days) End of Treatment / Early&#xD;
      Termination Visit 5/ Day 28 (-1/+3 days)* 2 Weeks Post-Treatment/Follow-Up Phone Contact&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes&#xD;
      from Visit 1/Screening in laboratory values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: Approximately 31 sites in the United States.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is bleeding cessation defined as cessation of anorectal bleeding associated with bowel movements or attempted bowel movements which does not recur after cessation for the remainder of the study period. The proportion of subjects with bleeding cessation using Anucort HCTM 25mg Rectal Suppositories will be compared statistically with the proportion of subjects using placebo.</description>
