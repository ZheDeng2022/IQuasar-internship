      Study of Biweekly Docetaxel plus Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Patients with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although surgical or medical castration is considered standard treatment in hormone-naïve PC&#xD;
      patients, some patients with extensive metastatic disease, including visceral or bone&#xD;
      involvement beyond axial skeleton, have shorter survival. Based on the recent randomized&#xD;
      trials (CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15 and STAMPEDE), hormone-naïve men with metastatic, high-volume&#xD;
      PC should be offered docetaxel plus ADT. However, side effects from standard 3-weekly 75&#xD;
      mg/m2 docetaxel can be substantial. In addition, a prospective trial is needed to determine&#xD;
      whether early docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with ADT is beneficial in Korean men.&#xD;
      Considering our own experiences with docetaxel, a dose intensity of 20 mg/m2/week (equivalent&#xD;
      to 60 mg/m2 3-weekly or 40 mg/m2 biweekly) should be tested in the prospective trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is a male at least 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has radiologic and clinical evidence of metastatic disease initially or after&#xD;
             treatment for localized disease. They must have metastatic or progressive disease for&#xD;
             which there is no further curative treatment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a life expectancy of 3 months or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least 4 weeks since the last surgical procedures or radiotherapy prior to&#xD;
             enrolment. Subjects must have recovered to &lt;Grade 2 from all acute toxicities or&#xD;
             toxicity must be deemed irreversible by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Acceptable hematologic status (without growth factor support or transfusion&#xD;
             dependency):&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Acceptable renal function with serum creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Any history of clinically relevant coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction&#xD;

             course of cranial radiation and restart trial medication after a recovery period of at&#xD;
             least 1 week. High dose corticosteroids may be employed for the management of cranial&#xD;
             radiation but must be tapered off before resuming treatment.&#xD;
