  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an alternative form of ventilatory support in critical care&#xD;
      encompassing different modes of ventilation such as continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and high flow nasal cannula ventilation.&#xD;
      Although numerous studies on adults exit in literature, the aspects of this ventilatory&#xD;
      support is limited in pediatric age groups. Early recognition of respiratory failure and&#xD;
      initiation of NIV in a pediatric patient would positively affect prognosis by avoiding&#xD;
      certain complications of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and adds certain&#xD;
      advantages. Decreasing re-intubation rates for the ones who are extubated but necessitating&#xD;
      further oxygen support is another advantage of NIV. Although numerous studies on adults exit&#xD;
      in literature, the aspects of this ventilatory support is limited in pediatric age groups.&#xD;
      Besides, success as well as failure and complication rates in pediatric age groups vary&#xD;
      extensively. This multi-centered, prospective cohort study is planned to observe the&#xD;
      epidemiologic perspectives of study group within underlying problems, success rates between&#xD;
      different age groups, complication and re-intubation rates and finally its' effect on&#xD;
      prognosis and long term survival in a year period. Hence we believe results of this study&#xD;
      would allow us to improve our knowledge on using this technique, applying different modes and&#xD;
      parameters appropriately and design criteria to guide clinician in deciding which group of&#xD;
      patients would benefit from NIV techniques.&#xD;

      Total of 9 pediatric critical care centers all across the country will collaborate at this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ondokuz Mayis University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Koc University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Izmir Katip Celebi University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Critical Care Division&#xD;
           Since nature of this study is an observational cohort, all noninvasively ventilated&#xD;
           children from one month to eighteen years will be enrolled in this study. A three-page&#xD;
           questionnaire is designed to collect data. The first page includes information on&#xD;
           epidemiological data, underlying disease in terms of both acute and chronicle problems&#xD;
           resulting in respiratory problems; the second page includes a multi-colon table to&#xD;
           record vital signs (heart and respiratory rate, systemic and diastolic blood pressure),&#xD;
           PRISM-III and Pediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) scores, Glasgow coma scale,&#xD;
           blood gas values, ventilation parameters, necessity of sedation (if so, drugs used for&#xD;
           sedation) and finally comfort pain scores. Data will be collected immediately prior to&#xD;
           commencing NIV, the first, second and sixth hours; if NIV support continues over 24&#xD;
           hours, then daily data will be obtained up to five days. Last questionnaire page&#xD;
           consists of data for clinical outcome, reason of NIV failure, necessity of re-intubation&#xD;
           and if so timing of re-intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of this study is to observe success rates in decreasing necessity of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation or re-intubation. Successfully managed children will also be evaluated&#xD;
      for age groups, underlying disease as well as modes of delivery and ventilation parameters to&#xD;
      define thresholds on decision of NIV success or failure. Secondary outcome is to evaluate the&#xD;
      NIV failure in terms of pediatric age groups, underlying disease, rates of NIV-related&#xD;
      complications. If a respiratory failure occurs, modes of delivery and ventilation parameters,&#xD;
      usage of different masks, timing of failure decision according to patients' clinical data&#xD;
      will be explored from collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center will fill in the questionnaire according to patient data and every two months&#xD;
      period data will be collected from collaborators. After one year period, statistical&#xD;
      evaluation will be investigated by the principle investigators.&#xD;
