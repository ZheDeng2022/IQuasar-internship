    <textblock>
      Stroke is the major cause of complex adult disability in the UK. Upper limb impairment&#xD;
      contributes to disability and fewer than 15% of survivors regain full arm and hand function&#xD;
      by 6 months. Consequently, many stroke survivors have difficulties with activities of daily&#xD;
      living where good upper limb and hand function is required. Upper limb impairment also&#xD;
      predicts quality of life and independent functioning after stroke. It is therefore vital that&#xD;
      effective therapeutic interventions to improve upper limb recovery are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various therapeutic interventions to improve arm recovery after stroke have been proposed,&#xD;
      however although effective in some circumstances, many have been proven as unacceptable and&#xD;
      unfeasible in usual rehabilitation practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of Dynamic Lycra Orthoses (DLO), as an adjunct to usual UL&#xD;
      rehabilitation and to examine the magnitude, direction and variability of any effects on&#xD;
      upper limb impairment and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This inexpensive, commercially available, CE marked, tailor-made lycra sleeve garment is worn&#xD;
      for up to 8 hours a day and during rehabilitation therapy. The DLO has not been extensively&#xD;
      studies in stroke rehabilitation, but existing evidence suggests that the garment may enhance&#xD;
      sensory feedback and correct upper limb movement and positioning, facilitating conditions for&#xD;
      recovery without the need for direct therapist supervision. It may therefore augment the&#xD;
      effects of standard dose of Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy, and self-directed&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility, randomised, controlled trial. Using 2:1 randomisation, We will recruit&#xD;
      and randomise 60 participants with mild, moderate and severe UL impairment who have been&#xD;
      admitted to Ninewells Hospital or Perth Royal Infirmary, Tayside, Scotland with a stroke&#xD;
      affecting the upper limb to receive usual care or usual care plus the DLO. The DLO will be&#xD;
      worn daily for up to 8 hours over 8 weeks. A blinded rater will collect outcomes data&#xD;
      examining upper limb functioning, strength, dexterity, sensation, use of the arm for daily&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life at the end of the intervention and at follow-up eight weeks&#xD;
      later. Data relating to duration and frequency of DLO wear, proportion of eligible&#xD;
      participants, and those willing to be randomised, drop-outs and losses to follow-up will also&#xD;
      be recorded to assess feasibility of a full-scale trial.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke causes complex adult disability, with 30-50% of survivors experiencing limited&#xD;
      independence in daily activities. Annually in Scotland there are around 14 000 new stroke&#xD;
      events and approximately 80,000 survivors living with stroke related disability.This number&#xD;
      will increase by 2035 as demographic change leads to a 26% increase in people aged over 65&#xD;
      years and developments in acute stroke care lead to improved stroke survival rates.&#xD;
      Consequently, the cumulative cost to the UK economy of stroke, currently estimated to be £8.9&#xD;
      billion, will increase proportionately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor upper limb (UL) recovery is a major cause of post-stroke disability with fewer than 15%&#xD;
      of survivors regaining full function by 6 months. Activities found difficult by stroke&#xD;
      survivors include dressing, bathing and feeding where good UL and hand function is required.&#xD;
      Limited UL function is characterised by muscle weakness, muscle stiffness or spasticity and&#xD;
      altered sensation leading to loss of movement co-ordination for functional tasks. UL&#xD;
      impairment is also an important predictor of quality of life six months after stroke onset.&#xD;
      It is therefore vital for quality of life and independent functioning after stroke that&#xD;
      effective strategies to improve arm recovery are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the problem of poor UL recovery, few cost-effective rehabilitation interventions are&#xD;
      available. Intensive repetitive functional task-specific practice is effective at improving&#xD;
      UL recovery, particularly where the unaffected UL is constrained to force practice with the&#xD;
      affected UL. However effects depend on six hours per day of intensive physiotherapy to guide&#xD;
      practice, combined with constraint in a mitt of an additional 8 hours per day. Such intensive&#xD;
      supervision although effective, is unfeasible in many healthcare settings, and survivors and&#xD;
      therapists express reluctance to participate in such demanding treatments. It is therefore&#xD;
      essential to develop effective, resource efficient ways to provide survivors with therapeutic&#xD;
      correction of movement during task practice, but with less therapy supervision. This is vital&#xD;
      because rehabilitation therapy available within stroke units in the UK is typically less than&#xD;
      one hour per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic lycra orthoses (DLO) may provide an inexpensive (£200 per unit) and potentially&#xD;
      effective adjunct to UL rehabilitation after stroke. The orthoses correct limb position&#xD;
      during movement and provide sensory feedback, as therapists would normally do. They are made&#xD;
      to measure fabric lycra compression garments individually tailored to correct UL movement and&#xD;
      positioning. They do this by providing correction of finger, wrist and elbow movement whilst&#xD;
      still allowing functional movement. The orthoses can be worn during therapy and throughout&#xD;
      the day when practising and performing functional tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, viscoelastic properties of the DLO create biomechanical forces for joint&#xD;
      stability and functional positioning where muscle weakness is problematic. The DLO may also&#xD;
      stretch stiff or spastic muscles where they limit functional UL use. Finally, pressure&#xD;
      exerted by the garment on muscles and skin may stimulate sensory awareness and sensory&#xD;
      feedback thereby improving neurophysiological control of movement. Because the DLO can be&#xD;
      worn for long periods of time, it may optimise effects of task practice during formal therapy&#xD;
      but also during self-directed task practice, without the need for direct therapy supervision.&#xD;
      Indeed, a growing body of evidence shows that DLO wear reduces spasticity and improves UL&#xD;
      movement and function in children with neurological impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although discussions with local stroke rehabilitation therapists suggest some DLO use in&#xD;
      practice, evidence of effectiveness for UL outcomes following stroke is limited. Literature&#xD;
      searches conducted by the investigators identified only one single case study showing&#xD;
      improved dexterity, dressing and writing in a survivor with longstanding stroke after wearing&#xD;
      the garment for 12 hours daily over 6 weeks. A second crossover trial with survivors (n=16) 3&#xD;
      to 36 weeks after stroke onset showed better wrist resting posture, passive range of movement&#xD;
      and reduction of wrist and finger muscle spasticity after only 3 hours wear of the DLO. These&#xD;
      studies were small and of low quality but suggest that evaluation of potential effectiveness&#xD;
      of the intervention on UL impairment and activity limitation outcomes as an adjunct to UL&#xD;
      rehabilitation after stroke is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of conducting an effectiveness trial of the DLO in&#xD;
           rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the potential effectiveness of the DLO intervention provided as an adjunct to&#xD;
           rehabilitation on: UL sensory and motor impairments, UL activity limitation, activities&#xD;
           of daily living and quality of life compared to those receiving usual rehabilitation&#xD;
           only in order to select a primary outcome measure and establish sample size for a full&#xD;
           scale effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What proportion of stroke survivors agree to participation and randomisation in the DLO&#xD;
           study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What proportion of participants who consent to participate in the trial fully complete&#xD;
           the intervention and outcome and follow-up assessments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the magnitude and direction of difference in upper limb impairment and activity&#xD;
           in stroke survivors using the UL DLO intervention as an adjunct to rehabilitation,&#xD;
           compared to those receiving standard rehabilitation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there any evidence that effects of the orthosis are likely to persist at eight week&#xD;
           follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are there indications that responses to the DLO are likely to differ between&#xD;
           participants depending on initial UL impairment severity and stroke type (lesion&#xD;
           location, stroke classification and ischaemic or haemorrhagic)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled feasibility trial to collect data to provide an estimate of the&#xD;
      direction and magnitude of effects on a range of clinical outcome variables to determine the&#xD;
      most appropriate primary outcome and sample size for a definitive trial. of particular&#xD;
      importance is assessing which survivors may benefit most, according to severity of UL&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      51 stroke survivors consecutively admitted to Ninewells Hospital and PRI and their associated&#xD;
      rehabilitation hospitals. Potentially eligible patients will be initially identified by&#xD;
      nursing, rehabilitation staff or stroke research nurses between 2 and 4 weeks after admission&#xD;
      to either of the selected acute stroke units, or when patients are medically stable. The&#xD;
      nursing and rehabilitation staff will provide invitation letters signed by the care team and&#xD;
      explain information sheets to patients about the study, with an invitation to participate.&#xD;
      The study researchers will then approach patients who have indicated an interest in&#xD;
      participation. Patients who agree after discussion with nurses and therapy staff to be&#xD;
      considered for and screened for inclusion, will be approached by study researchers 24 hours&#xD;
      after being given the information. The study will be explained in detail and written informed&#xD;
      consent obtained before screening for inclusion criteria and for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive ability will be formally assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment,&#xD;
      communication will be assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale, scales used by this team in&#xD;
      previous stroke studies. Upper limb activity limitation will be assessed using the Action&#xD;
      Research Arm Test (the ARAT). The ARAT will determine upper limb severity (mild, moderate,&#xD;
      severe) for purposive sampling purposes and to ensure equal severity sub-groups at each&#xD;
      phase. Other screening information (confirmation of stroke type, previous stroke, ability to&#xD;
      participate in rehabilitation, premorbid arm impairment, shoulder pain and sensitivity to&#xD;
      lycra and information about comorbidities) will be obtained from medical records, from staff&#xD;
      and from the patients themselves and recoded in a proforma format in the CRF. Written&#xD;
      informed consent for medical record review will also be undertaken at time of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will randomly allocate participants within each severity sub-group to a control&#xD;
      group or an intervention group on a 2:1 basis. This will lead to 33 participants (11 in each&#xD;
      severity sub-group) receiving the lycra orthosis and 18 (6 in each severity sub-group) acting&#xD;
      as control participants. After baseline assessment and, given that side of hemiplegia may&#xD;
      determine participants characteristics, stratification will be undertaken according to side&#xD;
      of hemiplegia using a secure, concealed web-based computerised randomisation system provided&#xD;
      by Tayside Clinical Trials Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed and measured for the DLO by a study Occupational Therapist (OT)&#xD;
      trained in DLO fitting. All participants will receive the sleeve orthosis, which encompasses&#xD;
      fingers, wrist and elbow, tailored to their own requirements as assessed by the OT, who will&#xD;
      be informed by participant performance on the baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OT will liaise with manufacturers and will order, fit and arrange for any adjustments to&#xD;
      the orthosis to ensure fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to wear the DLO eight hours per day for a maximum of 8 weeks&#xD;
      during waking hours. The orthosis will be removed for washing and bathing, but otherwise&#xD;
      participants will wear the DLO for participation in usual therapy as directed by the&#xD;
      therapists, and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Stroke upper limb oedema has been identified as a factor in early recovery. Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group, reporting oedema that prevents garment wear as per protocol, will&#xD;
      be provided with an oedema glove to wear at night and information on oedema management as per&#xD;
      normal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study research therapists will review DLO wear after 4 weeks of full wear. In order to&#xD;
      reflect normal practice, if issues arise at any other time the researchers will advise&#xD;
      participants and key health professionals to contact them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will also receive usual care and rehabilitation and a general advice&#xD;
      leaflet on looking after their arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive usual care and rehabilitation and a general advice leaflet on&#xD;
      looking after their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will continue to receive usual occupational and physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare Professionals: Regular therapists and nurses will record time for DLO application&#xD;
      and type and duration of usual therapy using a simple proforma log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment will be undertaken by a blinded assessor at baseline, after eight weeks of&#xD;
      intervention with follow-up eight weeks after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory RCT will allow an estimation of effect size and variability which will&#xD;
      facilitate a sample size calculation for a later definitive RCT to test effectiveness. The&#xD;
      sample size of 51 is accepted as being adequate for a feasibility study of this type.&#xD;
