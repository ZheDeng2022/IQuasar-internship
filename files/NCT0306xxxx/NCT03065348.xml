    <textblock>
      Major surgery in the elderly and frail patient is a challenge. Optimal perioperative&#xD;
      management is essential for outcome and survival. There is a need for improved&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach to improve postoperative outcome in this patient population at&#xD;
      high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Here the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation of a multimodal prehabilitation program including optimization of nutrition&#xD;
      (protein and carbohydrate loading), optimization of preoperative hydration and the use of&#xD;
      regional anesthesia during cystectomy and urinary diversion in a series old frail patients&#xD;
      and compared/matched them to a historical series of similar patients in terms of early return&#xD;
      of quality of life using the Convalescence and Recovery Evaluation (CARE) instrument,&#xD;
      cognition, and postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of patient-reported health status is well recognized and is a facet of&#xD;
      healthcare quality. In addition it is a valuable means for quantitatively measuring the&#xD;
      implication of technology adoption for the patient, who typically judges the efficacy of a&#xD;
      surgical procedure by whether it improves quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In industrialized countries the average life expectancy has continuously increased during the&#xD;
      last decades and this trend is expected to continue. In Switzerland, a sexagenarian now has a&#xD;
      50% chance, if male, and 70% if female of reaching the age of 80. By 2050, the population of&#xD;
      over 80 year-olds will have multiplied 2.7 times in Switzerland. Age is considered the&#xD;
      greatest single risk factor for developing cancer, bladder cancer is no exception and&#xD;
      typically affects old patients with a median age at the time of diagnosis of around 70. In&#xD;
      the US 32% of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer are between 75 and 84. In addition, the&#xD;
      prevalence of comorbidities in this old population is very high as hypertension is present in&#xD;
      50-60%, coronary artery disease in 15%, cardiac failure in 15%, dementia in 30%, diabetes in&#xD;
      10-20%, hearing and vision loss in 20-30%. The presence of advanced age, several&#xD;
      comorbidities, new acute medical condition (i.e. fracture or newly diagnosed cancer) define&#xD;
      the clinical condition of frailty. This medical condition is a consequence of age-related&#xD;
      decline in many physiological systems, with defects accumulating with the passage of time&#xD;
      (age) resulting in an increased risk of death (ageing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So surgery and the perioperative period can be exceptionally challenging in old and frail&#xD;
      patients due to the presence of comorbidities and age-related physiological changes. In these&#xD;
      patients treatment goals should focus on maintaining a good quality of life for the remaining&#xD;
      time span by aiming for excellent functional results and if possible long term remission. The&#xD;
      gold standard of care today for muscle invasive bladder cancer is pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection, cystectomy and urinary diversion which is associated with a high postoperative&#xD;
      complication rate (50%). This is probably why today younger age, high stage or grade disease&#xD;
      and lower comorbidity are associated with higher odds of receiving radical cystectomy.&#xD;
      However, elderly alone should not preclude the indication for radical cystectomy and urinary&#xD;
      diversion. In addition there is evidence that the type of anesthesia may impact cognition in&#xD;
      old patients. Major cardiac and non-cardiac surgical procedures are known to affect cognitive&#xD;
      function. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) varies greatly (4% to&#xD;
      41% after major surgery). POCD may persist being a risk factor for long-term cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that a multimodal prehabilitation program including optimization of&#xD;
      nutrition and mobilisation can improve functional recovery after surgery, resulting in less&#xD;
      complications and short length of stay. Optimizing the nutritional status of the frail&#xD;
      patients before cystectomy and avoiding general anesthesia could be an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional pre- and intraoperative approaches to improve outcome and quality of life,&#xD;
      including pain early return of gastrointestinal function cognition and functional activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of a multimodal prehabilitation&#xD;
      program including optimization of nutrition (protein and carbohydrate) and hydration combined&#xD;
      with the use of regional anesthesia (spinal-epidural anesthesia) during cystectomy in a&#xD;
      series old frail patients and compared/matched them to a historical series of similar frail&#xD;
      patients in terms of early return of quality of life using the Convalescence and Recovery&#xD;
      Evaluation (CARE) instrument, cognition (CERAD test), and postoperative morbidity. As there&#xD;
      is a need for a shift in the emphasis towards more patient and recovery-centric measures such&#xD;
      as quality of life, the investigators decide to assess the early return of quality of life&#xD;
      using the CARE instrument as the primary endpoint. The CARE instrument is a robust&#xD;
      multi-dimensional measure of convalescence after major abdominal and pelvic surgery. It has&#xD;
      been specifically designed and validated for patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery&#xD;
      (like cystectomy) with a high test retest reliability. The CARE instrument covers 4 domains&#xD;
      (pain, gastrointestinal, cognition and activity). The importance of patient-reported health&#xD;
      status is well recognized and is a facet of healthcare quality. In addition it is a valuable&#xD;
      means for quantitatively measuring the implication of technology adoption for the patient,&#xD;
      who typically judges the efficacy of a surgical procedure by whether it improves quality of&#xD;
      life. The Consortium of Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test is a widely&#xD;
      validated test packet for evaluation of old patients with dementia. However this CERAD test&#xD;
      has also been validated in the perioperative setting. It consists of a test battery,&#xD;
      including verbal fluency, Boston naming test, word list learning, constructional praxis, word&#xD;
      list recall, word list recognition, and mini mental state examination, which can detect&#xD;
      subtle changes in cognition. It is easy applicable and the investigators have expertise using&#xD;
      this test in a similar cystectomy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will, in a first step, start with a pilot study including 20 patients in&#xD;
      order to assess the feasibility of the multimodal approach in the urologic clinic and this&#xD;
      population. The sample size for the feasibility endpoint is based on convenience and no a&#xD;
      priori calculation was conducted. This number of patients is comparable to published case&#xD;
      series illustrating the feasibility of this anesthetic technique for cystectomy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the investigators will add 11 patients in the intervention group and then compare&#xD;
      this series with a historical series of 31 similar frail and old cystectomy patients. This is&#xD;
      based on the CARE results of the historical series (mean CARE score on POD 7 of 50.68 with a&#xD;
      SD ± 6.43 and considering a difference of 7 points as clinically relevant with an effect size&#xD;
      of 0.7).&#xD;
