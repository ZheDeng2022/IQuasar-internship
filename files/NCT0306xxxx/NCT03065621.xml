      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 trial that will include pre or post-menopausal&#xD;
      female subjects, that have ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. Subject will&#xD;
      receive 4 cycles of palbociclib 125 mg (each cycle of palbociclib consists of treatment from&#xD;
      D1 to D21 followed by a week of rest) combined with endocrine therapy given continuously&#xD;
      (each cycle of endocrine therapy consists of treatment from D1 to D28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endocrine therapy will be determined according to the menopausal status of the subject&#xD;
      evaluated at the study screening.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 trial that will include pre or post-menopausal&#xD;
      female subjects, that have ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. Subject will&#xD;
      receive 4 cycles of palbociclib 125 mg (each cycle of palbociclib consists of treatment from&#xD;
      D1 to D21 followed by a week of rest) combined with endocrine therapy given continuously&#xD;
      (each cycle of endocrine therapy consists of treatment from D1 to D28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endocrine therapy will be determined according to the menopausal status of the subject&#xD;
      evaluated at the study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For post-menopausal subjects: endocrine therapy will consist of letrozole 2.5 mg&#xD;
      continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal subjects: endocrine therapy will consist of tamoxifen&#xD;
      20 mg continuously, combined or not with goserelin 3.6 mg monthly at the local investigator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine therapy for both groups should continue until the last day of palbociclib treatment&#xD;
      (i.e. the day before surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's response to therapy will be evaluated before and after the 4 cycles of treatment by&#xD;
      ultrasound to determine response to therapy. Post treatment ultrasound should be performed 7&#xD;
      to 10 days before surgery (with a maximum delay of 3 days in case of delayed surgery date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed 4 to 8 days after the end of the 4th cycle of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy samples will be collected after the subject's inclusion in the study and prior to Day&#xD;
      1 Cycle 1 of study treatment (pre-treatment biopsy) and will consist of collection of 4 core&#xD;
      biopsies (2 FFPE and 2 Frozen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFPE and frozen material will be collected from the surgical material left over, after&#xD;
      sufficient and relevant parts has been retained to establish, improve or complement the&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One whole blood sample (1x10 mL) will also be collected after the subject's inclusion and&#xD;
      prior to Day 1 Cycle 1 of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for plasma processing (4x10 mL per time point) will be collected after the&#xD;
      subject's inclusion and prior to Day 1 Cycle 1, prior to Day 1 Cycle 2 of study treatment, at&#xD;
      surgery day (prior surgery) and one month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the biological samples collected (pre-treatment biopsy, material from surgery and all&#xD;
      blood samples) within the study are mandatory. The breast biopsy samples as well as imaging&#xD;
      tumour assessment (ultrasound breast) performed prior to the signature of the study ICF are&#xD;
      not admissible for assessment of study end-points and should be repeated within the required&#xD;
      study time window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To identify biomarkers of resistance to a 4-month preoperative treatment of palbociclib&#xD;
      plus endocrine therapy defined as stable or progressive disease by ultrasound (based on WHO&#xD;
      criteria) using RNA-seq of the baseline tumour biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify biomarkers of resistance to a 4-month preoperative treatment of endocrine&#xD;
           therapy and palbociclib by correlating tumour response by ultrasound (mandatory) or&#xD;
           magnetic resonance (optional) imaging (response will be assessed as continuous or&#xD;
           categorical variable) with RNA-seq of the baseline tumour biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify biomarkers of resistance to a 4-month preoperative treatment of palbociclib&#xD;
           plus endocrine therapy defined as residual disease burden, RCB of 3 using RNA-seq of the&#xD;
           baseline tumour biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify biomarkers of resistance to a 4-month preoperative treatment of endocrine&#xD;
           therapy and palbociclib defined as GGI high by RNA-seq of the residual tumour at surgery&#xD;
           using RNA-seq of the baseline tumour biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand mechanisms of resistance to the combination of endocrine therapy and&#xD;
           palbociclib by comparing the transcriptome of tumours at baseline and at surgery using&#xD;
           RNA-seq&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of plasma ctDNA in monitoring response/resistance to pre-operative&#xD;
           treatment with endocrine therapy and palbociclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate/further refine an 11-gene expression signature associated with&#xD;
           response/resistance to palbociclib and endocrine treatment&#xD;
