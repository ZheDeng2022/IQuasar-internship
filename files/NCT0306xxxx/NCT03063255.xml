  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with posterolateral bladder tumors will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided obturator block or a&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agent after the induction of general anesthesia in an attempt to block&#xD;
      the obturator reflex during surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the incidence of adductor spasm in patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anesthesia with neuromuscular blocking agents versus obturator block.&#xD;
      Transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s) (TURBT) is a commonly performed procedure to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat bladder cancer. The obturator nerve is located lateral to the bladder wall&#xD;
      in the pelvis prior to innervating the adductor muscles of the thigh. Depending on the&#xD;
      location of the tumor(s), electrocautery or surgical stimulation may result in stimulation of&#xD;
      the obturator nerve, resulting in adduction of the leg, which is called the adductor reflex&#xD;
      or spasm. This may occur violently and unexpectedly, and result in bladder perforation,&#xD;
      bleeding, or cancer dissemination.&#xD;

One hour after arrival to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) or when discharge criteria are met (whichever comes first), repeat dynamometer measurements and TUG tests will be performed.

Obturator block: Subjects allocated to the obturator block group will be monitored for the incidence of block and procedure-related adverse events. In addition to clinical observation, a Nerve Integrity Monitor (Medtronic) will be used to detect adductor spasm using continuous electromyography. Electrodes will be placed on the thigh to objectively detect and record instances of adductor spasm. One hour after arrival to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) or when discharge criteria are met (whichever comes first), repeat dynamometer measurements and TUG tests will be performed. Patients will be called 24-48 hours post procedure to inquire about falls or evidence of nerve injury, as well as patient satisfaction.</description>
