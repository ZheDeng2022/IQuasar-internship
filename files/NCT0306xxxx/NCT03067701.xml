      In healthy young adults 18-39 years of age, the investigators will determine if intermittent&#xD;
      inhalation a 0.1% CO, from a 1-liter bag once every minute for 30-40 minutes, at a level that&#xD;
      approaches the CO boost with hookah smoking, augments endothelial function, thus implicating&#xD;
      CO as the major endothelial vasodilator substance in hookah smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Our group has demonstrated (PRO36547) that in contrast to cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      hookah smoking (tobacco heated with charcoal) acutely augments, rather than impairs, brachial&#xD;
      artery FMD. Importantly, our data strongly implicate-but do not prove-that the augmentation&#xD;
      in FMD is caused by CO. Therefore; the investigators would like to extend the scientific&#xD;
      priority of this work by directly investigating cause and effect of CO breathing (similar&#xD;
      levels than ones obtained after hookah smoking) on brachial artery FMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenously produced gas that play important physiological roles&#xD;
      in the circulation. Traditionally considered a poisonous gas that causes tissue hypoxia, CO&#xD;
      produced by vascular cells as a byproduct of heme catabolism, also functions to regulate&#xD;
      blood flow by inhibiting vasomotor tone, smooth muscle cells proliferation, and platelet&#xD;
      aggregation. These vascular effects are thought to be mediated by cyclic guanosine&#xD;
      monophosphate (cGMP) because both clinical observations and experimental data provide&#xD;
      precedent that CO, like nitric oxide, constitutes a cGMP-dependent vasodilator. Drugs that&#xD;
      upregulate the endogenous production of CO by heme oxygenase, such as CO releasing molecules&#xD;
      (CORMs), are being developed to treat several vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toxicity of CO is dependent on the dose and duration of exposure. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      CO inhalation is fatally toxic at concentrations of 800 parts per million (ppm) or 0.08% in&#xD;
      the air. Studies have also demonstrated that CO inhalation at low doses (&lt;250 ppm) offers&#xD;
      protection against inflammation and ischemic injury in the heart, liver, and kidney.&#xD;
      According to a recent study published in Nature, repeated exposures of 250 ppm of CO for 1&#xD;
      hour inhibit experimental atherosclerosis by a cGMP-dependent process in rats. Other studies&#xD;
      have also demonstrated that exogenous CO causes cGMP-dependent vasodilation in isolated&#xD;
      vascular rings, and, in intact animals, can augment nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial studies by our group allowed us to discover that, in young healthy hookah smokers,&#xD;
      hookah smoking is a potent acute stimulus to augment-not impair-endothelial function measured&#xD;
      by brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD). The data implicate a pivotal mechanistic&#xD;
      role of one or more charcoal combustion products in the augmented endothelial function: when&#xD;
      burning charcoal was replaced with a healthier electronic heat source (&quot;e-coal&quot;), FMD became&#xD;
      acutely impaired just as with cigarettes and almost all other known tobacco products&#xD;
      including electronic-cigarettes. Interestingly, the CO boost after our hookah subjects smoked&#xD;
      charcoal-heated hookah tobacco was ~10-fold higher than after smoking a cigarette (25+11 vs.&#xD;
      3+2 ppm). Tobacco literature provide evidence that the repeated CO exposure from cigarette&#xD;
      smoking is associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (associated with pathological&#xD;
      vasoconstriction) in pregnant women as compared with both non-smokers or users of smokeless&#xD;
      tobacco (snuff) which does not generate CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published studies by our group showed that sustained CO inhaled by healthy smokers,&#xD;
      to achieve mean carboxyhemoglobin 5+1% (which is equivalent to our proposed exhaled CO levels&#xD;
      of 35 ppm), had no significant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines,&#xD;
      platelet aggregation or C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. The effects of low&#xD;
      levels of CO on human endothelial function has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken all the current evidence together, the present application aims to investigate the&#xD;
      acute effects of breathing very low doses CO-to replicate levels obtained with hookah&#xD;
      smoking-on peripheral vessel function in humans. the investigators hypothesize that CO is the&#xD;
      key charcoal combustion product in hookah smoke that enhances endothelial function, thus&#xD;
      masking the impairment seen with hookah tobacco toxicants. The benefit of this amendment is&#xD;
      beyond this project, especially if CO inhalation at very low dose, non-toxic levels is shown&#xD;
      to decrease cardiovascular risk and augment endothelial function.&#xD;
