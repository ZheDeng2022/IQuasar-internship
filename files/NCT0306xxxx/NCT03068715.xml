      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation device for treatment-resistant depression. In a double-blind fashion,&#xD;
      half the participants will receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation while half will&#xD;
      receive sham treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established therapy for&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40&#xD;
      min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been&#xD;
      effective in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of&#xD;
      the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session, 5 days per week, for 4-8&#xD;
      weeks). Recently, researchers have pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce&#xD;
      treatment times with some preliminary successes. This study aims to further modify the&#xD;
      parameters to create a more rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in&#xD;
      neuroimaging biomarkers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pretreatment (baseline), 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A ten item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders.The MADRS has an overall score range from 0-60, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of depression.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment (baseline) to 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A provider administered questionnaire used to assess remission and recovery from depression. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item questionnaire to assess depression severity. Each item is scored from 0-4, with higher scores representing increasing depression severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretreatment (baseline) to immediately post-treatment (day 8).</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a questionnaire used for suicide assessment developed by multiple institutions including Columbia University. Participants were asked a series of 6 yes or no questions. Yes answers indicate more suicidal ideation. Here we report a count of participants with an increase, decrease or no change in suicidal ideation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment) and at 1-month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, also known as Ham-D) is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale.&#xD;
The Ham-6 version consists of 6 items assessing for: mood, guilt, general somatic symptoms, work and activities, anxiety and slowness of thought and speech). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 4, except for the somatic symptoms item, which is scored 0 to 2. On the HAM-6 there can be a total score of 22. Higher scores represent higher depression severity. Here, we report a count of participants with an overall increase, decrease or no change in total HAM-6 score.&#xD;
Participants with an increase in total score (row 3) would signify a worse outcome than participants with a decrease in total score.</description>

          <description>The active group will receive theta-burst TMS stimulation.&#xD;
Active TBS-DLPFC: Participants in the active stimulation group will receive intermittent TBS to left DLPFC. The L-DLPFC will be targeted utilizing the Localite neuronavigation system. Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 90% of RMT and adjusted to the skull to cortical surface distance (see Nahas 2004).&#xD;
Stimulation will be delivered to the L-DLPFC using a MagPro stimulator.&#xD;
Open label TBS-DLPFC: All patients will have the option to receive active, open label aTBS treatment after the 1-month mark, following the blinded phase.&#xD;
Stimulation will be delivered to the L-DLPFC using a MagPro stimulator or Nexstim TMS device.</description>

        <title>Change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-6) Score</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, also known as Ham-D) is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale.&#xD;
The Ham-6 version consists of 6 items assessing for: mood, guilt, general somatic symptoms, work and activities, anxiety and slowness of thought and speech). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 4, except for the somatic symptoms item, which is scored 0 to 2. On the HAM-6 there can be a total score of 22. Higher scores represent higher depression severity. Here, we report a count of participants with an overall increase, decrease or no change in total HAM-6 score.&#xD;
Participants with an increase in total score (row 3) would signify a worse outcome than participants with a decrease in total score.</description>

          <title>Change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-6) Score</title>
          <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, also known as Ham-D) is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale.&#xD;
The Ham-6 version consists of 6 items assessing for: mood, guilt, general somatic symptoms, work and activities, anxiety and slowness of thought and speech). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 4, except for the somatic symptoms item, which is scored 0 to 2. On the HAM-6 there can be a total score of 22. Higher scores represent higher depression severity. Here, we report a count of participants with an overall increase, decrease or no change in total HAM-6 score.&#xD;
Participants with an increase in total score (row 3) would signify a worse outcome than participants with a decrease in total score.</description>
          <population>Participants with available data are included in this analysis. Only participants with paired data are included.&#xD;
Scores are marked as a change from baseline if the difference is greater than 1 point.</population>
