  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celldex endeavors to make investigational products available to patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening diseases who have exhausted other treatment options and where there is a&#xD;
      reasonable expectation of benefit over risk. Requests for expanded access to rindopepimut in&#xD;
      patients with EGFRvlll expressing recurrent glioblastoma will be considered.&#xD;

    <description>Rindopepimut is an experimental cancer vaccine that may act to promote anti-cancer effects in patients who have glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that expresses an EGFR mutation, called EGFRvIII. Data from, a randomized, controlled phase 2 study in patients with EGFRvIII positive progressive glioblastoma (the ReACT trial) suggested that vaccination with rindopepimut could improve survival. A randomized, controlled phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed EGFRvIII expressing GBM did not show a survival advantage from rindopepimut vaccination.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has histologically confirmed relapsed or recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EGFRvIII expression in tumor tissue, as assessed by a central laboratory using the&#xD;
             Celldex assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or planned therapy must include standard chemoradiation with temozolomide,&#xD;
             unless the patient is not a candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy tapered to less than 4 mg of dexamethasone (or&#xD;
             equivalent) per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient does not have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to KLH, GM-CSF or yeast&#xD;
             derived products, or a history of anaphylactic reactions to shellfish proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient does not have abnormal organ function, active autoimmune disease, active&#xD;
             infections or additional concurrent conditions that would compromise the patient's&#xD;
             ability to safely receive rindopepimut vaccine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is surgically sterile or post-menopausal, or, if of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential, had a negative serum pregnancy test within the week prior to initiation of&#xD;
             rindopepimut and is not nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to practice an effective form&#xD;
             of contraception during the time from signing of informed consent through 28 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of rindopepimut.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to read and understand, and has signed a patient informed consent&#xD;
             form, which outlines the anticipated benefits and risks of treatment with&#xD;
             rindopepimut.&#xD;
