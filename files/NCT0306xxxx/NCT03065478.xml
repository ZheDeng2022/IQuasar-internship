      The objective of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the dietary&#xD;
      supplementation &quot;OnLife&quot; in improving signs and symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN) in adult patients who have finished adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing regimen&#xD;
      (colon cancer) or adjuvant paclitaxel regimen (breast cancer). Furthermore, patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) and concomitant medication used for the treatment of neuropathic pain will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CIPN is a common side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents and often results in dose&#xD;
      limitation, switch to less efficacious agents or even therapy discontinuation. CIPN mainly&#xD;
      affects sensory nerves, while motor or autonomic nerve injury is rare. Therefore, most&#xD;
      patients with CIPN experience numbness, tingling, hyperesthesia, loss of vibratory&#xD;
      perception, and burning pain. Due to the vulnerability of the long nerves, CIPN typically&#xD;
      appears in a 'stocking and glove' distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapeutic agents that cause CIPN include platinum compounds (e.g., cisplatin,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin), antitubulins (vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine) and taxanes (e.g., docetaxel,&#xD;
      paclitaxel)), proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) and immunomodulatory drugs (e.g.,&#xD;
      lenalidomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum compounds are known to accumulate in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) leading to cell&#xD;
      death in sensory neurons. DRG death may account for chronic sensory neuropathy, which&#xD;
      manifests primarily as sensory paresthesias, dysesthesias and sensory ataxia most often&#xD;
      located in the extremities and persists between cycles. In addition, Oxaliplatin directly&#xD;
      regulates the gating of axonal voltage-gated sodium channels, inducing an acute neurotoxicity&#xD;
      which is characterized by peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Symptoms, like sensitivities to&#xD;
      touching cold items, discomfort swallowing cold liquids, throat discomfort, and muscle&#xD;
      cramps, occur during or shortly after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taxanes are known to cause disruption of microtubule function and therefore microtubule-based&#xD;
      axonal transport. In addition, they interfere with macrophage activation in both the DRG and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve, as well as microglial activation within the spinal cord. These effects&#xD;
      result in a distal axonopathy also referred to as the dying-back phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of OnLife® in improving CIPN is based on a patented fatty acid group (FAG)&#xD;
      that comprises palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid,&#xD;
      arachidic acid and myristic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEA, one main component of OnLife®, is an endogenous fatty acid amide belonging to the class&#xD;
      of endocannabinoids and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive,&#xD;
      neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties. It is synthesized in response to several&#xD;
      inflammatory and painful disorders (e.g., intestinal inflammation and neuropathic pain) in&#xD;
      order to counteract these pathological states. Clinical research revealed that treatment with&#xD;
      exogenous PEA is effective and safe in various neuropathological conditions, including&#xD;
      chronic idiopathic axonal neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, nerve compression syndromes, as&#xD;
      well as chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEA exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory functions in the peripheral nervous system&#xD;
      through its action on sensory neurons and on non-neuronal cells involved in inflammation,&#xD;
      such as mast cells and macrophages. It indirectly activates cannabinoid receptor signaling by&#xD;
      inhibiting the hydrolysis of endocannabinoids. This suppresses nociceptive behaviors and&#xD;
      counteracts macrophage and mast cell activation, thereby reducing pain and other inflammatory&#xD;
      symptoms. Another biological target of PEA is the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor (PPAR)-alpha, expressed in various cells implicated in peripheral nociception,&#xD;
      including dorsal DRG neurons and macrophages. Binding of PEA to PPAR-alpha ultimately results&#xD;
      in reduced transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS) as&#xD;
      well as repressed activity of pro-inflammatory transcription factors. In addition, there is&#xD;
      some evidence that binding of PEA to PPAR-alpha may modulate excitability of primary sensory&#xD;
      neurons by direct and indirect mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other fatty acids included in OnLife® have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of OnLife® in patients with CIPN is&#xD;
      carried out at the St. Savvas Anticancer Hospital, Athens by Dr. J. Skarlatos. First results&#xD;
      suggest that OnLife® is reducing pain, numbness and tingle and improving heat/cold&#xD;
      sensitivity as assessed by the physician. PRO, using the DN4 (Douleur Neuropathique 4)&#xD;
      questionnaire, revealed a reduction of the score for diagnosing neuropathic pain during&#xD;
      OnLife® application. Moreover, no patient showed a product-related side effect (date on file,&#xD;
      unpublished).&#xD;
