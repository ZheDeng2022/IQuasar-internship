  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a screening phase of up to 42 days, eligible subjects will undergo two whole body&#xD;
      immuno-PET scans with a non-therapeutic tracer dose (2 mg) of 89Zr-pembrolizumab; one with&#xD;
      and one without a preceding &quot;cold&quot; therapeutic dose of pembrolizumab. For the first 3&#xD;
      patients, PET scans will be obtained at 1, 72 and 120 hours post tracer injection to&#xD;
      determine the optimal scan time point and to perform biodistribution measurements and&#xD;
      dosimetry. All subsequent patients receive only 1 PET scan post-injection (i.e. two PET&#xD;
      scans). The optimal time point is expected to be at day 5 post-injection. Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      treatment will continue every three weeks until two years of therapy have been administered,&#xD;
      disease progression, or unacceptable adverse event(s).&#xD;
