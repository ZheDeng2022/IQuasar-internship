  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases and the subsequent risk of developing other&#xD;
      immune-related disorders, primary prevention of allergy has become a major priority. It is&#xD;
      generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is one of the main pillars in allergy prevention.&#xD;
      Infant formulas based on hydrolysed proteins have been developed to be used by infants at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing allergy in case a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed&#xD;
      her infant. The effect of hydrolysed formula in allergy prevention has been examined in many&#xD;
      studies, from which it can be concluded that currently there is not sufficient evidence to&#xD;
      support hydrolysed protein over intact protein for allergy risk reduction. Moreover, several&#xD;
      clinical trials support the suggestion of supplementation of pre and/or probiotics for the&#xD;
      reduction of eczema development, recognized by international authorities. The present study&#xD;
      (MAESTRO) investigates the preventive effect of a hypoallergenic concept combining several&#xD;
      nutritional approaches related to preventive strategies: partially hydrolysed protein formula&#xD;
      supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics. The aim of the present study is to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy, growth and safety of this concept compared to standard (intact protein) infant&#xD;
      formula on the development of allergic manifestations up to the age of 12 months in infants&#xD;
      at increased risk of developing allergy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy term infants (gestational age ≥ 37 and ≤ 42 weeks) at high risk of developing&#xD;
             allergy based on family history of allergy (*1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants aged ≤ 16 weeks (max. 16 weeks + 0 days), preferably as soon as possible after&#xD;
             birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants who start formula feeding within 16 weeks of age (infants of mothers who have&#xD;
             chosen not to breastfeed or mothers who completely/partially cease breastfeeding&#xD;
             before the subject's age of 16 weeks)(*2) OR Infants who are exclusively breastfed and&#xD;
             whose mothers have the intention to exclusively breastfeed at least until their infant&#xD;
             is 16 weeks of age (*2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent from one or both parents (according to local laws) and/or&#xD;
             legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1 Family history of allergy is defined as at least one first-degree relative&#xD;
                  (parent or full sibling) with: self-reported historically doctor confirmed&#xD;
                  allergic disease (allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, allergic eczema). In&#xD;
                  case of a self-reported historically non-doctor confirmed allergic disease doctor&#xD;
                  confirmation must be done as part of the screening procedure according to local&#xD;
                  practice (e.g. skin prick test, IgE measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 Subjects whose mother intents to switch to formula feeding before the subject's&#xD;
                  age of 16 weeks but in the end still exclusively breastfeed, will be included in&#xD;
                  the breastfed reference group. The other way around, subjects whose mother&#xD;
                  intents to exclusively breastfeed for at least 16 weeks, but in the end decides&#xD;
                  to switch to formula earlier, will be included in the randomised groups. All&#xD;
                  these subject s should meet all other in-/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3 Exclusive breast feeding. WHO definition: only breast milk and no other liquids&#xD;
                  or solids except for drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, mineral supplements&#xD;
                  or medicines [2]. In addition to the WHO definition, in this study water is&#xD;
                  allowed as well as formula feeding during the first 72 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Consumption of any amount of infant formula based on intact protein before&#xD;
             randomisation, except for consumption during the first 72 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Consumption of any amount of infant formula with added probiotics and/or probiotic&#xD;
             supplement before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Existing allergic manifestations (e.g. allergic skin disorders, food allergy) before&#xD;
             randomisation according to investigator's clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe congenital abnormalities which could influence the subjects' growth (e.g.&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal&#xD;
             fistula, major congenital heart disease, or any other condition according to&#xD;
             investigator's clinical judgement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe neonatal illnesses (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis&#xD;
             intraventricular hemorrhage, severe neonatal jaundice, necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
             persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, or any other condition which&#xD;
             required the use of intravenous and/or intramuscular antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known underlying disease predisposing to infection (e.g. HIV, viral hepatitis B, and&#xD;
             C, auto-immune diabetes, immune deficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Severe renal failure and hepatic failure according to investigator's clinical&#xD;
             judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;

             uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the subject to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in other studies involving investigational or marketed products&#xD;
             concomitantly or within two weeks prior to screening visit.&#xD;
