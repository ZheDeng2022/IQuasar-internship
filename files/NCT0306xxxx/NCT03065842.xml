  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many low-income countries, unsafe abortion is recognized as a leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Social stigma surrounding abortion and contraceptive use plays a&#xD;
      critical role in the social, medical, and legal marginalization of abortion and contraceptive&#xD;
      services. Though this stigma is pervasive and threatens women's health, it is not well&#xD;
      understood how it can be reduced. The Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale&#xD;
      (SABAS) was designed in 2013, to measure abortion stigma at individual and community level.&#xD;
      Objective: I) to conceptualize abortion stigma among; health care providers, secondary school&#xD;
      teachers and students, and II) to determine if a school based intervention targeting stigma&#xD;
      specifically faced by girls when accessing abortion and contraceptive services, compared to&#xD;
      usual standards, will decrease related stigma and increase contraceptive use among students,&#xD;
      who are sexually active. Design, Setting, Participants: I) Focus group discussions (FGD) with&#xD;
      service providers at YFC (n=12), secondary school teachers (n=16) and secondary school&#xD;
      students (n=20), and II) a quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study, targeting 800&#xD;
      secondary school students (14-20 y), in Kisumu, Kenya. Two schools will be assigned; one&#xD;
      interventions unit (n=400 students) and one control unit (n=400 students). The schools are&#xD;
      similar according to the study site, size and academic standards. The region is chosen&#xD;
      because of its low rate of contraceptive use, and high rate of teen pregnancy and of unsafe&#xD;
      abortions. Standard deviation is the measure of dispersion or variability in the data. The&#xD;
      sample size of 400 is based on a previous study and will give a power of 80% to detect&#xD;
      differences (95% Cl) between the two groups. Intervention: An abortion- and contraceptive-use&#xD;
      stigma reduction intervention (1-month program), capturing negative stereotypes about women&#xD;
      that are associated with abortion and contraceptive use. Main Outcome: Abortion-stigma&#xD;
      reduction. Secondary outcome: Contraceptive-use stigma reduction. Measured at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-test), and post-test at 1- and 12-months, by using the validated SABA-scale. Analyses:&#xD;
      Qualitative content analysis and repeated measures, ANOVA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Today, abortion is one of the most common practices within gynaecological care. Despite its&#xD;
      existence across time and its persistence across geographic location, the impact of abortion&#xD;
      on women, families, communities and societies differs a lot across the world. Safe abortions&#xD;
      - done by trained providers in hygienic settings and particularly early medical abortions&#xD;
      carry fewer health risks. In countries like Sweden, Romania, Nepal and South Africa,&#xD;
      liberalisation of abortion laws has had a direct and positive impact on maternal mortality.&#xD;
      Yet, approximately half of the 42 million abortions that take place every year are unsafe.&#xD;
      Nearly one in five maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion, and more than 500&#xD;
      women per 100,000 live births die from consequences of unsafe abortions. There is an inherent&#xD;
      need to invest in intervention strategies to improve maternal health, especially amongst&#xD;
      youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, abortion was only legally permissible in Kenya to save the life of a woman,&#xD;
      but a new constitution adopted in 2010 makes abortion available to protect a woman's health.&#xD;
      Article 43 in the constitution further widens access to reproductive health rights, as every&#xD;
      person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right&#xD;
      to health care services, including reproductive health care. However, contraceptive use&#xD;
      remains low in Kenya. Consequently unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortions are common, many&#xD;
      of which require medical care for complications. A Kenyan woman has a one in 55 chance of&#xD;
      dying from pregnancy related causes over her lifetime, and about 360 women per 100,000 live&#xD;
      births die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexuality education is part of general education. Its preventive nature not only contributes&#xD;
      to the prevention of negative consequences linked to sexuality, but can also improve quality&#xD;
      of life, health and well-being. In this way, sexuality education contributes to health&#xD;
      promotion in general. In some countries SRE in school is compulsory, as for example in&#xD;
      Sweden. In Kenya, SRE is not compulsory in the teacher education. Many teachers receive&#xD;
      additional training, although this training has a focus on teaching about HIV/AIDS. Oginga&#xD;
      (2014) recommend that SRE need to be incorporated and compulsory in the teacher-training&#xD;
      curriculum in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While extensive research has investigated the public health consequences of unwanted&#xD;
      pregnancy and unsafe abortion from a human rights perspective, there is little research on&#xD;
      stigma related to contraceptive use and abortion among youths. Causes of abortion stigma such&#xD;
      as negative gender stereotypes, intent to control female sexuality, compulsory motherhood -&#xD;
      are social constructs that can be deconstructed. Women's subordinate status in most societies&#xD;
      has negative implications for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is lack of research on stigma related to contraceptive use and abortion and&#xD;
      how it can be reduced, the occurrence of such stigma are widely acknowledged in many&#xD;
      countries. Few conceptual and methodological tools exist to measure its effects. For many&#xD;
      years now, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), together with partner&#xD;
      organizations, has implemented programmes to specifically address and combatting HIV stigma.&#xD;
      In the past five years there has been increased global attention on abortion stigma. IPPF has&#xD;
      thus expanded its work to address the impact that negative beliefs and attitudes about&#xD;
      abortion has on access to, and scale-up of, safe abortion services. Abortion stigma manifests&#xD;
      at many levels, from individuals and service providers to communities, institutions, laws and&#xD;
      policies, and wider public discourse including the media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, Ipas developed a scale to measure abortion stigma at the individual and community&#xD;
      levels, the Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS), to inform the&#xD;
      development of interventions to mitigate stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT DESCRIPTION Purpose and Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has mixed-methods approach, a qualitative and quantitative quasi-experimental&#xD;
      pre- and post-intervention design. The purpose is to empirically determine what role stigma&#xD;
      related to abortion and contraceptive use plays, how it is expressed, and how it can be&#xD;
      countered most effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the aim is to conceptualize abortion stigma, among health care providers in YFC, and&#xD;
      among teachers and students in secondary schools. Secondly, to determine if a school based&#xD;
      intervention, compared to usual standards, will decrease abortion- and contraceptive-use&#xD;
      stigma and increase contraceptive use among sexually active secondary school students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY The social and political sensitivity surrounding induced abortion makes it very&#xD;
      difficult to conduct high-quality research to measure its incidence and related stigma, which&#xD;
      automatically introduces bias into the result. Surveys of providers are also problematic for&#xD;
      a number of reasons, as for example in countries where safe abortion is illegal for obvious&#xD;
      reasons (fear of prosecution). Therefore the investigators have chosen to use qualitative-&#xD;
      and quantitative approaches (data triangulation) to conceptualize abortion and contraceptive&#xD;
      use stigma, and to estimate and validate the incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: I) a qualitative approach with Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and II) a quantitative&#xD;
      quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study design, comparing student attitudes in&#xD;
      intervention schools and matched control schools will be used. Tool: SABA-scale will be used&#xD;
      to assess attitudes and behaviour at baseline (pre-test) and post-test at 1 and 12 month.&#xD;
      Primary out outcome: Abortion-stigma. Secondary outcome: Contraceptive-use stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Potential schools in semi-urban settlements in the county of Kisumu, will be&#xD;
      identified according to the study site, size and academic standards (public schools). The&#xD;
      schools will be ordered alphabetically by name and imported into a statistical computer&#xD;
      software by an IT-assistant at Kisumu Medical and Educational Trust (KMET), Kisumu. The&#xD;
      software will randomly generate the allocation schedule for assignment of the stigma&#xD;
      reduction intervention to one school, and one to be operated as a control school. This area&#xD;
      has a dominance of Christian religions, Luo, Luhya and Kisii ethnic groups, and low&#xD;
      socio-economic status (SES) reflect the regional profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: I) Service providers (n=12) in YFC, secondary school teachers (n=16) and will&#xD;
      participate in gender mixed FGDs, and students (females, n=10; males, n=10), and II)&#xD;
      secondary school students between 14 and 20 years (n=200 male students; 200 female students),&#xD;
      will be included in the intervention unit, and the about the same number in the control unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The Stigmatizing Attitudes, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) is a tool&#xD;
      designed to measure abortion stigma at the individual and community level. A 57-item&#xD;
      instrument was created in 2013, pre-tested, and administered to 531 individuals (n=250 in&#xD;
      Ghana and n=281 in Zambia). All analyses were completed using Stata IC/11.2. SABAS captures&#xD;
      three important dimensions of abortion stigma: negative stereotypes (8 items), discrimination&#xD;
      and exclusion (7 items), and potential contagion (3 items) (1). IPPF adapted the Stigmatising&#xD;
      Attitude, Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) developed by Ipas to measure abortion stigma&#xD;
      amongst community members in the project areas in Benin, Burkina Faso, India and Pakistan at&#xD;
      the outset and end of the Packard Foundation abortion stigma project 2014-2016. The response&#xD;
      categories in SABAS have a Likert format from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot; with&#xD;
      each response being assigned a value ranging from 1-5. The tool can be used in several ways:&#xD;
      for example as baseline and/or endline data collection in stigma-reduction interventions or&#xD;
      as a &quot;pre and post-test&quot; to measure short-term change at the individual and/or community&#xD;
      level. The SABA tool will be further modified to adapt the tool to the context of this&#xD;
      setting. In addition new questions will be drafted targeting gender stereotypes related to&#xD;
      girls and contraceptive-use and misconceptions (including condom use) at last sexual&#xD;
      intercourse (yes/no). These questions will be drafted in collaboration with providers,&#xD;
      teachers and students, study I (FGD). This adapted tool will be used at baseline (pre-test)&#xD;
      and post-test at 1 and 12 months, to measure short- and long-term change at both group- and&#xD;
      individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and sample size calculation: Study I) data will be qualitatively analysed according&#xD;
      to guide for exploring contraceptive- and abortion-related stigma. Study II). The sample size&#xD;
      will take into account to identify a 25% stigma reduction (one-sided t-test), using a 95% CI&#xD;
      (α=0.05). The sample size was preliminary calculated to be about 1,200 and arbitrarily&#xD;
      derived since the 2 schools were drawn from a regional sample frame of four gender-mixed&#xD;
      christian schools with a minimum of 400 students (similar schools according to study site,&#xD;
      SES, and academic standards). However, for the initial validation of the scales the sample&#xD;
      size (n = 300/school) was based on the principle of a minimum of ten respondents (5/gender)&#xD;
      per scale item, and with a drop-out rate of 20%, and a further loss to follow-up of the&#xD;
      final-year students who participated in the intervention but were not planned to be followed&#xD;
      up at one-year, as they will have left the school (~30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of the intervention will be analysed quantitatively according to Shellenberg et&#xD;
      al (2013). A higher score on the SABAS represents more stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs.&#xD;
      There is no predetermined cut-off or threshold for what represents stigma. The results will&#xD;
      guide us if to use the scores as continuous variables or to create cut-offs that are&#xD;
      appropriate to the context/setting. For continuous variables, the intervention effect are to&#xD;
      be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (PASW 20.0), significant p-value &gt;0.05.&#xD;
      Within-subjects factor: time. Between-subjects factor: intervention vs. control. Dependent&#xD;
      variable: SABAS attitudes, beliefs and actions items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical clearance is recieved from JOOTRH/CDC in Kisumu, research and&#xD;
      ethics authority who will review the proposal for approval before the project starts. All&#xD;
      participants will be asked to give a written consent. For participants who are below 18&#xD;
      years, we will obtain parental consent as well as approval from the Ministry of education.&#xD;
      Consent forms will be translated into Kiswahili language and back translated into English to&#xD;
      ensure accurate translation. The participants will be informed that they can withdraw from&#xD;
      participation at any time without any consequences. The research team will ensure that all&#xD;
      research data, regardless of format, is stored securely and backed up or copied regularly.&#xD;
      All data will be handled according to national laws and guidelines. Prof Edwin Were, a&#xD;
      research team member is also a member in a regional ethical committee, and he will overview&#xD;
      the ethical aspects in this study, in accordance to national laws and guidelines.&#xD;

&#xD;
      PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATORS Marlene Makenzius from Sweden and Monica Oguttu from Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE IN KENYA The complications from unsafe abortion continue to pose a serious&#xD;
      threat to Kenyan women's health. Nearly 120,000 women received care in health facilities for&#xD;
      complications resulting from unsafe abortions in 2012, corresponding to an induced abortion&#xD;
      ratio of 30 abortions per 100 births in 2012. Severe complications of unsafe abortions were&#xD;
      most common among women aged 10-19. More than 70% of women seeking post-abortion care were&#xD;
      not using a method of contraception prior to becoming pregnant. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that the potential benefit of this study is high on a community level as well as the&#xD;
      individual level. The participants may also benefit as the intervention targets contraceptive&#xD;
      use and may thus reduce unwanted pregnancy. Unwanted pregnancy undermines young peoples'&#xD;
      (especially women's) schooling, health, social status and future opportunities for work.&#xD;
      Young people will therefore benefit from reduced abortion-stigma and increased contraceptive&#xD;
      use. In addition, in Kisumu this study will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage SRH as part of the regular curriculum in secondary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage male involvement in health-seeking practices and women's reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase access to contraceptive-use among students .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify and empower representatives from the communities; school- and church leaders,&#xD;
           and open meetings for publics (Baraza), to sensitize and influence communities on&#xD;
           problems of unsafe abortion and low contraceptive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of environments and capacity among international, national and regional&#xD;
           research actors and leading NGO's to mitigate the gap between knowledge and practice in&#xD;
           the prevention of unsafe abortions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enable women within the project to undergo research training that will facilitate&#xD;
           development of local and regional academic competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create awareness of gender equality perspective in research.&#xD;
