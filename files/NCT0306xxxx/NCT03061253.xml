  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large current uptake of e-cigarettes (2.8 million U.K. users in 2016; 26), the continuous&#xD;
      involvement of e-cigarettes (which potentially affects their contents as well), the&#xD;
      uncertainty about their medium- and longer-term effects, and the need to promote smoking&#xD;
      cessation as means of reducing Cardiovascular disease, dictate that more research is urgently&#xD;
      needed. Research exploring the impact of e-cigarettes on cardiovascular function/ health has&#xD;
      been requested by the European Parliament, the British Medical Association, regulatory&#xD;
      agencies, clinicians and researchers, as there is currently no consensus within the smoking&#xD;
      cessation community as to the potential impact of e-cigarettes. With e-cigarettes being&#xD;
      successful in replacing traditional cigarettes (i.e. up to 42% within a month), such studies&#xD;
      should not only be efficacy-focused, but should also explore the physiological effects of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes, as preliminary work in the field is contrasting and limited, in both the acute-&#xD;
      and longer-term timeframe. Furthermore, as e-cigarettes are not simple nicotine-based&#xD;
      products, the general public, researchers and government agencies cannot rely on the existing&#xD;
      research exploring the effects of nicotine on the cardio-vasculature (e.g. coronary and&#xD;
      peripheral vasoconstriction, intravascular inflammation and deregulation of cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function as well as inhibition of microcirculation). Thus, the lack of direct evidence -&#xD;
      which would clarify the degree of safety of e-cigarettes for the user's vascular system and&#xD;
      determine their longer-term cardiovascular disease risk - increases the need for research in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such studies will supply in-depth information to service-users and policy-makers, especially&#xD;
      as the recently-initiated U.K.'s &quot;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency&quot;&#xD;
      validation of e-cigarettes will increase likelihood of their introduction in smoking&#xD;
      cessation clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will bridge the existing knowledge gap and inform the general public, the&#xD;
      scientific and the smoking cessation community in respect to the physiological (e.g.&#xD;
      cardiovascular health) and participants' experience of both nicotine-inclusive and&#xD;
      nicotine-free, e-cigarettes (when combined with behavioural change support) and compare it&#xD;
      against a currently NHS-applied smoking cessation pathway that combines Nicotine Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy and behavioural change support. This will allow future research to advance and&#xD;
      optimize the pharmacological treatment of tobacco and nicotine dependence, by taking into&#xD;
      consideration the study's physiological and Health Economics' findings.&#xD;
