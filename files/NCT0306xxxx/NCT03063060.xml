  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative hypocalcaemia following total thyroidectomy is a well-known complication and&#xD;
      becoming a major area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors are assumed to increase the incidence of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia, but&#xD;
      the impact of vitamin D deficiency remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since results so far were inconclusive, the goal in this study is to significantly determine&#xD;
      the relation between those two factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first to deal with this issue through patients who underwent total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy that was performed by the same surgeon and the same surgical technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective evaluation study of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy at the head&#xD;
      and neck unit of the Otorhinolaryngology department at our institution between January 2013&#xD;
      and October 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 60 patients underwent total thyroidectomy with available vitamin D levels&#xD;
      before surgery, as well as pre and post-operative PTH and calcium levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative vitamin D and PTH levels were checked within a maximum of one month duration&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were operated by the same surgeon -Dr. Galit Avior-, with the same surgical&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves access to the patients files and admission reports. In addition the&#xD;
      investigators would like to be able to call the patients in order to ask them whether Vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency was corrected or not before their surgery, and If it was corrected then when&#xD;
      exactly.&#xD;

      Background Post-operative hypocalcaemia following total thyroidectomy is a well-known&#xD;
      complication and becoming a major area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors are assumed to increase the incidence of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia, but&#xD;
      the impact of vitamin D deficiency remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is known to be one of the most common medical conditions in the world..&#xD;
      Serum calcium is mainly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D, therefore&#xD;
      demonstration of a correlation between preoperative vitamin D levels and the occurrence of&#xD;
      post thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia may reveal an easily correctable factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, few studies have investigated whether preoperative vitamin D levels have any effect&#xD;
      on post thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia. Some of them showed that patients with vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency were more likely to develop postoperative hypocalcaemia. In addition a significant&#xD;
      decrease in postoperative hypocalcemia was shown in patients who received supplementation of&#xD;
      vitamin D regardless of their vitamin D status, while others found no relationship between&#xD;
      preoperative vitamin D concentrations and postoperative hypocalcaemia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since results so far were inconclusive, the goal in this study is to significantly determine&#xD;
      the relation between those two factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first to deal with this issue through patients who underwent total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy that was performed by the same surgeon and the same surgical technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify a correlation between pre-operative vitamin D deficiency and the occurrence&#xD;
           of hypocalcaemia following total thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine wether the correction of vitamin D levels prior to the surgery was able to&#xD;
           prevent post surgery hypocalcaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A retrospective evaluation study of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy&#xD;
      at the head and neck unit of the Otorhinolaryngology department at our institution between&#xD;
      January 2013 and October 2016.&#xD;
