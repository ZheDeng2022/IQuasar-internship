  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 3 study visits to the clinic over at least 9 days. Visit 1 - the&#xD;
      medical screening visit: subjects will undergo informed consent and will be tested for signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of Dry Eye Syndrome (DES) including measurements by the TFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon conclusion of the screening for DES, the subjects will be divided to the different&#xD;
      categories: NDE, LDDE and ADDE. For ADDE and LDDE subjects the eye fitting the worst DES&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be designated as the study eye. For the NDE subjects the best eye&#xD;
      will be designated as the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 2 and 3, the TFI measurement and other clinical study endpoint procedures will&#xD;
      be only conducted on the study eye. The safety endpoint procedures will still be conducted on&#xD;
      both eyes individually throughout the study. Subjects will be queried for adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - after two days washout period subject will return for the LH-EEC test. Signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of dry eye will be recorded before entering the LH-EEC, during the 120 min stay in&#xD;
      the LH-EEC and at the conclusion of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - after 7 days washout period subject will return for the last test. The third day&#xD;
      procedure is identical to the second day, with the addition of: following LH-EEC exit,&#xD;
      subjects will have a health check and study check out procedures conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized with respect to baseline characteristics, efficacy variables and&#xD;
      safety variables. Summary statistics will include the number of observations (N), mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum values for continuous variables and&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing values will not be replaced or imputed, i.e., no interpolation or extrapolation will&#xD;
      be applied to missing values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 study visits to the clinic (a medical screening visit, and 2 LH-EEC&#xD;
      visits) over at least 9 days. Subjects need to refrain from putting on any makeup near their&#xD;
      eyes on the morning of each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the medical screening visit (Visit 1), subjects will undergo informed consent, fill out&#xD;
      the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, and provide&#xD;
      medical/surgical/ocular/medication histories and demographics. A urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      performed on women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). Prior to any baseline symptom or sign&#xD;
      collection, subjects will be acclimatized to the clinic environment for at least 30 min.&#xD;
      Baseline subject rating of ocular symptoms (dryness, burning/stinging, tearing,&#xD;
      grittiness/sandiness, intermittent blurring, soreness/discomfort, sensitivity to light&#xD;
      [photophobia]) in both eyes together will be recorded using the electronic Patient Data&#xD;
      Acquisition Tablet (ePDAT™) on a 0-4 scale with 0.5 increments. To meet eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      subjects will participate in the following ophthalmic examinations (in the order specified):&#xD;
      distance visual acuity (VA), slit lamp examination (SLE), undilated fundus examination,&#xD;
      non-contact tonometry (NCT) followed by at least a 30 min wait, baseline TFI ocular surface&#xD;
      imaging assessment (duplicate measurements at least 30 min apart in both eyes), Tear Break Up&#xD;
      Time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), conjunctival lissamine green staining&#xD;
      (CLGS), Schirmer's Test without anesthetic, and Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)testing.&#xD;
      Upon conclusion of the screening for DES, the eye fitting the worst DES inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be designated as the study eye. For the NDE subjects, the best eye will be designated as&#xD;
      the study eye. During Visit 2 and 3, the TFI measurement and other clinical study endpoint&#xD;
      procedures (i.e. TBUT, CFS, CLGS, Schirmer's Test) will be only conducted on the study eye,&#xD;
      however the safety endpoint procedures (i.e. VA, SLE, undilated fundus exam NCT) will still&#xD;
      be conducted on both eyes individually throughout the study. Subjects will be queried for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) at all visits. The clinic environment will be monitored for relative&#xD;
      humidity (%RH) and temperature (ºC) at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least a 2 day washout period, subjects will return to the clinic for Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any baseline symptom or sign collection, subjects will be acclimatized to the clinic&#xD;
      environment for at least 30 min. Subjects will be queried for changes in health and&#xD;
      medication use since the last visit. Baseline subject rating of the 7 subjective ocular&#xD;
      symptoms will be recorded using the ePDAT™. Baseline ophthalmic evaluations will be conducted&#xD;
      (in the order specified) including VA, SLE followed by at least a 30 min wait, TFI assessment&#xD;
      (single measurement only), TBUT, CFS, CLGS and Schirmer's Test without anesthetic. Following&#xD;
      the Schirmer's Test, subjects will wait at least 60 min in the clinic and during this time,&#xD;
      baseline blink rate (blink/min, in triplicate) will be measured. Subjects will then have a&#xD;
      second TFI measurement and then enter the LH-EEC. Subject symptom scoring and staff assessed&#xD;
      blink rate will be assessed on both eyes together throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will enter the LH-EEC (&lt;15% relative humidity (RH), temperature 22±5ºC, and 5±3ft/s&#xD;
      directed air flow velocity) and remain for approximately 120 min. During this time subjects&#xD;
      are asked to visually task on a digital screen to ensure the ocular surface is exposed to the&#xD;
      airflow and humidity levels in the room. Environmental conditions in the LH-EEC, including&#xD;
      relative humidity (%RH) and temperature (ºC), will be monitored. Subject-assessed symptoms&#xD;
      will be assessed at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (+5 min), while in the LH-EEC. Blink rate and&#xD;
      TFI tear film imaging assessment (single measurement on the study eye only) will be assessed&#xD;
      by qualified staff at 35, 65, 95 min (+15 min), and prior to LH-EEC exit. After all other&#xD;
      procedures and prior to exiting the chamber, VA, TBUT, CFS, CLGS, and Schirmer's Test without&#xD;
      topical anesthetic, will be performed. After LH-EEC exit, a health check will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least a 7 day washout period, subjects will return to the clinic on Visit 3 for&#xD;
      their second LH-EEC visit. Subjects will be queried for changes in health and medication use&#xD;
      since the last visit. Subjects will once again enter the LH-EEC (&lt;15% relative humidity [RH],&#xD;
      temperature 22±5ºC, and 5±3ft/s directed air flow velocity) for approximately 120 min. All&#xD;
      procedures prior to LH-EEC entry, during LH-EEC exposure and prior to LH-EEC exit will be&#xD;
      repeated as in Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following LH-EEC exit, subjects will have a health check and study check out procedures&#xD;
      conducted including: VA, SLE, undilated fundus exam, and NCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Sets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safety set will consist of all subjects who were enrolled in the study. The Modified&#xD;
      Intent-to-Treat population (MITT) set will consist of all subjects who were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study and who entered the LH-EEC and provided at least one post-baseline measurement. The&#xD;
      Per-Protocol population (PP) set will consist of all subjects from MITT population who&#xD;
      complete Visit 3 and do not have any protocol violations that may substantially affect the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be summarized with respect to baseline characteristics, efficacy variables and&#xD;
      safety variables. Summary statistics will include the number of observations (N), mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum values for continuous variables and&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Missing values will not be replaced or&#xD;
      imputed, i.e., no interpolation or extrapolation will be applied to missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be listed and summarized by group (NDE, ADDE, and LDDE). Any deviation(s)&#xD;
      from the planned statistical analysis will be described and fully justified in the&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and/or the final clinical study report (CSR) as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Baseline Characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects who participated in this study will be&#xD;
      summarized by study group (NDE, ADDE, and LDDE) and overall using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Distributions of these baseline parameters among study groups will be compared descriptively&#xD;
      only. No statistical inference will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated via the following parameters: AEs, SLE, VA, NCT, Fundus examination&#xD;
      AEs will be summarized for severity and causality. AEs will be summarized by body system and&#xD;
      preferred term within each study group (NDE/ADDE/LDDE). Each AE will be counted only once for&#xD;
      a given subject. If the same AE occurred in a subject on multiple occasions, the highest&#xD;
      severity and maximum causality relationship will be assumed. Serious AEs (SAEs), if any, will&#xD;
      be summarized by body system, preferred term and study group. All AEs will be listed, along&#xD;
      with SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation. NCT assessment will be performed at Screening&#xD;
      (Visit 1) and at end of study (Visit 3), to measure the Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP). The&#xD;
      collected data (average of 3 readings for each eye) will be listed by study group, subject&#xD;
      and visit. Summary statistics of the average of 3 readings for each eye will be tabulated for&#xD;
      Study eye, Right and Left eye. Study eye will be defined in the SAP. VA assessment will be&#xD;
      performed at each visit. Data will be listed by ADDE/ LDDE/NDE group, subject and visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Study Termination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the device related SAE rate exceeds 20% in any specific group (ADDE/LDDE/NDE) the study of&#xD;
      this group will be halted and a report will immediately be sent to the Sponsor. The&#xD;
      Investigator and the Sponsor will analyze this report and offer a protocol update to the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) to rectify the problem. If the IRB approves the updated&#xD;
      protocol, the study will continue based on the updated protocol. If the IRB will not accept&#xD;
      the updated protocol the specific group study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the clinical endpoints will be carried out using both the MITT and PP&#xD;
      populations. All summary tables will be provided by study group (NDE, ADDE, and LDDE) and&#xD;
      overall. The repeatability of the TFI will be evaluated from summary of TFI assessments&#xD;
      between Visit 2 and Visit 3. The sensitivity of the imager to detect changes in ocular&#xD;
      surface integrity will be evaluated from the summary of baseline to post baseline assessment&#xD;
      scores by time points and visit. The correlation between the clinical measurements of DE and&#xD;
      the corresponding TFI measurement of interest will evaluate the association between the two&#xD;
      assessments. Descriptive statistics of all observed assessment scores at each time point and&#xD;
      the change at each post LH-EEC time point from pre LH-EEC baseline score will be summarized.&#xD;
      Individual data listings of all observed values will be presented by study group, visit and&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
