      The prospective randomized clinical study investigating the effect of mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      on tendon healing. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effect of concentrated&#xD;
      bone marrow stem cells ( MSCs ) to the healing of sutured tendon of the supraspinatus muscle&#xD;
      in comparison to the same procedure performed without MSCs. We have postulated the hypothesis&#xD;
      that MSCs enhance the healing of the sutured supraspinatus tendon to its humeral footprint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective randomized study is carried out at orthopaedic and traumatology, haematology&#xD;
      and radiology departments. 50 patients were included in the study. Of the 25 patients in both&#xD;
      groups, Group I (received the concentrate of marrow MSCs into the tendon- bone contact point&#xD;
      at the site of the suture during surgery ) consisted of 7 women and 18 men ( mean age 51,2&#xD;
      years ), Group II ( without the use of MSCs ) consisted of 15 women and 10 men ( mean age&#xD;
      50,5 years ). Selection of patients into both groups was performed using permutation block&#xD;
      randomization computer software Random Number Generator Software 7.0. All of&#xD;
      radiographs/MRI/CT results were evaluated by an experienced radiologist specialized in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pathologies, that was blinded to the both groups of patients. Before entering&#xD;
      the study, patients signed an informed consent created by the Ethical Committee of local&#xD;
      hospital and were randomly assigned to one of the treatment possibilities with use of the&#xD;
      Random Number Generator Software 7.0 by the method 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgical treatment, patients completed a questionnaire with VAS score, ASES score&#xD;
      ( American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form ) and the&#xD;
      Constant score. Further clinical control with completing these questionnaires is 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery, 1 year after surgical treatment, 2, 5 and ten years postoperatively. Two years&#xD;
      after the surgery MRI examination of the shoulder joint is performed. All of the outpatient&#xD;
      clinical evaluations during the study were performed by the orthopaedic surgeon blinded to&#xD;
      the both groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual therapy was as follows: open surgery was preceded by a standard diagnostic&#xD;
      arthroscopy, which was performed from the posterior portal for optics and anterior portal for&#xD;
      arthroscopic instruments. The tendons of the rotator cuff were assessed from both sides -&#xD;
      intraarticular and subacromial. To evaluate cuff tendon injury perioperatively and to measure&#xD;
      the rupture width, a special arthroscopic hook calibrated in 1 mm was used. To evaluate the&#xD;
      shape of the rupture, the classification of Ellman - Gartsman was used. Surgical treatment of&#xD;
      injured tendons of the rotator cuff was performed in the beach chair position of the patient,&#xD;
      by the deltoid muscle split approach. After evaluation of the extent and location of the cuff&#xD;
      tendon lesion the aspiration of 10 ml of bone marrow blood was done ( from the humeral head&#xD;
      through the same surgical approach ) into a 20 mL syringe prefilled with 0.5 ml of heparin&#xD;
      with the Yamshidi needle. Aspiration of the bone marrow was performed by surgeon. From one&#xD;
      bone puncture was aspirated maximally 3 ml of marrow blood. Centrifugation of the aspirate in&#xD;
      10 ml test-tube Monovette filled with citrate followed. Selected centrifugation regime&#xD;
      consisted of gradient 15 minute centrifugation at 200 g RCF ( relative centrifugal force ).&#xD;
      After such a centrifugation the tube contents is divided into three parts. The upper layer&#xD;
      consists of the platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the middle layer of the buffy coat with the&#xD;
      dominant proportion of leukocytes, and the lower layer is formed by sedimented erythrocytes.&#xD;
      Using a sterile laboratory pipette, a collection of the buffy coat was performed. MSCs&#xD;
      represented 0.01 to 0.02 % of all nuclear elements of the buffy coat, that is about 10 x 106&#xD;
      / l. The MSCs concentrate ( similar to synovial fluid in consistency and colour ) was&#xD;
      impregnated into the collagen patch Hypro-Sorb F ( Otrokovice, Czech Republic ) of dimensions&#xD;
      1x2 cm. The collagen patch as a carrier of the MSCs concentrate was used to ensure its&#xD;
      retention in desired place. This material was then inserted between the tendon and bone, into&#xD;
      the place of re-fixing of the rotator cuff tendons ( footprint ) before tightening the&#xD;
      threads of the anchors. Fixation of the tendon to the bone was made by a double row method&#xD;
      with use of absorbable fixation anchors BioComposite Corkscrew ( Arthrex, Munich, Germany ).&#xD;
      In all such treated cases the tendon was fixed in place of original attachment without any&#xD;
      stress and without the need of abduction of the arm above 60 degrees. All patients underwent&#xD;
      Neer acromioplasty for an increase of the subacromial space. This procedure was followed by&#xD;
      the standard surgical wound closure in all anatomical layers, sterile dressing of the wound&#xD;
      and by applying of the abduction orthosis. All patients were operated by the same orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeon with the same surgical technique. Open surgery instead of arthroscopy was chosen&#xD;
      because of the safer fixation of the MSCs carrier under the re-inserted tendon and to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of washout of the MSCs concentrate from the carrier during the arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment of patients in Group II was identical as in Group I, except the aspiration&#xD;
      of bone marrow from the humeral head and subsequent application of the scaffold saturated&#xD;
      with MSCs into the tendon / bone interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abduction fixation lasted for 4 weeks. Passive motion over the horizontal line under the&#xD;
      guidance of a physiotherapeutist was initiated the first postoperative day. After removing&#xD;
      the fixation, an active rehabilitation began, that is a full range of motion exercises done&#xD;
      actively 6 weeks after surgery. Full load was allowed 12 weeks after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient follow-up took place according to the schedule mentioned above. To check the&#xD;
      integrity of the tendon at the point of insertion into the greater tuberosity of the humerus,&#xD;
      MRI of the shoulder joint was performed 2 years postoperatively. Both, preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative MRI examinations were performed with a 1.5T high-field scanner, in sagittal,&#xD;
      coronal, and axial planes, in T1- and T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences ( MRI arthrography&#xD;
      using gadollinium as a contrast medium ). All of MRI results were evaluated by an experienced&#xD;
      radiologist specialized in musculoskeletal pathologies. He evaluated tendon integrity,&#xD;
      presence and localisation of complete retear, tendon and muscle borders, and presence of&#xD;
      abnormal artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the&#xD;
      supraspinatus tendon reconstruction surgery will have a positive effect in the assessment of&#xD;
      both subjective and objective scoring systems, and also in terms of reducing the number of&#xD;
      tendon reruptures compared to the patients population in which mesenchymal stem cells were&#xD;
      not used. All data were statistically analyzed with STATISTICA 9.0 programme. To compare the&#xD;
      results of the of the VAS score, the Constant score, and the ASES score preoperatively and&#xD;
      one year after the surgery Student´s t- test was used, to compare the incidence of reruptures&#xD;
      between both groups of patients 2 years postoperatively Chi-square test was used. The&#xD;
      significance level was determined at p &lt;0.05. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      treatment possibilities with use of the Random Number Generator Software 7.0 by the method&#xD;
      1:1&#xD;
