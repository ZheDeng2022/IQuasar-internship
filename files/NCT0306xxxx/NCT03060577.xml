  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ORION-3 is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, active comparator extension trial to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran and&#xD;
      evolocumab given as subcutaneous injections in participants with high cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORION-3 is an open label, long term extension study with two arms: Group 1 (inclisiran only&#xD;
      arm) will receive inclisiran only and Group 2 (switching arm) will receive an active&#xD;
      comparator (evolocumab) followed by inclisiran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORION-3 will be conducted in subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or&#xD;
      ASCVD-risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C lowering therapies who have completed study&#xD;
      MDCO-PCS-15-01 (ORION-1) [NCT02597127], to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      long-term dosing of inclisiran.&#xD;
