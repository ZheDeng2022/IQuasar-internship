    <textblock>
      Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) is one of the most challenging complications in long&#xD;
      term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As the number of allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantations rises annually, the incidence of chronic GVHD rates have also increased due&#xD;
      to a variety of factors including but not limited to increasing use of peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell (PBSC) grafts, increasing age of both donors and recipients, and increased use of&#xD;
      matched unrelated donors. One study showed much lower than traditional acute GHVD rate and&#xD;
      chronic GHVD which is similar with historical rates when atorvastatin was administered&#xD;
      prophylactically to both the donors as well as recipients of matched related allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation, lead to the interest in further examining the role of Atorvastatin in&#xD;
      relation to the development of GVHD. The investigator hypothesize that the administration of&#xD;
      atorvastatin in recipients of matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a group&#xD;
      with known higher incidence of chronic GHVD, would be a safe and effective method to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of chronic GVHD. Matched related allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      recipients will not be included in this study due to their significantly lower GVHD rates.&#xD;
      The definition and monitoring of our primary endpoint of GVHD is well established in clinical&#xD;
      trials in allogeneic stem cell transplantations and the investiagor will utilize the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) Staging System for the diagnosis and severity assessment of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD as well the recommendations from the NIH Consensus Conference for the conduct of&#xD;
      clinical trials in chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several secondary endpoints will be examined as defined below and include standard&#xD;
      complementary data in the examination of clinical trials in chronic GVHD again as laid out by&#xD;
      the NIH Consensus Conference for conduct of clinical trials in chronic GHVD.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, open label phase III trial in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia,&#xD;
      Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Myelodysplastic Syndrome undergoing matched unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the treatment arm (atorvastatin):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prophylaxis atorvastatin treatment (taken by mouth) for GVHD will start at 14 days prior&#xD;
      to transplant and continue until 365 days post-transplant or until development of significant&#xD;
      adverse events or desire of the primary treating physician to stop the administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will also receive our institution's standard graft versus host disease&#xD;
      prophylactic regimen which consists of two drugs. It has been shown that immunosuppression&#xD;
      with two drugs is better than a single agent thus our institution utilizes a combination of&#xD;
      Methotrexate and Tacrolimus. For all matched unrelated donor allogeneic transplantation&#xD;
      patients, the following schedule of Methotrexate will be administered intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      post-transplant on Days 1, 3 and 6. Tacrolimus will be administered 2 days prior to&#xD;
      transplant and continue approximately 180 days post-transplant. Tacrolimus will be&#xD;
      administered IV until patient can take it by mouth.&#xD;
