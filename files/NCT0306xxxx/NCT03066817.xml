  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although vitamin D is known to play a major role in multiple organ functions in healthy&#xD;
      adults, including bone homeostasis, its role in the unique population of orthopaedic&#xD;
      polytrauma patients has not been well described. The aim of this therapeutic randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled feasibility study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      initiated on admission on patients' 25(OH)-D level, bone turnover markers, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in a cohort of adult orthopaedic polytrauma patients. Polytrauma patients with one&#xD;
      or more orthopaedic injuries admitted to an urban Level I trauma center will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility based upon strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty patients meeting the&#xD;
      criteria will be consented, enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention and&#xD;
      control (placebo) arm. Baseline 25(OH)-D and bone turnover marker levels will be drawn for&#xD;
      all the patients on admission, and the intervention arm will receive a one-time dose of&#xD;
      ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) 400,000 IU shortly after enrollment. The labs will be repeated 7&#xD;
      days after the initial draw or at discharge, whichever occurs first. Patients' daily&#xD;
      immobilization status, baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes will be recorded.&#xD;
      Statistical methods will be used to assess whether there is a difference in 25(OH)-D and bone&#xD;
      turnover markers levels associated with the intervention.&#xD;

      Sixty polytrauma patients presenting to Jacobi Medical Center will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria by study personnel on&#xD;
      admission. Medical history, physical examination, and laboratory findings will be collected&#xD;
      and assessed to ensure that patients meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled after obtaining informed consent from either the subject or health&#xD;
      care proxy if the subject is not able to participate in the decision-making process secondary&#xD;
      to his injuries or mental status. As this dose of vitamin D has not been previously studied&#xD;
      in pregnant subjects, female subjects will be counseled on potential pregnancy risks and will&#xD;
      undergo urine pregnancy testing prior to administration of the investigational agent/placebo.&#xD;
      Female patients testing positive for pregnancy will be removed from the study. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment, study personnel will assign subjects a study ID and record this information in a&#xD;
      password-protected data collection document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects will have blood draws by phlebotomy or nursing staff for the&#xD;
      above-mentioned bone turnover markers once consent is obtained. This will include specimen&#xD;
      collection and processing for the following serum levels in both study arms: 25(OH)-D, PTH,&#xD;
      collagen type I C-telopeptide, calcium, phosphorus, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
      This initial specimen collection will occur in the interval between 0 and 72 hours of&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected specimen will be assigned unique identifiers corresponding to patients' study IDs&#xD;
      and delivered to core labs at Jacobi Medical Center. From there, the specimen will be sent to&#xD;
      an outside testing facility (Northwell Laboratories, Lake Success, NY), where specimen&#xD;
      processing will occur. Normal laboratory values will be established by the outside testing&#xD;
      facility according to CLIA standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study personnel will liaise with the JMC Main or Satellite Pharmacy to alert them&#xD;
      regarding newly enrolled study subjects. The pharmacist will then assign patients according&#xD;
      to randomization algorithm in a 1:1 ratio to intervention and control arms, with 30 patients&#xD;
      in each group by the end of the study accrual. The pharmacist will then prepare and transport&#xD;
      the investigational agent or placebo to the subject's location for administration by nursing&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention cohort will receive 400,000IU liquid ergocalciferol (50cc of 8000IU/cc&#xD;
      Calcidol solution) via oral, NG tube, or gastrostomy route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control cohort will receive 50cc of propylene glycol as placebo via oral, NG tube, or&#xD;
      gastrostomy route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat specimen collection of above-mentioned bone turnover markers will commence either at&#xD;
      7 days if patient is still inpatient, or at discharge, whichever occurs first. The specimens&#xD;
      obtained at that time will be treated in the same manner as the initial specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each enrolled subject, the investigators will collect data from hospital presentation to&#xD;
      discharge on standard demographics, routine laboratory results, clinical and injury&#xD;
      characteristics and hospital course data (length of stay, in-hospital mortality, mobilization&#xD;
      status, associated inpatient procedures and complications).&#xD;
