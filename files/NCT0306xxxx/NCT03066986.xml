  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential use of delta-inulin as an adjuvant to&#xD;
      facilitate the desired immune response to Jack Jumper Ant (JJA) venom with a lower dose of&#xD;
      venom, thus reducing adverse reactions, venom requirements and costs of treatment.&#xD;
      Specifically we aim to compare outcomes of in-hospital JJA sting challenges and JJA venom&#xD;
      specific IgE, and IgG4 responses to semi-rush JJA VIT at maintenance doses of 25 and 50 mcg&#xD;
      of JJA venom, with and without delta-inulin adjuvant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background JJA sting appears to be a dominant cause of insect sting anaphylaxis in the cooler&#xD;
      areas of southern and eastern Australia where the native ant is prevalent. Immunotherapy for&#xD;
      treatment of stinging insect anaphylaxis involves the administration of increasing doses of&#xD;
      purified insect venom with the aim of inducing clinical tolerance, but also carrying the risk&#xD;
      of allergic reactions to treatment. In a randomised double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      of JJA VIT7 we have shown JJA VIT to be highly effective at preventing JJA sting anaphylaxis,&#xD;
      with an objective systemic sting reaction rate in those who were on maintenance JJA VIT &lt; 5%&#xD;
      vs 70% for those receiving placebo VIT. Real world experience in Tasmania has supported these&#xD;
      findings with objective systemic reaction rates to sting challenges on 50 and 100 mcg&#xD;
      maintenance doses respectively 14/130 and 12/126 subjects as against reaction rates to stings&#xD;
      in similar subjects without JJA VIT of 70-76% in trial and epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although JJA VIT is highly effective at preventing severe objective reactions to JJA stings,&#xD;
      its applicability is limited by (1) venom availability with venom collected by venom sac&#xD;
      dissection of ants harvested from wild nests with inherent WH&amp;S risks; (2) venom costs, at $2&#xD;
      per microgram of venom (3) as with honey bee VIT difficulties in a significant minority of&#xD;
      subjects in achieving maintenance because of immediate generalised allergic reactions (4)&#xD;
      prolonged therapy, generally 5 years or longer - for those in whom a previous sting reaction&#xD;
      was immediately life-threatening, treatment continues indefinitely for as long as the risk of&#xD;
      an accidental sting remains. An adjuvant that would facilitate the wanted immune response to&#xD;
      JJA venom has the potential to reduce venom requirements and thereby reduce costs and&#xD;
      increase availability of JJA VIT, reduce the number of hospital visits required and if the&#xD;
      protective response can be achieved with lower doses of venom and/or earlier in therapy,&#xD;
      reduce the number of systemic allergic reactions to JJA VIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inulin is a natural storage polysaccharide in some plants. It is approved around the world&#xD;
      for intravenous human use in renal function studies and generally regarded as safe. Inulin&#xD;
      exists in different polymorphic forms, and water suspensions of inulin particles in delta&#xD;
      polymorphic form are potent adjuvants that preferentially induce IgG4 without the toxicity&#xD;
      exhibited by other adjuvants and without increasing IgE production as occurs with traditional&#xD;
      aluminum-based adjuvants. This effect is particularly important as one of the functions of&#xD;
      VIT is to reduce IgE and increase IgG4, making inulin an ideal candidate vaccine adjuvant to&#xD;
      be tested in combination with VIT. A cGMP product of delta-inulin adjuvant (Advaxâ„¢) is&#xD;
      supplied in Australia by Vaxine Pty Ltd (Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, SA 5042) and&#xD;
      is suitable for human use. Delta-inulin adjuvant (Advax) have successfully been tested in&#xD;
      adult human subjects in combination with such antigens as Hepatitis B virus surface antigen&#xD;
      and influenza haemagglutinin, with an excellent safety record and evidence of antigen&#xD;
      dose-sparing, greater sero-protection and fewer systemic adverse effects. In the recently&#xD;
      completed RAH-FMC trial of honey bee venom immunotherapy with and without delta inulin the&#xD;
      addition of the adjuvant delta-inulin to honey bee venom vaccine has been shown in another&#xD;
      study to promote a better immune response than the standard venom preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The aim of this proposed study is to compare responses to in-hospital sting&#xD;
      challenges and JJA venom specific lgE and IgG4 responses to semi-rush JJA VIT at doses of 25&#xD;
      and 50 mcg of JJA venom, with and without delta-inulin adjuvant (Advax). Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomised, ten to each arm, to receive semi-rush JJA VIT with or without delta-inulin (a&#xD;
      fixed dose of 5 mg with each dose of venom) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom&#xD;
      of 25 or 50 mcg. The study will be subject and observer blind because it is very difficult to&#xD;
      mask from attending nursing staff the turbid appearance of the delta-inulin containing&#xD;
      vaccines and we judge it unsafe to use opaque syringes. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to&#xD;
      use a placebo that mimics the cloudy appearance of venom vaccine containing delta-inulin&#xD;
      without first performing a trial on the placebo itself to ensure that it does not either&#xD;
      positively or negatively influence the effect of the venom extract. In a previous study with&#xD;
      256 sting challenges performed after 12 months JJA VIT, 50 mcg and 100 mcg of JJA venom&#xD;
      appear to have similar efficacy as maintenance doses. In an attempt to give all participants&#xD;
      a real possibility of some medium term protection, the study schedule has been designed such&#xD;
      that, after effects of twelve months of maintenance injections have been assessed by sting&#xD;
      challenges, all subjects in 25 mcg maintenance dose arms giving suboptimal responses in&#xD;
      comparison to standard 50 mcg dose group will be offered conversion to the 50 mcg&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of subjects Subjects for this study will be recruited from the Royal Adelaide and&#xD;
      Royal Hobart Hospitals. We plan to recruit a total of 40 patients to this study, half of whom&#xD;
      (i.e. 20 subjects) will be recruited from the Royal Adelaide Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a Phase 1/2 study, no formal sample size estimation is normally required. The&#xD;
      sample of 20 patients for the delta-inulin adjuvant preparation and 20 control subjects&#xD;
      receiving standard venom therapy without adjuvant was chosen in order to provide adequate&#xD;
      evaluation of the study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Participants will be randomised in equal proportions to receive a top study&#xD;
      dose 25 or 50 mcg of JJA venom with or without 5 mg delta-inulin adjuvant, that is four (4)&#xD;
      study groups each of ten (10) subjects. Randomisation will be performed in real time, with&#xD;
      all calls/emails regarding allocation to be logged to ensure adherence to allocation. Given&#xD;
      the small patient numbers, we will use a randomisation table. Patients will also be&#xD;
      stratified by site, with a target of 20 cases at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given by our established semi-rush regimen adapted for different target&#xD;
      maintenance doses. Following this groups with modified doses will continue designated&#xD;
      maintenance dose monthly to 12 months of maintenance VIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adverse events during venom immunotherapy. Severe (hypersensitivity and&#xD;
           non-hypersensitivity) reactions to JJA VIT, deaths and unexpected hospital admissions&#xD;
           will require immediate notification to a Data Safety Monitor independent of the&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory studies&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Safety tests: At entry, on achieving maintenance and then only if clinically&#xD;
                indicated. Full Blood Examination (FBE), C-reactive Protein (CRP), Urea and&#xD;
                Electrolyte (U&amp;E), Liver Function Test (LFT), Mast Cell Tryptase (MCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Markers of venom delta-inulin immunogenicity and desensitisation: Sera for&#xD;
                determination of specific IgE and IgG4 to JJA venom using ImmunoCAP assay will be&#xD;
                taken at baseline, at attendance after reaching maintenance VIT, at attendance&#xD;
                after 4th injection of maintenance dose; then at 12 months. Venom skin testing&#xD;
                (VST) will be performed at the same timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. JJA in-hospital sting challenges - will be performed after 12 months tolerating the&#xD;
           1-month maintenance interval, and one month after the last dose.&#xD;
