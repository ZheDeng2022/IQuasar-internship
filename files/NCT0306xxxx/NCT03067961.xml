  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever results from infection with a bacterium called Salmonella Typhi and is a major&#xD;
      cause of illness worldwide. It is estimated to infect 20-25 million people every year and can&#xD;
      affect people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. The disease is&#xD;
      spread through contaminated food and water, and efforts to improve water quality, sanitation&#xD;
      and hygiene will likely go a long way to reducing the global burden of disease.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, improving access to clean water and sanitation improvements is very costly and&#xD;
      difficult to implement on a large scale. Vaccination against typhoid fever is likely to be a&#xD;
      cost-effective way of reducing the global disease burden. There are two vaccines currently&#xD;
      available against typhoid fever. Whilst these vaccines provide some protection against&#xD;
      disease (in the region of 50-70%) these vaccines are less effective in young children, who&#xD;
      are the population group at highest risk of disease. In order to develop a new generation of&#xD;
      typhoid vaccines it is important to have a more complete understanding of how the bacterium&#xD;
      causes disease. In this study, the investigators are aiming to understand more about the&#xD;
      Salmonella Typhi bacteria and how it causes disease. In particular, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      study the importance of a toxin produced by the typhoid bacteria, called the typhoid toxin.&#xD;
      The typhoid toxin has only recently been discovered. It is made only by the typhoid bacteria&#xD;
      and closely related bacteria, such as paratyphoid. From studies done in the laboratory, there&#xD;
      is evidence that the typhoid toxin is important in causing typhoid disease. It is thought&#xD;
      that the typhoid toxin might be important in causing symptoms of typhoid disease, however the&#xD;
      exact role of the typhoid toxin during infection in humans hasn't been studied before.&#xD;
      Studying this might impact on the design new vaccines against typhoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will be undertaking a 'challenge' with two strains of the&#xD;
      typhoid bacteria (Salmonella Typhi). This involves exposing participants to live Salmonella&#xD;
      Typhi under defined circumstances, by asking them to swallow a solution that contains the&#xD;
      bacteria. After the challenge the investigators closely monitor participants for a period of&#xD;
      at least two weeks and the investigators will then treat participants with antibiotics as&#xD;
      soon as they are diagnosed with typhoid disease. The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      comparing the response to challenge between two strains of the typhoid bacteria that differ&#xD;
      in the production of the typhoid toxin. This process has been undertaken by participants in&#xD;
      previous Oxford Vaccine Group studies since 2011.&#xD;
