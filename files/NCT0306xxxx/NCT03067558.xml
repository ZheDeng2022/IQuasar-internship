  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death among children under 5 years of age&#xD;
      globally. Many pneumonia deaths result from late care seeking and inappropriate treatment due&#xD;
      to misdiagnosis of symptoms. The United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF's) Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Infection Diagnostic Aids (ARIDA) project aims to introduce automated respiratory&#xD;
      rate (RR) counting aids for use by frontline health workers in resource limited community&#xD;
      settings and health facilities. These RR counting aids aim to offer improved accuracy,&#xD;
      effectiveness and acceptability compared to current practices for counting and classifying RR&#xD;
      to detect fast breathing pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the controlled accuracy study is to understand whether the ARIDA test&#xD;
      device accurately measures RR in children under 5 years of age with cough and/or difficult&#xD;
      breathing. It is a cross-sectional, prospective study in a controlled setting comprising&#xD;
      three types of device evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The accuracy of the ARIDA test device in measuring RR in young infants 0 to &lt;2months,&#xD;
           children 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months when compared to a video panel reference&#xD;
           standard will be established through the first evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The consistency of the ARIDA test device will be established by determining the level of&#xD;
           agreement between the measures of RR for two ARIDA test devices when used on the same&#xD;
           child at the same time in those aged 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months through the&#xD;
           second evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A third evaluation on a different group of normal-breathing children aged 2 to 59 months&#xD;
           will assess RR fluctuation over time due to ARIDA test device attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations 1 and 2 for accuracy and consistency will also be undertaken with expert&#xD;
      clinicians (EC) conducting a manual RR count to further the evidence base around the&#xD;
      performance of current standard practice in a controlled setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cross-sectional, prospective study and will be conducted in paediatric in and&#xD;
      outpatient departments Saint Paul's Hospital and Millennium Medical Collage in Addis Ababa,&#xD;
      Ethiopia.&#xD;

      General aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand whether the ARIDA test device accurately measures respiratory rate (RR) in&#xD;
      children under 5 years of age with cough and/or difficult breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the performance of the ARIDA test device, as defined by accuracy and consistency&#xD;
      in children under 5 years with cough or difficulty breathing in a controlled setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the performance of expert clinicians (ECs) counting RR, as defined by accuracy&#xD;
      and consistency, in children under 5 years with cough or difficulty breathing in a controlled&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure RR fluctuation over time after ARIDA test device attachment, in normal breathing&#xD;
      children aged 2 to 59 months, in a controlled setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A total 290 respiratory rate assessments will be done. The accuracy evaluation&#xD;
      will aim to enrol 156 children (52 per age group: 0 to &lt;2 months, 2 to &lt;12 months and 12 to&#xD;
      59 months). The consistency evaluation will aim to enrol 104 children (52 per age group: 2 to&#xD;
      &lt;12 months and 12 to 59 months). The accuracy and consistency evaluations will aim to enrol&#xD;
      children in a ratio of 3:1 fast:normal breathers in each age group. The RR fluctuation&#xD;
      evaluation will aim to enrol 30 normal breathing children age 2 to 59 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of evaluation stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training of the research team: 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-testing of procedural activities and debrief: 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening procedure will take place to ascertain study eligibility. Written parent or&#xD;
           guardian informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children will be enrolled prospectively based on eligibility determined by the screening&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each child will participate in at least one of the evaluations: accuracy, consistency,&#xD;
           RR fluctuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps for device evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ECs conducting manual RR counts are blinded to the RR result from the pre-screen RR&#xD;
      evaluation and the ARIDA test device readings during the evaluation. The RR reading during&#xD;
      the pre-screening is recorded by the RA on a data collection form that is not seen by the EC&#xD;
      manual counter(s). The ARIDA test device screen is covered during the assessment and the RR&#xD;
      readings were recorded by the RA and entered on to password protected tablets. VEPs are&#xD;
      blinded to all EC, ARIDA and pre-screen RR readings and the other VEP's RR readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to three attempts are made to obtain an ARIDA test device and EC manual RR reading with&#xD;
      the MK2 ARI timer. The RA attaches the ARIDA test device to the child and ensures the child&#xD;
      is positioned correctly according to device instructions. The child is calmed by the parent&#xD;
      or guardian or by the EC who distracts the child through clicking their fingers or make&#xD;
      hushing sounds. When the child is calm, the videographer starts video recording and the ARIDA&#xD;
      test device and manual EC RR count start simultaneously. The time taken to get an ARIDA test&#xD;
      device reading is also obtained using a stopwatch. The EC RR count lasts for 60 seconds.&#xD;
      After 60 seconds, if the EC has not obtained a RR reading, the EC attempt is recorded as&#xD;
      unsuccessful and repeated for both the EC and ARIDA test device. The ARIDA test device count&#xD;
      lasts up to five minutes. After five minutes, or if the ARIDA test displays an error message,&#xD;
      the ARIDA test attempt is recorded as unsuccessful and repeated for both EC and ARIDA test&#xD;
      device. If the third attempt is still unsuccessful for either device, the evaluation is&#xD;
      recorded as a failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistency evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consistency evaluation follows the same procedure as the accuracy evaluation. To obtain a&#xD;
      measure of consistency between two ARIDA test devices, two test devices are attached to a&#xD;
      single belt, in line with each nipple and measured RR in the same evaluation period. To&#xD;
      obtain a measure of ECs consistency, two ECs conduct a manual RR count with MK2 ARI timers in&#xD;
      the same evaluation period. For an EC or ARIDA test attempt to be successful, both ECs or&#xD;
      ARIDA test devices must have obtained RR readings. The videographer record the entire&#xD;
      evaluation for quality assurance purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate fluctuation evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline EC manual RR count for 60 seconds is obtained on a calm child using the MK2 ARI&#xD;
      timer. The research team are allowed multiple attempts to get a baseline reading. Following&#xD;
      this, the ARIDA test device is attached to the child and the EC does a further three manual&#xD;
      RR counts for 60 seconds in the following time periods: 0-1 minute, 2-3 minutes, 4-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference standard for the accuracy and fluctuation evaluations is a video review by two&#xD;
      to three independent video expert panel (VEP) members whose counting is standardised weekly&#xD;
      to agreement (≤±2 breaths per minute (bpm)). Two VEPs independently review recorded videos of&#xD;
      the child's chest movements and count the number of breaths observed in a full minute, as per&#xD;
      the WHO guidelines for RR counting. Each video is edited with an audible beep and 60-second&#xD;
      timer to ensure the VEP counts the same 60 seconds as the EC. If the panel agreed (≤±2bpm), a&#xD;
      median VEP reading is used. If the panel disagreed (&gt;±2bpm), a third VEP reviews the video&#xD;
      and if two out of these three readings agree, the median RR is used. If all three panel&#xD;
      members disagree the result is sent to a fourth VEP. If two out of four VEP readings agree, a&#xD;
      median VEP reading is used. If the panel disagree, the data from this evaluation is excluded&#xD;
      from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no video reference standard for the consistency evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected using electronic forms uploaded on tablets and backed up to a&#xD;
      protected cloud account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identifiers will not be utilised on data forms; a UIC and associated barcode will be&#xD;
      used to anonymise patient data and track patient data. The UIC to be used for the study will&#xD;
      have three numerical characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECs and RAs will each have a numerical unique identifier, assigned at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the quality assurance procedures, standard clinical protocols, standard operating&#xD;
      procedures (SOPs) and job aids will be prepared. The tablet based data collection forms will&#xD;
      also have pre-programmed checks and restrictions to ensure the quality of the data inputted,&#xD;
      and the data will be reviewed centrally on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular site visits will be conducted by Malaria Consortium study investigators to provide&#xD;
      oversight and quality assure that the protocols, SOPs and job aids are adhered to by the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research reports will be submitted to relevant Ministry of Health (MOH) departments and&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject safety procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARIDA test device has CE medical device approval. RAs and ECs will be trained on how to&#xD;
      use the device safely, according to instructions provided by the manufacturers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not evaluate device efficacy or safety as a study endpoint and treatment will&#xD;
      not be based on the outcomes of the study. It is important to note that the device, as part&#xD;
      of the dossier to the stringent regulatory bodies has conducted their own efficacy studies&#xD;
      and internal approvals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child/young infant will be evaluated in a health facility; a research nurse or clinical&#xD;
      officer, trained in management of children and in Integrated Management of Newborn Childhood&#xD;
      Illnesses (IMNCI), will perform a medical history and physical examination prior to&#xD;
      evaluation to ensure no children with danger signs or 'pink' IMNCI referral signs are&#xD;
      included in the study. Children who are deemed very ill will be excluded. ECs and RAs&#xD;
      performing the evaluations will also be trained in the management of children and in IMNCI.&#xD;
      In case a child has a medical complication before, during or after the evaluation, the&#xD;
      research nurse or clinical officer or other medical professionals will manage this&#xD;
      immediately in the health facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject safety, anticipated risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARIDA test device to be used on the children will not be invasive. The ARIDA test device&#xD;
      will not elicit pain or other noxious stimuli when near or in contact with the child/young&#xD;
      infant's body. It is therefore anticipated it will not cause any bodily harm or injury to the&#xD;
      child and no adverse events (AEs) associated with the device are anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of an AE following an evaluation with the ARIDA test device, the research&#xD;
      nurse/clinical officer will determine whether the AE is attributable to the device. The&#xD;
      project manager and or clinical director will report the AE to the in-country research ethics&#xD;
      committee and the study principal investigator as per applicable guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject safety, adverse event recording and reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent or guardians of the children will be requested to report any suspected AE&#xD;
      occurring during and/or immediately after the evaluation using the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECs/RAs while evaluating the child/young infant will be requested to alert the research&#xD;
      team and clinical director and/or another medical professional of any untoward occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any observed and/or reported AE (serious or non-serious), or suspected causal relationship to&#xD;
      the investigational device, will be recorded on a severe AE form For all AEs, sufficient&#xD;
      information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit: 1) an adequate determination of&#xD;
      the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should be classified as a serious AE);&#xD;
      and 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the AE and the investigational&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs felt to be associated with the investigational device will be followed until the effect&#xD;
      (or its sequelae) resolves or stabilises at a level acceptable to the local project manager&#xD;
      in discussion with the clinical director.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will promptly review documented AEs. If the research team's final&#xD;
      determination of causality is &quot;unknown and of questionable relationship to the&#xD;
      investigational device(s)&quot;, the AE will be classified as &quot;associated with the use of the&#xD;
      investigational device&quot; for reporting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the research team's final determination of causality is &quot;unknown but not related to the&#xD;
      investigational device(s)&quot;, this determination and the rationale for the determination will&#xD;
      be documented in the respective subject's case history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the completed form will be provided to the research team in country and to the&#xD;
      study principal investigator. The completed AE form will be submitted to the regulatory&#xD;
      authorities as per the country-specific reporting requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed form, the research team will submit&#xD;
      additional information concerning the reported AE as requested by the regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an investigational device elicits pain or other noxious stimuli when near or in contact&#xD;
      with the child/young infant's body, or leads to any other untoward medical occurrence, the&#xD;
      use of the device on the child/young infant will be stopped immediately, the child/young&#xD;
      infant will be withdrawn from the study and steps will be taken to assess and record the AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child/young infant will be managed by the EC or other medical professionals, and if the&#xD;
      AE(s) is felt to be associated with the investigational device(s), the child/young infant&#xD;
      will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) resolves or stabilises at a level&#xD;
      acceptable to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child/young infant will also be withdrawn from the study if the parent or guardian&#xD;
      withdraws consent at any point in the study or if the study is discontinued for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: This clinical protocol as part of the ARIDA project has been approved by&#xD;
      the Ethiopian IRB at national level. The ARIDA test device will be registered with the Food,&#xD;
      Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority of Ethiopia.&#xD;
