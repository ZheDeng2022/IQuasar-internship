  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted and&#xD;
      multi-level prompting intervention in a real world urban primary care office setting on&#xD;
      improving provider-delivered guideline-based asthma care and reducing asthma morbidity among&#xD;
      urban children with persistent or uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial comparing the intervention to enhanced&#xD;
      usual care (eUC) in 20 Bronx practices serving over 5,000 children ages 2-12 years with&#xD;
      persistent or uncontrolled asthma. Eleven eUC practices will receive guideline information&#xD;
      and assess children's asthma severity and control, but active intervention components will&#xD;
      not be provided. Practices will join the study in 4 waves over 4 years (4-6 practices per&#xD;
      year). Provider adoption of guidelines and utilization of care in all patients (~5,000) ages&#xD;
      2-12 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from intervention and eUC practices will be&#xD;
      evaluated using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data and practice-based screening for asthma&#xD;
      severity and control. Investigators will also enroll a random subset of 512 caregivers of&#xD;
      children with persistent/uncontrolled asthma from both study arms to systematically evaluate&#xD;
      caregiver-reported child morbidity outcomes and obtain measures not available in EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention consists of academic detailing in the EHR that follow national asthma guidelines&#xD;
      and outreach worker care coordination for patients with persistent or uncontrolled asthma.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criteria listed below will apply to ~5,000 children from eMPI and eUC practices:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physician-diagnosed asthma (based on EHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent or uncontrolled asthma as per clinic assessment. Based on NHLBI guidelines,&#xD;
             any one of the following: in past month, &gt; 2 days/week with asthma symptoms, &gt;2&#xD;
             days/week with rescue medication use, &gt;2 days/month with nighttime symptoms, or &gt; 2&#xD;
             episodes in the past year that required systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 2 and 12 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria will apply to a subset of 512 of children whose caregivers&#xD;
        will be interviewed to obtain caregiver-reported morbidity outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caregiver is able to speak and understand either English or Spanish. Participants&#xD;
             unable to read will be eligible as all surveys will be administered verbally by&#xD;
             research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent from the primary caregiver, caregiver permission for the child to participate&#xD;
             as well as assent from the child (&gt;7 years). If there are eligible siblings, only one&#xD;
             child will be randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has other significant medical conditions, such as congenital heart disease,&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis, or other chronic lung disease, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             assessment of asthma-related measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria will apply to a subset of 512 children/caregivers as&#xD;
        described above:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No access to a telephone to conduct follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from a&#xD;
             guardian.&#xD;
