    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, two armed trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Fenfuro&#xD;
      capsule twice daily for 90 days in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes that will be conducted&#xD;
      in single center in India. The primary outcome measures will be the determination of decrease&#xD;
      in plasma glucose levels from baseline to last visit. The secondary outcome will be the&#xD;
      determination of safety of Fenfuro capsule in type 2 diabetic subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus, involving rise in blood sugar levels, has shown to be a highly prevalent&#xD;
      disease. Treatments and treatment regimens include combinations of oral anti-diabetic drugs&#xD;
      (OADs), anti-hypertensive medications and anti-dyslipidemic agents, but these have been less&#xD;
      than successful in managing their respective disease targets with clinical goals. Now-a-days,&#xD;
      the treatment strategies for diabetes mellitus type 2 which are opted by general population&#xD;
      include natural supplements. This choice is based upon the involvement of very less side&#xD;
      effects along with high effectiveness of the natural supplements as compared to the synthetic&#xD;
      medications. One of those natural supplements is fenugreek seeds extract i.e. Fenfuro which&#xD;
      has been used as a nutraceutical in the present study for the management of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenugreek has been extensively used as a source of anti-diabetic compounds from long time.&#xD;
      Thus, Fenfuro, prepared from fenugreek seeds extract, is supposed to have anti-diabetic&#xD;
      properties as well. Previous studies on fenugreek seeds extract have shown effective and safe&#xD;
      anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties of it. It has shown to decrease blood&#xD;
      glucose levels as well as lipid profile of the diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study, Fenugreek seed extract will be used as an add-on to the existing&#xD;
      therapy in patients with type-2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of the extract will be&#xD;
      evaluated using standard methodology.&#xD;
