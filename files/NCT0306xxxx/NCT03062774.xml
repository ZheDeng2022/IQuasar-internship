    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple dose study, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies will&#xD;
      be performed at the same time with tolerability study. Three dose arms are designed, 12&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in each arm, will equal number of males and females.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies were performed in parallel with PB-119&#xD;
      25μg、50μg、and 100μg dose escalation tolerability study, plasma samples were collected to&#xD;
      determine drug concentration and pharmacodynamics parameters. The study duration of each arm&#xD;
      was 8 weeks, study medication was given about 8:00 a.m. on day 1 of each week, totally 6&#xD;
      times, and subject was followed until 15 days after last dose (50 days of study) and then&#xD;
      study can be completed.&#xD;
