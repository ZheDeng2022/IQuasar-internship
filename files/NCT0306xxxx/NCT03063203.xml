      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TP53 mutant AML. The presence of a TP53 mutation should be determined by Genoptix (or&#xD;
             institutional preferred equivalent assay). Detection of a TP53 mutation at the time of&#xD;
             initial diagnosis is sufficient for enrollment at the time of relapsed/refractory&#xD;
             disease. Detection of a TP53 mutation in either the peripheral blood or bone marrow is&#xD;
             adequate for enrollment. Alternatively, patients who have not had TP53 mutation&#xD;
             analysis performed, but who have &gt; 20% TP53 positive cells by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
             detected on a bone marrow aspirate may also be enrolled,29 provided that mutation&#xD;
             analysis is requested at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed/refractory AML following 7+3 (or similar cytarabine containing induction&#xD;
             chemotherapy for AML) disease detected by one of the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  bone marrow blasts &gt; 5%, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologics flow cytometry assay (threshold &gt; 0.5%) (alternative equivalent&#xD;
                  assay may be substituted), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persistent cytogenetic abnormality (e.g. del5, del17p, etc), by FISH or&#xD;
                  conventional karotyping, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persistent TP53 mutation (at least 5 variant reads with at least 50x coverage)&#xD;
                  determined by Genoptix (or institutional preferred equivalent assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; 10% blasts on a day +14 bone marrow biopsy following 7+3 may either be&#xD;
             enrolled or may be treated with a course of standard re-induction (e.g. 5+2 or&#xD;
             similar) and then re-evaluated for response. Eligible patients will meet any of the&#xD;
             above criteria on a subsequent biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow and organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Peripheral white blood cell count &lt; 50,000/mcl (patients may receive hydroxyurea&#xD;

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status ≤ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy administration in the 7 days preceding enrollment with the exception of&#xD;
             hydroxyurea, which can be continued until Cycle 2. A washout period for oral tyrosine&#xD;
             kinase inhibitors (e.g. Jakafi, etc) is not required, although tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors therapy must be discontinued prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancies (other than AML) requiring active therapy or diagnosed within the last&#xD;
             year, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer which can be treated or in situ&#xD;
             malignancies (such as cervical, breast, prostate, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
