    <textblock>
      Objectives: Intravenous (IV) fluid administration is a fundamental component of diabetic&#xD;
      ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment. Normal saline (NS), the most common IV fluid used in DKA&#xD;
      management, contains more chloride than human blood. Excessive amounts of chloride have been&#xD;
      shown to cause a detrimental metabolic acidosis. Other IV fluids have more physiologic&#xD;
      chloride levels, such as lactated ringers (LR). This study will compare the rates of&#xD;
      hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in children treated with NS to those treated with LR to&#xD;
      determine the effect on overall length of acidosis and length of stay in the hospital or&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single-center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Children aged 0 to 18 years who present with diabetic ketoacidosis and require&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit admission. Patients with evidence of shock, multi-organ failure&#xD;
      or clinically significant cerebral edema will be excluded. The projected study population&#xD;
      will be 104 patients, 52 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Patients will be enrolled within 1 hour of presentation to the emergency room&#xD;
      or pediatric intensive care unit if transferred directly from another facility. They will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive intravenous fluids containing 0.9% saline or lactated ringers. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated using the institutional DKA protocol with the content of the&#xD;
      intravenous fluids being the only difference in treatment between arms. Study intervention&#xD;
      lasts until the end of the acute management of DKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned measurements and study outcomes: The primary study outcome will be duration of&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis. Resolution of metabolic acidosis will be defined in three ways: 1.&#xD;
      Normalization of the ketosis; 2. Normalization of the serum pH; 3. Normalization of the serum&#xD;
      bicarbonate level. Secondary outcomes will include length of stay in the pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit and length of stay in the hospital. All outcomes will be correlated with the&#xD;
      overall chloride load given via intravenous fluids during DKA management. Regression&#xD;
      modelling will control for any baseline differences between the groups in regards to severity&#xD;
      of DKA, and if newly diagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been limited prospective clinical studies in pediatrics patients examining the&#xD;
      association of the chloride content of intravenous fluids and outcome in DKA. This&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled trial is being performed to compare the duration of&#xD;
      acidosis and hospital length of stay in children with DKA who are admitted to a pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit and are treated with intravenous fluids containing NS or LR. The primary&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that use of LR will be associated with decreased duration of&#xD;
      hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and, therefore, shorter hospitalization than use of NS in&#xD;
      the treatment of pediatric DKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) who are treated with&#xD;
      intravenous fluids containing lactated ringers (LR) will have a shorter duration of&#xD;
      hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis after hospital admission than those treated with&#xD;
      intravenous fluids containing normal saline (NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: The duration of acidosis after hospital admission in children with DKA&#xD;
      will be associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome will be duration of metabolic acidosis. Resolution of metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis will be defined in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum ketone level &lt;1mmol/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Venous pH &gt; 7.3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum bicarbonate level &gt; 18mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes will include length of stay in the pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit (PICU) and length of stay in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single center, double blinded, randomized controlled trial with two&#xD;
      treatment arms performed at a tertiary care children's hospital. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      within an hour of presentation to the hospital to receive DKA management using intravenous&#xD;
      fluids containing primarily normal saline or lactated ringers. All other aspects of DKA&#xD;
      management will be the same in each arm, per the institution protocol. Since both treatment&#xD;
      arms involve using intravenous fluids which are considered standard of care in treating&#xD;
      dehydration, a waiver of consent will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment methods Patients will be eligible for enrollment and randomization if they are&#xD;
      admitted to the pediatric emergency room or pediatric intensive care unit from an outside&#xD;
      hospital or facility with DKA and they meet inclusion criteria. Patients will be screened by&#xD;
      emergency room personnel for eligibility and if PICU admission is determined, patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled. If transferred directly to the pediatric intensive care unit, pediatric critical&#xD;
      care fellow and attending physicians will be responsible for screening and enrollment 24&#xD;
      hours a day. Enrollment and randomization will occur within 1 hour of hospital presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will consist of assigning a randomization number at point of entry to the hospital&#xD;
      (Emergency Room or Pediatric Intensive Care Unit) and placing the study DKA order set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization methods Upon enrollment, patients will be assigned a randomization number in&#xD;
      sequential order from a previously generated randomization table provided by a statistician&#xD;
      and available in the ER and PICU to study personnel. Each number will correlate with a&#xD;
      treatment arm visible on a randomization table with coordinated treatment arm assignment&#xD;
      available only to pharmacy personnel. Pharmacy personnel will then provide the appropriate&#xD;
      content to the intravenous fluids with a generic label &quot;DKA study fluids with dextrose&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;DKA study fluids without dextrose.&quot; As the fluids look identical, they would only differ&#xD;
      visually in labelling, so standardized labelling as described here will allow all treating&#xD;
      physicians to be blinded to treatment arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention All enrolled patients will be treated using the institutional DKA&#xD;
      management protocol which is in place in the emergency room and the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit and was developed in collaboration with the endocrinology division. The only difference&#xD;
      in the study protocol from the institutional DKA protocol is the intravenous fluid content.&#xD;
      Please refer to study protocol schematic shown in supplement 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission to the ER or PICU, all eligible patients will be placed on cardiac monitors,&#xD;
      admission DKA laboratory tests will be ordered and an initial intravenous fluid bolus of 10&#xD;
      ml/kg normal saline will be administered as is standard of care. These aspects of DKA&#xD;
      management will likely be performed before study enrollment, but if not, will be identical&#xD;
      for both arms so treatment arm assignment will not be affected. Subjects will be started on a&#xD;
      continuous insulin infusion drip at 0.1 U/kg/hr and study intravenous fluids without dextrose&#xD;
      at 1.5 times maintenance. Per standard of care, point of care whole blood glucose levels will&#xD;
      be followed hourly, serum blood gases and electrolytes every 2 hours, beta-hydroxybutyrate&#xD;
      levels every 6 hours and urine ketones every void. ER subjects will be transferred to the&#xD;
      PICU to continue exactly the same management and laboratory schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be used until acute management for DKA using the continuous insulin&#xD;
      infusion is stopped. Our current practice is to convert from continuous insulin to&#xD;
      intermittent subcutaneous insulin administration when the venous pH is equal to or greater&#xD;
      than 7.30 and the serum bicarbonate level is equal to or greater than 15 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid Management DKA fluid management is based on a two-bag system to maintain glucose levels&#xD;
      between 100 and 300 mg/dL as the ketosis is corrected. The first type of intravenous fluid&#xD;
      used has no dextrose in it to avoid worsening the initial hyperglycemia. Once the serum&#xD;
      glucose falls below 300 mg/dL, 10% dextrose-containing fluids will be started. All&#xD;
      intravenous fluids will contain 20millieqilivants per liter (mEq/L) of potassium acetate and&#xD;
      20mEq/L potassium phosphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study fluid management will follow the same guidelines for rate of fluid delivery and amount&#xD;
      of dextrose used in the standard management of patients in DKA. Bedside healthcare personnel&#xD;
      will treat all study subjects identically regardless of treatment arm. To provide blinding to&#xD;
      all bedside staff, intravenous fluid bags will be labelled as &quot;DKA study fluid with dextrose&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;DKA study fluid without dextrose.&quot; All intravenous fluids used will have an electrolyte&#xD;
      composition of 20mEq/L of potassium acetate and 20mEq/L of potassium phosphate.&#xD;
