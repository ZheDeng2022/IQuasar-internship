      The aim of the study is to investigate the capacity of post-stroke individual (study group)&#xD;
      to modulate their EMG muscle activation pattern (MAP) compared to healthy individuals&#xD;
      (control group), and to correlate these capacities with their motor impairments. Twenty&#xD;
      post-stroke individuals and 12 healthy individuals will participate in this study. each&#xD;
      participant will carry out hand-reaching movements in multiple directions, monitored by an&#xD;
      EMG device. The modulation of the EMG signal will be compared between groups in terms of&#xD;
      EMG-MAP and in terms of muscle-synergies. Additionally the MAPs and synergies of the study&#xD;
      group will be correlated with their Fugl-Meyer (FM) assessment scores. Analysis of the muscle&#xD;
      synergies underlying the EMG signal will be carried out by the Non-negative Matrix&#xD;
      Factorization (NMF) algorithm.&#xD;

      Introduction: Upper extremity function after a stroke is impaired and characterized by&#xD;
      abnormal, stereotypical and uncoordinated movement pattern. Decreased neural drive in the&#xD;
      damaged corticospinal system causing a decreased agonists motor units firing, spasticity,&#xD;
      impaired motor coordination. A more comprehensive understanding of the way our brain controls&#xD;
      and regulates limb-movements, through the spinal cord, may enhance more advanced&#xD;
      rehabilitation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current concept in motor control suggest that the brain-cortex modulates and synchronizes the&#xD;
      activation of discrete number of functional units within the brainstem and spinal cord. These&#xD;
      neural functional units i.e. muscle synergies, when linearly combined facilitate the&#xD;
      production of diverse limb-movements. This control mechanism may in a large extent explain&#xD;
      the way the CNS reduces the dimensionality of the vast number of degrees of freedom embedded&#xD;
      in the CNS to a discrete number of muscle synergies. Therefore, execution of a movement may&#xD;
      only requires to linearly combine these synergies and regulates its intensity of activation&#xD;
      along the time domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existence of such a control mechanism attracted the attention of both clinicians and&#xD;
      scientists to use its properties to enhance motor recovery after a stroke. Therefore, studies&#xD;
      emerged to investigate how cortical damage impact the synchronization of synergies, and also&#xD;
      whether it changes the internal structure of the synergies. Despite numerous studies in this&#xD;
      domain, there is lack of consensus regarding how stroke impact this control mechanism, and&#xD;
      extent of correlation between the level of impairment and the synergy structure. The study&#xD;
      objectives are to compare the synergy structure and the MAP in hand-reaching movements in&#xD;
      multiple directions between post-stroke individuals and healthy individual, and to correlate&#xD;
      between these properties and the motor impairments in post-stroke individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Twelve healthy volunteers (control group) and 20 post-stroke individuals (study&#xD;
      group) will participate in the study. Inclusion criteria for the study group will be&#xD;
      individuals, above the age of 20, who sustained unilateral cerebral stroke, with hemiparesis.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for the trial are sensory aphasia, unilateral neglect and presence of&#xD;
      other neurological disease such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: The Hand-reaching Spatial Device (HRSD) is an adjustable, simple tool allowing&#xD;
      standardization of hand pointing movement for 9 different directions between different&#xD;
      participants. It is composed of two vertical rods to which are attached three semi-circular&#xD;
      shelves. Each shelf contains three movable pointing pins that can be adjusted left and&#xD;
      rightward to accommodate the variable arm length of each participant. The lowest shelf was&#xD;
      located 10 cm above the table, the middle was located 35 cm above the table and highest 55 cm&#xD;
      above the table. For each participant the HRSD was located at the maximum hand reach distance&#xD;
      in front of the tested shoulder. The side pins were located at a 45-degree angle to the&#xD;
      shoulder joint to both sides. The arrangement of the targets on the HRSD was designed to&#xD;
      cover the majority of hand-reaching movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface EMGs were recorded (Trigno 8, Delsys, Boston, MA) from 8 muscles of the shoulder&#xD;
      girdle and arm: trapezius (TRS); deltoid anterior (AD), medial (MD), and posterior fibers&#xD;
      (PD); and pectoralis major (PECT); infraspinatus (IS); biceps (BI); triceps (TRI). Electrodes&#xD;
      were placed in accordance with the guidelines of the Surface Electromyography for the&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles-European Community Project (SENIAM) [34]. Maximum&#xD;
      voluntary contractions (MVCs) were performed prior to data collection to verify correct&#xD;
      electrode placement and for normalization. One-minute rest periods followed each MVC to limit&#xD;
      the possibility of fatigue. EMG signals were band-pass filtered (20-450 Hz), and sampled at&#xD;
      2000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: The MVC was measured by standard muscle testing [35]. Then the participant sat in&#xD;
      front of a table with his forearm resting in a comfortable position. The HRSD was located as&#xD;
      mentioned above. Participants were requested to point to each target 5 times according to&#xD;
      voice prompting that was activated by the EMG software every 10 seconds, for 45 pointing&#xD;
      movements. The order of pointing targets was constant for all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis EMG preprocessing Data analysis was performed using Matlab (The MathWorks,&#xD;
      Inc.). EMGs were demeaned, follow by RMS calculation using overlapping window of 50 samples&#xD;
      (25 millisecond around each timepoint). Mean baseline EMGs for each trial were subtracted&#xD;
      from the averaged data for the sequence of reaching movements. Hence, the EMG data for each&#xD;
      trial, a vector whose dimension was 8 (the number of muscles recorded), corresponded to&#xD;
      active force generation beyond any residual baseline muscle activity. The EMG data was&#xD;
      normalized in accordance to the Maximal Isometric Contraction (MVC) for each muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NMF algorithm originally used by Lee and Seung (1999 and 2001), was applied to identify&#xD;
      muscle synergies and their activation weights. An EMG pattern recorded in hand-reaching&#xD;
      movements was modeled as a linear combination of a set of N muscle synergies, each of which&#xD;
      specified the relative level of activation across 8 muscles, and activated by a time-varying&#xD;
      activation coefficient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V^(M×T)≈W^(M×N)∙H^(N×T) (4) Where V is the EMG data set matrix with M as the number of&#xD;
      muscles (8 muscles), T as the number of time samples, W is the synergy matrix and H is the&#xD;
      coefficient matrix. W is m×n is a matrix with n synergies, m is the number of muscles, and H&#xD;
      is the n×t matrix of synergy activation coefficients. Thus, each column of W represents the&#xD;
      weights of each muscle for a single synergy, and each row of H represents how much the&#xD;
      corresponding synergy was activated or used to generate force. In this model, it is possible&#xD;
      for each muscle to belong to more than one synergy and thus the EMG of any single muscle&#xD;
      might be attributed to simultaneous or sequential activations of several muscle synergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the optimal number of synergies for the whole group, the EMG data of&#xD;
      all the targets were concatenated for each participant. Then the EMG's of the whole sample&#xD;
      were concatenated before applying the NMF. The optimal number of synergies (d) was defined as&#xD;
      the number of synergies that captured the highest of the total variance of the data,&#xD;
      suggesting that additional synergies only captured small residual amounts of variation&#xD;
      attributable to noise. This procedure allowed us to estimate the optimal number of synergies&#xD;
      for the whole sample to execute any reaching movement in space regardless of the direction of&#xD;
      the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NMF algorithm required the number of synergies extracted to be specified before the&#xD;
      application of the algorithm. Therefore, for each data set, the VAF was calculated while&#xD;
      changing the number of synergies from 1 to 7. The VAF was calculated using the equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAF(H)=100%×(1-(|(|V-WH|)|_2^2)/(|(|V|)|_2^2 )) (6) Where V is the original matrix, and W and&#xD;
      H are the derived, factorized matrices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalization of movement directions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim at this stage of analysis was to establish whether a set of discrete number of&#xD;
      synergies exist that control any reaching movement in space. Therefore, it was investigated&#xD;
      how movement in certain directions could account for movements in other directions. The EMG&#xD;
      data for each movement direction was pooled separately across the 8 muscles and concatenated&#xD;
      it for the whole sample. In that way the derived set of synergies would have to account for&#xD;
      the variance between different subjects, but would also be specific for that direction alone.&#xD;
      The NMF was applied separately for each movement direction according to the equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V_i≈W_i∙H_i (7) where i is the target number, which corresponded to specific movement&#xD;
      direction in space. In this stage of analysis V_i (the EMG matrix) was given as an input for&#xD;
      each target, i∈[1,9], and matrices W_i,H_i were updated iteratively. The study procedure&#xD;
      included reaching for 9 different target directions in space, allowing us to further&#xD;
      investigate if there was a single set of synergies that could account for movements in other&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was done by using a cross-validation technique between the V_i matrices and the W_j&#xD;
      matrices by applying a modified version of the NMF algorithm, followed by corresponding VAF&#xD;
      calculation changing the number of synergies (d) from only 3 to 5, and not from 1 to 7 based&#xD;
      on the results of the NMF for all the participants and for all targets, as detailed in the&#xD;
      results section. In the modified version of the algorithm, both V_i and W_j (the synergies&#xD;
      matrix) were given as an input. Only the H_(i,j) coefficients matrix of target i, was updated&#xD;
      and outputted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross validation process of the modified NMF was carried out for each combination of a&#xD;
      data matrix V_i (of target i) and a synergy matrix W_j (of target j), resulting in 9×9&#xD;
      matrices H_ji. For every i,j∈[1,9], we factorize V_i such that W_j H_ji≈V_i.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference set of muscle synergies was chosen by calculating the VAF for each of the 9×9&#xD;
      factorizations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAF(H_ij )=100%×(1-(|(|V_i-W_j H_ij |)|_2^2)/(|(|V_i |)|_2^2 )) (8) assuming that consistent&#xD;
      high values of VAF(H_ij) for a specific V_i may indicate that the synergies obtained from&#xD;
      movements in this direction may accurately explain movement in other directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, for each predefined number of synergies (d) a 9×9 matrix was received in which each&#xD;
      cell represented the accountability of a given synergy (row) to a specified direction&#xD;
      (column). Each row in the resulting matrix represented the overall &quot;performance&quot; of the&#xD;
      appropriate set of synergies, and so the row with the highest average VAF was chosen for the&#xD;
      next stage of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direction modulation of muscle synergies Once the set of synergies (W_j ) was chosen, setting&#xD;
      the activation coefficients for every target (H_ij,when i∈[9,1]), it was determined which&#xD;
      synergies are dominant for each of the directions. For each number of synergies, the mean&#xD;
      activation coefficient of every synergy for every direction was calculated. Setting the&#xD;
      number of synergies to 4, for example, resulted in 9 vectors (one for each movement&#xD;
      direction) of 4 values, representing the 4 synergies. Then, the average amplitude of each of&#xD;
      the synergies across the direction of movement, and between movements in different directions&#xD;
      across synergies, were measured.&#xD;
