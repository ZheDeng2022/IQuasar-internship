    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of EA in pediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      minor ENT surgery under Sevoflurane and compare opioid-only based intra-operative analgesia&#xD;
      to multi-modal analgesia consisting of opioid and IV acetaminophen or PO acetaminophen&#xD;
      regimen using a validated and standardized EA measurement tool, the Pediatric Anesthesia&#xD;
      Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. The post operative pain scores will be measured in all&#xD;
      patients by post-op recovery staff using FLACC Score/Wong-Baker FACES (patients 24 months up&#xD;
      to 7 years of age) or Numeric Pain Score for patients 7 years of age. The pre-operative,&#xD;
      surgery, anesthesia and post-operative staff will be all blinded.&#xD;

      Place of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando, Florida (Primary Site) Wolfson Children's Hospital,&#xD;
      Jacksonville, Florida (Nemours Jacksonville Satellite Site)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Randomized Study Total Number of Patients: 150&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials: 150 patients will be randomly divided into three groups of 50&#xD;
      patients. Each group will receive sevoflurane induction and maintenance of anesthesia.&#xD;
      Sevoflurane, currently the most commonly used agent for inhalational induction, will be used&#xD;
      for induction of anesthesia, as it is less irritating to the tracheobronchial tree than other&#xD;
      volatile anesthetic agents and is considered the standard for pediatric induction anesthesia.&#xD;
      These three groups, (study arms), are identified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: multi-modal analgesia of IV fentanyl plus IV acetaminophen and oral placebo Group B:&#xD;
      multi-modal analgesia of IV fentanyl plus PO acetaminophen and IV placebo Group C: single&#xD;
      modal analgesia of IV fentanyl plus oral placebo and IV placebo Pre-operative procedures: The&#xD;
      Research Pharmacy will have the following standards for randomization: prior to patient&#xD;
      surgery date; the pharmacy will assemble study kits to contain the appropriate drug products&#xD;
      based on the 3 randomization scenarios: A. IV Tylenol and Oral Placebo, B. IV Placebo and&#xD;
      Oral Tylenol, or C. IV Placebo and Oral Placebo. The kits will be kept in the pharmacy and&#xD;
      identified in a blinded fashion from other study team members. On the day of surgery,&#xD;
      (patient dosing day), blinded study team member will provide the signed study consent to&#xD;
      pharmacist, along with the patient's weight to be used in calculating dosages of study drug.&#xD;
      The pharmacist will then assign the patient to 1 of 3 study arms, in a random approach.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by using a method based on the biased coin method using a&#xD;
      dynamic urn technique. Once the study arm has been determined, the corresponding kit will be&#xD;
      used to prepare the study drugs by patient weight. The blinded, randomized study kit&#xD;
      information will be kept in a locked Excel spreadsheet, with password access, only available&#xD;
      to pharmacy team members. All study drugs will be checked and verified by a licensed&#xD;
      pharmacist prior to dispensing to a blinded study team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the study patients will receive premedication for sedation. Premedication is not a&#xD;
      standard treatment at Nemours Children's Hospital (NCH) as NCH allows parental presence&#xD;
      during induction of anesthesia to facilitate the transport of the patient to the operating&#xD;
      room and decrease separation anxiety. Wolfson Children's Hospital will allow parental&#xD;
      presence for study patients. Parental presence is an appropriate substitute for sedation&#xD;
      premedication. In the pre-operative area, all patients will receive a de-identified PO syrup.&#xD;
      The syrup will be prepared by the pharmacy and will contain acetaminophen (15 mg/kg&#xD;
      -160mg/5mL Manufacturer: Major Pharmaceuticals), for the PO acetaminophen group and placebo&#xD;
      flavored syrup (Manufacturer: Humco, Ingredients: Sucrose 82.3%, Purified Water, Artificial&#xD;
      Flavors, 0.1% Sodium Benzoate as a preservative, Critic Acid, FDC Red #40, and inert&#xD;
      ingredients), for the other two groups. This approach will maintain blindness of the&#xD;
      peri-operative staff, and patients/parents/guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Procedures and Administration of intra-op analgesia: Before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia the pre-induction vital signs will be reviewed and ASA standard monitors will be&#xD;
      applied. Standard ASA monitors include blood pressure, ECG, pulse oxymetry, etCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement, respiratory rate and temperature. Induction of anesthesia will be accomplished&#xD;
      via inhalation of sevoflurane (8 vol%) in nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%) at a fresh gas&#xD;
      flow of 10 Lpm. An IV will be established and propofol 2mg/Kg will be administered to&#xD;
      facilitate endotracheal intubation. After intubation, all children will receive fentanyl&#xD;
      (West- Ward Pharmaceuticals) 2 mcg/kg. IV Fentanyl is considered standard of care for&#xD;
      analgesia regimen for these types of surgery. Intra-op anesthesia team will be blinded to the&#xD;
      use of non- opioid IV analgesia and will administer a pharmacy prepared de-identified&#xD;
      infusion (pharmacy will blind the IV formulation of acetaminophen and all pharmacy&#xD;
      formulations will follow regulation 797 compounding standards), following intubation that&#xD;
      will consist of 0.9% normal saline (Baxter Pharmaceuticals), placebo for control groups and&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen (15 mg/kg, - 1000mg/100 cc Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) for the IV&#xD;
      acetaminophen group. The maximum single dose will be 750 mg with a 24-hour maximum dose not&#xD;
      to exceed 3,750 mg in this 24-hour period. The product will infuse for 15 minutes as&#xD;
      recommended by the manufacturer. For maintenance of anesthesia, children will receive&#xD;
      sevoflurane (maximum of 2.0±0.2 MAC, age adjusted) with a constant fresh gas flow of 2 L/min&#xD;
      (maximum FIO2 of 30% air mixed with oxygen), using a semi-closed circle breathing system.&#xD;
      Ventilation will be controlled to maintain normocapnia (ET-CO2 32-38 mmHg). Additional doses&#xD;
      of fentanyl can be administered, per anesthesiologist's discretion, in all groups by&#xD;
      increments of 0.5 mcg/Kg IV per dose for hemodynamic response to surgical stimulation greater&#xD;
      than 20% above baseline. Removal of the mouth gag for tonsillectomy/tonsillectomy and&#xD;
      adenoidectomy/adenoidectomy will be defined as the end of surgery. At this point, inhalation&#xD;
      anesthetic will be discontinued. Fresh gas flow will be increased to 8 Lpm, 100% oxygen.&#xD;
      Tracheal extubation will be performed when normal ventilation is achieved and cough or gag&#xD;
      reflex is regained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Consent Process: Potential participants will be identified and receive basic&#xD;
      information about the study and enrollment criteria at ENT clinic by participating ENT&#xD;
      surgeons. A copy of an unsigned consent will be given to the families who are interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study. Anesthesiologists, will obtain PP consent and Assent for eligible&#xD;
      children. A signed and dated copy of all consents forms will be given to the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Standardization and Procedures: The surgical technique will be standardized&#xD;
      and a limited group of two surgeons per clinical site that share same surgical technique&#xD;
      which will be agreed upon at the start of the clinical phase. This technique will consist of&#xD;
      only Teflon blade cautery and will require no peri-tonsilar local anesthetic injection. The&#xD;
      number of anesthesia providers involved in the study will be limited to two anesthesiologists&#xD;
      per clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative pain management approach will be restricted to fentanyl (0.5 mcg/Kg&#xD;
      IV/dose titrated to effect) for moderate to severe pain. Ibuprofen (10mg/Kg) PO will be&#xD;
      ordered for mild to moderate post- op pain. Post-op recovery staff will be limited to a&#xD;
      maximum of three trained PACU nurses per site and will use FLACC Scale for age 24 month to 4&#xD;
      years of age and sedated patients at time of assessment, Wong-Baker FACES for patients 4 to 7&#xD;
      years of age and non-verbal patients and Numeric Pain Score for patients equal/greater than 7&#xD;
      years of age to assess level of pain. Episodes of clinical emergence agitation/delirium (EA),&#xD;
      will receive rescue treatment. This treatment will consist of 0.5 - 1.0 mcg/Kg IV&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, height, weight, procedure, duration of surgery, intra-op agents used, exposure&#xD;
      and time of discontinuation of anesthesia to extubation will be documented for each patient.&#xD;
      A blinded PACU nurse will monitor the patient. The Post-anesthesia unit monitoring standards&#xD;
      consist of ECG, Blood Pressure, pulse-oxymetry and respiratory rate every 5 minutes times 3&#xD;
      and every 15 minutes thereafter until discharge. Temperature will be obtained upon arrival to&#xD;
      unit and every hour or as needed. All patients will be evaluated for the Aldrete Score which&#xD;
      assesses readiness for discharge from post-anesthesia care unit. The PACU nurse will record&#xD;
      degree of agitation using the PAED scale and measure and record the pain scores using either&#xD;
      the FLACC for patients 24 months to 4 years of age and patients who are sedated at time of&#xD;
      assessment, Wonk-Baker FACES for patients 4 to 7 years of age and non-verbal patients and&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Scores for patients equal/greater than 7 years of age upon admission to the PACU&#xD;
      and every 15 minutes for approximately 1 hour after admission, or until discharge from the&#xD;
      PACU, whichever comes first. These nurses will all be experienced in the use of PAED scale.&#xD;
      There will be three; two-hour study training sessions at each clinical site for PACU&#xD;
      participating nurses. PACU nurses assigned to this study will be selecting the Modified&#xD;
      Aldrete scores (respiration, O2saturation, consciousness, circulation, activity) and&#xD;
      documenting adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative team assures that informed consent is obtained prior to performing any&#xD;
      research procedures, that all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is&#xD;
      conducted according to the IRB-approved research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection and Reporting of SAEs and AEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the following standard AE definitions are used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated&#xD;
      with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered&#xD;
      related to the medical treatment or procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event: Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congenital anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs identified will be captured in real time as they become known. AEs that result in visits&#xD;
      to the ED and/or outpatient clinics will be monitored at each site through their readmission-&#xD;
      monitoring program and reported to the department of Anesthesiology by the quality and safety&#xD;
      officer. In addition, all AEs are reported in Orlando according to the Nemours IRB AE&#xD;
      reporting guidelines and in Jacksonville, according to the Baptist Health IRB AE guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of AEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a symptomatic event where a severe adverse event or any SAE is noticed, the&#xD;
      blinding can be broken by accessing a sealed envelope that contains the assigned drugs in the&#xD;
      randomization process and appropriate treatment will be instituted. These patients will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study but the clinical and research team will continue to collect safety&#xD;
      information. This data will be included in the safety database and reported during monthly&#xD;
      meetings. Nemours will assure that the participant receives treatment, if needed , for study-&#xD;
      related injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ameliorating Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodes of clinical emergence agitation/delirium (EA), will receive rescue treatment. This&#xD;
      treatment will consist of 0.5 - 1.0 mcg/Kg IV dexmedetomidine as previously stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed not to start the next dose of acetaminophen until 6 hours&#xD;
      after last administered dose. This dose correlates to the time of intra-operative IV infusion&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All discharged patients will receive a call within 24 hours of surgery for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance of regulatory documents as well as study data accuracy and completeness, will&#xD;
           be monitored through an internal study team quality assurance process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidentiality throughout the trial is maintained by securing identifiable participant&#xD;
           data in secured,&#xD;
