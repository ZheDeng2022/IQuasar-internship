      Objectives- to find out whether a correlation exists between denudation of urothelium and&#xD;
      diagnosic delay in patients with BPS / IC, secondary aim was to search a correlation between&#xD;
      impact of symptoms evaluated with ICSI-ICPI and number of comorbid conditions associated with&#xD;
      BPS-IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods- Fifty-seven consecutive patients underwent cystoscopy under anaesthesia&#xD;
      to classify those cases suspected of BPS/IC. As for the evaluation of the ICSI-ICPI scores we&#xD;
      considered significant relevant values those ≥ 12. Patients underwent cystoscopy with&#xD;
      hydrodistension under general (90%) or locoregional anaesthesia. Bladder biopsies were taken,&#xD;
      including detrusor muscle, from those areas with the most apparent bladder wall lesions. All&#xD;
      biopsies were then fixed in 4% formalin and sent to the Pathologist for examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between 2005 and 2016, in our Department 57 consecutive patients underwent cystoscopy under&#xD;
      anaesthesia to classify those cases suspected of BPS/IC. Patients reported long-lasting&#xD;
      irritative bladder symptoms, including urgency, daytime frequency of seven or more episodes,&#xD;
      nocturia, and pain in the lower abdomen, lower back, vagina or perineum during filling or&#xD;
      after micturition. Alternative diagnoses such as urinary tract infection (UTI) were excluded.&#xD;
      Confusable diseases were ruled out by thorough history, clinical examination, urine analysis&#xD;
      and imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By means of a detailed medical history we considered the time of symptom onset, frequency of&#xD;
      micturitions, the presence of associated diseases. All patients were given the same&#xD;
      questionnaire (O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index) (19), filled at&#xD;
      the time of bladder biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the evaluation of the ICSI-ICPI scores we considered significant relevant values those&#xD;
      ≥ 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent cystoscopy with hydrodistension under general (90%) or locoregional&#xD;
      anaesthesia. A rigid cystoscope with a Ch. 22 caliber was used, mannitol solution was used as&#xD;
      filling fluid, and infusion height was 80 cm above the symphysis pubis. During filling the&#xD;
      bladder was continuously inspected. At maximal capacity, distension was maintained until&#xD;
      spontaneous filling stopped and maximum capacity was reached. At this point the bladder was&#xD;
      drained and bladder walls and mucosa were closely examined . The bladder was then filled&#xD;
      again at approximately half capacity, and at least three deep biopsies were taken, including&#xD;
      detrusor muscle, from those areas with the most apparent bladder wall lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies were then fixed in 4% formalin and sent to the Pathologist for examination. It&#xD;
      was specifically asked to assess the presence of urothelial denudation, inflammatory&#xD;
      infiltrate, counts of mast cells in the submucosa and detrusor, presence of intrafascicular&#xD;
      fibrosis and submucosal bleeding. A cut-off of 28 mast cells / mm2 was used for the&#xD;
      assessment of detrusor mastocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphologic Study Biopsy samples were cut in 5-μm-thick sections, then stained with the&#xD;
      following reagents for morphologic evaluation: Hematoxylin-Eosin, Giemsa and Masson Tricromic&#xD;
      Stain. This procedure was performed by automatic stainers (Leica, mod. ST5020 and mod.&#xD;
      Autostainer™ XL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each biopsy the following parameters were evaluated, according to the recommendations&#xD;
      reported by Hanno et al. (20) and reported in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the biopsy wasn't adequately sized (&lt; 1 mm2-wide), we decided to evaluate the most&#xD;
      reliable parameters, giving a N.V. (Not Valuable) response to the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such parameters were single-blindly studied by two independent pathologists using optic&#xD;
      microscopes (Nikon, mod. Eclipse™ E400 and mod. Eclipse™ CI) and discordant cases were then&#xD;
      discussed jointly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical Studies Immunohistochemical reactions with Dako monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      anti-Human Mast-cell Tryptase (Clone AA1; IgG1, Kappa), at 1:4000 dilution, were performed in&#xD;
      order to highlight the mast-cell component of the inflammatory infiltrate, and then to&#xD;
      quantify it. According to the protocol followed at the Laboratory of Immunohistochemistry of&#xD;
      the Pathology Unit the automatic immunostainer Dako Omnis™ was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Immunostainings&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactions were evaluated using optic microscopes (Nikon, mod. Eclipse™ E400 and mod.&#xD;
      Eclipse™ CI). The following parameters were studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of mast-cells/mm2 of mucosa;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of mast-cells/mm2 of submucosa;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of mast-cells/mm2 of the detrusor layer. In order to obtain the highest accuracy,&#xD;
           a single-blind evaluation was performed by two independent pathologists; discordant or&#xD;
           uncertain cases were then discussed jointly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were evaluated retrospectively using patient files, they were given a score&#xD;
      between 0 to 5 according to the presence of the following criteria (each criteria counting&#xD;
      one point): pain, nocturia, a bladder capacity of 500 mL, glomerulations, or interfascicular&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
