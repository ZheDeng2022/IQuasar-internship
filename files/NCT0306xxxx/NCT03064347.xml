  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether enteric-coated nutrients increase some glucose and&#xD;
      regulating hormone levels, glucose tolerance and satiety in overweight and obese individuals&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Direct delivery of nutrient to the upper intestine by enteral feeding tube can increase&#xD;
      circulating levels of some glucose and appetite regulating hormones when compared to usual&#xD;
      oral ingestion. Such an enhancement could be of value in the management of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and obesity. In this study enteric-coated nutrients will be ingested to allow for direct&#xD;
      delivery of nutrient to the upper intestine. Levels of select hormones and glucose, and&#xD;
      measures of satiety and adverse effects will be compared following the ingestion of uncoated&#xD;
      and enteric coated nutrient.&#xD;
