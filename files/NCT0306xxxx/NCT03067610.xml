      This study aims to significantly improve the acute and late morbidity of patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma both by tailoring the elective&#xD;
      irradiation only to regions with a legitimate risk of recurrence (&gt; 5%) and by lowering the&#xD;
      elective dose to 40 Gy. Level IB will not be electively treated unless it is involved with&#xD;
      pathologic or suspicious lymphadenopathy. Level V will not be treated unless two or more&#xD;
      ipsilateral nodal levels are involved (or level V itself has pathologic or suspicious&#xD;
      adenopathy). Levels III and IV will only be irradiated if the immediately proximal level&#xD;
      contains pathologic lymphadenopathy (i.e. level III irradiated if level II is positive; level&#xD;
      IV irradiated if level III is positive). We anticipate that this approach should dramatically&#xD;
      improve the acute and late complication profile.&#xD;
