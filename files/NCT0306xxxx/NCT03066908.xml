      A prospective, single arm, multicenter study designed to demonstrate that the Sinopsys®&#xD;
      Lacrimal Stent can safely create transcaruncular access to the ethmoid sinus to enable sinus&#xD;
      irrigation and reduce symptoms in patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinosinusitis.&#xD;

             postmenopausal for at least 1 year (&gt; 12 months since last menses) or are surgically&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe co-morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other&#xD;

             life expectancy, vulnerable patient population, high surgical risk)&#xD;
