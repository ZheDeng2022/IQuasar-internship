  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to establish if it is possible for patients who have&#xD;
      undergone major body surgery to complete a home based exercise training program and complete&#xD;
      the assessments required to measure physical and cognitive function. If the investigators can&#xD;
      establish that it is feasible to complete the training and test's then further research can&#xD;
      follow using these methods to determine whether it is possible to improve the physical&#xD;
      function of older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in the period following surgery&#xD;
      by using a simple exercise regimen that can be carried out at home. By targeting physical&#xD;
      function in this way the investigators hope to determine if it is a method for improving&#xD;
      frailty and well being. In turn it may also have a positive impact on health service&#xD;
      provision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome describing a lack of physiological reserve. It is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for morbidity, mortality and increased length of hospital stay. Five&#xD;
      criteria can be used to describe Frailty: weight loss, exhaustion, diminished hand-grip&#xD;
      strength, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength, is a key component of all of these criteria and of Frailty itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By assessing Frailty, vulnerable patients can be recognised early so that additional measures&#xD;
      can be implemented. Interventions to ameliorate the severity of an individual's Frailty are&#xD;
      currently the focus of much attention as these can positively impact on the patients physical&#xD;
      and cognitive function and well-being. In turn this has a positive impact on health service&#xD;
      provision reducing hospital length of stay, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise programme used in this study incorporates the High-Intensity Functional Exercise&#xD;
      (HIFE) programme for older individuals developed by Umea University Sweden with exercises&#xD;
      incorporated from the Help the Aged Preventing Falls Programme. The exercises are designed&#xD;
      such that they can be performed at home with no additional aids. The participants will be&#xD;
      required to begin the programme on discharge from hospital and undertake exercises three&#xD;
      times per week. They will receive instruction, help and support prior to discharge and&#xD;
      throughout the 6 month exercise period. The participants will be required to complete an&#xD;
      exercise diary to monitor their compliance with the programme and to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a home based exercise programme as an intervention measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures of physical function will be assessed by the Handgrip strength and Step&#xD;
      Box testing plus questionnaires assessing daily activities, Sarcopenia will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Handgrip test to measure muscle strength and quantification of muscle mass through muscle&#xD;
      ultrasound (USS) imaging. Cognitive function will be assessed by the use of validated&#xD;
      questionnaire and online cognitive tests. Frailty by the Reported Edmonton Frail Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified from local multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings.&#xD;
      These are held weekly and all patients undergoing major cavity intra-abdominal surgery are&#xD;
      discussed at the relevant MDT for their surgical speciality. Those patients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be noted by the usual care team and they will make the initial&#xD;
      approach to the patient regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 participants will be recruited to the study and allocated randomly to either the exercise&#xD;
      intervention arm or the control arm of the study. Participants will be involved in the study&#xD;
      for approximately 8 months depending upon when they are recruited to the study&#xD;
      pre-operatively. The post-operative exercise programme runs for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of the screening process are part of the standard NHS pre-operative assessment&#xD;
      and include National Health Service (NHS) blood tests, ECG, clinical examination and medical&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend five testing sessions, one pre-operatively and four&#xD;
      postoperatively. These sessions will wherever possible be timed with planned clinic&#xD;
      appointments scheduled as part of the standard NHS care provided by their surgical&#xD;
      speciality. The first session shall occur at the time of the pre-operative assessment and&#xD;
      will require the participant to complete all of the assessments (detailed below). The second&#xD;
      session occurs three days postoperatively whilst the participant is an inpatient, of the&#xD;
      physical assessments only the handgrip strength test shall be completed. The remaining three&#xD;
      sessions occur at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-operatively and all of the assessments&#xD;
      shall be completed. At each session blood tests for monitoring of Haemoglobin levels and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers shall be collected, some of which will be a part of the standard NHS&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of physical function and Sarcopenia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip test: Three readings (maximal isometric contraction of the hand using the Takei hand&#xD;
      dynamometer) for each hand will be recorded with the average of the three readings&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Box test: Participants will complete three sets of step box steps. The first set&#xD;
      involves 10 steps at a slow pace, the second set, 20 steps at normal walking pace and the&#xD;
      final set, 20 steps as fast as they can. The height of the step is dependent upon the height&#xD;
      of the participant. The time to complete each set and the heart rate during stepping and in&#xD;
      the recovery period is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery period is 5 minutes or the time taken for the heart rate to return within 5 bpm&#xD;
      of the resting heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of vastus lateralis: Ultrasound images will be taken of the vastus lateralis at a&#xD;
      point 2/3 along the axis from the greater trochanter of the femur and the knee joint-line. At&#xD;
      this point a sagittal image will be captured to delineate the anterior and posterior borders&#xD;
      of the muscle. Muscle depth, bulk and muscle pennation angle will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Frailty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported Edmonton Frail Scale: This is a validated frailty scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Cognition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire is a validated cognitive screening&#xD;
      tool to screen for mild to moderate cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computerised Cognitive test battery: This involves two computerised tests, the Simon test and&#xD;
      the Symbol Substitution test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following validated questionnaires will be used; The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)&#xD;
      assess activities of daily living, the EQ5D evaluates health status, the International&#xD;
      Physical Activity - Short Form (IPAC-SF) questionnaire assess physical activity. Depression&#xD;
      shall also be screened for by using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of the intervention will be determined through interviews, exercise diary's&#xD;
      and feedback questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of participants from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they wish to withdraw consent or loose the&#xD;
      capacity to consent. Further if they develop post-operative complications of the&#xD;
      cardio-vascular system, cerebrovascular system or complications of the operative wound site.&#xD;
      Also if they discontinue with the exercise programme either temporarily or permanently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study, there is no current data from which to estimate the sample size.&#xD;
