  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pilot clinical study involving two study groups. This study is&#xD;
      designed to demonstrate that the study treatment meets primary efficacy and safety endpoints.&#xD;
      The treatment involves radiofrequency treatment to address symptoms of stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the study treatment, subjects will be followed out to 12 months&#xD;
      post-treatment. At the Screening Visit, and at each designated follow-up timepoint, subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a variety of questionnaires, provide a patient diary, and undergo&#xD;
      an objective assessment for urine loss.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, pilot clinical study involving two study groups. Subjects meeting the&#xD;
      all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single SUI treatment; subjects in Group 2 will receive two SUI&#xD;
      Treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening Visit, and at each pre-designated study follow-up timepoint, subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to complete several quality of life questionnaires related to the treated condition.&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will provide a bladder voiding diary for review and data collection,&#xD;
      and a pad weight test will be conducted and results collected.&#xD;
