      This study is being done to see if the radioisotope 99mTc sestamibi scans can locate what is&#xD;
      causing the elevated serum thyroglobulin in persons with differentiated thyroid cancer who&#xD;
      have elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and negative diagnostic imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is for patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elevated suppressed or stimulated thyroglobulin level (Tg) &gt; 10 ng/ml with or WITHOUT&#xD;
           thyroglobulin antibodies ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All NEGATIVE standard diagnostic clinical imaging studies (NSDCIS) = negative ultrasound&#xD;
           (US), diagnostic radioiodine scan (DRS), chest-x-ray (CXR), computer tomography with or&#xD;
           without contrast (CT), and 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission computer tomography&#xD;
           scan (18F-FDG PET) within the last 12 mos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If EDCIS (extensive diagnostic clinical imaging studies of 18F-sodium fluoride positron&#xD;
           emission computer tomography scan (18F NaF PET) or 99mTc methylene diphosphonate bone&#xD;
           scan (99mTc MDP), AND negative brain CT or magnetic resonance (MR) are performed, these&#xD;
           are also negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary patients will have sestamibi scan performed in 4 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: receive an injection into their vein of a radioisotope called 99mTc sestamibi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: wait for 60 to 90 minutes in a waiting room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: imaged lying face up on an imaging table while a camera passes around you from the&#xD;
      top of the head to approximately the level of knees. This requires approximately 45 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: images will be reviewed by the nuclear medicine physician. This will take ~10-15&#xD;
      minutes. If additional images are required to clarify an image, then additional images of&#xD;
      that area will be performed on the same camera or an alternate camera. As earlier, the&#xD;
      additional images performed lying face up. These images require ~20-45 minutes. The patient&#xD;
      will then be released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of this study is considered very low, and the potential benefits to the patient are&#xD;
      considered very high.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Interpretation of 99mTc Sestamibi Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. A team of two blinded nuclear medicine physicians will interpret the 99mTc sestamibi, and&#xD;
      any area of radioactivity will be graded as by a standard nuclear medicine grading system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normal physiological activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probably physiological activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indeterminate activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Probably metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Criteria for &quot;final determination&quot; regarding whether a finding represents physiological&#xD;
      activity or metastatic disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For findings graded as 1 or 2, they will be defined for this study as physiological&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For findings graded as 3, or 4, the following will be required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Biopsy; however, this will only performed if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Follow-up: It is anticipated that very few biopsies will be performed and because the&#xD;
      criteria for entering this study is NDCIS or NECIS, the only alternative for confirming&#xD;
      whether or not a foci of 99mTc sestamibi uptake on a scan is metastases will be follow up,&#xD;
      which will be performed on a clinical bases. However, if on follow up any of the following&#xD;
      occur, then the focus will be categorized as a metastases (true positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subsequent biopsy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subsequent clinical imaging study(s) (For example, although a lytic bone lesion in the&#xD;
           area of interested was not present initially on the CT, a lytic lesion indicative of&#xD;
           metastases may subsequently develop in that area, and for this study this will be&#xD;
           defined as evidence of metastases of DTC (true positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Blind I-131 treatment** with or without a prefatory scan: If a &quot;blind&quot; I-131&#xD;
           treatment&quot; is clinically selected and the post I-131 therapy scan demonstrates uptake in&#xD;
           the same areas as the 99mTc sestamibi, then the finding on the 99mTc sestamibi will be&#xD;
           classified for this study as a metastases of DTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grade 5 is not anticipated, because unlikely I-131, which can have patterns that are&#xD;
           very specific for DTC, 99mTc sestamibi patterns are not specific for DTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A &quot;blind I-131 treatment&quot; is a potential therapeutic option, and this term means&#xD;
                that the treating physician or team cannot identify the source of the patient's&#xD;
                elevated Tg, but because of factors such as the level of elevated Tg, the rate of&#xD;
                rise of the Tg, and the patient's clinical situation, a therapeutic administration&#xD;
                of I-131 is give despite being &quot;blind&quot; to the source of the Tg.&#xD;
