  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open label, expanded access program to provide access to olaparib&#xD;
      tablets for relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer patients (including patients with&#xD;
      primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube cancer) with BRCA mutations (documented mutation&#xD;
      in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that is predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious [known or&#xD;
      predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function]) who have responded following platinum&#xD;
      based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive study treatment until disease progression as assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator according to local standard clinical practice or any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria are met.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide expanded access to olaparib tablets for use as maintenance monotherapy in BRCA&#xD;
      mutated platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patients who&#xD;
      are in complete or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect the individual safety data of olaparib maintenance monotherapy in BRCA mutated PSR&#xD;
      high grade epithelial ovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partial response&#xD;
      following platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the number of enrolled patients is not enough (&lt;5 patients), only listings of safety&#xD;
      data will be prepared. On the other hand, if the number is sufficient (&gt;=5 patients),&#xD;
      summaries of safety data will be prepared using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target subject population Patients with PSR high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer with a BRCA&#xD;
      mutation (this includes any patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube cancer).&#xD;
      At enrollment, patients will be in complete or partial response following completion (a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 treatment cycles) of platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have completed at least 2 previous lines of platinum-based therapy (e.g.,&#xD;
      carboplatin or cisplatin) before entry to the study and must be considered platinum sensitive&#xD;
      after the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum sensitive in this study is&#xD;
      defined as disease progression greater than 6 months after completion (last dose) of the&#xD;
      penultimate platinum chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must not have received bevacizumab during the chemotherapy course immediately prior&#xD;
      to entry. Cytoreductive surgery prior to the end of the last chemotherapy regimen is allowed&#xD;
      as long as it is completed before the end of the chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients known to have BRCA mutation/s from germline (i.e., blood) or a tumour specimen,&#xD;
      prior to provision of informed consent can enter the study based on this result. The result&#xD;
      must be made available to AstraZeneca. Patients that have a BRCA mutation identified can&#xD;
      enter the study provided that all such testing has been undertaken in appropriately&#xD;
      accredited laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment Patients may continue to receive study treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression as assessed by the investigator according to local standard clinical practice or&#xD;
      any other discontinuation criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration Olaparib is available as a&#xD;
      film-coated tablet containing 150 mg or 100 mg of olaparib. Patients will be administered&#xD;
      study treatment orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily. The planned dose of 300 mg twice&#xD;
      daily will be made up of two x 150 mg tablets twice daily with 100 mg tablets used to manage&#xD;
      dose reductions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Approximately 10 patients will be allowed to enter the expanded access&#xD;
      program. No formal analysis will be performed on any data obtained. However all safety data&#xD;
      will be summarised and tabulated for regulatory purposes only, if the number of enrolled&#xD;
      patients is sufficient (&gt;= 5 patients). On the other hand, if the number of patients is small&#xD;
      (&lt;5 patients), only listings of safety data will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the number of enrolled patients is sufficient, data summaries will be prepared based on&#xD;
      the Safety Analysis Set, which will consist of patients who have received at least one dose&#xD;
      of olaparib and have at least one post baseline safety assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Initial dose is 300mg twice daily. Study treatment can be dose reduced to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step. There is no maximum duration for taking study treatment.
