  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coordination Toolkit and Coaching (CTAC) project aims to disseminate strategies for&#xD;
      coordination of care for high-risk Veterans via an online toolkit, while evaluating the&#xD;
      benefits of adding a distance-coaching strategy to assist sites with deploying the toolkit's&#xD;
      tools. The project's focus is on care coordination across outpatient settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-site project provides: 1) An online toolkit to support better care coordination&#xD;
      for vulnerable patients visiting primary care, 2) Random assignment of participating clinics&#xD;
      to either a toolkit or a combined toolkit/distance coaching strategy, and 3) A quality&#xD;
      improvement approach with &quot;plan-do-study-act&quot; cycles of improvement, designed to support&#xD;
      clinics in a locally initiated effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is recruiting clinics with the goal of improving Veteran experience of care (as&#xD;
      measured by a survey called the Hassles Scale).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: High-risk Veterans are defined as individuals who are at increased risk for poor&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and higher use of unplanned health services relative to their non-high-risk&#xD;
      counterparts. These Veterans typically have multiple chronic health problems and are&#xD;
      vulnerable to gaps in care due to impaired physical, psychological, and/or social&#xD;
      functioning. Despite efforts to integrate care through VA's Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT)&#xD;
      in primary care, deficits in care coordination persist. In VA, most high-risk Veterans are&#xD;
      managed in primary care rather than a specialty service. PACT was expected to improve care&#xD;
      coordination by creating the care manager role for the PACT teamlet nurse. However, there&#xD;
      have been significant challenges in implementing the care manager role as intended. Many of&#xD;
      the care coordination challenges involve the &quot;medical neighborhood&quot; outside of PACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the quality of care coordination in outpatient care and also develop better&#xD;
      methods for spreading innovations, the Coordination Toolkit and Coaching project was funded&#xD;
      by VA's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI). This project develops and pilots an&#xD;
      online toolkit and distance-based coaching process, and then compares the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the toolkit alone to the combination of the toolkit plus distance coaching for improving VA&#xD;
      patients' experience of care. Both toolkit and combined toolkit/coaching strategies have been&#xD;
      used individually in VA quality improvement initiatives, and each strategy has been compared&#xD;
      individually to other alternatives. However, to the investigators' knowledge, these&#xD;
      strategies have not formally been compared head-to-head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Outcome Information: The project's primary outcome is a measure of patient&#xD;
      experience, the Health System Hassles Scale. This 16-item scale asks patients questions such&#xD;
      as whether their medications are being refilled on time, whether they were given information&#xD;
      about why they were referred to a specialist, whether there has been poor communication&#xD;
      between different doctors or clinics, or whether there have been disagreements between&#xD;
      doctors about the patient's diagnosis or the best treatment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculations: The sample size calculation for this study is based on a simple&#xD;
      presumption of a difference-in-differences analysis (across the two time points) for the&#xD;
      comparison of the two implementation strategies. The primary outcome is the Health System&#xD;
      Hassles Scale. The investigators assume 12 clinics in the study (6 per study group), which&#xD;
      will be viewed as clusters in order to evaluate the sample size. Since the number of patients&#xD;
      per cluster may vary, the investigators assume a coefficient of variation of cluster sizes of&#xD;
      about 0.9. With an effect size of 0.3 standard deviations (which is considered to be a small&#xD;
      to medium effect size in Cohen's terminology) for the difference-in-difference analysis and&#xD;
      an intra-cluster correlation of 0.023 (based on preliminary evaluation of prior data), then&#xD;
      with 80% power and two-sided 5% significance level, 149 patients per clinic are needed for a&#xD;
      total of 1788 patients (evenly divided between the two groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan: The primary endpoint of the Health System Hassles Scale will be&#xD;
      compared between the two implementation groups (toolkit and combined toolkit/coaching) using&#xD;
      a difference-in-differences (between the two time points: baseline and 12 months) analysis&#xD;
      adjusted for the clustering by clinic. This analysis will be performed initially with a&#xD;
      general linear model using the between time point difference as the dependent variable and&#xD;
      study group as the independent variable, with clinic as the clustering variable (and, thus,&#xD;
      using an appropriately chosen variance-covariance matrix). A further adjustment model may&#xD;
      incorporate appropriate covariates including patient-level factors, such as gender, age, and&#xD;
      use of non-VA care.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome was the 16-item Health Care System Hassles Scale. Recognized as a measure of care coordination, the Hassles questionnaire lists problems that patients may encounter with their general healthcare, as opposed to their care experience with one specific visit or provider. The questionnaire prompts patients to indicate how much situations such as &quot;lack of information about why you've been referred to a specialist&quot; have been a problem, using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 -4. Ratings were dichotomized (0 = &quot;Not a problem at all&quot; vs. 1 = any level of problem indicated) and summed to yield a hassles count ranging from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating more hassles.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We recruited and enrolled VA primary care clinics from October 2016 to June 2018 using a multi-pronged approach, including teleconference presentations and direct outreach to regional and national leadership. Enrolled clinics participated in a 12-month quality improvement project.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patient survey data were collected cross-sectionally at baseline and 12-months' follow-up to measure clinic outcomes. For the primary outcome (Health Care System Hassles Scale), both baseline and follow-up data are presented in the &quot;outcomes&quot; section; the primary measure of effectiveness depends on the change in outcome from baseline to follow-up.</pre_assignment_details>

Of these individuals, 40 reported receiving no VA care (the clinics being analyzed are part of the VA) in the past 12 months, so they were excluded from further analysis.

        <title>Health Care System Hassles Scale</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was the 16-item Health Care System Hassles Scale. Recognized as a measure of care coordination, the Hassles questionnaire lists problems that patients may encounter with their general healthcare, as opposed to their care experience with one specific visit or provider. The questionnaire prompts patients to indicate how much situations such as &quot;lack of information about why you've been referred to a specialist&quot; have been a problem, using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 -4. Ratings were dichotomized (0 = &quot;Not a problem at all&quot; vs. 1 = any level of problem indicated) and summed to yield a hassles count ranging from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating more hassles.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months' follow-up</time_frame>
        <population>These data derive from two cross-sectional participant surveys at separate (i.e., baseline and follow-up) timepoints. The numbers of participants shown here exceed the numbers presented in the Baseline module because respondents from the surveys are two separate (i.e., independent) samples of participants. Sample sizes for each arm are smaller than reported in the participant flow module because not all survey responses received had valid primary outcome data for analysis.</population>
