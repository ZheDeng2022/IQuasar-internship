      The primary objective of this pilot study to evaluate the safety of low dose Entolimod in&#xD;
      normal, healthy, non-patient normals. This clinical trial in 40 normal humans compares a&#xD;
      single dose of 4 ug Td (2 ug of TT and 2 ug of diphtheria toxoid + 3000 ug of alum with or&#xD;
      without entolimod. Subjects will be randomized to: Td alone (n=15) and Td+ entolimod (n=25).&#xD;
      The investigators expect that Td + entolimod will double the anti-TT and anti-diphtheria AB&#xD;
      levels over Td alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (participants are blinded), pilot study with no therapeutic or&#xD;
      diagnostic intent and limited drug exposure. The study will be conducted at Baylor College of&#xD;
      Medicine in normal, healthy, and non-drug using male volunteers who have not received the Td&#xD;
      vaccination in the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and surrogate efficacy of low dose&#xD;
      entolimod in normal, healthy, non-patient subjects by comparing anti-tetanus (TT) antibody&#xD;
      levels between patients getting entolimod vs no entolimod combined with tetanus-diphtheria&#xD;
      (Td) vaccine. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two arms in a 3:5 ratio (for every&#xD;
      8 subjects, 3 will be randomly assigned to the control group and 5 to the treatment group) to&#xD;
      receive a single dose of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Td (4 ug) (n=15), Arm 2: Td (4 ug) + Entolimod (1 ug) (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to give the normal dose of Td given routinely to humans (i.e. TT at 2μg and&#xD;
      diphtheria toxoid at 2 ug) for a total protein dose of 4 ug. The proposed dose of entolimod&#xD;
      at 1 ug is 30-40 times lesser than that previously given safely to humans. We expect that Td&#xD;
      + entolimod will double the anti-tetanus toxoid antibody (anti-TT AB) and anti-diphtheria AB&#xD;
      levels over Td alone. We predict that this low dosing of entolimod (1μg) produces no&#xD;
      difference in adverse effects from giving Td vaccine alone and that any adverse events will&#xD;
      be no different than what is typical as reported in the Physicians' Desk Reference for Td&#xD;
      vaccine in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this trial, study population age cut-off will be 40 years of age. The reason&#xD;
      for this cut-off is that the body produces higher antibody levels in response to vaccines in&#xD;
      younger age groups compared to older groups. Further, this study is restricted to males only&#xD;
      as a safety measure so that women of child-bearing age are not exposed to entolimod, which&#xD;
      has not been given to women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider our strategy adequate for human safety for several reasons related to risks for&#xD;
      this new combination of an existing vaccine and new adjuvant. First, our proposed&#xD;
      Td-Entolimod starting dose is the usual approved clinical dose of Td (4 μg containing 2 ug TT&#xD;
      + 2 ug diphtheria toxoid). Second, the proposed dose for the adjuvant entolimod (1 μg) is&#xD;
      supported by both animal toxicology studies and human safety/PK/PD studies cross-referenced&#xD;
      from IND 100480. The results of these safety studies, which have given humans up to 30 μg and&#xD;
      animals up to 100μg, strongly support that entolimod at 1μg is a safe human dose. The other&#xD;
      adjuvant is aluminum phosphate, which is contained within the standard Td vaccine in humans.&#xD;
      Third, further support for safety comes from the recent recommendations to boost pregnant&#xD;
      women with Td at each pregnancy regardless whether or not they have recently received a Td&#xD;
      shot. This recommendation of acceptable enough safety for ACIP to recommend it for pregnant&#xD;
      women, supports that this study's single dosing with Td even at less than a 5 year interval&#xD;
      would be relatively low risk. Fourth, other FDA approved conjugate vaccines using TT have&#xD;
      contained 8 to 10 times greater doses of TT than in our planned dose. Fifth, we will have a&#xD;
      randomization of 25 subjects to the Td-Entolimod combination vaccine, which will provide&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of subjects to detect common adverse events such as fever and local site&#xD;
      reactions in more than one human subject in our vaccinated group compared to the Td alone&#xD;
      control group. Local injection site and systemic inflammatory changes also will be monitored&#xD;
      in planned clinical study trials with later TT conjugate anti-addiction vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The close monitoring of objective and subjective drug effects by direct observation, blood&#xD;
      work (CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel), weekly telephone check-ins over a 6 week period&#xD;
      from point of vaccination to close-out visit to monitor for potential adverse reactions, and&#xD;
      a close-out physical will allow objective evaluation of the effects of the vaccines in these&#xD;
      normal subjects. We will also have post treatment follow up period with monthly telephone&#xD;
      visits up to 1 year from vaccination to further monitor for adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6-weeks post-vaccination, we will analyze level of anti-TT AB and anti-diphtheria AB and&#xD;
      compare both study arms compared to baseline AB levels to determine the immune potentiating&#xD;
      capability of entolimod. In addition to not expecting any difference in adverse events (AE)&#xD;
      from giving Td alone compared to those AE listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference for Td in&#xD;
      normals, we also expect the AB levels at 6 weeks post vaccination and the ratio of 6-week to&#xD;
      baseline AB levels from Td+entolimod (n=25) to be at least double the levels from Td alone&#xD;
      (n=15).&#xD;
