      Celldex endeavors to make investigational products available to patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening diseases who have exhausted other treatment options and where there is a&#xD;
      reasonable expectation of benefit over risk. Requests for expanded access to glembatumumab&#xD;
      vedotin in patients with gpNMB expressing triple negative breast cancer will be considered.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has histologically confirmed, gpNMB expressing, metastatic triple-negative&#xD;
             breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Overexpression of gpNMB in at least one tumor sample as determined by a Sponsor&#xD;
             approved laboratory using IHC methods&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient does not have abnormal organ function, active autoimmune disease, active&#xD;
             infections or additional concurrent conditions that would compromise the patient's&#xD;
             ability to safely receive glembatumumb vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is not eligible for or cannot access ongoing glembatumumab vedotin&#xD;
             clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient does not qualify for, or cannot access, other comparable or satisfactory&#xD;
             alternative therapy for triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient is able to read and understand, and has signed a patient informed consent&#xD;
             form, which outlines the nature of the proposed treatment and the anticipated benefits&#xD;
             and risks of treatment with glembatumumab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar composition to&#xD;
             glembatumumab vedotin, MMAE, dolastatin or auristatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or breast-feeding women, and women or men who are not willing to use&#xD;
             effective contraception during the time from signing of informed consent through two&#xD;
             months after the last dose of glembatumumab vedotin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient was previously treated with glembatumumab vedotin or previously enrolled&#xD;
             on the METRIC trial (regardless of which arm they were randomized to).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any underlying medical condition that, in the investigator's or Sponsor's opinion,&#xD;
             will make the administration of Glembatumumab vedotin hazardous to the patient, or&#xD;
             would obscure the interpretation of adverse events.&#xD;
