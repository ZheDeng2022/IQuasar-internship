      This study will apply novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to investigation of&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) to learn how nerve fibers repair and neural cells regain ability to&#xD;
      control muscle during the rehabilitation. The information gained will be helpful for&#xD;
      physicians to make more accurate diagnosis of SCI, predict injury recovery and movement&#xD;
      restoration, and develop more effective treatment plans.&#xD;

      Today, the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury&#xD;
      (ISNSCI) , which includes tests of motor and cutaneous sensory function, and Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Independence Measure (SCIM) are the gold standards for neurological classification of spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI). These standard measures have very important applications in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of SCI as primary clinical and outcome measures. Despite the importance and&#xD;
      usefulness of their applications, these standard measures have their limitations. For&#xD;
      example, ISNSCI, intended to be a clinical classification system, is subjective and&#xD;
      relatively insensitive to incremental neurophysiological and functional changes during both&#xD;
      acute and chronic stages of recovery. Moreover, the ISNSCI cannot evaluate the spinal cord&#xD;
      (SC) function bellow the neurological level. For some patients such as children and patients&#xD;
      with concomitant brain injuries, reliable evaluation cannot be completed due to their limited&#xD;
      cognitive engagement in the evaluation process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been&#xD;
      proposed as a more objective tool to help clinicians make prognosis. However, recent study&#xD;
      showed that conventional clinical MRI does not correlate well with scores measured with&#xD;
      ISNSCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI tool capable of probing white matter&#xD;
      integrity information through measuring directional diffusion of water molecules, thus&#xD;
      providing more microscopic details than conventional MRI. Recent findings suggest that DTI is&#xD;
      a promising, non-invasive and objective tool for evaluating and monitoring structural changes&#xD;
      within white matter axon pathways after SCI. Our preliminary data showed significant&#xD;
      deviation of DTI indices from normative values of healthy subjects in a SCI patient whose&#xD;
      conventional T2 scans appeared to be normal (see preliminary data section). A likely&#xD;
      explanation for this observed alteration of DTI indices is degeneration and demyelization in&#xD;
      descending axonal pathways. Although DTI has been used in animal models to measure the&#xD;
      evolution of the injury in the SC and showed great promise in detection of pathological&#xD;
      changes in SC, no longitudinal DTI data obtained from human SC are available to indicate&#xD;
      sensitivity of DTI technique in detecting SCI progression or recovery. Is DTI capable of&#xD;
      detecting structural changes taking place in the SC over the course of rehabilitation in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI? Will these measured DTI parameters correlate with ISNSCI-based scores?&#xD;
      The fundamental hypothesis of the current study is that rehabilitation can facilitate SC&#xD;
      fiber tract repair along with spontaneous adaptations following the injury to help reconnect&#xD;
      some of the injured nerve fibers with motoneurons controlling muscles and this will in turn&#xD;
      improve the motoneuron activity to promote muscular function, and all these changes can be&#xD;
      detected by the proposed longitudinal DTI protocols and standard clinical tools for motor&#xD;
      function evaluation. The expected results gained by this longitudinal study would support the&#xD;
      application of DTI in monitoring plastic changes in the injured SC and the DTI-derived&#xD;
      measures could potentially aid clinicians make more objective diagnosis of the injury and&#xD;
      estimate its progression, which are critical in planning targeted therapies. However, it is&#xD;
      out of the scope of this proposal to distinguish contributions to structural changes&#xD;
      occurring in the SC between spontaneous and treatment factors. Because it is unethical to not&#xD;
      treat patients, this limitation cannot be overcome in the current human study. Given the&#xD;
      primary focus of the study being longitudinal tracking of SC structural changes using&#xD;
      neuroimaging rather than determining relative contributions to these changes by spontaneous&#xD;
      recovery and treatment, the limitation should not significantly influence the quality of our&#xD;
      study. To test the hypothesis, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Track SC structural changes in patients with incomplete SCI (iSCI) using DTI. Each&#xD;
      patient in the proposed study will be scanned covering entire cervical region of the SC using&#xD;
      a DTI sequence at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 month and 6 month after start of standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention. DTI indices (see methods for details) will be quantified and&#xD;
      compared across all time points. Previous longitudinal brain DTI human and animal studies&#xD;
      suggest that DTI is sensitive to detect brain whiter matter structural changes 24 hours&#xD;
      (animal study) and 3 months (unpublished human DTI results by PI's group) after brain injury,&#xD;
      and 6 month after initial scan in patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) (DTI data&#xD;
      were only available 6 months after initial scan in this study). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the proposed DTI protocol will be able to capture structural changes in SCI during its&#xD;
      recovery course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Correlate the SC plasticity manifested by changes in DTI indices with clinical&#xD;
      assessments of injury and sensorimotor function. Quantitative DTI indices will be correlated&#xD;
      to clinical diagnoses of SCI and clinical evaluations of upper and lower limb sensorimotor&#xD;
      function of the patients. It is hypothesized that the DTI index of SCI will significantly be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical diagnosis and scores of upper and lower sensorimotor function. The&#xD;
      DTI parameter holds great promise to be a biomarker of SCI and is expected to have prognostic&#xD;
      value in predicting functional outcome of a rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <time_frame>changes within 6 months after participant enrolls.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological examination will be performed using the ISNCSCI. Sensory scores and lower and upper extremity motor scores (LEMS and UEMS) are derived at the time of this exam. The ISNCSCI and all examinations described below will be performed following the same schedule as the imaging (DTI, T2, T2*) evaluation (baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after commencement of rehabilitation therapy). The LEMS measures strength in five muscle groups bilaterally (hip flexors, knee flexors, extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors) and the UEMS also assess strength bilaterally in 5 muscle groups (elbow flexors, elbow extensors, wrist extensors, finger flexors, finger abductors) with the modified British Medical Research Council scale and is performed during the ISNCSCI examination.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes within 6 months after participant enrolls.</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity assessments will be performed at each visit using the MAS. It tests the resistance to passive movement about a joint with vary degrees of velocity. The scores range from 0 to 4, with 6 choices (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, and 4). A score of 0 indicates no resistance, and 4 indicates rigidity. The MAS scores will be averaged across 5 muscle groups bilaterally for lower extremities and 5 muscle groups for upper extremities. An experienced therapist will perform all the evaluations for all the visits and all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Spinal Cord Independence measure III (SCIM III)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes within 6 months after participant enrolls.</time_frame>
    <description>The SCIM is a measure of functional ability developed specifically for individuals with SCI to evaluate their performance of activities of daily living and to make functional assessments of this population sensitive to change. SCIM scores a task higher in patients who accomplish it with less assistannce, aids, or medical compromise than other patients. The SCIM III to be adopted by the current study is composed of 19 items in 3 subscales: (a) self-care; (b) respiration and sphincter management; and (c) mobility. The total score ranges from 0 to 100. Mobility is subdivided into &quot;room and toilet&quot; and &quot;indoors and outdoors&quot;. The items are weighted in terms of their assumed clinical relevance. The SCIM III is a valid and reliable measure and is recommended as a primary outcome measure to assess functional recovery in individuals with SCI.</description>
