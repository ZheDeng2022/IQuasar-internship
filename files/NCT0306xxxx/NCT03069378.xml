             (neoadjuvant cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For histology specific additional metastatic cohorts, patients must have&#xD;
             undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/myxofibrosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma or&#xD;
             cutaneous angiosarcoma. For the additional neoadjuvant cohort, patients must have&#xD;
             either undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or myxofibrosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous (superficial or deep)&#xD;
             soft tissue or nodal lesion ≥ 10 mm in longest diameter. Of note, bone lesions are not&#xD;
             eligible for injection unless there is a soft tissue component that is amenable to&#xD;
             injection. Injectable lesions must not be chosen from a previously irradiated field&#xD;
             unless there has been radiographically and/or pathologically documented tumor&#xD;

             subtypes for which there is no known standard systemic therapy (e.g., epithelioid&#xD;
             sarcoma). Treatment naive patients may be enrolled if they have refused standard&#xD;
             systemic treatment. Prior adjuvant therapy will not count provided it was completed&#xD;
             more than 6 months previously&#xD;
&#xD;

             receiving anti-cancer therapy for the recurrence must have evidence of progression on&#xD;
             this therapy to be considered eligible.&#xD;
