  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab works in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment or high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response rate as determined by the International Working Group recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability. II. To assess time on treatment. III. To assess overall&#xD;
      survival. IV. To assess progression free survival. V. To assess long-term response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore biomarkers predictive of response or resistance to therapy including expression&#xD;
      of CD38 at study entry and at relapse and response rate based on CD38 expression level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 3.25-6.5 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22&#xD;
      of cycles 1-2, on days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, every 6&#xD;
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
