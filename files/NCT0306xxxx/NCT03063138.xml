      The aim of the study is to evaluate the intra- and inter-rater variability of wound&#xD;
      measurements using the 3D camera and to compare with standard measurement methods (2D image&#xD;
      method and gel injection). Forty-eight patients with wounds of various sizes are measured by&#xD;
      four clinicians. Each wound is measured twice with the 3D camera, once by 2D image method and&#xD;
      once by gel injection into wound cavity by two clinicians.&#xD;

      Diabetic foot ulcers constitute an increasing health problem in Denmark concurrent with an&#xD;
      ageing population and an increase in diabetes prevalence. Diabetic foot ulcers belong to the&#xD;
      most serious and costly complications. Several studies have found that the size and depth of&#xD;
      the wound is one of the major etiologic factors for delayed healing. Wound measurement is&#xD;
      important in monitoring the healing process of wound and in evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      treatment. Three-dimensional methods for measuring wound size have made it possible to&#xD;
      evaluate the process of wound healing with respect to all dimensions. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed a 3D camera, which is able to measure wound size (2D area, 3D area, perimeter and&#xD;
      volume) and to assess wound characteristics.&#xD;
