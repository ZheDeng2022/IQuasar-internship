  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgens are important sex steroids in women. Androgens influence protein synthesis and&#xD;
      muscle growth, are involved in maturation of the reproductive organs, have a fat reducing&#xD;
      effect , have a negative effect on the serum lipid profile, and may also increase insulin&#xD;
      resistance and coagulation activity. The role of androgens in women is not clear. This study&#xD;
      is aimed at learning about the amount of androgen and its actions in pregnant women. This&#xD;
      study is also looking to see if there are specific patient factors (such as genetics) that&#xD;
      change the amount of androgen and its activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lot of information about the main female sex hormones such as estrogens and&#xD;
      progesterones (the main female sex hormones and the most important in menstrual ,&#xD;
      reproductive cycles and pregnancy) . However there is little information about androgens in&#xD;
      pregnant women. It is known that certain illnesses, chemicals and dietary products might&#xD;
      change the amount of androgen and its actions, which could affect the mother and her baby. It&#xD;
      is also known that there are differences between the androgen levels in different people, and&#xD;
      in different ethnic groups. These differences are mostly due to genetic factors. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to learn about the androgen levels in healthy pregnant women and if genetic or&#xD;
      clinical factors (for example age, trimester of pregnancy, parity, ethnicity, etc.) play a&#xD;
      role in changing the androgen amount and action, throughout pregnancy and after delivery.&#xD;
