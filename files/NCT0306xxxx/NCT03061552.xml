    <textblock>
      Determination of dry weight in patients with end-stage renal disease treated with&#xD;
      hemodialysis is an unmet challenge in clinical nephrology. Current methods are imprecise, and&#xD;
      thus many patients are hype- or hypovolemic, and suffer respective consequences such as&#xD;
      hypertension, pulmonary congestion, cardiac hypertrophy, chronic dehydration, hypotension and&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques have been proposed to asses hydration status in dialysis patient, among&#xD;
      them measurement of bioimpedance and biochemical markers. Sonographic measurement of the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) is a method under investigation for assessing hydration&#xD;
      status. It is available, inexpensive and efficient, yet operator-dependent. In a&#xD;
      single-center, blinded and controlled trial it has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      patients receiving hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to assess the applicability and clinical utility of this method in our&#xD;
      dialysis units. A crossover design is intended to examine the effect of IVCD measurement on&#xD;
      quality of life and rate of hemodynamic adversities as compared with traditional estimation&#xD;
      of dry weight.&#xD;

      Introduction Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESDR) cannot regulate their fluid&#xD;
      balance, and are dependent on dialysis for fluid removal. Fluid removal is dependent upon&#xD;
      estimation of dry weight. Dry weight is defined as the post-dialysis weight under which a&#xD;
      patient suffers (more often than not) from symptoms of hypotension. Today, clinical&#xD;
      estimation of dry weight is based on physical examination. This method is inaccurate, and&#xD;
      many patients suffer from the consequences of over- or under-estimation of their dry weight.&#xD;
      Overestimation leads to hypertension, edema and pulmonary congestion, cardiac hypertrophy and&#xD;
      failure. Underestimation results in chronic dehydration, hypotension, dizziness, muscle&#xD;
      spasms, gastrointestinal disturbances, tinnitus and shock. Both over- and underestimation&#xD;
      diminish quality of life. One of the methods proposed as objective estimators of hydration&#xD;
      status is sonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Cheriex et al&#xD;
      have determined that IVCD correlates with right atrial filling, and suggested that IVCD above&#xD;
      11.5 mm/m2 indicates hypervolemia, and values less than 8 mm/m2 indicate hypovolemia. Chang&#xD;
      et al reported the only randomized controlled trial to examine quality of life and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of hemodialysis patients in whom IVCD was measured compared to patients in whom dry&#xD;
      weight estimation was based solely on physical examination. They found lesser clinical&#xD;
      mishaps and improved quality of life in the intervention group, an effect which was more&#xD;
      pronounced in patients found to be hypovolemic. As this is the only reported randomized&#xD;
      intervention, conducted with Asian participants, we sought to conduct a similar study in an&#xD;
      independent hemodialysis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Examination of the quality of life consequences of dry weight estimation in ESRD&#xD;
      patients receiving dialysis with sonographic IVCD measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We assume that adjustment of dry weight in ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis&#xD;
      using sonographic IVCD measurements will improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design: single-blinded cross-over clinical trial Study population: ESRD&#xD;
      patients receiving chronic dialysis at the Hadassah Medical Center hemodialysis units.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: pregnant women; patients treated with hemodialysis less than 3 months;&#xD;
      significant tricuspid regurgitation; severe heart failure; patients with inadequate&#xD;
      sonographic window for IVCD visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative outcomes: Primary - rate of symptomatic hypotensive events during hemodialysis&#xD;
      sessions; secondary - (1) quality of life, as evaluated using SF-36 questionnaire; (2)&#xD;
      intradialysis clinical events: hypotensive episodes, gastrointestinal complaints, muscle&#xD;
      spasm, tinnitus, headache and chest pain; (3) rate of emergent (unplanned) hemodialysis&#xD;
      treatments; (4) average 24 h ambulatory blood pressure and sleep-related dipping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental methods: hemodialysis patients undergo monthly clinical evaluation by their&#xD;
      primary nephrologist, including history, review of peri-dialysis blood pressure, physical&#xD;
      examination and routine labs - which are basis for the monthly adjustment of target dry&#xD;
      weight. Measurement of IVCD index will be performed twice in each participant, at the&#xD;
      beginning of months 1 and 3, prior to the monthly visit by the primary nephrologist.&#xD;
      Measurement will be performed as described by Cheriex et al. The primary nephrologist will be&#xD;
      notified of the IVCD index performed at the beginning of month 3, and will be requested to&#xD;
      adjust target post-dialysis weight accordingly. Participants will be blinded as to whether to&#xD;
      not the primary nephrologist has been notified of the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of quality of life: self report by patients using SF-36 medical outcome study&#xD;
      short form health survey scoring system, at the end of months 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: will be performed using Ocsar 2 devices (SunTech) at&#xD;
      the ends of months 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size analysis: calculation of sample size was guided by the primary outcome. We&#xD;
      estimated that 4 hypotensive episodes occur across 14 monthly dialysis sessions, and that an&#xD;
      intervention can reduce the number of episodes to 2 per 14 session. With a difference of 2&#xD;
      episodes and standard deviation of 2 episodes, alpha level of 0.05 and 90% power, with a&#xD;
      2-sided paired t-test sample size is 13 paired assessments (13 patients) (WINPEPI). Assuming&#xD;
      incomplete followup, we intend to recruit up to 20 participants.&#xD;
