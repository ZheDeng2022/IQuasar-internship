  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b work in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon&#xD;
      gamma-1b may boost the immune system activity. Giving pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b&#xD;
      together may work better in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and Sezary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

      toxicity. Patients also receive interferon gamma-1b subcutaneously (SC) 3 times per week for&#xD;
      12 weeks, and then follow 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off schedule for up to 2 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;

Exploratory outcomes will be summarized with descriptive statistics (primarily proportions and medians) for all biomarkers described above, and additionally, serum IL-10, regulatory T-cells, and activated CD8 T cells. Scatterplots and Kendall's tau estimates will be produced for estimating correlation of PD-1, PDL1, or PD-L2 expression measures and clinical outcome across compartments (skin, lymph node, blood). Comparison of tissue immunohistochemistry markers between pre-treatment and with clinical response or disease progression will be assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</description>

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 12 weeks&#xD;

             effective form(s) of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES /SEZARY SYNDROME (TREATMENT GROUP I):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has disease that is suitable for local therapy administered with curative intent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) before entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had an allogeneic stem cell transplant are excluded because such&#xD;
             transplants disrupt the normal immune response to a very substantial degree; in&#xD;
             addition, emerging data suggests exacerbation of lethal graft versus host disease&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks before study day 1 or who has not&#xD;

             than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: the following will not be exclusionary: patients may have any grade&#xD;
                  alopecia or lymphopenia and still participate if other inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
                  criteria are met; patients may have grade 1 or 2 neuropathy at baseline and still&#xD;
                  participate if other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             patients with carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded; patients with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without&#xD;
             evidence of progression by imaging using the identical imaging modality for each&#xD;
             assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] scan,&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic&#xD;
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis, congestive&#xD;
             heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade &gt;= 3, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is an&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab); these potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to Interferon-gamma; MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and Interferon-gamma&#xD;
             may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero; furthermore, it is not known if MK-3475&#xD;
             (pembrolizumab) or Interferon-gamma have transient adverse effects on the composition&#xD;
             of sperm; patients are excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or&#xD;
             expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial,&#xD;
             starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
