  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For family members of chronically critically ill (CCI) patients, an ICU admission marks a&#xD;
      significant milestone in the patient's illness trajectory that highlights the onset of end&#xD;
      of-life issues and an abrupt need for family members to assume the caregiver role for the&#xD;
      first time. Assuming the caregiver role can have devastating and longstanding health&#xD;
      consequences for family members, which can impair their ability to sustain caregiving&#xD;
      behaviors for a CCI patient. The unrelenting psychological distress perceived by caregivers&#xD;
      of CCI patients is linked to significant reductions in their self-management and health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a theoretically-derived Adaptive SenSor-Based&#xD;
      Intervention for Caregiver Self-ManagemenT (ASSIST) intervention compared to an attention&#xD;
      control condition for first time caregivers of CCI patients discharged to an extended care&#xD;
      facility. One group will be exposed to the ASSIST intervention and will wear the sensor-based&#xD;
      technology for 30 days and receive a daily dose of MMT. Biophysical sensor data (blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart-rate variability, pedometry, and actigraphy) will be continuously acquired&#xD;
      and analyzed using anomaly detection and machine learning techniques to vary the dose&#xD;
      intensity (number of doses per day) of the two components of ASSIST adding a real-time,&#xD;
      adaptive feature to promote caregiver self-management. The other group will wear the&#xD;
      sensor-based technology for 30 days but will not receive the daily dose of MMT. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomly assign participants to each group.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the ASSIST&#xD;
      intervention compared to an attention control condition among 20 first time caregivers of CCI&#xD;
      patients discharged to an extended care facility. The investigators will collect mixed&#xD;
      methods data at baseline (T1) on Day 15 (T2) and Day 30 (T3) after subject enrollment to&#xD;
      describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. We have chosen our time points to capture&#xD;
      neural and behavioral changes associated with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether there are differences in the distal outcomes [psychological burden&#xD;
           (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular health (BP and HRV) and&#xD;
           economic costs] between subjects who were exposed to ASSIST compared to those exposed to&#xD;
           the attention control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine whether decentering, self-efficacy, decision-making, motivation, caregiver&#xD;
           activation, and perceived stress mediate the relationship between exposure to a&#xD;
           self-management condition (ASSIST vs. attention control) and the proximal&#xD;
           (self-management) outcomes (stress reduction behaviors, sleep hygiene behaviors, and&#xD;
           physical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if social support and demographics (gender and age) moderate the proximal&#xD;
           outcomes [emotional distress, sleep quality, and physical activity] or distal outcomes&#xD;
           [psychological burden (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular&#xD;
           health (BP and HRV) and economic costs].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the differences in brain activation (structural and fMRI scans) and HPA function&#xD;
           and stress response (hair cortisol, inflammation panel) between subjects exposed to&#xD;
           ASSIST compared to those exposed to the attention control condition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Our model posits that effective caregiver self-management depends on analytic and emotional processing. The investigators hypothesize the ASSIST intervention will improve analytic processing by improving self-monitoring. ASSIST will expose subjects to mindfulness meditation training and promote self-awareness, which will aid the regulation of their emotional processing and improve proximal outcomes. The investigators expect proximal self-management outcomes to influence the distal outcomes of caregiver health. Our model will also test the mediating effects of decentering, processing, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), inflammatory stress response, and cognitive mediators. The influence of potential moderators will be assessed for their effect on the relationship between the self-management intervention and the proximal and distal outcomes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ASSIST intervention will deliver daily doses of MMT and vary dose intensity of all components each day based on the subject's biophysical data. Across a 30-day period, the ASSIST intervention will capture and analyze data to deliver on-demand MMT, guided practices to promote sleep hygiene and physical activity. Each day, subjects will receive at least one prompt to practice MMT (about 5 minutes at a time). However, based on the subject's biophysical sensor data, subjects could receive a maximum of 5 alerts or prompts per day from the device to enhance stress reduction, sleep hygiene, or physical activity.</description>

    <description>This intervention exposes subjects to the wearable technology without the self-management components to minimize novelty effects. Subjects assigned to this condition will wear the device for 30 days, which offers them an opportunity to experientially learn to self-monitor and employ self-regulatory skills by viewing the display biophysical data. Subjects in this condition will not receive any prompts from the device.</description>
