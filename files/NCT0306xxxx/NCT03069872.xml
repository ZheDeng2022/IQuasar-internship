      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer (OC) is a disease with a poor prognosis due to diagnosis at late stage.&#xD;
      Early-stage OC presents with non-specific and vague symptoms and therefore OC usually is not&#xD;
      detected until reaching an advanced stage. From 2008, Danish general practitioners (GPs)&#xD;
      could urgently refer patients suspected of having OC to standardized cancer patient pathways&#xD;
      (CPPs). The CPP is designed for women presenting specific signs and alarm symptoms, and is&#xD;
      supposed to shorten the pathway from suspicion to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to fast transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) through general practice is feasible in&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis of OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the implementation and clinical implications of direct&#xD;
      referral access to fast TVU through general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a feasibility study and GPs from in Central Denmark Region are offered direct&#xD;
      access to fast TVU for women aged 40 years or more who present symptoms that could origin&#xD;
      from OC, but which are not classified as alarm symptoms. The GPs will receive education about&#xD;
      updated knowledge on OC symptoms and the use of the guideline for earlier diagnosis of OC in&#xD;
      general practice. The study period is 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a great need to test rational strategies for diagnosing OC at an earlier stage in&#xD;
      order to improve survival. For women who do not fulfil access criteria for the CPP, and for&#xD;
      whom the main prospect for earlier diagnosis is improved identification of symptomatic OC,&#xD;
      this study may provide important new knowledge of how to facilitate the diagnostics of OC in&#xD;
      the future and reduce time to diagnosis and improve survival.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 550 ovarian cancers (OCs) are diagnosed yearly in Denmark. Still, OC is the fourth&#xD;
      commonest cause of cancer death amongst women in Denmark. Epithelial ovarian cancers&#xD;
      (carcinomas) account for more than 90% of all OCs and Denmark has the second highest&#xD;
      incidence in the world (15 per 100.000 women) with a life-time risk around 2%. The mean age&#xD;
      at diagnosis is 63 years, and 80% are postmenopausal. In Denmark, 74% are diagnosed in FIGO&#xD;
      stage III-IV and therefore at the time of diagnosis have regional or metastatic spread.&#xD;
      Five-year survival with FIGO stage I is 83%, stage II 62%, stage III 23% and stage IV 11%.&#xD;
      Thus, OC is detected at advanced stages with a very poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, a national fast-track system for cancer patients was established to ensure fast&#xD;
      diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The fast-track system or cancer patient pathway (CPP)&#xD;
      implies that patients presenting 'alarm' symptoms of e.g. OC will be referred immediately for&#xD;
      diagnostic workup; no more than 14 days must pass from referral to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
      Only about one quarter of the women with OC are referred primarily through this route.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional accelerated routes are needed for the majority of women with OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possibility could be access to fast TVU through general practice for women presenting with&#xD;
      vague and non-specific symptoms that may represent underlying OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop and conduct training for general practitioners (GPs) in the latest knowledge of OC&#xD;
      symptomatology. And at the same time investigate the feasibility and clinical implications in&#xD;
      general practice of direct referral access to fast TVU, intended for women presenting with&#xD;
      vague and non-specific symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs in Central Denmark Region are offered direct access to fast TVU for women aged 40 years&#xD;
      or more who present vague and non-specific symptoms that could origin from OC, but which are&#xD;
      not classified as alarm symptoms. Shortly afterwards all the GPs are offered a short lecture&#xD;
      on OC symptomatology and instructions for the use of TVU for earlier diagnosis of OC through&#xD;
      general practice. The lecture will be conducted by researchers from the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to investigation, all women who are referred to TVU will receive a consent form and a&#xD;
      symptom-questionnaire. The symptom questionnaire focuses on the experienced symptoms during&#xD;
      the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finished investigation, the TVU test results will return electronically to the&#xD;
      referring GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period is one year. Data analysis will focus on the frequency of TVU use in general&#xD;
      practice, action taken on test results and patient-reported symptoms prior to TVU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will provide important new knowledge of the GPs referral practice when they&#xD;
      suspect OC. For women presenting with vague and non-specific symptoms that may origin from&#xD;
      OC, the introduction of TVU through general practice will provide new possibilities for&#xD;
      evaluating the symptoms. Therefor introduction of TVU is a corner stone in the identification&#xD;
      of more efficient ways to evaluate women at risk of developing OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute with important knowledge of how to improve the diagnostics of OC&#xD;
      in the future and may reduce time to diagnosis.&#xD;
