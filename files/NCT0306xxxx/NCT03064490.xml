    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, prospective phase II trial with an initial safety run-in to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      and adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced esophageal and gastric cancers&#xD;
      (EGC). Chemoradiation therapy (45Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent, weekly carboplatin [AUC&#xD;
      2] and paclitaxel [50mg/m2 of BSA]) with three cycles of pembrolizumab will be administered&#xD;
      as neoadjuvant therapy. These patients will also receive three cycles of adjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab after surgical resection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will receive three doses of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered&#xD;
      as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks). The first dose of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be administered approximately 14 days prior to initiating radiotherapy. The second dose&#xD;
      will be administered three weeks later (week 1 of chemoradiation). The third dose will be&#xD;
      administered 3 weeks later (week 4 of chemoradiotherapy). Pembrolizumab will be given every 3&#xD;
      weeks and may be given at the same time as systemic therapy. All patients will receive&#xD;
      radiation treatment (45Gy in 25 fractions at 1.8 Gy/fraction) using image-guided radiation&#xD;
      therapy with concurrent, weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50mg/m2 of BSA).&#xD;
      Restaging will be performed per standard of care approximately 4-8 weeks after completing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Resection will be performed approximately 6-12 weeks after completing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy per standard of care. Postoperatively, three additional cycles of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered as adjuvant therapy.&#xD;

    <description>A two-stage design will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true pCR rate is ≤ 0.30 against the alternative hypothesis that the true pCR rate is ≥ 0.50. This design will allow the trial to stop early to accept the null hypothesis. If there are no more than 4 responders (27%) in the first 15 evaluable patients, the trial will stop to accept the null. Otherwise, an additional 15 evaluable patients will be accrued.</description>

    <measure>Safety of the combined drug therapy with radiation therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity by type and grade will be tabulated. Toxicity rates of interest will be calculated with their 80% confidence intervals. After the first 5 subjects have been accrued, an analysis will be performed to assess acute treatment-related toxicities. If more than 1, grade 3 or greater toxicities definitely related to concurrent pembrolizumab and radiotherapy are observed, then an additional five patients will be added to this treatment arm.If no issues concerning for safety are observed within 30 days of the last dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (cycle 3) for the fifth patient, then the study will continue to accrue.</description>
