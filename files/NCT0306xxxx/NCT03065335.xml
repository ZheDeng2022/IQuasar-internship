      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most medications that treat depression take weeks or months to work. Researchers want to&#xD;
      develop fast-acting treatments. One dose of ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect. For&#xD;
      most people, this lasts a week or less. Repeated doses of ketamine may help maintain this&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study: To study the effects of ketamine in treating depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine Metabolites Substudy: To study how ketamine effects brain chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how ketamine effects the brain. This is done by looking at metabolites, which are&#xD;
      created when a drug is broken down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study: People ages 18-65 with major depressive disorder and healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine Metabolites Substudy: Healthy volunteers ages 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in another study, with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and psychiatric history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be inpatients at NIH for 4 phases totaling 14-20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (2-7 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gradually stop current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: Participants lie and perform tasks in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood and thinking tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep test: Monitors on the skin record brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and movement&#xD;
           during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A coil on the scalp gives an electrical current that&#xD;
           affects brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress tests: Electrodes on the skin measure reactions to loud noises or electric&#xD;
           shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I tests are repeated in Phases II and III and in the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (4-5 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 weekly IV infusions of ketamine or a placebo during an MRI or MEG. For the MEG, a cone&#xD;
           over the head records brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 infusions of ketamine over 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms monitoring for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final visit. They will be offered standard treatment at NIH for&#xD;
           up to 2 months.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol has a two-fold purpose. In the pharmacodynamic imaging phase, we will&#xD;
      investigate the neuropharmacodynamics of acute intravenous ketamine administration in&#xD;
      patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy volunteers (HV) using functional&#xD;
      MRI (fMRI) and electrophysiological modalities [electroencephalography (EEG) and&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG)]. We will also investigate if specific signatures from&#xD;
      functional neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) associated evoked potentials&#xD;
      (TMS-EP), sleep EEG (S-EEG), and psychophysiologic responses can be used to classify specific&#xD;
      subpopulations of patients with MDD; preliminary findings from such an approach may be&#xD;
      important in forging further studies identifying those who will respond to ketamine&#xD;
      infusions. In the repeat-dosing phase, we will expand upon our previous findings of the&#xD;
      immediate efficacy of glutamatergic modulators by investigating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      repeated dose administrations of ketamine in MDD patients. We will include all MDD patients&#xD;
      regardless of antidepressant response to single infusions of ketamine to allow for potential&#xD;
      identification of patients who are able to attain and/or maintain a response over a series of&#xD;
      infusions. To reduce any potential biases due to partial blinding, all patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into groups to receive ketamine at either 0.5 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg (an active&#xD;
      comparator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 50 patients with treatment-resistant MDD between 18 and 65 years old&#xD;
      and 50 age/gender matched HVs. Within the MDD group, 25 patients will be enrolled into each&#xD;
      group in the repeat-dosing phase. An addition 50 HVs will participate in the Ketamine&#xD;
      Metabolites Substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase I Clinical Trial that comprises four phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I includes screening, medication taper (as needed), medication-free period, and&#xD;
      baseline assessments, including optional TMS-EP, S-EEG, the None, Predictive, Unpredictive&#xD;
      (NPU)-threat test, non-brain imaging cognitive tasks, and blood samples for plasma&#xD;
      neurochemicals and peripheral blood biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, all subjects will receive an alternating series of placebo and ketamine&#xD;
      infusions, once per week, for a total of 4 infusions (2 ketamine, 2 placebo). Concurrently&#xD;
      with each infusion, subjects will be administered either resting-state fMRI with simultaneous&#xD;
      EEG, or resting state MEG recording, thus each subject receives fMRI+EEG and MEG for both a&#xD;
      placebo and ketamine infusion. Participants may also undergo optional sEEG, non-brain imaging&#xD;
      cognitive tasks, TMS-EP, and NPU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III involves MDD patients whose depression symptoms relapsed after the final infusion&#xD;
      in Phase II. Patients whose symptoms did not relapse may receive an additional one-week&#xD;
      washout. Subjects will be randomized to receive ketamine at 0.5 or 0.1 mg/kg twice weekly for&#xD;
      4 weeks (total of 8 infusions). Participants may undergo optional fMRI, S-EEG, non-brain&#xD;
      imaging cognitive tasks, TMS-EP, and NPU at time points between infusions. Clinical rating&#xD;
      scales will assess depression symptomology and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      testing and biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV includes patients who completed Phase III and who are responders. These patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks, or until relapse, to determine durability of&#xD;
      response. The final study day will include rating scales, medical evaluations, blood tests,&#xD;
      and an additional sMRI to assess structural changes that may have occurred due to repeated&#xD;
      ketamine infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes a substudy evaluating ketamine metabolites in (Ketamine Metabolites&#xD;
      Substudy). Only HVs will be enrolled in this substudy. Subjects will undergo a single&#xD;
      infusion of ketamine concurrently with serial peripheral blood collection. Some participants&#xD;
      may also undergo serial CSF collection during the ketamine infusion. Clinical rating scales,&#xD;
      cognitive tasks, MEG, S-EEG, CSF and/or blood draws for pharmacokinetics testing and&#xD;
      biomarker analyses will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of Phase II is the pharmacodynamic fMRI and MEG responses to&#xD;
      ketamine compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures include the difference in&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 24 hours between the&#xD;
      placebo and ketamine infusion, correlations between an antidepressant response and TMS-EP,&#xD;
      S-EEG, neuroimaging, cognitive, and NPU measures. In Phase II, the HVs acts as another level&#xD;
      of control to identify a potential neuropharmacodynamic signature associated with an&#xD;
      antidepressant response to ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for Phase III is the difference or change in MADRS from baseline&#xD;
      to the end of 4 weeks of twice-weekly infusions. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      cognitive, TMS-EP, S-EEG, and NPU-threat test measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures for both Phase II and III include clinical rating scales,&#xD;
      neurocognitive tests, ketamine levels, plasma neurochemicals, and peripheral blood&#xD;
      biomarkers. Additional outcomes in Phase III are baseline and post-repeated dose infusion MRI&#xD;
      scans, and neurocognitive test results. Rating scales are the outcomes measures of Phase IV.&#xD;
      Subjects will continue Phase IV for 4 weeks or until relapse.&#xD;
