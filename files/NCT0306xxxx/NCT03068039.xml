  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breakfast porridges made from milled grains are commonly eaten worldwide. Traditionally&#xD;
      different grains are used in different countries. For example, oats are more common in the&#xD;
      Anglo-Saxon countries whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. However the&#xD;
      nutritional value of different grains and their potential effects on the body may vary&#xD;
      dramatically: for example the effect on blood sugar, on how fast the stomach empties after&#xD;
      eating and how full people may feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION: The investigators think that a pearl millet breakfast will cause a smaller&#xD;
      rise in blood sugar compared with an oat breakfast containing the same number of calories.&#xD;
      The investigators also think that there will be a difference in how full people feel and how&#xD;
      fast their stomach will empty. These 2 breakfasts will be fed to each one of 26 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, one week apart. A safe medical imaging method (MRI) will be used to look at how&#xD;
      quickly the breakfast empty from the stomach and how this affects the small bowel. Blood&#xD;
      glucose levels will be measured using a finger prick test (the same as used by diabetics) and&#xD;
      some small blood samples will be taken from a vein in the arm to measure the chemicals&#xD;
      released by the gut after feeding gut hormones.&#xD;

      Background: Porridge breakfasts from various grains are a staple source of energy for many&#xD;
      populations worldwide. The grains used in the porridges differ between regions, mostly due to&#xD;
      the crops historically grown. For example, oats are more common in the Anglo-Saxon countries&#xD;
      whilst millet is very common in parts of India and Africa. Consumption of whole grains has&#xD;
      been associated with a variety of health benefits ranging from lower blood glucose levels,&#xD;
      improved insulin responses, reduced cholesterol and increased diversity of the microbiota. Of&#xD;
      particular interest to this study are recent suggestions that different grains, and&#xD;
      particularly millet grains, may have enhanced health benefits on glucose and insulin&#xD;
      metabolism. This may be due to different rates of digestion and absorption, for example,&#xD;
      because of grain specific differences in starch digestibility. This could affect gastric&#xD;
      emptying and, in turn, post prandial glycaemia and impact on satiety. However little is known&#xD;
      about possible differences in gastric emptying between breakfast porridges from different&#xD;
      grains and possible relationship with glucose, insulin and appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group in Nottingham has world-leading expertise in imaging foods in the body and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function using non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques&#xD;
      which are particularly well suited for this kind of investigations study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to collect data on postprandial glucose levels and hormone peptide response of&#xD;
           isoenergetic breakfast porridges made from oats and pearl millet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to collect data on their gastric emptying and satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare postprandial glucose levels, gastric emptying and satiety for the treatments&#xD;
           4. to explore relationships between glucose levels, gastric emptying and satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods: 26 healthy volunteers will participate in this 2-way&#xD;
      study. They will attend one morning for each study, with the studies separated by&#xD;
      approximately a week. Before the test meal, and after that approximately every 15 min for 2&#xD;
      hours the level of sugar (glucose) in their blood will be measured using the finger prick&#xD;
      method, as diabetics commonly do to monitor their blood sugars. Venous blood samples will&#xD;
      also be collected from a cannula placed in the forearm to measure gut hormones such as&#xD;
      Peptide YY, GIP, GLP-1 and insulin. The subjects will be scanned on a research dedicated 1.5T&#xD;
      MRI scanner. The subjects will be scanned at baseline, immediately after the test meal and&#xD;
      then every 30 minutes for 2 hours postprandially. At baseline and every time the subjects&#xD;
      come out of the MRI scanner they will be asaked to rate their feelings of fullness, hunger&#xD;
      and appetite on 100mm VAS scales. Each subject will be fed two isoenergetic breakfast meals&#xD;
      -one on each visit: Oat and Pearl millet breakfast porridge sourced from supermarkets or food&#xD;
      manufacturers. These will be cooked in water to avoid confounding factor with milk. The test&#xD;
      breakfast will have 220 kcal (slightly higher than a commonly recommended average portion of&#xD;
      ~185 kcal). After this the subjects will be asked to eat as much of a pasta meal as they wish&#xD;
      and note how much they have eaten as an objective measure of food consumption. The subjects&#xD;
      will also complete a food diary for the rest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable endpoints/ statistical power Primary endpoint: Incremental Area Under the Curve of&#xD;
      post prandial blood glucose up to 2h (AUC2h) Secondary endpoints: Area Under the Curve of&#xD;
      post prandial gastric volumes up to 2h (AUC2h), postprandial hormone peptide response,&#xD;
      insulin and post prandial VAS scores up to 2h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and exploratory measurements: Time to Peak of blood glucose; Area Under the Curve&#xD;
      for appetite (Fullness, Hunger, Prospective food consumption) up to 2h. The amount of pasta&#xD;
      meal eaten ad libitum. Energy intake for the day from food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between blood, MRI and satiety data. Using Satiety data (Hunger) from our pilot&#xD;
      study, we can calculate sample size needed using a crossover, paired design with alpha=0.05&#xD;
      and a power of 80% using n=26 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and other such methods as&#xD;
      appropriate. Where normally distributed, endpoints will be assessed using parametric methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T test (primary endpoint) and AUC2h (secondary endpoints). T test of Time to Peak.&#xD;
      Correlation (Pearson's or Spearman) between blood glucose, MRI and satiety data.&#xD;
