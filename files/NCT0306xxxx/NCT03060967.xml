  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a frequent psychiatric disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      16-17% in the general population. Although its pathophysiology is not completely understood,&#xD;
      a large body of literature pleads for a causative role of disturbances in reward processes,&#xD;
      referring to: i) the hedonic sensation (i.e. &quot;liking&quot;) defined by the pleasure felt after&#xD;
      exposure to appetitive stimuli, and ii) the motivation (i.e. &quot;wanting&quot;) represented by the&#xD;
      ability to initiate and maintain behavioral responses oriented toward appetitive stimuli. the&#xD;
      investigators have therefore developed and tested a new experimental computer-based and&#xD;
      easy-to-use test intended to provide an objective and quantitative measurement of both&#xD;
      hedonic and motivational states in humans. According to the task, the subjects are asked to&#xD;
      view and to compare two stimuli, an appetitive one (food pictures) and its devalued&#xD;
      counterpart (food pictures in greyscale), at each trial, assessing either the size (task A)&#xD;
      or the duration of presentation (task B). From these considerations, the present project aims&#xD;
      at using our novel tool to: i) assess the hedonic and motivational state in subjects with&#xD;
      major depression, ii) compare their responses with healthy volunteers. The present project&#xD;
      should demonstrate that the behavioral tests validated in our laboratory are relevant&#xD;
      experimental tools for the diagnostic/clinical assessment and for the phenotypic&#xD;
      characterization of depressed patients. The application of the test in the therapeutic&#xD;
      context could add further information about the efficacy and relevance of the chosen therapy.&#xD;

      Major depression is a frequent psychiatric disorder with an estimated lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      16-17% in the general population. Although its pathophysiology is not completely understood,&#xD;
      a large body of literature pleads for a causative role of disturbances in reward processes,&#xD;
      referring to: i) the hedonic sensation (i.e. &quot;liking&quot;) defined by the pleasure felt after&#xD;
      exposure to appetitive stimuli, and ii) the motivation (i.e. &quot;wanting&quot;) represented by the&#xD;
      ability to initiate and maintain behavioral responses oriented toward appetitive stimuli.&#xD;
      Several methodological approaches have been used to study hedonic and motivational processes&#xD;
      in major depression. Some clinical investigations have tried to explore: i) taste&#xD;
      sensitivity, as reflective of hedonic reaction to food stimuli, and ii) time judgment, as&#xD;
      indicative of the degree of motivation, which is expected to be low when time is perceived&#xD;
      long. However, these studies suffer from serious limitations relied on the frequent&#xD;
      utilization of subjective assessment methods. Other authors have instead examined either: i)&#xD;
      the processing of emotional information using positive, negative, and neutral faces or words,&#xD;
      or ii) the processing of the motivational value of reinforcement, such as monetary cues.&#xD;
      These experimental paradigms when coupled with functional neuroimaging allow objectively&#xD;
      identifying the anatomo-functional correlates of the internal affective state. However,&#xD;
      limited availability and costly procedures characterize the use of functional neuroimaging.&#xD;
      the investigators have therefore developed and tested a new experimental computer-based and&#xD;
      easy-to-use test intended to provide an objective, implicit and quantitative measurement of&#xD;
      both hedonic and motivational states in humans. According to the task, the subjects are asked&#xD;
      to view and to compare two stimuli, an appetitive one (food pictures; F) and its devalued&#xD;
      counterpart (food pictures in greyscale; D), at each trial, assessing either the size (task&#xD;
      A) or the duration of presentation (task B). Geometric figures are used as controls and&#xD;
      presented in color (C) or greyscale (D) (1). Both tasks are registered under the French&#xD;
      agency for the protection of computer software. Here, the investigators propose to use our&#xD;
      novel test to: i) assess the hedonic and motivational state in subjects suffering from major&#xD;
      depression ii) compare their responses with healthy volunteers. Responses to the test in&#xD;
      depressed patients will be evaluated during two separate experimental sessions under either&#xD;
      fasting or satiety conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is expected to begin in February 2017 for a total duration of 36&#xD;
      consecutive months. A sample of 36 patients suffering from major depression will be recruited&#xD;
      and compared with 36 healthy normal volunteers. They will be matched on age and sex. During&#xD;
      the inclusion visit, information about the study design will be delivered before the written&#xD;
      inform consent is collected. Thereafter, the subjects will be screened using the &quot;Association&#xD;
      pour la Méthodologie et la Documentation en Psychiatrie&quot; (AMDP) questionnaire, the&#xD;
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire for&#xD;
      the anamnestic, diagnostic and psychometric (eating behavior) evaluations, respectively.&#xD;
      Dietary habits will be recorded with a specific and appropriate instrument used in the&#xD;
      National Program Nutrition Health.This will be associated to the assessment of: i) depressive&#xD;
      and anxiety symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      severity with the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Brief Anxiety Scale, and&#xD;
      overall functioning with the Global Assessment of Functioning scale in depressed patients;&#xD;
      and, ii) neuropsychological functions including cognitive flexibility/psychomotor speed with&#xD;
      the Trail making Test (A-B) and visuospatial memory with the Rey-Osterreich Figure Test. To&#xD;
      ensure that subjects are familiar with the experimental procedure, the tasks A and B will be&#xD;
      explained and the first 5-10 trials will be performed. Two separate experimental sessions&#xD;
      will then be conducted, one in satiety and the other after a 6-hour fasting from the&#xD;
      breakfast, 3-4 days apart. During each session, the participants will be asked to perform the&#xD;
      two validated instrumental tasks in front the screen of a computer. Visual analogue scales&#xD;
      (VAS) assessing hunger levels will be completed before each task is performed. A VAS will be&#xD;
      also used for the global assessment of appetitive properties of the viewed food images just&#xD;
      before the end of the second experimental session. This procedure is adopted to avoid giving&#xD;
      to the subject specific information about the exact objectives of the study and therefore to&#xD;
      potentially limit biased responses to food images.&#xD;
