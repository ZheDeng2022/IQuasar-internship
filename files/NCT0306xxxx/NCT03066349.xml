  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (IVF / ICSI) often experience an impact on their quality of life and emotional maladjustment&#xD;
      to treatment and outcome. Multiple contributors to this negative impact have been identified,&#xD;
      including interference with professional activities, expenses related to fertility treatment&#xD;
      and hormonal side effects. In-vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes obtained from minimally&#xD;
      stimulated or unstimulated ovaries offers a more &quot;patient friendly&quot; treatment option than the&#xD;
      conventional ovarian stimulation protocols for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)&#xD;
      treatment. Historically, IVM has been offered to women with increased ovarian response&#xD;
      (so-called &quot;high responders&quot;), typically women with polycystic ovaries (PCO/PCOS), who are at&#xD;
      increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) if conventional ART protocols are&#xD;
      used. IVM treatment programs are characterised by a minimal administration of fertility&#xD;
      hormones, are less disruptive to patients' daily life through a reduced need for hormonal and&#xD;
      ultrasound monitoring, avoid a range of minor and major complications because of the reduced&#xD;
      hormonal burden of this procedure, and aim to reduce the total cost for of infertility&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate the application of IVM as a treatment that can potentially improve the overall&#xD;
      patient experience, a study comparing the psychological impact of a conventional ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation protocol versus an IVM protocol will be conducted; furthermore, a study&#xD;
      investigating the differences in quality of life between the two subgroups will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data, medical characteristics and the following questionnaires will be&#xD;
      collected: Specific questions for patients with fertility problems (FertiQol); Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and an instrument to measure side effects designed by the&#xD;
      research group. The study group (IVF patients and IVM patients) will be evaluated at three&#xD;
      predefined time points: at intake, after oocyte collection and when the outcome after the&#xD;
      first embryo transfer is known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis, intergroup comparisons and explanatory/predictive model of the&#xD;
      dependent variables (quality of life, emotional adjustment) will be performed.&#xD;
