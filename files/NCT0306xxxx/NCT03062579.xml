  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a severe inflammatory disease of the&#xD;
      central nervous system characterized by relapsing optic neuritis and longitudinal extensive&#xD;
      transverse myelitis. The specific autoantibody against aquaporin 4 (AQP4-ab) has been&#xD;
      suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Peripheral blood plasma cells are&#xD;
      a major source of AQP4-ab. Previous studies have observed increased IL-6 levels in serum and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid of patients with NMOSD, particularly during relapses. Exogenous&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-6 promotes the survival of plasma cells and their production of AQP4-ab in&#xD;
      vitro. And blockade of IL-6 receptor signaling by an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody reduces the&#xD;
      survival of plasma cells in vitro. Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®), a humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against the IL-6 receptor, has shown beneficial clinical effects in some patients with NMOSD&#xD;
      when concomitant immunosuppressive medications were administered. However, the long-lasting&#xD;
      biological effects of preceding immunotherapies such as rituximab might overlap with the&#xD;
      subsequent tocilizumab therapy. To reduce the side effects of concomitant treatments to large&#xD;
      extent and verify the beneficial effects of tocilizumab, we evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of tocilizumab as monotherapy in patients with NMOSD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug tocilizumab as monotherapy contributes&#xD;
      to reduce the average relapsing rate (ARR) and improve neurological disability in NMOSD&#xD;
      patients, who still have experienced relapses when common immunosuppressive medications&#xD;
      including rituximab had been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine: Whether bortezomib&#xD;
      reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO. The number of attacks during the&#xD;
      one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that occurred prior to&#xD;
      initiation of tocilizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of tocilizumab in patients with NMO and whether tocilizumab improves&#xD;
      walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established&#xD;
      disability scales.&#xD;

    <measure>Neurological Disability - Expanded Disability Scale Score (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic exam; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death.</description>

    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk test is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. If required, the subject may use an appropriate assistive device to walk as quickly as he/she can from one end to the other end of a clearly marked, unobstructed, 25-foot course.</description>
