  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if the insertion of a peripheral Internal&#xD;
      Jugular (IJ) catheter is faster than a standard of care intravenous (IV)access in patients&#xD;
      with difficult access. The secondary aims of this study examine patient discomfort between&#xD;
      standard IV insertion vs. peripheral IV insertion as well as a comparison of complication&#xD;
      rates between the two methods of insertion. Support for the peripheral IV procedure could&#xD;
      provide an option for the thousands of Emergency Department (ED) patients who daily encounter&#xD;
      the situation of difficult IV access and the numerous needle pokes that accompany it. Using&#xD;
      this procedure may result in greater patient satisfaction and reduced complication rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control trial comparing peripheral IJ to standard care of difficult&#xD;
      access patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be identified by nurses as having difficult IV access. This can be&#xD;
           determined based on past history or immediate experience. In other words, while a nurse&#xD;
           is caring for a patient, s/he might notice that the patient looks to have difficult&#xD;
           veins for an IV and may ask the patient 'Are you a hard stick?'. On the other hand, the&#xD;
           nurse may fail at a number of attempts at placing an IV. In both of the cases, the&#xD;
           patients can be determined to have difficult access and the nurse will have the option&#xD;
           to contact the research assistant or continue with current attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nurse will contact research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research assistant (RA) will determine if the patient is being cared for by an MD with&#xD;
           appropriate experience for placing the peripheral IJ (attending, second or third year ED&#xD;
           resident).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RA will consent patient, discussing possible continuation of IV or IJ catheter&#xD;
           insertion. If patient agrees, he/she will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time clock will be started by RA when nurse or study member (attending physician, second&#xD;
           or third year resident) start the procedure (IV or IJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. RA will monitor procedure progress and stop time clock when access has been confirmed by&#xD;
           study member or by nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. RA will survey patient regarding pain during procedure and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient chart will be queried at the completion of ED visit or hospitalization for&#xD;
           complications. Chart will be queried again at two weeks to evaluate for any return visit&#xD;
           complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheters will be placed by attending physicians and residents (2nd and 3rd years) with&#xD;
      experience placing ultrasound guided internal jugular central venous catheters. Because the&#xD;
      procedure is identical to the first step of placing an IJ Central Venous Catheter, there is&#xD;
      no special training needed for the procedure itself. A video will be created and viewed by&#xD;
      all placing the catheters to show the specifics so that there is standardization between&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to place the peripheral IJ will be limited to two. If not successful after two&#xD;
      attempts, the patient will return to 'standard care' and the treatment team will decide on&#xD;
      further directions such as ultrasound guided peripheral IV or central venous line.&#xD;
