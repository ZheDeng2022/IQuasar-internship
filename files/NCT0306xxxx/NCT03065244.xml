  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limited illness that affects the heart blood vessels&#xD;
      (coronary arteries) of infants and children and is now the most common cause of acquired&#xD;
      heart disease in children. A mixture of proteins from human blood (Intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, IVIG) is a treatment that reduces the rate of the major complication of the&#xD;
      disease: a bulging of the wall of the coronary arteries called an aneurysm. However, 10-20%&#xD;
      of children are resistant to this treatment and the fever returns. These children have the&#xD;
      highest rates of aneurysm formation and thus should be treated aggressively. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there are no guidelines for the best secondary treatment for these resistant patients because&#xD;
      the problem has never been adequately studied. Most physicians choose either a second&#xD;
      infusion of IVIG or an engineered antibody called infliximab that inactivates a molecule that&#xD;
      promotes inflammation. This trial will randomize (assign by chance like the flip of a coin)&#xD;
      IVIG-resistant patients to receive either a second IVIG infusion or infliximab and the&#xD;
      response to treatment will be compared to learn which treatment stops the fever the fastest.&#xD;
      In addition, parents and caregivers will provide observations about their child's response to&#xD;
      the different treatments.&#xD;

      This is a 3-year (2.75-years of enrollment), Phase III, two-arm, randomized, multi-center,&#xD;
      superiority treatment study to compare infliximab to a second intravenous immunoglobulin&#xD;
      (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent fever in children with KD who&#xD;
      fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that infliximab will be superior to a second&#xD;
           intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion for treatment of persistent or recrudescent&#xD;
           fever in children with KD who fail to become afebrile after the first IVIG infusion&#xD;
           (resistant KD). Cessation of fever (&lt;38°C rectally or orally) within 24h of initiation&#xD;
           of study treatment infusion will be the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in more&#xD;
           rapid resolution of inflammation compared to second IVIG as measured by the change in&#xD;
           white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and high-sensitivity&#xD;
           C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration between baseline and 24 hours and 2 weeks&#xD;
           following study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that infliximab treatment will result in a&#xD;
           reduction from baseline in coronary artery Zworst score of ≥ 0.05 standard deviation&#xD;
           units as compared to second IVIG at 2 weeks following study treatment measured by&#xD;
           echocardiography.&#xD;
