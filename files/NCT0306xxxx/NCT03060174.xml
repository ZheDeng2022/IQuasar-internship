  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction describes a condition where cognitive functions such as&#xD;
      attention, perception, concentration, learning, abstract thinking and problem solving are&#xD;
      impaired postoperatively. These changes can be resolved after weeks and months, but in some&#xD;
      cases may be permanent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology is multifactorial. One risk factor for developing POCD is the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 638 consecutive patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      up at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. The cognitive function will be tested and&#xD;
      compared to tests done before surgery. Postoperatively (from the day of operation until the&#xD;
      7th day and except of day 6) the grade of sedation; agitation; signs of delirium; pain;&#xD;
      cardiac; respiratory; renal and infectious complications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As possible influencing factors, the investigators will document diagnosed depression;&#xD;
      comorbidities; intraoperative blood loss; length of hospital stay; 1-year-mortality; number&#xD;
      of operations/anaesthetics undergone after the initial operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters that could trigger either depressive symptoms, neurocognitive dysfunction,&#xD;
      anxiety, fatigue or lack of concentration will be recorded. These include: anaemia,&#xD;
      hypercalcaemia, thyroidal gland hormones, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate, cortisone therapy and adrenal cortical insufficiency.&#xD;

      The methods include a neuropsychological test battery: TAP 2.3 (attention), Trail Making Test&#xD;
      (TMT )A+B (attention), Digit span (memory), (Visual Learning and Memory Test (VLMT) (memory),&#xD;
      Regensburgerwortfluessigkeitstest/fluency (RWT) subtests (executive function),&#xD;
      Mehrfach-Wortschatz-Intelligenztest/vocabulary (MWT-B) (premorbid IQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures are Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) (depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      anxiety), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 2 (dementia), Confusion Assessment Method&#xD;
      (CAM-ICU) (delirium), Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) (sedation and agitation),&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (pain) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) (health related&#xD;
      quality of life).&#xD;
