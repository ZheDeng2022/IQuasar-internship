      ECS is a very common procedure. A 1-year retrospective survey revealed a vast opioid&#xD;
      consumption among the new mothers of approximately (mean±SD) 35±25 mg of oral morphine in the&#xD;
      first 24 postoperative hours despite a multimodal analgesic regimen. The adverse effects of&#xD;
      morphine are well known and include postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), itching,&#xD;
      fatigue, constipation, confusion, respiratory depression and delayed mobilization. These&#xD;
      adverse effects are unsound for the new mothers as well as the breast-fed, newborn children.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum (TQL)&#xD;
      block in reducing postoperative morphine consumption and pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year two hundred and twenty patients undergo elective caesarean section (CS) at the&#xD;
      department of obstetric and gynaecologic surgery at Zealand University Hospital. The vast&#xD;
      majority of these patients undergo the surgical procedure under spinal (subarachnoid)&#xD;
      anaesthesia with Bupivacaine with the additive Sufentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many ways to perform a caesarean section. The techniques can vary, regarding the&#xD;
      type of skin incision, how the abdominal wall is dissected, how the uterine incision is made,&#xD;
      and finally in which layers are closed after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two common transverse skin incisions are the Pfannenstiels incision and the Joel-Cohen&#xD;
      incision. The Pfannenstiels incision is made 2 to 3 cm cephalad to the pubic bone, slightly&#xD;
      curved so the midportion of the incision is within the shaved area of the pubic hair. The&#xD;
      Joel-Cohen incision is placed 3 cm caudad to the anterior intercristal line; i.e. slightly&#xD;
      more cephalad than the Pfannenstiels incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Pfannenstiels incision is utilized, the subcutaneous layer, fascia and the parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum are usually dissected sharply, whereas with the Joel-Cohen incision, the&#xD;
      subcutaneous layer is only incised medially, followed by a manual separation of the lateral&#xD;
      tissue. The fascia and peritoneum are dissected bluntly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Zealand University Hospital, the skin incision used for elective caesarean sections is the&#xD;
      Joel-Cohen incision. A straight, transverse, 12 cm long incision is made through the&#xD;
      cutaneous layer as described above. The subcutaneous layer is incised only in the most medial&#xD;
      area, through which two small incisions are made on each side of the midline of the fascia.&#xD;
      These incisions in the fascia are then extended laterally with a scissor. The linea alba and&#xD;
      parietal peritoneum are opened bluntly with the fingers. Finally, all the layers of the&#xD;
      abdominal wall are pulled apart at the angles of the incisions, opening the incision&#xD;
      laterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory nerve supply to the abdominal wall below the umbilicus consists of the anterior&#xD;
      cutaneous rami of the 11th intercostal nerve, the subcostal nerve (T12), the iliohypogastric&#xD;
      nerve (T12, L1) and the ilioinguinal nerve (L1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the intercostal space, the 11th intercostal nerve runs behind the costal cartilage and&#xD;
      enters into the neurovascular plane between the internal oblique- and the transverse&#xD;
      abdominis muscles. Just lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle, the nerve perforates the&#xD;
      dorsal sheath of the rectus muscle and continues through the rectus muscle to end as an&#xD;
      anterior cutaneous branch of the abdominal wall just below the umbilicus. The subcostal nerve&#xD;
      passes under the lateral arcuate ligament, runs in front of the quadratus lumborum muscle and&#xD;
      then perforates the transverse abdominis muscle to enter the neurovascular plane. Here the&#xD;
      subcostal nerve divides into an anterior and a lateral branch, where the anterior branch&#xD;
      innervates the skin in the hypogastrium. The iliohypogastric nerve emerges from the lateral&#xD;
      border of the psoas major muscle and runs in front of the quadratus lumborum muscle behind&#xD;
      the kidney. The nerve perforates the transverse abdominis muscle near the iliac crest and&#xD;
      enters into the neurovascular plane between the transverse abdominis and internal oblique&#xD;
      muscle where it divides into a lateral and an anterior cutaneous branch. The lateral branch&#xD;
      innervates the skin of the gluteal region, whereas the anterior branch perforates the&#xD;
      internal oblique muscle, runs between the internal and external oblique muscle until it&#xD;
      perforates the external oblique muscle 2-3 cm cranial to the subcutaneous inguinal ring and&#xD;
      ends as an anterior cutaneous branch to the skin of the hypogastric region. The ilioinguinal&#xD;
      nerve initially follows the iliohypogastric nerve, just caudad to it, and sometimes&#xD;
      communicating with it in a common nerve. After perforating the internal oblique muscle, it&#xD;
      runs through the superficial inguinal ring and innervates the skin over mons pubis, labia&#xD;
      majora and the upper and medial part of the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal cavity and is innervated by the same spinal&#xD;
      nerves as its corresponding region of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When entry to the abdominal cavity is achieved, an incision in the peritoneum covering the&#xD;
      bladder is made. A superficial, transverse incision is made in the midline of the lower&#xD;
      uterine segment. The rest of the muscular layers are dissected bluntly with a pean until&#xD;
      entering the uterine cavity where after the incision is expanded laterally by pulling in&#xD;
      cephalocaudal direction. The infant is delivered and placenta removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visceral peritoneum covers the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly. Like the parietal&#xD;
      peritoneum, it receives the same afferent nerve innervation as the organ it covers. On each&#xD;
      side of the uterus, the two peritoneal sheets meet and comprise the broad ligament. The&#xD;
      fallopian tubes run between the two sheets in the free edge of this ligament, where the&#xD;
      peritoneum folds. On each side of the fallopian tubes, the round ligament of the uterus and&#xD;
      the ovarian ligament arise anteriorly and posteriorly, respectively. Other ligaments that&#xD;
      support the uterus are the cardinal ligament that attaches the cervix to the lateral pelvic&#xD;
      wall, and the uterosacral ligament that extends backwards from the cervix to the front of the&#xD;
      sacrum. The ovaries are held in place by the ovarian ligament (to the uterus), the suspensory&#xD;
      ligament of the ovary (to the pelvic wall) and the mesovarium (to the broad ligament).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like most other viscera, the uterus is innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers,&#xD;
      as well as sensory nerve fibers. It is innervated by the uterovaginal plexus, which fibers&#xD;
      originate from the inferior hypogastric plexus. The inferior hypogastric plexus is paired,&#xD;
      with each half on each side of the rectum, cervix and the bladder and consists of sympathetic&#xD;
      as well as parasympathetic fibers. Pain from the body of the uterus is considered to run with&#xD;
      the sympathetic nerves. Afferent nerves supplying the uterus arise from T10 - T12 and L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fallopian tubes are also innervated by the uterovaginal plexus, as well as the ovarian&#xD;
      plexus. The ovaries have their afferent supply from the 10th intercostal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After fetal and placental extraction, the uterotomy is closed. Where possible, it is&#xD;
      recommended to close the uterus in-situ. The uterus is closed with a single-layer, continuous&#xD;
      closure. Marcain is sometimes administered subfascially where after the fascia is closed with&#xD;
      a continuous suture. Finally, the skin is closed with an intracutaneous suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) the patients are administered the multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia regimen currently consisting of oral Acetaminophen 1g, Ibuprofen 400 mg. and&#xD;
      Morphine 10 mg. The addition of oral Morphine 10 mg is not an international standard but has&#xD;
      been so far agreed on locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's research group at Zealand University Hospital has conducted a thorough&#xD;
      retrospective one-year survey for this patient group in order to define the quantity of the&#xD;
      research problem. The electronic anaesthesia files, PACU files and ward files were&#xD;
      meticulously reviewed. The survey revealed accumulated morphine consumptions in the first 24&#xD;
      postoperative hours of 35.7±25.0 mg of oral morphine equivalents in CS patients. This dosage&#xD;
      should be evaluated in relation to the standardised multimodal regimen described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesiologists have primarily used either epidural catheters or long-lasting opioids as&#xD;
      the basis for the postoperative pain management of expected or manifest moderate to severe&#xD;
      pain. An epidural blockade can be contraindicated for some patients, and might cause bladder&#xD;
      paralysis, lower extremity paralysis, hypotension etc. Also, the epidural technique is&#xD;
      labour-intensive in application as well as in its requirements for monitoring. Thus, the&#xD;
      continuous epidural blockade is not a possibility of interest to the gynecologists and&#xD;
      obstetricians at our hospital. Therefore, until recently opioids have been the sole treatment&#xD;
      of pain, when over-the-counter medicine does not suffice. This presents a problem for the&#xD;
      patients due to the well-known adverse effects of morphine including postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV), itching, fatigue, constipation, confusion, respiratory depression and&#xD;
      delayed mobilisation. These adverse effects are bad for the new mothers as well as the&#xD;
      breast-fed, newborn children. All of these adverse effects are well known, and&#xD;
      internationally several anaesthesia associations (ESA, ASA, ESRA, ASRA) are searching for&#xD;
      viable alternatives that can be implemented in the daily clinical practice - alternatives&#xD;
      with the primary focus on the wellbeing of the patient striving to ensure effective pain&#xD;
      relief with minimal adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there could be many potentially positive benefits related to the treatment with&#xD;
      advanced pain-reducing techniques. Postoperative complications to surgery are more frequent&#xD;
      in patients experiencing postoperative pain, and besides reducing the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      pain perception, we consider reduction of the total morphine consumption and the potential of&#xD;
      reducing development of chronic pain through better treatment of the acute pain, as very&#xD;
      interesting and promising for the patients in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid or reduce postoperative pain after CS, numerous regional anaesthetic techniques have&#xD;
      been tried. In the UK, and elsewhere, the combined spinal epidural (CSE) is used, but because&#xD;
      of high demands of time and technical skills, and it's lack of potential to have the epidural&#xD;
      tested with the spinal on top, this technique has never gained ground in Denmark. The&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided (USG) or 'blind' transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been&#xD;
      investigated in several studies, but with varying results. Thus, this technique has not been&#xD;
      considered for implementation into the standard anaesthesia regimen for CS at Zealand&#xD;
      University Hospital. In a placebo controlled trial in 2015 with patients undergoing CS,&#xD;
      Blanco et al. found significantly lower postoperative opioid consumption and lower pain&#xD;
      scores in the active group treated with Dr. Blanco's version of an ultrasound-guided (USG)&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum (QL) block - named QLB which much resembles an USG version of the original&#xD;
      blind and landmarked based TAP block. However, the exact mechanism by which Dr. Blanco's QLB&#xD;
      block works is still not clear. The investigators now have the technical capability to&#xD;
      improve perioperative pain management by taking advantage of USG peripheral nerve blocks&#xD;
      (PNBs). At Zealand hospital we have concomminantly with Dr. Blanco described another&#xD;
      so-called QL block technique. We call this technique the transmuscular QL (TQL) block. The&#xD;
      mechanism by which the TQL block works has just been proven in a major cadaveric study.&#xD;
      (submitted for publication Anesth Analg) USG PNBs are applied using a technique based on a&#xD;
      thorough anatomical knowledge and real-time ultrasound images that have evolved rapidly&#xD;
      during the last 10 years. At the Department of Anaesthesiology, Zealand University Hospital,&#xD;
      our research group is among the leaders in Scandinavia within this specific field of&#xD;
      interest. We want to make the use of this pain treatment technique in everyday practice&#xD;
      wherever it is clinically indicated. The research group is headed by associate professor Jens&#xD;
      Børglum, PhD, and he has been deeply involved in this development since 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to abdominal surgery, Jens Børglum and his previous research group have been&#xD;
      involved in research that has described and evaluated the effectiveness of USG bilateral dual&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane (BD-TAP) blocks, USG ilioinguinal / iliohypogastric nerve blocks&#xD;
      and, more recently, the USG TQL blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three articles concerning specifically the USG TQL block and its' application has recently&#xD;
      been published from our group alone, showing the increasing interest and focus on the&#xD;
      development of this particular block and the potential abilities with the future knowledge of&#xD;
      the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Zealand University Hospital several research projects regarding the seemingly very&#xD;
      promising analgesic efficacy of the USG TQL blockade are planned and already in the making.&#xD;
      The Department of Anaesthesiology already conduct a PhD-study in cooperation with the&#xD;
      Department of Urology concerning the TQL block and the management of pain in patients&#xD;
      operated for kidney cancer (nephrectomy) and large pelvis stones (Percutaneous&#xD;
      Nephrolithotomy, PNL). The USG TQL block has shown convincing results in a small pilot-study,&#xD;
      concerning the above-mentioned patients with surgery in the retroperitoneal space, resulting&#xD;
      in very low pain scores and a period without the need for opioids in up to 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our other pilot-studies, the USG TQL block has shown an excellent pain-relieving effect&#xD;
      administered as a bilateral rescue block; i.e. postoperatively after laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy and other gynaecologic procedures as well as CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TQL block is applied with the patient in the lateral position, with the flank of the side&#xD;
      to be blocked turning upwards. The ultrasound transducer is placed in the transverse position&#xD;
      at the posterior axillary line, just above the iliac crest, and adjusted to visualise the QL&#xD;
      and psoas major (PM) muscles and the transverse process of vertebrae L3 or L4. The needle is&#xD;
      subsequently inserted at the posterolateral end of the transducer and advanced in plane. The&#xD;
      needle is then advanced through the QL muscle until the tip of the needle penetrates the&#xD;
      investing fascia of the QL muscle. The local anaesthetic is then injected in the interfascial&#xD;
      plane, but posterior/superficial to the transversalis fascia (TF) and between the QL and PM&#xD;
      muscles. Confirmation of correct application can subsequently be visualized when the two&#xD;
      muscles are seen to spread apart on the ultrasound image. The TF, which cover the&#xD;
      antero-medial surface of the QL and the antero-lateral surface of the PM, splits in two&#xD;
      layers at the level of the diaphragm. One layer is continuous with the inferior diaphragmatic&#xD;
      fascia and the other continues behind the arcuate ligaments of the diaphragm to be the&#xD;
      endothoracic fascia. This is why the lumbar application of local anaesthetic can facilitate a&#xD;
      block of nerves within the thoracic cage. The injectate will now be in close proximity with&#xD;
      the ventral rami of the segmental nerves in the thoracic paravertebral space and the&#xD;
      sympathetic trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously mentioned we have yet unpublished data from a cadaveric study in Innsbruck,&#xD;
      December 2015, conducted by our own group. The results show a very favourable spread of&#xD;
      injectate with the TQL block. Not only does the injected dye in this study spread to colour&#xD;
      the ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves up to T9 in the thoracic paravertebral space;&#xD;
      the injectate also spread to colour the thoracic sympathetic trunk. The visceral pain arising&#xD;
      from the intraperitoneal organs travel via different nerves to join exactly in the thoracic&#xD;
      sympathetic trunk before entering the central nervous system. Thus, this seem to indicate&#xD;
      that the TQL block can be used to treat not only the pain from the incisions and tears&#xD;
      superficially to the uterus, but also the pain from the uterus itself, and the adjacent&#xD;
      intraperitoneal organs and structures, which is affected in patients undergoing CS. The&#xD;
      cadaveric study has also shown that the lumbar sympathetic trunk and lumbar plexus were not&#xD;
      affected by the injected dye. These results seem to imply that there would be minimal or no&#xD;
      affection of ambulation or lumbar sympathectomy; i.e. no hypotension or dysfunctional bladder&#xD;
      as can often be observed with the epidural technique. Both findings that coincides with our&#xD;
      clinical experiences from our pilot studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to perform evidence-based research using the USG TQL for patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective CS. Our hypothesis is that the USG TQL block administered bilaterally and&#xD;
      applied postoperatively in the PACU for the CS patients (with the spinal anaesthesia still&#xD;
      manifest) can reduce the postoperative morphine consumption by 50 % during the first 24&#xD;
      postoperative hours. It is considered a block with very little discomfort for the patient,&#xD;
      when not already anaesthetized, but even more so, when the patient is still anaesthetised in&#xD;
      our area of interest, or at least still somewhat desensitised from the spinal anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients scheduled for a CS will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The suitable candidates will be asked prior to surgery, whether they want to&#xD;
      participate in the trial. If so, following elective CS surgery, the patient will receive the&#xD;
      block, allocated in a randomised fashion to either active LA or placebo. The block will be&#xD;
      performed under standard postoperative monitoring by a trained and skilled physician from the&#xD;
      department of anaesthesia. The active treatment will be a bilateral TQL block with 30 mL&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.375% on each side, whereas the placebo group will receive the same volume of&#xD;
      Saline, applied in the exact same way. The patients will all receive the same post-surgical&#xD;
      analgesia regimen, consisting of 1 g Acetaminophen, 400 mg Ibuprofen / 100 mg Celebra, the&#xD;
      latter with larger blood loss evaluated by the anaesthetist and obstetrician, and an IV&#xD;
      Morphine Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) - pump. In order to keep the pooled&#xD;
      administration of local anaesthetic below the accepted maximum recommended dosage, local&#xD;
      anaesthetic infiltration will not be performed by the surgeon. In reference to opioid&#xD;
      consumption, it has been part of a local instruction to receive 10 mg Morphine in the PACU&#xD;
      upon arrival here post-surgically. This is also withdrawn concerning the patients enrolled in&#xD;
      this study, but instead the patient herself will manage the opioid treatment by activation of&#xD;
      the PCA pump.&#xD;
