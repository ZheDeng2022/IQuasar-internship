      This study investigated the changes in urothelial dysfunction and sensory protein expression&#xD;
      in the bladder urothelium with time after onabotulinumtoxin injection in spinal cord injured&#xD;
      (SCI) patients. The investigators planned to enroll 30 chronic SCI patient with neurogenic&#xD;
      detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence were treated with a single injection of 200 U&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA at the detrusor. Video urodynamic studies and bladder mucosal biopsies&#xD;
      were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. Bladder tissues will be&#xD;
      investigated for urothelial barrier and inflammation proteins as well as sensory proteins by&#xD;
      Western blotting, between SCI patients and 10 controls, as well as successful and failed&#xD;
      treatment groups. This study will explore the therapeutic efficacy of a single injection of&#xD;
      200 U onabotulinumtoxinA on neurogenic detrusor overactivity and the changes of urothelial&#xD;
      sensory proteins in SCI patients with successful and failed treatment outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) with&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA has emerged as an alternative method for the management of urological&#xD;
      complications due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis. Injection of 200-300 U&#xD;
      of onabotulinumtoxinA into the detrusor muscle can reduce contractility, improve bladder&#xD;
      compliance, and restore urinary continence in patients with NDO. However, detrusor&#xD;
      underactivity will develop after injection of 300 U of onabotulinumtoxinA and improvement of&#xD;
      urodynamic and quality of life parameters lasted 9 months. Currently, a 200 U single&#xD;
      injection of onabotulinumtoxinA into the detrusor has been recommended as standard treatment&#xD;
      for NDO. However, the therapeutic duration of this dosage on NDO was shorter than that of a&#xD;
      300 U injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OnabotulinumtoxinA effectively improves lower urinary tract symptoms by inhibiting signal&#xD;
      transmission at the neuromuscular and neuroglandular junctions. OnabotulinumtoxinA cleaves&#xD;
      synaptosome-associated protein 25 and inhibits signal transmission by disrupting fusion of&#xD;
      neurotransmitter- containing vesicles with the neuronal wall. In the urinary bladder, release&#xD;
      of acetylcholine from both pre- and postganglionic parasympathetic nerves is blocked after&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA administration. This toxin was also found to modulate afferent activity of&#xD;
      the bladder associated with reduced urgency and urgency urinary incontinence symptoms in NDO&#xD;
      patients. Although the impact of onabotulinumtoxinA on the sympathetic nervous system within&#xD;
      the urinary bladder is unclear, it has an inhibitory effect on release of norepinephrine to&#xD;
      α- and β3-adrenoreceptors (β3-ARs) which regulate bladder neck contraction and detrusor&#xD;
      relaxation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study reported decreased expression of adhesion and junction proteins E-cadherin&#xD;
      and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), respectively, and increased suburothelial inflammation with&#xD;
      apoptosis in patients with chronic SCI bladders.The urothelial inflammation and dysfunction&#xD;
      in SCI bladders might also alter sensory protein expression, such as in purinergic receptor&#xD;
      P2X3, transient receptor potential vallinoid receptor subfamily 1, adenosine triphosphate,&#xD;
      and nitric oxide. Urothelial dysfunction might also result in increased excitability of the&#xD;
      C-fibers which become predominantly afferent nerves of the micturition reflex after SCI. In&#xD;
      humans with NDO, the levels of bladder P2X2, P2X3, and muscarinic receptors M2 and M3 were&#xD;
      reduced after detrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection, suggesting this toxin inhibits DO by&#xD;
      inhibiting both the sensory and motor arms of the micturition reflex. In addition, β3-ARs are&#xD;
      known to promote urine storage in the bladder by inducing detrusor relaxation in animal and&#xD;
      human bladders. In humans, β3-AR is the predominant β-receptor subtype in the urinary&#xD;
      bladder. There has been no report on β3-AR changes in SCI bladder urothelium before or after&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After onabotulinumtoxinA injection, patients may be symptom-free for a period of 3-6 months&#xD;
      before symptoms relapse. Most studies of onabotulinumtoxinA on NDO come from animal models,&#xD;
      and only a few human studies have been noted. The current study investigated changes in&#xD;
      urothelial dysfunction and sensory protein expression in the bladder urothelium with time&#xD;
      after a single onabotulinumtoxin injection in SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 26 patients with chronic SCI causing NDO and urinary incontinence were treated&#xD;
      with a single injection of 200 U onabotulinumtoxinA to the detrusor muscle. All patients&#xD;
      presented with urinary incontinence with or without difficult bladder emptying. In patients&#xD;
      who received detrusor injections, clean intermittent catheterization was suggested as a&#xD;
      possible mode of urinary management after treatment. The current study was approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital&#xD;
      (IRB:098-53). Each patient was informed about the study rationale and procedures, and written&#xD;
      informed consent to participate was obtained before any bladder procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video urodynamic studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received a video urodynamic study (VUDS) before their enrollment. Bladder and&#xD;
      urethral dysfunction were classified as the presence of DO with coordinated or dyssynergic&#xD;
      urethral sphincter activity. Patients with urinary tract infection were properly treated&#xD;
      before they were scheduled for onabotulinumtoxinA injection. VUDS results were interpreted&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the International Continence Society. VUDS parameters&#xD;
      included maximum flow rate (Qmax), detrusor voiding pressure at Qmax (Pdet), cystometric&#xD;
      bladder capacity (CBC), voided volume (Vol), and post-void residual (PVR) volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OnabotulinumtoxinA injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received 200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA in 20 mL normal saline (BOTOX®, 100 U/vial,&#xD;
      Allergan Inc., Irvine, USA) in the operation room by rigid cytoscopic injection (22 Fr,&#xD;
      Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) into 40 sites of the bladder wall, sparing the&#xD;
      trigoneAfter injection, a urethral Foley catheter was routinely inserted and removed the next&#xD;
      morning before patients were discharged. Broad spectrum antibiotics were prescribed for 3 d&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After onabotulinumtoxinA injection, four bladder cold-cup biopsies were taken randomly at the&#xD;
      posterior wall about 2 cm above the interureteric ridge, and only the bladder mucosa and&#xD;
      submucosa were taken to prevent bladder perforation; any erythematous or inflammatory bladder&#xD;
      mucosa were avoided. One bladder biopsy specimen from each patient was sent to the pathology&#xD;
      department to exclude the possibility of carcinoma in situ. The remaining three specimens&#xD;
      from each patient were stored at optimum cutting temperature and in liquid nitrogen for&#xD;
      further immunohistochemistry studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up and outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed up at OPD monthly, and VUDS and assessment of bladder and voiding&#xD;
      conditions and satisfaction with treatment were performed 3 and 6 months after treatment. If&#xD;
      the CBC increased by 50% from the baseline value, the treatment outcome was considered&#xD;
      successful; otherwise, the outcome was considered a failure at that time-point. Ten female&#xD;
      patients with stress-related urinary incontinence without frequent urgency served as&#xD;
      controls. All control patients were confirmed free of bladder outlet obstruction or DO by&#xD;
      VUDS. Control bladder tissue was obtained during anti-incontinence surgery and processed the&#xD;
      same as SCI patients. Male patients were not selected to serve as controls because the&#xD;
      prostate could cause bladder outlet obstruction and affect urothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunofluorescence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder tissue samples from SCI patients and controls were examined for changes in urothelial&#xD;
      E-cadherin (adhesive protein), ZO-1 (junction protein), and mast cell activation (tryptase)&#xD;
      levels by immunofluorescence; cellular apoptosis was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl&#xD;
      transferase dUTP nick end-labeling assay. These procedures were performed similar to those in&#xD;
      our previous study, with 6-μm thickness tissue sections. Urinary bladder specimens were&#xD;
      immersed and fixed for 1 h in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)&#xD;
      then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% sucrose for 12 h. Biopsy&#xD;
      specimens were embedded in optimum cutting temperature medium and stored at -80 °C. Four&#xD;
      sections per specimen were cut using a cryostat at a thickness of 8 μm and collected on new&#xD;
      silane III-coated glass slides (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Sections were&#xD;
      postfixed in acetone at -20 °C and blocked with rabbit serum. The sections were incubated&#xD;
      overnight at 4 °C with antihuman E-cadherin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) or tryptase&#xD;
      (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) primary antibodies. After rinsing the sections with 0.1%&#xD;
      Tween-20 in BPS, rabbit antimouse-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies&#xD;
      (DakoCytomation Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) were applied and incubated on sections for 1&#xD;
      h. Finally, sections were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma Chemical&#xD;
      Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Negative controls included the isotype of the primary antibody. We&#xD;
      obtained the mean, maximum, range, and standard deviation of the staining intensity and&#xD;
      percent positive area measurements using three random hot spots within each specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunofluorescence quantification was determined in four consecutive high-power fields (400X)&#xD;
      in the area with the greatest density. Immunofluorescence (tryptase and terminal&#xD;
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling) assays were quantified by counting the&#xD;
      number of positively stained cells per unit area (4 μm2) and are shown as percentages. The&#xD;
      intensity of E-cadherin (ﬂuorescence microscopy) and ZO-1 (confocal microscopy) fluorescence&#xD;
      was quantified using Image J.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Western blotting was used to assess the levels of sensory proteins in bladder mucosa&#xD;
      specimens. Primary antibodies included P2X3 (1:2000), endothelial nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      [eNOS] (1:1000), M2 (1:1000), M3 (1:500), and GAPDH (1:100000; internal control) from GeneTex&#xD;
      (Irvine, CA, USA); inducible NOS [iNOS] (1:1500; ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA); and β3-AR&#xD;
      (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Donkey antigoat (for β3-AR) or goat antirabbit (for all other&#xD;
      proteins) IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:3000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)&#xD;
      secondary antibodies were used. The scanned ﬁlm after gel electrophoresis was quantiﬁed using&#xD;
      a gel documentation system (Quantity One Version 4.6.2, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel&#xD;
      Hempstead, Herts, UK). Procedures were similar to those described in our previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables were presented as means ± standard deviations, and categorical data were&#xD;
      presented as numbers and percentages. Eligible SCI patients were grouped according to&#xD;
      treatment outcome and compared with controls. Differences in the levels of functional&#xD;
      proteins in the urothelium at baseline and 3 and 6 months after onabotulinumtoxinA injection&#xD;
      were analyzed using a paired Student's t-test. Differences in immunofluorescence and Western&#xD;
      blot of sensory proteins between successful and failed treatment groups were analyzed using&#xD;
      the Kruskal-Wallis test. In order to clarify the roles of urothelial sensory proteins in NDO,&#xD;
      correlation analysis using linear regression was also performed, including VUDS and&#xD;
      urothelial dysfunction parameters. All calculations were done using SPSS for Windows version&#xD;
      16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant if P&#xD;
      values were less than 0.05.&#xD;
