      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma can be defined as damage inflicted on the body as the result of an external force, and&#xD;
      the body's associated response. It is one of the leading causes of death world-wide, causing&#xD;
      almost five million deaths yearly, making up for close to nine per cent of global deaths. Of&#xD;
      these, road traffic injury alone causes 1.3 million, making it the ninth leading cause of&#xD;
      death, with a predicted rise to seventh leading cause by 2030. Overall, however, the world&#xD;
      has experienced an increase in life-expectancy over the past 30 years, as well as a decrease&#xD;
      in infant and maternal mortality. With evidence suggesting that surgical care results in at&#xD;
      least one million deaths per year, twice the number of maternal deaths, it has been&#xD;
      established that new health metrics are needed for assessing health system performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO Safe Surgery Saves Lives initiative proposes two metrics: day-of-surgery mortality,&#xD;
      and 30-day postoperative in-hospital mortality. The subsequently introduced perioperative&#xD;
      mortality rate (POMR) comprises these two. To date, no standard timespan for day-of-surgery&#xD;
      measurement prevails - the same day as surgery has been suggested for convenience, while some&#xD;
      institutions measure at 24, and others at 48 hours after surgery. The outcomes required to&#xD;
      calculate POMR (death and number of surgeries) are easily defined. Additionally, there is an&#xD;
      option to end follow-up at discharge, which makes the metric suitable for use in low-resource&#xD;
      settings, where 30-day follow-up is rare. These are qualities that make POMR the choice of&#xD;
      index for tracking the quality and safety of surgery in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of databanks of surgical patients establish some factors that are more intimately&#xD;
      linked to perioperative mortality (POM) than others. In trauma, especially, thorough risk&#xD;
      adjustment is highly stressed to enable comparisons at hospital and patient level. However,&#xD;
      the data yielding adjustment models largely stems from high-income countries, which is&#xD;
      relevant considering that not all risk factors associated with POM in a high-resource setting&#xD;
      are applicable in a low-resource setting. This owes to the scarcity of data on surgical&#xD;
      programs in low-resource settings, not least in India. As the country faces increasing&#xD;
      motorisation, and with it an increase in trauma patients for which factors associated with&#xD;
      POM is poorly understood, bridging this knowledge gap is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will be estimating the POMR and assessing the association between type&#xD;
      of acute surgical intervention and POM among adult trauma patients in an urban Indian&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the POMR and asses the association between type of acute surgery and POM in adult&#xD;
      trauma patients in a low resource setting. Based on subject matter knowledge and clinical&#xD;
      experience the authors of this article hypothesise that the distribution of the multinomial&#xD;
      variable type of acute surgery will differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors,&#xD;
      and that this difference will remain significant after risk adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective analysis of the cohort study Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in&#xD;
      India (TITCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data used is available in the TITCO database, which includes a total of 16,047 trauma&#xD;
      patients enrolled prospectively from four public university hospitals between July 2013 and&#xD;
      December 2015. The units are all located in megacities (Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi) and&#xD;
      classified as free-to-public. Data was collected through an on-site trained and supervised&#xD;
      observer who systematically noted routine data on arrival through direct observation in the&#xD;
      emergency room and through extraction from medical records. The observer worked rotating&#xD;
      8-hour shifts covering morning, day and night. Data from patients admitted outside the&#xD;
      observer's shifts was retrospectively extracted from patient records. Patients were followed&#xD;
      until discharge from hospitals, or for 30 days, or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-site observer included patients presenting to participating centres, either by direct&#xD;
      observation or by retrospective data extracted from records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory variable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main explanatory variable will be type of acute surgery, categorised using the Nordic&#xD;
      Centre for Classifications in Health Care (NOMESCO) classification of surgical procedures&#xD;
      (NCSP), which is based on functional-anatomic body system groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between type of acute surgery and POM will be adjusted for mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, patient age in years, sex, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, transfer status and&#xD;
      Glasgow coma scale on arrival. A health centre identifier will be included to account for&#xD;
      centre level nesting in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources/measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POMR will be calculated for adult trauma patients who underwent acute surgical&#xD;
      intervention within 24 hours of arrival by dividing the number of surgical patients who died&#xD;
      within 48 hours of arrival, and the number of patients who died within 30 days of arrival,&#xD;
      with the total number patients who underwent surgery. The timespan of 48 hours for&#xD;
      day-of-surgery mortality measurement is deemed most accurate due to the database format, in&#xD;
      which it is stated whether a patient is taken to the operating room (OR) within 24 hours or&#xD;
      not. Only procedures performed in an OR under regional or general anaesthesia qualify. The&#xD;
      resulting POMR will be reported as a percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observers collecting the data were holders of a health science master's degree, and were&#xD;
      trained by project management. They were also cross-checked by project management on two&#xD;
      occasions, upon each a random selection of enrolled patient records were compared with those&#xD;
      on file with the hospital. No major discrepancies were identified during these quality&#xD;
      control sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of injury severity score (ISS) in the risk adjustment model, as recommended for&#xD;
      predicting trauma mortality by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), will not be done in&#xD;
      this study due to ISS performing poorly in predicting early mortality in low-resource&#xD;
      settings. A physiological injury score, in the form of systolic blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;
      and GCS score, is however included to adjust for physiological injury severity. ASA physical&#xD;
      score and the need for ventilator use will not be included as this information is not&#xD;
      available in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations in the database do not allow taking into account whether a patient has had any&#xD;
      secondary, subacute surgery outside of the first 24 hours, within 30 days. Thus, subacute&#xD;
      surgical interventions made after the first 24 hours are not counted, and so are not included&#xD;
      in the denominator for POMR. Effectively, instead of the denominator being defined, as is&#xD;
      recommended, as the total number of procedures, this redefines it as the total number of&#xD;
      patients. The authors acknowledge that this is not ideal as it confers to the potential risk&#xD;
      of overestimating POMR in the case where a patient receiving additional surgery expires&#xD;
      perioperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation studies of logistic regression models indicate a need for ten events, i.e.&#xD;
      patients with the outcome, per parameter used in the model. For the logistic regression model&#xD;
      in this study, the type of acute surgery will account for 14 parameters, i.e. coefficients to&#xD;
      be estimated. Mechanism of injury will account for four parameters. The four different&#xD;
      centres will account for three. Because age, heart rate and systolic blood pressure will be&#xD;
      modelled using splines with four degrees of freedom these variables will account for three&#xD;
      parameters each. Sex, Glasgow coma scale and transfer status for one respectively, coming to&#xD;
      a total of 33 parameters. This analysis will thus require at least 330 non-survivors to allow&#xD;
      for logistic regression analysis of both POMR48H and POMR30D. Assuming a POMR48H of 10%, the&#xD;
      study size (the number of adults who underwent surgery within 24 hours) needs to amount to&#xD;
      least n = 3300. All adult patients in the TITCO database who received surgical intervention&#xD;
      within 24 hours of arrival will be included, and is expected to provide a sufficient study&#xD;
      size by a wide margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      All quantitative variables, i.e. age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and Glasgow coma&#xD;
      scale will be analysed as continuous. Age, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate are&#xD;
      assumed to be non-linearly associated with mortality why these will be modelled using spline&#xD;
      smoothing terms with four degrees of freedom, resulting in coefficients for three basis&#xD;
      functions to be estimated for each of these. Glasgow coma scale is assumed to display a&#xD;
      linear association with mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      R, a language and environment for statistical computing, will be used for all statistical&#xD;
      analyses. The main analysis will be a complete case analysis, in which observations with&#xD;
      missing values in any of the covariate variables will be excluded. In the event of missing&#xD;
      data being too extensive to allow for analysis, multiple imputation using chained equations&#xD;
      will be applied. Sample characteristics will be reported using medians and values at the 25th&#xD;
      and 75th percentiles as well as minimum and maximum values for quantitative variables and&#xD;
      proportions for qualitative variables. The association between type of surgery and POMR will&#xD;
      be assessed using multilevel generalised additive models, in two steps. First, the crude&#xD;
      associations between type of surgery and POM will be estimated using a model that does not&#xD;
      include additional covariates. Second, the adjusted associations will be assessed using a&#xD;
      model that does include the covariates listed above. 95% confidence intervals and a 5%&#xD;
      significance level will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sensitivity analysis will be conducted by using a generalised additive model without&#xD;
      accounting for centre level nesting.&#xD;
