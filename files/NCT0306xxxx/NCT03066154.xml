  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment for HRPC patients has not yet been established. Recent trials suggest a&#xD;
      benefit from early treatment with docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting, with an&#xD;
      improvement in failure free survival in high risk and metastatic patients and increase in&#xD;
      overall survival in the metastatic hormone-sensitive group. In these recent randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, patients were treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant&#xD;
      docetaxel, assuming that early systemic treatment for high risk or metastatic disease could&#xD;
      delay progression in patients with aggressive primary tumor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the fact that docetaxel is a known radiosensitizer, combined modality treatment with&#xD;
      docetaxel during the radiotherapy could also lead to better local control and reduction of&#xD;
      local recurrence. Several phase I and II studies have been done in HRPC patients, to evaluate&#xD;
      the combination of high dose radiotherapy and concurrent weekly infusions with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral administration of docetaxel has many advantages above intravenously administered drugs&#xD;
      for patients. Besides the higher patient convenience, possibly longer treatment duration can&#xD;
      be achieved due to better safety. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously&#xD;
      administered docetaxel, such as neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral&#xD;
      polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with the oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the N15DOP study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      ModraDoc006/r when given in a weekly bidaily schedule in combined modality with high dose&#xD;
      intensity radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      with high risk disease, including positive lymph nodes.&#xD;

      Phase IA part This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomized, single centre phase I&#xD;
      study of ModraDoc006/r combined with ADT and radiotherapy in patients with high risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer, as defined by node positive prostate cancer with all of the following primary tumor&#xD;
      characteristics: stage ≥cT2c, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, any PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IB part After determination of the MTD of ModraDoc006/r in the combined treatment with&#xD;
      radiotherapy and hormonal therapy and good tolerability of the treatment without unexpected&#xD;
      adverse events during the radiotherapy until 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, the study&#xD;
      will be further conducted to the phase IB part. This part will explore the feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerability of long term treatment with ModraDoc006/r.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven prostate cancer.&#xD;

          2. All eligible patients have hormone naïve non-metastatic node positive high risk&#xD;
             prostate cancer. Node positive cancer will be defined as radiological demonstration of&#xD;
             more than four pelvic lymph node(s) consisting of bean shaped lymph node(s) with a&#xD;
             short axis of minimal 10 mm and/or round lymph node(s) with a minimal size of 8 mm on&#xD;
             PSMA, MRI or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             PSMA-scans or PET-Choline scans may be used, but are not obligated. Since the use of&#xD;

             of false positive results is considered very low in patients with more than 4 positive&#xD;
             lymph nodes, histological confirmation of positive lymph nodes is not required for&#xD;
