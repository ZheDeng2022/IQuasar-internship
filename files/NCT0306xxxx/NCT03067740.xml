    <textblock>
      Fifty two children of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II,&#xD;
      aged 8-14 years old, of both gender, with suspected acute appendicitis scheduled for&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendicectomy, were included in this study. Patients were randomized into group&#xD;
      (B) and group (BD) with a 1:1 allocation ratio.At the end of surgery, and after peritoneal&#xD;
      lavage, those patients who were allocated to B group (bupivacaine group; n = 26) received&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 mg/kg followed by 5 ml normal saline.&#xD;
      However, in group BD (bupivacaine, Dexmedetomidine group; n = 26), bupivacaine 0.25% at a&#xD;
      dose of 2mg/kg was instilled intraperitoneally followed by dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg diluted in&#xD;
      5 ml normal saline. In the postoperative period, assessments were made for pain and sedation&#xD;
      on awakening in PACU (0 time) and at 2, 4, 6, 12,and 24 h. Abdominal and/or shoulder pain was&#xD;
      assessed on the 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Sedation was assessed using the Ramsay&#xD;
      sedation score. Also the occurrence of nausea or vomiting was recorded . The time from&#xD;
      extubation to the first administration of pethidine was registered. The consumption of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia was recorded. Side effects of the study drugs were assessed and&#xD;
      recorded by the ward nurses for 24h postoperatively. Possible complications such as&#xD;
      respiratory depression, allergic reactions, local anaesthetic toxicity,dizziness, , headache,&#xD;
      were recorded and managed accordingly. Duration of surgery and length of stay in PACU were&#xD;
      noted. Before discharge to home, length of stay in the hospital was recorded and parent's&#xD;
      satisfaction was assessed using the 7-point Likert scale&#xD;

      A written informed consent for participation in the trial was obtained by parents or the&#xD;
      legal guardians . Fifty two children participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blindness: Patients were randomized into group (B) and group (BD) with a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation ratio. The allocated intervention was written on a slip of paper, placed in a&#xD;
      sealed serially numbered, opaque envelopes. The envelopes were serially opened, and the&#xD;
      allocated intervention was implemented. Patients were equally distributed in both groups. All&#xD;
      investigators, parents, and patients were blind to which method was being used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the operating room, routine preoperative evaluation was performed, and the&#xD;
      procedure was explained to all parents. Before premedication, patients and parents were&#xD;
      instructed in the use of the 10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS),with score raging from 0 (no&#xD;
      pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Baseline measurements of heart rate (HR), mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), and room air oxygen saturation (SaO2) were obtained&#xD;
      using an electrocardiogram, a &quot;Dinamap&quot; automated blood pressure monitor, and a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children received premedication with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg intravenously afterward,&#xD;
      Ringer's lactate infusion (20 ml/kg/h) was started. Standardized prophylactic antiemetic was&#xD;
      iv ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg. General anesthesia was inducted with propofol 2 mg/kg, rocuronium&#xD;
      0.6 mg/kg, and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg intravenously (i.v.). Endotracheal intubation was performed,&#xD;
      tube size was calculated according to the formula: age/4+4. Anesthesia was maintained with a&#xD;
      sevoflurane and oxygen mixture, with total fresh gas flow 3 L/min controlled by mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, tidal volume 5-10 ml/kg. The respiratory rate adjusted according to the end&#xD;
      tidal CO2 (maintaining CO2 in the normal range of 35-45 mmHg). Standardized prophylactic&#xD;
      antiemetic was ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study groups, laparoscopic surgery was performed according to the standard surgical&#xD;
      protocol. Local infiltration of port sites was performed by 4 ml xylocaine 1% at a maximum&#xD;
      dose of 3 mg/kg. Standardized surgery involved 3 ports, a 5 or10-mm umbilical Hasson cannula&#xD;
      and 3 or 5- mm left iliac fossa and suprapubic ports. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved using&#xD;
      nonhumidified and nonheated CO2, with the intra-abdominal pressure maintained around 10-12&#xD;
      mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, and after peritoneal lavage, those patients who were allocated to B&#xD;
      group (bupivacaine group; n = 26) received bupivacaine 0.25% intraperitoneally at a dose of 2&#xD;
      mg/kg followed by 5 ml normal saline. However, in group BD (bupivacaine, Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      group; n = 26), bupivacaine 0.25% at a dose of 2mg/kg was instilled intraperitoneally&#xD;
      followed by dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg diluted in 5 ml normal saline. Surgeons instilled the&#xD;
      study solution through a suction-irrigation device under visual control onto the parietal and&#xD;
      visceral peritoneum of the right iliac fossa and pelvis to cover the appendix stump, lower&#xD;
      pole of the cecum, and the terminal ileum. At the end of the operation, CO2 was cleared&#xD;
      completely from the peritoneal cavity by manual compression of the abdomen with open trocar.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups received intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg (Perfalgan, Bristol-Myers&#xD;
      Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, New York City, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reversal of the muscle relaxant was carried out using prostigmine at a dose of 0.05-0.07&#xD;
      mg/kg and atropine at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg. The patients were then transferred to the&#xD;
      postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) where monitoring of heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and pain scoring&#xD;
      was carried out. After operation, paracetamol 15mg/kg iv drip was administered on a regular&#xD;
      base every 8h, and iv pethidine 1mg/kg as rescue analgesia ( whenVAS≥ 4) for the 1st 24. the&#xD;
      occurrence of nausea or vomiting was recorded and patients were immediately given ondansetron&#xD;
      0.15 mg/kg if they experienced nausea and/or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ward nurses were instructed to omit the 6-h dose of pethidine if they considered that the&#xD;
      patient was over sedated or pain free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time from extubation to the first administration of pethidine was registered. Side&#xD;
      effects of the study drugs were assessed and recorded by the ward nurses for 24h&#xD;
      postoperatively. Oxygen desaturation was considered when SpO2 dropped below 93% for more than&#xD;
      10 s. Bradycardia was defined as a HR 20% decrease from the baseline, whereas a HR more than&#xD;
      20% of the baseline was labeled as tachycardia. A drop in MAP by 20% or more of the baseline&#xD;
      was regarded as hypotension while a MAP value higher than the baseline by 20% was regarded as&#xD;
      hypertension. Other possible complications such as respiratory depression, allergic&#xD;
      reactions, local anaesthetic toxicity,dizziness, , headache, were recorded and managed&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postoperative period, assessments were made for pain on awakening in PACU (0 time) and&#xD;
      at 2, 4, 6, 12,and 24 h. Abdominal and/or shoulder pain was assessed on the 10-cm Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation scores at PACU time and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, and 24h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of first request of analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of rescue pethidine in 24h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of nausea and vomiting and other complications after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in hospital after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents satisfaction before discharge to home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size, the postoperative opioid consumption at day 1 in a similar&#xD;
      clinical setting was taken into account. With a 2-tailed α = 0.05 and a power of 80%, we&#xD;
      needed 23 patients in each group. Considering the anticipated drop out as 10%, 52 patients&#xD;
      were asked to participate in the study. Data will be presented as a mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, numbers, and frequencies, as appropriate. Statistical significance&#xD;
      accepted at a P &lt; 0.05 Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS program version 19&#xD;
      (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and EP16 program. Student's t-test, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U-test, and Fisher's exact test will be used for statistical analysis, as appropriate.&#xD;
