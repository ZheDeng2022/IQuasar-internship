  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK has the highest incidence of mesothelioma. The incidence has risen by 497% since the&#xD;
      late 1970's and is increasing worldwide due to continued mining and use of asbestos. For&#xD;
      patients with mesothelioma who have relapsed after taking pemetrexed and cisplatin, there is&#xD;
      currently no standard treatment, making this an urgent unmet need. Recent trials in this area&#xD;
      have not found an effective treatment that improves overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a debate in the House of Lords, a national survey assessing the research priorities&#xD;
      in mesothelioma found that 'exploiting the potential of immunotherapy' was a top priority.&#xD;
      This trial was designed in response to that survey. It uses the immunotherapy agent nivolumab&#xD;
      which blocks programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on activated T-cells (a type of white&#xD;
      blood cell forming part of the immune system). Early research has found a dependency of&#xD;
      mesothelioma on the PD-1 checkpoint. By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action&#xD;
      (checkpoint inhibition), preventing it from turning off the T-cell, and therefore allowing&#xD;
      the immune system to work. PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has revolutionised the treatment of&#xD;
      melanoma and it is hoped to be as effective in mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial of patients with&#xD;
      mesothelioma who are second or third relapse following a platinum based chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio (nivolumab: placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      336 patients will be recruited from 25 UK centres with the last patient having a minimum of 6&#xD;
      months follow up. All patients will be on treatment for 12 months unless they progress or&#xD;
      withdrawal prior to this.&#xD;
