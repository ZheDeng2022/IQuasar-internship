  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely accepted that coronary artery disease (CAD) is related to a high mortality. It&#xD;
      is predicted that an increase of approximately 21.3 million cardiovascular events and 7.7&#xD;
      million cardiovascular deaths over 2010 to 2030 in China.1 Male sex, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and smoking are all traditionally considered as&#xD;
      risk factors for CAD. In recent decades, tremendous progress toward the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors have helped decrease the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from CAD, but the condition remains a major public health challenge worldwide.&#xD;
      Looking into the other potential risk factors (OSA) for CAD, it may help to develop&#xD;
      additional preventative strategies and further reduce the incidence and mortality of CAD.&#xD;

      Before initiating the study, all potential subjects were invited to attend an educational&#xD;
      program that explained the purpose and methodology of this study. After getting informed&#xD;
      consent from patients, demographic data including age, sex, medical history (including&#xD;
      comorbidities and risk factors), current medicine, lifestyle habits, height (cm), and weight&#xD;
      (kg) were recorded, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height&#xD;
      squared (kilograms per square meter, kg/m2). The included subjects need to perform&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography or provide an echocardiographic examination within one month.&#xD;
      CAD diagnosis was determined based on the results of the coronary angiography, using stenosis&#xD;
      50% cutoffs considered have coronary diseases or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients of both sexes with coronary angiography from outpatient or inpatient&#xD;
      departments of Fuwai Hospital were recruited into the study. The inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      Chinese, aged 35 to 75 years with CAD verified by coronary angiography, and able to give&#xD;
      informed written consent. The subjects were excluded if they had New York Heart Association&#xD;
      Class III-IV degree with ejection fraction &lt; 45%, severe pulmonary disease, significant&#xD;
      psychiatric disease, or history of pharyngeal surgery for OSA or current use of CPAP&#xD;
      treatment for OSA. They were also excluded if they declined to participate or were unable to&#xD;
      provide informed consent.&#xD;
