      Prospective, multi-center, pilot study of subjects undergoing the FemBloc Permanent&#xD;
      Contraceptive System procedure conducted at 5 sites in the U.S. following 49 subjects total.&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of the FemBloc Permanent Contraceptive&#xD;
      System for female sterilization in preventing pregnancy through the 3-month confirmation test&#xD;
      visit. Femasys also intends to continue follow-up of pilot subjects for safety a total&#xD;
      duration of approximately 68 months after the FemBloc treatment procedure.&#xD;
