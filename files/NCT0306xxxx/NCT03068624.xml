    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous CD8 positive (+)&#xD;
      SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes when given together with cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, and to see how well they work in treating patients with uveal melanoma that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). To make specialized CD8+ T cells,&#xD;
      researchers separate out T cells collected from patients' blood and treat them so they are&#xD;
      able to target melanoma cells. The blood cells are then given back to the patients. This is&#xD;
      known as &quot;adoptive T cell transfer&quot; or &quot;adoptive T cell therapy.&quot; Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as cyclophosphamide, may work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Biological therapies, such as aldesleukin, use substances made from living&#xD;
      organisms that may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from&#xD;
      growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Giving autologous CD8+ SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes together with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of adoptively transferred SLC45A2-specific&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) for the treatment of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the anti-tumor efficacy as measured by immune-related response criteria&#xD;
      (irRC) and duration of response in metastatic uveal melanoma patients receiving autologous&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells against SLC45A2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of adoptively transferred SLC45A2-specific CTL in&#xD;
      combination with immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic uveal melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To quantify in vivo numeric and functional persistence of transferred CTL, and&#xD;
      development of antigen spreading in metastatic uveal melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess overall survival and progression-free survival in metastatic uveal melanoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of autologous CD8+ SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      on day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous CD8+ SLC45A2-specific T lymphocytes via hepatic&#xD;
      arterial infusion via central catheter over 60 minutes on day 0. Within 6 hours of T-cell&#xD;
      infusion, patients also receive aldesleukin twice daily (BID) subcutaneously (SC) for 14 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, and&#xD;
      64 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 84 and 168, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
