  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate in detail the way that the immune system responds to three different&#xD;
      kinds of flu shots that are licensed in the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous observations to date lead to the following model: Traditional egg-derived TIV have&#xD;
      contaminating internal virion proteins that preferentially elicit memory CD4 T cells specific&#xD;
      for these proteins. These CD4 T cells will have limited efficacy as helpers for the&#xD;
      neutralizing Ab response and will suppress the CD4 T cell response to new HA epitopes in the&#xD;
      vaccine. The current study will test this hypothesis by comparing CD4 cell responses to&#xD;
      specific epitopes, and the subsequent B cell and antibody response, in subjects receiving a&#xD;
      vaccine containing only HA protein to vaccines with more complex antigenic characteristics.&#xD;
      The CD4 T cell reactivity to pools of unique, conserved, and total pH1 HA peptides as well as&#xD;
      H3, influenza B HA, NP, and M1 peptides will be quantified using cytokine Elispot assays and&#xD;
      flow cytometry, and then compared to the subsequent antibody and B cell response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also use this study as an opportunity to evaluate the effects of prior&#xD;
      vaccination. Recent studies have emphasized the potential negative effect of vaccination in&#xD;
      prior years on both the immune response as well as the protective effectiveness of current&#xD;
      vaccine. In order to evaluate this phenomenon in the context of multiple vaccine&#xD;
      formulations, prior vaccination history of the subjects will be reviewed and subjects&#xD;
      stratify vaccination based on vaccine history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects who participated in this study in a previous year are eligible to&#xD;
      re-enroll, and will receive the same vaccine that they were randomized to previously. This&#xD;
      will allow an evaluation of differences between vaccine formulations in the responsiveness to&#xD;
      multiple vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent studies indicate reports that the glycosylation pattern of viral&#xD;
      hemagglutinins produced in cell culture can vary depending on the host cell used, and that&#xD;
      this can affect CD4 T cell immunogenicity and antibody recognition. As a cell culture-based&#xD;
      influenza vaccine production platform offers many advantages and may eventually supplant the&#xD;
      traditional egg-based approach, it is of great value to understand the CD4 T cell response&#xD;
      induced by this vaccine and how this affects neutralizing Ab production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data have also suggested that the failure of seasonal influenza infection to induce&#xD;
      substantial levels of stalk specific antibody may be due to the relatively inaccessible&#xD;
      nature of this epitope. As part of this study, investigators will also compare the&#xD;
      specificity of the human antibody response between the vaccine groups, with the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the rHA vaccine will more readily allow targeting of these important, broadly conserved&#xD;
      epitopes. There is compelling preliminary data demonstrating that multiple antibodies that we&#xD;
      have isolated have a particularly slow on rate when they bind to the HA-stalk versus the&#xD;
      HA-globular head epitopes on whole virions, but not on recombinant HA trimmers expressed in&#xD;
      baculovirus. The hypothesis is that a free, recombinant HA vaccine will allow more efficient&#xD;
      targeting of the HA-Stalk epitopes.&#xD;
