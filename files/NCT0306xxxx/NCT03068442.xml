    <textblock>
      The invesigators propose a clinical study on patients undergoing carotid surgery&#xD;
      (endarterectomy). The invesigators will determine carotid artery imaging features associated&#xD;
      with (1) vessel wall inflammation, (2) downstream brain inflammation, and (3) cognitive&#xD;
      benefit from surgery. This project will uncover links between inflamed carotid plaque and&#xD;
      downstream brain inflammation. The invesigators will also determine carotid plaque imaging&#xD;
      features predicting cognitive benefit from carotid surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is directed at a major stroke source, the carotid artery, a major vessel that&#xD;
      supplies blood to the brain. It has long been known that carotid narrowing is an important&#xD;
      stroke risk factor. However, many patients with narrow carotids do not have strokes, and many&#xD;
      patients with seemingly normal carotids have strokes. MRI research now suggests that the&#xD;
      carotid wall itself is the stroke source. Using carotid MRI, clinicians can identify&#xD;
      previously invisible markers of unstable carotid plaque, including carotid wall bleeds&#xD;
      (intraplaque hemorrhage). The working hypothesis is that patients with these unstable carotid&#xD;
      plaques may have higher inflammation in both their carotid arteries and brain. This&#xD;
      inflammation has been implicated in other diseases, including dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid wall bleeds can easily be seen with carotid MRI, but are often invisible on&#xD;
      ultrasound and CT scans. By using MRI, the invesigators have found that this silent killer is&#xD;
      an important stroke risk factor even without carotid narrowing. Now that imaging can detect&#xD;
      carotid wall bleeds, where do the bleeds come from? Recent research points to inflammation&#xD;
      within the carotid wall. The invesigators plan to use histology to detect this inflammation&#xD;
      in the vessel wall. Another question is, does inflammation in the carotid wall lead to&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain? Using PET scans, the invesigators plan to determine whether&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain is linked to carotid disease. Lastly, the invesigators hope to find&#xD;
      out if carotid wall inflammation contributes to memory loss and if surgery is beneficial in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invesigators hope to detect this inflammation in the vessel wall and brain before&#xD;
      patients develop stroke, memory loss and dementia. This will be of huge benefit not only in&#xD;
      the detection of diseases, but would also allow clinicians to monitor treatment effect on&#xD;
      both carotid disease and brain inflammation. The invesigators also hope to use these tools to&#xD;
      detect early treatment response. This research will accelerate the pace of future clinical&#xD;
      trials to bring important new medications to patients sooner.&#xD;
