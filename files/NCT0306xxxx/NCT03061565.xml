  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is catastrophic event that commonly require treatment in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit. Management is mainly supportive aiming at avoiding hypoxia, hypotension,&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia and increased intracerebral pressure. Thus far efforts to find a specific&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapies have been disappointing. Recently it was demonstrated that&#xD;
      recombinant erythropoietin has been found to decrease mortality at six months from injury but&#xD;
      without significantly improving functional neurological outcome (GOSe). Whether this survival&#xD;
      benefit of EPO is sustained beyond 6 months is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study survival data will be collected centrally and patients alive or person&#xD;
      responsible will be invited to participate in an evaluation of neurological function and&#xD;
      quality of life. Factors associated with time to death as well as factors associated with&#xD;
      long term quality of life will be determined with statistical methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim: In this post hoc study of a RCT the primary aim is to determine the effect of EPO&#xD;
      compared to placebo in improving outcome, including survival, neurological function and&#xD;
      quality of life two years after the conclusion of the EPO-TBI study (two to seven years after&#xD;
      moderate or severe TBI occurring in individual patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A long term follow-up study of a prospective, multi-centre, double blind, phase III,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Survival status at the time when this follow-up trial is executed will obtained in&#xD;
      all patients. Time from injury will vary between 2 to 7 years depending on when the patient&#xD;
      was enrolled. This information will obtained from hospital notes, national register offices&#xD;
      and/or national statistical bureaus. Since the trial was an international RCT, strategies may&#xD;
      vary and will take into account local circumstances. Local plans will be developed by the&#xD;
      local principal investigators and approved by the management committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data includes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival status at long term follow up (alive/dead)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from injury to assessment (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patients is deceased, time of death and time from injury in days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (or a proxy - generally a close family member) who are alive at 2-7 years after&#xD;
      randomisation will be interviewed by trained assessors. The same contact person as used in&#xD;
      the primary trial will be contacted primarily. Consent will be obtained for the conduction&#xD;
      for long term assessment. Assessors will use a standardized structured telephone&#xD;
      questionnaires to determine GOSE and QOL. Neurological outcomes will then be defined as&#xD;
      favourable (GOSE 5 to 8; moderate disability and good recovery) or unfavourable (GOSE 1 to 4;&#xD;
      death and severe disability). Data include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from injury in days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up GOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up EQ-5D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up SF-12&#xD;

        The EPO-TBI study conducted between 2010 and 2015 enrolled a total of 606 patients treated&#xD;
        for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury in the intensive care unit. Of these consent&#xD;
        was withdrawn in 3 patients. Of the 603 patients, 524 we alive at 6 months. Survival status&#xD;
        will be checked in these 524 patients and those alive will be included in a follow-up of&#xD;
        functional recover and quality of life.&#xD;
