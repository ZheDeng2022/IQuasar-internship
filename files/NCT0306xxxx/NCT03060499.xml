      1.0 INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly known that the thyroid hormones affect the function of the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system. Several studies mention that these hormones influence the cardiac function and&#xD;
      geometry directly and indirectly. Three potential mechanisms have been described, which are&#xD;
      the direct cellular effect, the interaction with the sympathetic nervous system and changes&#xD;
      in peripheral circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have been already published , dealing with the correlation between thyroid&#xD;
      hormones and heart function. Only one of them have proved a suppressed ventricular&#xD;
      contractility after subtotal thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to compare the pre- and post-operative heart function after total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, using echocardiography. Outcomes will be assessed during patient&#xD;
      hospitalization and at three, six and twelve months' follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of total thyroidectomy on the function of the cardiac muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, single-center, cohort study. Any patient that is&#xD;
      scheduled for a total thyroidectomy will be offered participation in this study if they&#xD;
      fulfill specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted until at least 50 patients are treated. It is estimated that it&#xD;
      will take up to 12 months to enroll the patients and an additional 12 months to complete&#xD;
      follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STUDY PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Weight of the gland&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dimensions of the gland&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Postoperative follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluation will be performed during hospitalization as well as on the 3rd, 6th and&#xD;
      12th month after discharge. The following information will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wound condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Average Pain score for patient resting and moving/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative laboratory findings (Complete blood count, Ca2+, fT3, fT4, TSH, PTH, VitD)&#xD;

        6. Comments&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are required to notify the coordinators of any serious adverse events. The&#xD;
      coordinators are also required to notify the Ethics Committee according to local regulations&#xD;
      and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death regardless of cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any-life-threatening event&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any event that results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of total thyroidectomy on the&#xD;
      myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis includes description of the pre- and post-operative outcomes, and&#xD;
      indication of patient characteristics associated with these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study does not have pre-specified hypotheses all statistical analyses are&#xD;
      exploratory and interpretation of results should be within this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 DATA MONITORING PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinators will monitor all data. Furthermore, the coordinators will review the&#xD;
      progress of the clinical trial including safety data and ensure that it is conducted,&#xD;
      recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, good clinical practice and the&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be identified by his/her initials and a unique patient identification&#xD;
      number. Source data will be stored with source documents. Only personnel responsible for&#xD;
      collecting data and transcribing it into the case report forms will have access to the data.&#xD;
      Records will be protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 FUNDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      No funding for the execution of the present protocol is considered necessary. The&#xD;
      investigators are willing to execute the present study without any additional reimbursement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the onset of the study, institution review board (IRB) approval should have been&#xD;
      obtained. Any changes in the study protocol, informed consent forms, or investigator must be&#xD;
      re-approved by the IRB. All patients enrolled in the study will provide their consent prior&#xD;
      to entering the study. Informed consent forms shall be signed and dated by the patient. The&#xD;
      investigator will retain the forms as part of the study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be executed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, in agreement with&#xD;
      the guidelines for conducting a clinical investigation and the principles of ICH GCP outlined&#xD;
      in the E6 document. By signing the present protocol, participants in the study commit&#xD;
      themselves to carry it out with respect to local legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 INFORMED CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients should have the capacity to provide an written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above described inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure the entry of the&#xD;
      appropriate population of patients to this study and will be approved by the local IRB.&#xD;
      Screening for these criteria will be conducted by the coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be educated about the research proposal by a study investigator. To&#xD;
      determine whether the patient has understood the issues, they will be asked to describe what&#xD;
      the research entails and whether they have any questions. All questions will be addressed&#xD;
      prior to enrollment. The patient can decline participation in the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent form will be generated. For each patient, a case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      will be completed, providing general medical information and history.&#xD;
