  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of adding a new cancer&#xD;
      drug, venetoclax, to a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs as a second treatment for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL. In this study, venetoclax will be added to RICE (rituximab,&#xD;
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), a common set to cancer drugs used as a second line&#xD;
      treatment for relapsed/refractory DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax, is a new targeted anti-cancer drug, which works by mimicking a particular protein&#xD;
      produced by the tumor and interrupting its normal processes, ultimately causing the tumor&#xD;
      cells to die. Adding venetoclax to the standard RICE regimen is believed to increase the&#xD;
      chance of getting cancer into remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Venetoclax has been FDA approved for&#xD;
      use in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment of safety of V+RICE in order to identify the recommended Phase II dose (RPD2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of V+RICE relative to historical controls of&#xD;
           RICE alone in r/r DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the proportion of patients who proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           after V+RICE relative to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients&#xD;
           treated with V + RICE who do and do not proceed to auto-Stem Cell Transplant, relative&#xD;
           to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure total number of peripheral blood stem cells collected in patients treated with V&#xD;
           + RICE who proceed to stem cell mobilization/harvesting, compared to historical&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;

Phase I part of this study is a 3 + 3 design, with 3 dose levels, a minimum of 6 participants (maximum of 18) will be required to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
Phase II involvs two stages: In stage I, a total of 16 participants will be accrued. If there are 7 or fewer complete responses (CR), the study will be stopped. Otherwise, an additional 30 participants will be accrued in stage II.&#xD;
The maximum number of treatment cycles with V+RICE is three. Participants who achieve complete remission at the interim response assessment after 2 cycles may omit cycle 3 in order to proceed to subsequent consolidation therapy with autologous stem cell transplant (AHSCT).&#xD;
Participants will proceeed to other treatment including RICE, other chemotherapy, peripheral blood stemm cell collection, and ASCT per institutional guidelines.</description>
