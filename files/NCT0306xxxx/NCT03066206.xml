    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well poziotinib works in treating patients with non-small&#xD;
      lung cancer with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutation that is stage IV or has come back. Poziotinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) to poziotinib according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with&#xD;
      EGFR exon 20 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the objective response rate (ORR) to poziotinib according to RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
      in NSCLC with HER2 (ErBB2) exon 20 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable response) of poziotinb&#xD;
      in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression free survival of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Overall survival of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently. IV. Duration of&#xD;
      response of poziotinb in cohort 1 and 2, analyzed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Safety and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess molecular markers associated with resistance and response to poziotinib,&#xD;
      including secondary mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive poziotinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
