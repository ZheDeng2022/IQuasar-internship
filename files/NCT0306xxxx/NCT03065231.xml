  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasospasm is a common complication after rupture of intracranial aneurysms causing&#xD;
      devastating neurologic deficits and death. Vasospasm has been directly associated with the&#xD;
      amount of subarachnoid blood inside the basal cisterns. Prior literature has attempted to&#xD;
      refine treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms but does not have clear guidelines on the&#xD;
      optimal method to drain subarachnoid blood. Two methods, extraventricular drain (EVD) and&#xD;
      lumbar drain (LD) have been compared retrospectively yet remain controversial as to which&#xD;
      method is optimal in reducing subarachnoid blood and preventing vasospasm. This study would&#xD;
      be a prospective randomized trial in which patients would be assigned to EVD or LD and&#xD;
      observed to see if one method of intervention is associated with preventing clinical&#xD;
      vasospasm, decreasing subarachnoid blood, shortening overall ICU stay, and reducing the need&#xD;
      for a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The conclusions of this study may identify an&#xD;
      optimal treatment modality to benefit all future patients with ruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Participants will be patients&#xD;
      admitted at UCSD Hillcrest or Thornton Hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited by the Endovascular Neurosurgical treatment team. Since there are no existing&#xD;
      guidelines existing for procedural drainage of subarachnoid blood from the intracranial&#xD;
      cisterns, patients are currently treated with either lumbar drain or extraventricular drain.&#xD;
      This study would randomize the process of assigning patients to either LD or EVD as part of&#xD;
      their treatment package for subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both EVD and LD are regularly performed at UCSD. Both procedures are equally likely to take&#xD;
      place if patients do not have randomization. There is currently no gold standard that&#xD;
      dictates whether EVD should be done over LD and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented to partake in the study while they are also consented for their&#xD;
      usual care in SAH. Briefly, inclusion criteria are patients with Fisher Grade II, III, IV SAH&#xD;
      or any aneurysmal SAH patients with radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus. Briefly,&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are patients with obstructive hydrocephalus or mass lesion that would&#xD;
      preclude lumbar drain placement. Pregnant patients or minors of age &lt;18 will not be included&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two arms of the study: patients randomly assigned to LD and patients randomly&#xD;
      assigned to EVD. Randomization will account for Fisher Grade. The two treatment arms will&#xD;
      have CSF diversion for 7 days. For patients treated with lumbar drain, patients will have CSF&#xD;
      drainage of 10cc/hour for lumbar drain while patients treated with EVD at 15cm above the&#xD;
      tragus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both an extraventricular drain and a lumbar drain are defined as significant risk devices&#xD;
      however both devices are FDA approved and will be utilized in the exact manner that they are&#xD;
      intended. Both devices are already regularly utilized and a part of the standard of care for&#xD;
      sub arachnoid hemorrhage management and will not be utilized in any novel way. LD and EVD&#xD;
      assignment will be randomized through the protocol of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via electronic medical record and will assess patient age, patient&#xD;
      presenting Hess grade and clinical improvement post cerebrospinal fluid diversion, aneurysmal&#xD;
      bleed day on presentation, method and technical success of securing aneurysm (clip versus&#xD;
      coil), size and location of aneurysm, discharge disposition and clinical exam (NIH Stroke&#xD;
      Scale), complications (tract hemorrhage or infection), need for intra-arterial management of&#xD;
      vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Sample size in this study will include approximately 200 patients in which half of&#xD;
      patients included in this study will be treated with LD and the other half treated with EVD.&#xD;
      The number of estimated patients is calculated from the annual incidence of SAH received at&#xD;
      UCSD hospitals. The facilities that are available for this project include UCSD Hillcrest&#xD;
      Hospital, UCSD Thornton Hospital, and the UCSD Endovascular Neurosurgery suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be time to clearance of acute cisternal blood by&#xD;
      surveillance CT (stratified by presenting Fischer Grade), need for endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      vasospasm or stroke from vasospasm, time spent in the critical care unit, and need for&#xD;
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding CT scans; Surveillance CTs are standard of care. They are typically performed on&#xD;
      the day of device placement and subsequent imaging takes place pending clinical resolution of&#xD;
      the patient. For most patients, they have an additional CT scan 1-2 days after initial device&#xD;
      placement and a final scan on the 7th day of device placement. If clinical condition&#xD;
      deteriorates, patients will have an additional scan to monitor for intracranial bleeding. The&#xD;
      scans are performed for the clinical purpose of monitoring resolution of intracranial injury.&#xD;
      This study would collect the data obtained from the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total exposure resulting from these imaging studies is calculated to be approximately 10&#xD;
      mSv. Additional head CT may be performed if clinically indicated with exposure 2.5 mSv per&#xD;
      scan. Fluoroscopy is not routinely used, however if clinically indicated, may be utilized&#xD;
      during lumbar drainage procedure with radiation exposure 1.5 mSv per minute. This amount is&#xD;
      more than one would receive from one year of natural exposure in the San Diego area, which is&#xD;
      approximately 1.6 mSv. Cumulative exposure from radiation may increase a person's risk of&#xD;
      developing certain types of cancer in the future. This imaging is determined to be part of&#xD;
      routine care and management of SAH. In this study, we will be merely collecting data from&#xD;
      these images to determine clinical incidence of vasospasm and resolution of cisternal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSM criteria were derived from Al Tamimi et al. The initial power calculation was based off&#xD;
      of the Al Tamimi et at study 9 that demonstrated that for 85% power, 105 patients were&#xD;
      required in each arm of the trial. Interim analysis will be performed after recruiting 40&#xD;
      patients in order to establish adverse effects and an additional reevaluation at 100 patients&#xD;
      to determine if one arm of the study is superior to the other. If this is identified, the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped at recruitment of 100 patients. Statistical analysis will continue&#xD;
      throughout the trial. If statistically significant differences between both arms of the study&#xD;
      are identified earlier in the enrollment process, the study will be discontinued. Monitoring&#xD;
      will take place internally in which the differences between the two groups will be examined&#xD;
      for each additional 5 patients added to both groups. Internal monitoring will take place by&#xD;
      (D.R.S.D., A.W., R.R., A.K., S.P.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods to evaluate data include chi square test, using independent t tests for&#xD;
      normal numerical data, and comparing categorical data with Fisher exact test. P value of .05&#xD;
      will be considered clinically significant in this study.&#xD;
