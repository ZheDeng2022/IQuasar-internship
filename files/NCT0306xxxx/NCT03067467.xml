  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, purely observational, feasibility study to detect metabolic changes&#xD;
      in patients with brain malignancy using a novel hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRSI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to test the hypothesis that patients with brain malignancy&#xD;
      present altered [1-13C]lactate and 13C-bicarbonate production from infused hyperpolarized&#xD;
      [1-13C]pyruvate in tumor as compared to in normal-appearing brain regions. To achieve this&#xD;
      aim investigators will assess metabolic phenotype in cancer patients with brain tumors (n =&#xD;
      8) and in healthy control subjects (n = 8). Total target enrollment will be set at 25&#xD;
      subjects to allow for attrition and screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each imaging session, following localization of the tumor in brain, tissue&#xD;
      characteristics and morphological changes will be evaluated with 1H MRI. Then, cerebral&#xD;
      metabolism will be assessed utilizing 13C MRSI after an intravenous injection with&#xD;
      hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate. Finally, contrast-enhanced 1H MRI will be acquired. The study&#xD;
      agent, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate, will be administered under a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND), which was approved on 1/3/2017 (IND#&#xD;
      133229).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data in human are essential to secure larger scale funding required for clinical&#xD;
      studies. The investigators believe the ability to measure such metabolic shifts in vivo could&#xD;
      have major significance in assessing the efficacy of multiple anti-tumor therapies currently&#xD;
      under development that target reversing the Warburg effect as a means of controlling tumor&#xD;
      growth. Brain tumor applications at the Advanced Imaging Research Center, Harold C. Simmons&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Neuro-Oncology Program of the Development of Neurological&#xD;
      Surgery at the UT Southwestern Medical Center offer today a unique opportunity to lead&#xD;
      globally the translational scientific efforts in this field.&#xD;
