  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been well established that only 40 to 60% of the patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) positively respond to volume expansion (VE). The fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness is usually estimated by assessing VE-induced change in stroke volume (SV). To&#xD;
      guide prescriptions and possibly avoid deleterious effects of inappropriate VE, several&#xD;
      clinical studies demonstrated that invasive dynamic indices based on heart-lung interactions&#xD;
      permit an accurate prediction of the hemodynamic effects induced by VE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation induces cyclic changes in intrathoracic and transpulmonary pressures&#xD;
      that transiently affect venous return, right and left ventricular preload, resulting in&#xD;
      pronounced cyclic changes in SV in preload-dependent, but not in preload-independent&#xD;
      patients. These cyclic changes in SV can be evaluated by the cyclic changes in arterial pulse&#xD;
      pressure. Several studies have shown that pulse pressure variation is able to predict fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in patients in the operating room and intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this technique requires percutaneous arterial catheterization, which is associated&#xD;
      with several rare but serious complications (thrombosis, infections, pseudoaneurysm,hematoma,&#xD;
      and bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A method for assessing noninvasive arterial blood pressure using an electropneumatic control&#xD;
      loop was introduced by Penaz in 1973. Briefly, the blood volume in a finger is measured and&#xD;
      kept constant by applying corresponding external pressure. The continuously changing external&#xD;
      pressure needed to keep the volume constant directly corresponds to the arterial pressure&#xD;
      and, therefore can be used as continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure. Numerous&#xD;
      studies evaluating the accuracy of this technology, e.g., Finapres™ (Ohmeda Monitoring&#xD;
      Systems, Englewood, CO), and more recently of the Infinity CNAP™ SmartPod (Dräger Medical AG&#xD;
      &amp; Co.KG, Lübeck, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic operating principle of the CNAP™ is similar to the Finapres™, but CNAP™ uses&#xD;
      multiple control loops. It has recently been shown that CNAP provides real-time estimates of&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) comparable with those measured by an invasive&#xD;
      intraarterial catheter system during general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the measures and the respiratory variations in pulse pressure obtained with&#xD;
      the CNAP system have not yet been studied in ICU.&#xD;
