  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital myasthenia and LEMS are potentially lethal disorder, which, even with careful&#xD;
      management, significantly impedes participation in normal daily functions. Currently approved&#xD;
      therapies have had little impact on promoting a normal quality of life activity in these&#xD;
      patients. The goal is to systematically examine the effect of 3,4-DAP on the natural course&#xD;
      of this disease and to gain additional experience in titrating 3,4-DAP with other available&#xD;
      therapies to maximize clinical function and development in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the use of 3,4 Diaminopyridine (DAP) on&#xD;
      selected patients proven by genetic or serum antibody testing to have Congenital Myasthenic&#xD;
      Syndrome (CMS) or Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). We will evaluate the patient for&#xD;
      CMS or LEMS, prescribe 3,4 DAP, and then clinically evaluate the response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subject population will consist of selected patients proven by genetic testing, muscle&#xD;
      biopsy or antibody testing to have CMS or LEMS. Consideration for entry in our clinical study&#xD;
      will require referral from a treating pediatrician or neurologist. Dr. Maselli will examine&#xD;
      patients and deem which are appropriate for neurophysiologic examinations at the University&#xD;
      of California, Davis Medical Center. In vitro neuromuscular recordings of anconeus muscle&#xD;
      biopsy material (as well as standard light and electron morphologic analysis) or&#xD;
      documentation of a genetic mutation associated with congenital myasthenia will be required in&#xD;
      some patients to confirm the diagnosis of CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant decides to volunteer, and if the diagnosis of Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome&#xD;
      (CMS) or Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) has not been established, the participant&#xD;
      may need to undergo a muscle biopsy or a blood sampling for DNA testing. The investigators&#xD;
      will obtain a blood test (serum chemistry) before participants start treatment and then once&#xD;
      a year after the start of 3,4-DAP treatment. Participants will also have an&#xD;
      electrocardiograph (EKG) before starting treatment, and every 2 years after the start of&#xD;
      3,4-DAP treatment. All study participants will then return to the clinic once each year (or&#xD;
      more often if the neurologist feels it is necessary) for follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive treatment with the study drug until it is approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      use in patients with CMS or LEMS, until the investigator stops the study drug (because it&#xD;
      doesn't work for the participant or it is unsafe for to take), or until the study is ended&#xD;
      for other reasons (i.e. safety concerns are discovered, etc.), whichever comes first.&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to stay on other medications for myasthenia or add other&#xD;
      medications to treat their condition, as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have an unclear history of episodes resembling seizures as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator, they should not to drive or operate heavy machinery for the first 6 months of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may not participate in this study if they are pregnant or breastfeeding or if&#xD;
      they are a woman of childbearing potential who plans to become pregnant while on the study.&#xD;
      It is unclear how 3,4 DAP can effect an unborn fetus. Therefore, women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential will have a pregnancy test prior to starting the study drug and periodically&#xD;
      throughout the study, if needed. Participants who think they may have become pregnant during&#xD;
      the study should tell the study doctor immediately.&#xD;
