  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate whether an increase in step rate can be used to reduce pain&#xD;
      and injury causing movement patterns in runners who are currently experiencing achilles&#xD;
      tendonopathy, iliotibial band syndrome, patellofemoral pain syndrome and medial tibial stress&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many injuries have been reported to share similar injury causing movement patterns. For&#xD;
      example iliotibial band syndrome and patellofemoral pain syndrome have been reported to be&#xD;
      caused by increased side to side drop of the pelvis and inward movement of the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait retraining is a method of changing the way people run in order to change movement&#xD;
      patterns.Increasing step rate may present a gait retraining method that does not pose further&#xD;
      injury risks and can be used across multiple different injury populations. Studies have shown&#xD;
      increasing step rate can reduce frontal plane movement patterns at the pelvis, hip and foot&#xD;
      as well as reducing sagittal plane joint angles such as ankle dorsiflexion. Based on the&#xD;
      changes in movement patterns increasing step rate has been recommended as an intervention for&#xD;
      the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome, medial tibial stress syndrome, iliotibial band&#xD;
      syndrome and achilles tendonopathy. Therefore this study aims to investigate whether an&#xD;
      increase in step rate can reduce pain and change injury causing mechanics in runners&#xD;
      currently running with patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, medial tibial&#xD;
      stress syndrome or achilles tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to use a simple gait intervention, increasing step rate to&#xD;
      investigate if this technique change can reduce pain immediately, at short term follow up and&#xD;
      long term follow up. The project will also look at whether an increased step rate can be&#xD;
      maintained at follow up and whether this changes movement patterns proposed to be the cause&#xD;
      of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Runners will be recruited from local running clubs and competitions using poster&#xD;
      advertisement at running clubs and emailed to running clubs&#xD;

      All data will be collected at the university of Salford podiatry clinic gait laboratory.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from running clubs and races via poster advertisement sent via&#xD;
      email to the running club and on advertisement at the club. Also participants presenting at&#xD;
      the running performance clinic with patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome,&#xD;
      medial tibial stress syndrome and achilles tendonopathy will be invited to take part in the&#xD;
      research study investigating the effects of gait retraining on injury. Participants who agree&#xD;
      to take part will be sent an email confirming their appointment along with an information&#xD;
      sheet detailing the study which they are encouraged to read before attending the appointment.&#xD;
      They will have contact details of the lead researcher should they wish to ask any further&#xD;
      questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives above will be addressed via the following data collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arriving at the running clinic participants will be informed that the gait retraining&#xD;
      intervention aims to reduce pain when running and that there is a risk that the retraining&#xD;
      protocol will not affect their pain. If there are no improvements to symptoms following gait&#xD;
      retraining they will be then directed to the appropriate medical service for further&#xD;
      management. Participants will be informed as to the procedures and given the chance to read&#xD;
      through an information sheet again detailing the procedures involve. If on reading the&#xD;
      information sheet participants do not wish to take part they can terminate the appointment at&#xD;
      any time. Before data collection begins participants will sign a consent form, a running&#xD;
      history form and a health screening questionnaire will be completed by a qualified&#xD;
      physiotherapist in order to assess the patients suitability to complete the assessment with&#xD;
      no further risk to their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend two visits 4 weeks apart. The first visit will consist of an initial&#xD;
      assessment data collection and a retraining session. Detailed below. The second visit will&#xD;
      consist of the same procedures in the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Assessment data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the appropriate self reported outcome measure: if iliotibial band&#xD;
      syndrome or patellofemoral pain syndrome they will complete the Lower extremity Functional&#xD;
      Index and the Anterior Knee Pain Scale. If they present with medial tibial stress syndrome&#xD;
      they will complete the medial tibial stress syndrome score and the Lower Extremity Functional&#xD;
      Index. If they present with achilles tendonopathy they will complete the VISA - A score and&#xD;
      the Lower Extremity Functional Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before running retroreflective markers will be attached to the subject on specific points of&#xD;
      their body: shoe, ankle joint, knee joint, greater trochanter of the hip, thigh, lower leg,&#xD;
      pelvis (anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine, iliac crest), lumbar&#xD;
      spine, thoracic spine, sternum and acromion process off the shoulders. This marker placement&#xD;
      is according to a protocol previously established and validated in a project undertaken at&#xD;
      the University of Salford. A qualysis motion capture system will then be used to track the&#xD;
      movement of these markers as the participant runs on a treadmill. Once the marker data has&#xD;
      been collected then we will use custom software to calculate the kinematic (joint movement)&#xD;
      patterns for each person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are required to run on a treadmill at two different speeds (3.2, 3.8m/s). These&#xD;
      speeds have been chosen based on running speeds used in previous research to allow&#xD;
      comparability between studies. If participants feel they are unable to run at these speeds&#xD;
      they can run at a self selected running speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be given a 6 minute accommodation period running on the treadmill at 3.2m/s. At&#xD;
      this point data will then be collected for 1 minute of running in order to gain data for ten&#xD;
      steps of running for the right and left feet. Speed will then be increased to 3.8m/s where&#xD;
      they will be given a 1 minute accommodation period with data collected for a further minute&#xD;
      of running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified physiotherapists will monitor the patients feels ok to continue at each 2 minute&#xD;
      interval. At the end of data collection for each running speed the participant will be asked&#xD;
      to rate their current level of pain on a scale of 0 = no pain to 10 = sever pain. If at any&#xD;
      point the participants pain exceeds 8 out of 10 or the participant feels they can no longer&#xD;
      continue running the data collection will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps will be identified when the foot markers are in contact with the treadmill, once ten&#xD;
      steps have been collected the data will be averaged across all trials for right and left&#xD;
      feet. During the data collection injured participants will be asked to rate their current&#xD;
      level of pain while running using a numerical rating scale 0 = no pain and 10 = sever pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retraining Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once data has been collected participants will then be asked to run for a further 5 minutes&#xD;
      at each speed under an increased step rate condition with data collected for the final 1&#xD;
      minute of the trial. Step rate will be calculated as number of steps per minute. Step rate&#xD;
      will then be increased by 10% and participants instructed to run to an audible metronome to&#xD;
      ensure the step rate increase is achieved. Again at the end of each running speed&#xD;
      participants will be asked to rate their current level of pain using a numerical rating&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data collection participants will be permitted up to a further 15 minute practise&#xD;
      session running to maintain the increase in step rate without the metronome present to allow&#xD;
      participants to adjust to the new running technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be instructed to continue their current level of running using the new&#xD;
      running technique. Participants will have contact details to the lead researcher (email and&#xD;
      phone number) and will be requested to provide weekly updates regarding their running and if&#xD;
      any pain is experienced. This will ensure patients are continuing to improve, not running&#xD;
      with an increase in pain and are able to ask any questions they may have. If patient's&#xD;
      symptoms are increasing they will be informed to stop running and terminated from the&#xD;
      assessment and directed to the appropriate medical professional for further assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reassessed between 3 weeks and 5 weeks later following the same&#xD;
      procedures outlined in the initial assessment data collection as well as at a 3 month follow&#xD;
      up following the same procedures to investigate long term improvement.&#xD;
