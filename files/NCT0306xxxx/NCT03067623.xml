    <textblock>
      The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate the increasing in endometrial thickening&#xD;
      after the intrauterine infusion of 0,5-1 ml of autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) and the&#xD;
      implantation rate in women with thin endometrium undergoing Embryo-transfer, in order to&#xD;
      propose a novel therapeutic approach for women with an endometrium &lt; 7 mm unresponsive to&#xD;
      standard treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, a thin endometrium, unresponsive to conventional therapies, usually&#xD;
      results in cycle cancellation and embryo cryopreservation. The evaluation of an adequate&#xD;
      endometrial growth is performed using grey-scale ultrasound. The minimal endometrial&#xD;
      thickness required for embryo transfer is now considered about 7 mm at the end of natural or&#xD;
      medically induced follicular phase, despite some investigators reported different cutoff&#xD;
      values, ranging between 7 and 10 mm. Currently, no evidence-based data show the predictive&#xD;
      positive value of endometrial thickness on pregnancy rate after Embryo-transfer, but if the&#xD;
      endometrial lining is below 7mm the chance of pregnancy is statistically significant reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thin endometrium is relatively frequent in women with previous trauma of the uterus (cesarean&#xD;
      sections, repetitive curettage), patients subjected to antitumoral treatments in childhood&#xD;
      (Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Surgery), women affected by Asherman's syndrome, chronic&#xD;
      infections (endometritis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) and inadequate blood flow (stress,&#xD;
      malposition of uterus, fibrosis), patients with low estradiol values or excessive use of&#xD;
      Clomiphene Citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several alternative treatments have been proposed over the years to improve the endometrial&#xD;
      thickening, then showed themselves to be not considered the answer in many cases: some of&#xD;
      them, indeed, require a not damaged endometrium, other act on endometrial blood flow and have&#xD;
      no direct proliferative effect on the endometrium. The only factor presumed to have a&#xD;
      proliferative effect on endometrium is the Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) but&#xD;
      this hypothesis is not supported by in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, first results from an in vitro study ongoing on the evaluation of Platelet-Rich&#xD;
      Plasma (PRP) effect on endometrial cell proliferation have been presented (Aghayanova et al.,&#xD;
      2016). The authors demonstrated that PRP increased proliferation not only on cultured&#xD;
      fibroblasts, as currently known but also on mesenchymal cells, which are progenitors of&#xD;
      different types of cells, including endometrial cells. This evidence supports the hypothesis&#xD;
      that PRP stimulates some of the cellular processes involved in endometrial regeneration, that&#xD;
      can be relevant to the management of a thin lining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma is prepared from fresh whole blood which is collected from a&#xD;
      peripheral vein and processed to separate platelets from the other blood components. PRP&#xD;
      contains activating platelets that stimulate the action of cytokines and growth factors. On&#xD;
      the basis of this evidence, local intrauterine infusion of PRP may improve endometrial growth&#xD;
      and implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered to be candidates for a PRP application must undergo a minor hematological&#xD;
      evaluation to exclude blood disorders or platelet dysfunction. The study, since it involves&#xD;
      the use of a blood component, was approved by Ethical Committee and all participant have to&#xD;
      sign an informed written consent before undergoing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any concerns of immunogenic reactions or disease transmission, that exist with homologous&#xD;
      blood products, are eliminated because PRP is produced from autologous blood. Preparation of&#xD;
      PRP, however, demands many processing steps, thus there is the theoretic possibility of&#xD;
      contamination. For these reasons, all samples are subjected to quality and sterility controls&#xD;
      within a closed mechanism. No wound infections after PRP applications have been reported.&#xD;
      Despite PGF has mitogenic properties, there is no evidence that the growth factors included&#xD;
      in PRP promote tumor growth or that they are involved in carcinogenesis.&#xD;

    <description>PRP will be obtained from a fresh whole blood collected from a peripheral vein; the blood sample will be centrifuged at 1500g (RCF) for 10 minutes and the repeated reversal of the tube will allow obtaining the PRP at the concentration required. Then 0,5-1ml of PRP will be infused into the uterine cavity through a Tomcat catheter. The endometrial thickening will be evaluated by ultrasonography 24-48h after the instillation and, if the endometrial lining reaches 7mm the Embryo-transfer will be arranged.</description>
