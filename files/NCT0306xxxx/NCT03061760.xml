  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate men before radical prostatectomy for the incidence of&#xD;
      Overactive Bladder (OAB), as well as urge urine incontinence (UUI) development after the&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be evaluated for signs of OAB and for signs of Bladder Outlet&#xD;
      Obstruction (BOO). Afterwards they will be divided into four observational groups. Follow up&#xD;
      period is designed to be 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy remains the standard treatment in case of organ-confined and in&#xD;
      selected cases of locally advanced prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy consists of&#xD;
      removing the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, ideally with negative surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the patients who present urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy have stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence. However in some cases the post-surgical urinary incontinence is also&#xD;
      due to urgency caused by overactive bladder development defined as urge urinary incontinence.&#xD;
      Recent clinical observations suggest that men can also develop overactive bladder after&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate men before radical prostatectomy for the incidence of&#xD;
      Overactive Bladder (OAB) and it's development after the surgery. Before surgery questionnaire&#xD;
      assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms will be performed using International Prostate&#xD;
      Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. OAB symptoms will be analyzed using King's questionnaire,&#xD;
      as well as using two different OAB symptom score (OABSS) designed by Blavis et al. and Homma&#xD;
      et al. Each patient will have transabdominal ultrasonographic evaluation of the prostate and&#xD;
      urinary bladder structure. Prostatic dimensions width (W), height (H), length (L) and volume&#xD;
      will be recorded. The ultrasonography will be done in urinary bladder filling related to&#xD;
      normal desire to void. Urinary bladder wall thickness (BWT) and detrusor muscle thickness&#xD;
      (DWT) will be measured in sagittal plane in anterior bladder wall. The mean of three&#xD;
      following measurements BWT and DWT will be obtained. The urinary bladder weight (UEBW:&#xD;
      Ultrasound Estimated Bladder Weight) will be also estimated. After ultrasonography each&#xD;
      patient will undergo uroflowmetry with post-void residual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the results above 4 groups will be formed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 OAB (-) BOO (-)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 OAB (-) BOO (+)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 OAB (+) BOO (+)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 OAB (+) BOO (-)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain detail information about the surgery (time, blood loss,&#xD;
      histopathological outcome, nerve sparing, complications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluation of the patients before surgery, the control evaluation is set on&#xD;
      1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month after radical prostatectomy in groups 1-4 to define the lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms after radical prostatectomy related to pre-surgical patient clinical&#xD;
      feature. During each of the following controls the investigator will not have the access to&#xD;
      previously obtained data from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, healthy volunteers aged 20 to 40 will be assigned as a control group.&#xD;
