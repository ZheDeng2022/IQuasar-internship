  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test an intervention for children and adolescents ages 8-17&#xD;
      years with sickle cell disease and their families. In the first phase of this study, key&#xD;
      informant interviews are being conducted with health care providers and children ages 8-17&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease and their primary caregivers. Participants are asked to review the&#xD;
      intervention and provide feedback that will inform revision to the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Key informant, semi-structured interviews are conducted using an interview guide to obtain&#xD;
      expert provider (healthcare providers of children with SCD) and end-user (children and&#xD;
      parents/caregivers) feedback on the intervention. Interview questions are designed to solicit&#xD;
      information on advantages and disadvantages, perceived usefulness, and recommendations for&#xD;
      improvement on the intervention. The interviews will last approximately 1 hour and are audio&#xD;
      recorded. Recordings are transcribed for analysis. Data are analyzed using a&#xD;
      deductive-inductive approach with the intervention as a framework for initial categories.&#xD;
      Findings will inform revisions to the intervention. Feasibility testing of the revised&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted in the next phase of the study.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be delivered via a mobile device (tablet) and consists of three components. 1. Education, will consist of continuous access to electronic educational resources on the SCD process, treatment, home management strategies, symptom prevention and management strategies. To address potential literacy barriers, an application that reads PDF files aloud will be downloaded onto devices. 2. symptom monitoring and tracking, will consist of an application for tracking and monitoring pain in SCD that also permits upload of symptom logs and text alerts to a health care provider. 3. caregiver-provider communication, consists of SMS messaging with a nurse who will: respond to alerts, monitor pain symptoms delivered via the mHealth application, and respond to text messages.</description>

        Up to 15 parent/caregiver child dyads (30 individuals) and up to 15 healthcare providers&#xD;
        will be recruited and enrolled in the study. No sex/gender or racial/ethnic group will be&#xD;
        excluded. However, it is anticipated that the majority or all of the parent/caregiver child&#xD;
        dyads will be African American since SCD is predominantly seen in this population. Pregnant&#xD;
        women will not be excluded. Children ages 8-17 years will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
        this study. Participation will include child-parent/caregiver dyads to solicit feedback&#xD;
        from both groups and obtain a more comprehensive, family-level perspective on the&#xD;
        intervention.&#xD;
