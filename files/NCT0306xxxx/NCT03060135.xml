  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of popular, freely available online interventions targeting hazardous&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, most have limited or no published evidence regarding&#xD;
      their efficacy. Of particular interest is the intervention, 'Hello Sunday Morning.' The&#xD;
      current project proposes to evaluate its' efficacy employing a RCT, using The Check Your&#xD;
      Drinking intervention as an active comparator in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Potential&#xD;
      participants identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to&#xD;
      complete another survey in 6 months time. Those who agree to be followed-up will be assigned&#xD;
      by chance to be asked versus not asked to access one of the interventions and then&#xD;
      recontacted 6 months later to ask about their drinking and their impressions of the online&#xD;
      intervention. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that participants receiving access to&#xD;
      any of the online interventions will report a greater level of reduction in number of drinks&#xD;
      in a typical week between the baseline survey and six-month follow-up as compared to&#xD;
      participants in the control condition.&#xD;
