  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (SCT), especially after myelo-ablative conditioning and if the donor is&#xD;
      antigen-mismatched or haplo-identical.. In the described setting the patient's own immune&#xD;
      system has been destroyed by the necessary highly immuno- and myelo-ablative conditioning and&#xD;
      all memory against infections has been deleted. Therefore, there is a high risk for several&#xD;
      viral infections and other infectious organisms.Both primary viral infections and&#xD;
      reactivations can occur, and patients can become refractory to antiviral treatments, or in&#xD;
      some cases an adequate antiviral treatment is unavailable or too toxic. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will target CMV, as refractory CMV infection and disease is accompanied by an&#xD;
      extremely high mortality rate and therefore the development of new treatment approaches is&#xD;
      required. Despite the available antiviral drugs, a considerable number of patients are facing&#xD;
      an insufficient control of CMV reactivation after SCT. Because reconstitution of CMV-specific&#xD;
      T cells confer protection against the development of CMV disease after SCT, attempts have&#xD;
      been made to restore antiviral immunity by direct infusion of CMV-specific T cells. Most&#xD;
      clinical cellular immunotherapy protocols for CMV treatment have used CMV-specific cytotoxic&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cell lines generated by repetitive in vitro stimulation with CMV antigens with&#xD;
      success. Despite the proven efficacy, use of cellular therapy in the clinic has been limited,&#xD;
      because the approach is time and labor consuming and requires specialized facility allowing&#xD;
      handling of the therapeutic cells according to good manufacturing practice. In addition, no&#xD;
      sustained response was seen after adoptive transfer that involved only cytotoxic CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells. This phenomenon is supported by the fact that recall responses to latent infections&#xD;
      depend on the presence of CD4+ T cells to help cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. An alternative&#xD;
      approach for the transfer of T-cell immunity is the isolation of Ag-specific T cells ex vivo&#xD;
      from the blood of CMV seropositive donors, based on interferon γ (IFN-γ) secretion of T cells&#xD;
      after in vitro stimulation with viral Ag, resulting in a combination of CD4+ T helper and&#xD;
      cytotoxic CD8+ CMV specific T cells. Using this strategy, a short-term ex vivo protocol was&#xD;
      developed for the isolation of pp65 (CMV immunodominant protein)-specific T cells. Since&#xD;
      then, several centers have used this protocol in the clinic, infusing low numbers of&#xD;
      pp65-specific T cells, that were able to restore protective T-cell immunity against CMV in a&#xD;
      post SCT setting in patients with refractory CMV disease or viremia. For this protocol the&#xD;
      investigators have set up and validated this method of CMV-specific T-cell generation in the&#xD;
      Ghent University Hospital and the investigators will make it available for other Belgian&#xD;
      transplant centers.&#xD;
