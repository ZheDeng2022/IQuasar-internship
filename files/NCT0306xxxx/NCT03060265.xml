      Protective analgesia in caesarean section using intravenous paracetamol: A prospective&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial. Cesarean section a common surgical procedure in women. The&#xD;
      parturients undergoing CS experience severe to moderate postoperative pain. Pain relief is&#xD;
      very important to the patient as it causes discomfort which affects hemodynamic&#xD;
      intraoperative and increases the risk of postoperative complications. Analgesia is crucial to&#xD;
      postoperative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To investigate the efficacy of combined administration of paracetamol, as protective&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia, and standard spinal anesthesia in the reduction of postoperative pain&#xD;
      following cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty adult Parturients undergoing CS will participate in a single-centered, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial divided into 2 groups 30 each. The intervention&#xD;
      group will receive 1 gr of intravenous paracetamol in 100 ml normal saline only 15 minutes&#xD;
      prior to spinal anesthesia induction. The control group will receive 100 ml normal saline IV&#xD;
      identical in size and shape and manner to the experimental group, 15 minutes prior to&#xD;
      induction of spinal anesthesia. We will measure postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain&#xD;
      score, postoperative time to analgesia in PACU and number of postoperative analgesic doses&#xD;
      within 24 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (CS) is one of most common surgical procedure in women. Parturients&#xD;
      undergoing CS, experience severe to moderate postoperative pain. Pain after CS may impair the&#xD;
      ability of mother to care and feed her child, early ambulation, and discharge. About 12.3% of&#xD;
      parturients experience pain scores enough to affect infant care up to 6 months after CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of perioperative stress effects, before delivery of the baby, such as, skin incision,&#xD;
      need various approaches of treatment, which may include systemic and neuraxial analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical trauma causes immediate changes in both peripheral and central nervous systems,&#xD;
      leading to augmentation of pain perception in the final destination - the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      The surgical incision induces secretion of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which increases the&#xD;
      production of prostaglandins (PGs), and which in turn excites peripheral nociceptors. These&#xD;
      special pain fibers not only transmit the pain signal to the central nervous system, but also&#xD;
      amplify tissue sensitivity to the surgical trauma, giving rise to the phenomenon known as&#xD;
      &quot;local hyperalgesia&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improper pain control during the perioperative period leads to complications, which may&#xD;
      affect the outcome of CS. Pain relief is very important to the patient as the pain causes&#xD;
      discomfort which affects hemodynamic intraoperative and increases the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complications as atelectasis, ineffective, coughing and inadequate ventilation. Adequate pain&#xD;
      control is essential not only intraoperatively, but also in immediate postoperative period to&#xD;
      cover long time period postoperatively. The major role of intra- or post-operative management&#xD;
      of pain is to reduce the dose of medication and to lessen side-effects, while providing&#xD;
      adequate analgesia. This role may best be accomplished with multimodal protective analgesia&#xD;
      or preemptive analgesia. Protective multimodal analgesia term is described as any&#xD;
      intraoperative analgesic agents able to control pain-induced sensitization of the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Preemptive analgesia had been defined as an antinociceptive treatment, starts&#xD;
      before surgery that to prevent establishment of altered central afferent input from injuries&#xD;
      and its goal is to decrease pain by timing the analgesic's peak pharmacodynamic effect with&#xD;
      anticipated onset of pain or peak pain response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective analgesia is distinguished from pre-emptive analgesia in that it focuses less on&#xD;
      the treatment and on the relatively timing and the anesthetic intervention but rather more on&#xD;
      the mechanisms of action. Protective analgesia aims to decrease the impact of the nociceptive&#xD;
      barrage associated with noxious pre-operative, intra-operative, and/or post-operative&#xD;
      events/stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic opioids either intra- or post-operatively have potential of serious adverse&#xD;
      reactions or risks for neonate and they act on opioid center in central nervous system.&#xD;
      Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is mostly used for treating pain and fever, typically for mild to&#xD;
      moderate pain. In combination with opioid agents, paracetamol is used for more severe pain&#xD;
      such as in cases of cancer and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol is devoid of risks related to opioid and acts at both central and peripheral&#xD;
      points of the pain pathway, by direct inhibition of N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors and&#xD;
      inhibition of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia using local anesthetics combined with opioids affects the transmission,&#xD;
      modulation and modification stages of nociceptive afferent impulses and its analgesic&#xD;
      qualities are superior to local anesthesia alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study where paracetamol as pre-emptive analgesia was compared to placebo in paediatric after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy patients, found that pain score was lower in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing lower extremity surgery with spinal anesthesia, protective&#xD;
      acetaminophen may enhance analgesia and decrease postoperative analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the combined use of paracetamol with spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia/analgesia for pre, intra and postoperative multimodal pain protection in&#xD;
      parturients undergoing cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is therefore; to assess the efficacy of combined administration of&#xD;
      paracetamol and standard spinal anesthesia in the reduction of postoperative pain following&#xD;
      cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be&#xD;
      conducted at Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel (following the approval and according to&#xD;
      the regulations of the Helsinki Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria consist of parturient age between 18 and 40 years, a maximal American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Score of II, parturients undergoing first elective&#xD;
      cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria consist of current or previous chronic NSAID or opioid treatment, liver or&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, asthma, cardiovascular disease, allergy to paracetamol or other NSAIDs.&#xD;
      Parturients with ASA III, IV and whom past a spinal anesthesia failure will be also excluded&#xD;
      from the study. All parturient participants will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parturients will be blindly and randomly allocated to 2 groups, consisting of 30 patients&#xD;
      each, randomization will be performed with a computer-generated. The experimental group&#xD;
      participants will be treated with 1 gr paracetamol (under the brand name Paracetamol® B.&#xD;
      Braun, Germany) intravenous provided in 100 ml normal saline in a single intravenous dose in&#xD;
      a double-blind mode. Where in the control placebo group participants will be provided with&#xD;
      the same bag of 100 ml normal saline medication free. Each bag contains the patient&#xD;
      allocation number, the package identification number, the bag type (A for paracetamol or B&#xD;
      for placebo). Separate sealed envelopes will be provided to the investigator to be opened in&#xD;
      the event of a serious adverse event. The treatment will be conducted in both groups at the&#xD;
      same time, 15 minutes prior to spinal anesthesia induction. [The control group will receive&#xD;
      100 ml normal saline identical in size and shape to the treatment drug, 15 minutes prior to&#xD;
      induction of spinal anesthesia.] All parturients will receive spinal anesthesia using 10-12mg&#xD;
      of bupivacaine for local anesthesia and 25μg of fentanyl. The agents will be administered by&#xD;
      senior anesthesiologists, who are not involved in data collection. The same surgical team&#xD;
      will perform all cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to demographic data parturient age, weight, the following parameters will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
           saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain intensity level presented in VAS scale (0- none, 10-the worst imaginable pain)&#xD;
           will be estimated and marked at arrival in PACU ,2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours&#xD;
           postoperatively will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative time to first administration of analgesic dose (Time-to-Analgesia; TTA)&#xD;
           will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of analgesic doses administered within the first 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When in the PACU and in surgical ward, the VAS score ≥4, 1-3 mg of morphine IV in&#xD;
           titration boluses will be administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain relief will be evaluated and recorded on a five-point scale (0 - none, 1 - a&#xD;
           little, 2 - some, 3- a lot, and 4- complete). Analgesic agents will be titrated till&#xD;
           pain score reaches zero or stage 1 (a little pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects such as local pain, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 30 parturients by group is calculated to detect a significant difference of&#xD;
      20% or more in intraoperative opioid consumption with a power of 100% two-tailed and a&#xD;
      significant level of 5% (alpha of 0.05) corresponding to level of confidence 95%. Data will&#xD;
      be reported as mean ± SD and counts (numbers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 30% difference in postoperative analgesic doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 40 minutes difference for TTA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 30 % difference in the postoperative VAS score. Statistical assessment includes&#xD;
           analysis of Student's t-test for continuous data and VAS pain data. Fisher's exact&#xD;
           t-test will be used to analyze nominal data. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered to be&#xD;
           significant for all tests. All analyses will be performed using the SPSS statistical&#xD;
           software, version 15 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
