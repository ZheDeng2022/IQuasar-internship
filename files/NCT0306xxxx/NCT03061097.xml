      This study, a Randomized controlled trial of Autologous microbiome reconstitution to prevent&#xD;

             Adenovirus, or 5) Shiga toxin, the enrollment stool will be sent out to test for these&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We enrolled 78 patients across four nursing homes from July 10, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Of these 78, a total of 33 individuals were able to provide a stool sample of sufficient quantity to undergo procedures required for preparation of autologous FMT. As specified in the protocol, only participants that had stool processed into autologous FMT and subsequently received a course of antibiotics will undergo randomization. Out of the 33 eligible participants, a total of 7 were ultimately randomized</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 7 randomized participants, 3 participants withdrew prior to administration of FMT. A total of 26 enrolled participants were withdrawn or discontinued prior to randomization for reasons including: enrollment in hospice care, passing away from age-related comorbidities, withdrawal of consent, and non-compliance. The remaining 45 enrolled participants were removed at study closure since they did not meet criteria for randomization at the time of closure.</pre_assignment_details>

      <desc>For the placebo arm: All three (3) participants assigned to placebo arm withdrew post-randomization but pre-treatment administration. One (1) participant was outside of treatment window following antibiotic exposure and therefore no longer eligible to receive the treatment. Two (2) participants withdrew consent prior to administration of the intervention.</desc>

          <description>Participants randomized into the treatment arm will receive a single dose of autologous fecal microbiota preparation (auto-FMP) via enema following an infectious episode requiring antibiotics, with follow-up at day 3, 7, 28, and 6 months.&#xD;
Route of Administration: Enema Dosing Regimen: 125mL x 1 dose&#xD;
Autologous fecal microbiota transplant (Auto-FMP Enema): FMT is the process by which processed donor microbiota material is transplanted into recipients. The aim is to reconstitute the normal intestinal microbial flora in recipients. In this study, the fecal microbiota preparation will be made from the participant's own stool and processed into an auto-FMP enema formulation.</description>

The placebo enema preparation will be identical in appearance but will not contain human feces to prevent unmasking of the trial arms.&#xD;
