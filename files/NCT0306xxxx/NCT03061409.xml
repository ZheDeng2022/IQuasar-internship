  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrient intake through diet and nutritional supplements are critical determinants of plasma&#xD;
      nutrient status. In addition, untoward drug-nutrient can contribute to nutritional&#xD;
      inadequacy. Among medications used by the elderly in the US, diuretics, metformin, and proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitors (PPIs) are ranked among the most commonly prescribed. Use of these&#xD;
      medications is variously associated with inadequate status of many micronutrients, e.g.,&#xD;
      vitamins B1, B9 (folate), B12, C, and thiamine and the minerals calcium, iron, potassium,&#xD;
      magnesium, and zinc. While diets rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help&#xD;
      decrease the risk for micronutrient inadequacy in older adults using one or more of these&#xD;
      drugs, supplementation may prove more effective to restoring and/or enhancing their nutrient&#xD;
      status. When compared to a placebo, investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      multivitamin-multi-mineral (MVM) supplement will improve nutritional status in older adults&#xD;
      at increased risk of micronutrient inadequacy induced by drugs commonly used by this&#xD;
      population, specifically diuretics, metformin, and PPIs. Investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      MVM supplementation will beneficially modify selected biomarkers or biochemical pathways of&#xD;
      cellular function/health. To test these hypotheses, investigators will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) To determine the extent by which&#xD;
      MVM supplementation (compared to placebo) will increase the plasma status of vitamins B12, C,&#xD;
      D, folic acid, and thiamine and the minerals iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc; 2) To&#xD;
      quantify indices of 'metabolic health' including one or more of the following biomarkers:&#xD;
      glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio, ubiquinol/ubiquinone, malondialdehyde&#xD;
      (MDA), asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), selected cytokines and chemokines, homocysteine,&#xD;
      methylmalonic acid (MMA).&#xD;

      The older adults are prone to inadequate nutrition. The prevalence of malnutrition is 5-10%&#xD;
      among independently living older individuals, 30-60% among institutionalized patients, and&#xD;
      35-65% among hospitalized geriatric patients. There are many factors that make the elderly&#xD;
      more susceptible to nutrition inadequacy. Aging itself is associated with a decline in a&#xD;
      number of physiological functions that can impact nutritional status, including reduced lean&#xD;
      body mass and a resultant decrease in basal metabolic rate, decreased gastric secretion of&#xD;
      digestive juices and changes in the oral cavity, sensory function deficits, changes in fluid&#xD;
      and electrolyte regulation, and chronic diseases. In addition, medications can contribute to&#xD;
      nutritional inadequacy through many mechanisms, from decreased nutrient absorption in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract to increased metabolism and from enhanced utilization to rapid&#xD;
      elimination It has been reported there are &gt;250 drugs that may influence the intake,&#xD;
      absorption, metabolism and excretion of nutrients. As Americans rely more on prescription&#xD;
      drugs, many are taking multiple drugs daily, so polypharmacy can increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      drug-nutrition interactions through additive and synergistic actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel clinical&#xD;
      trial to test the hypotheis. This trial will include 72 older adults randomized to receive&#xD;
      either placebo or MVM supplement. Participants will be 45-75 y and have a BMI &gt;20 and &lt;36&#xD;
      kg/m2. Participants will be receiving regular, chronic pharmacotherapy with â‰¥2 drugs in the&#xD;
      following drug classes: a diuretic, metformin and/or proton pump inhibitor medication with&#xD;
      allowance for a total of less than 7 drug prescriptions. The medication history with one of&#xD;
      the target drugs will be longer than 6 mo. The total duration of the trial will be ~5 mo,&#xD;
      including screening and 16 wk of intervention. Participants must maintain their medication&#xD;
      regimens and dietary habits throughout the intervention. During the intervention phase,&#xD;
      Participants will take the assigned supplement daily. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the baseline, 8 wk, and the end of the 16 wk intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the supplements (MVM vs. placebo)&#xD;
      after their eligibility is confirmed. A randomization scheme will be prepared by a&#xD;
      biostatistician using a standardized computer program for two treatment groups using a&#xD;
      parallel design. The nutrient composition of MVM supplement, which will be Pharmavite Nature&#xD;
      Made Multi for Him 50+ (newly manufactured). A matching placebo product will be manufactured&#xD;
      by the Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (San Marcos, CA) under the FDA Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practices(GMP) guidelines. The main ingredient of the placebo will be&#xD;
      microcrystalline cellulose containing 0.5% magnesium stearate. Pharmavite Nature Made Multi&#xD;
      for Him 50+ has been marketed in US, and both microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium&#xD;
      stearate have a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status under FDA Code of Federal&#xD;
      Regulations (CFR) title 21.&#xD;
