  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children have increased in recent years and this&#xD;
      has been associated with replacing plain water intake by sugar-sweetened beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      school-based intervention that aimed to replace sugar-sweetened beverages by water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized community trial including 314 children aged 9-11 years from three public schools&#xD;
      of the State of Hidalgo, Mexico was performed. Schools were randomized to intervention (two&#xD;
      schools from municipality of Apan; six classes with 146 participants) or control group (one&#xD;
      school from municipality of Emiliano Zapata; six classes with 168 participants) and followed&#xD;
      during 6 months. Intervention included to place water filters at school and classroom lessons&#xD;
      to increase water consumption and decreasing sugar-sweetened beverages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized community trial, that included children of both sexes belonging to&#xD;
      public elementary schools, grades 4 and 5, in Hidalgo, Mexico, including the municipalities&#xD;
      of Emiliano Zapata and Apan. It was excluded from school children with Type 1 Diabetes, heart&#xD;
      failure, kidney or liver that limit fluid intake by medical prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 334 (167 in each group) children would allow to detect a difference of 9% in&#xD;
      water consumption between the two groups15, considering a loss to follow-up of 20%, a power&#xD;
      of 85% and a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of the schools of the two communes was based on the availability of a place to&#xD;
      conduct physical assessments and intervention. Schools were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention (IG) or control groups (CG). Each group included 3 classes of fourth grade and 3&#xD;
      classes of fifth grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from school principals, teachers, parents and students.&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas&#xD;
      y Nutrición Salvador Zubiran, in Mexico City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Study variables were measured at baseline and at 6 months after intervention.&#xD;
      Weight was measured with a portable scale (SECA professional scale model 750, Seca North&#xD;
      America East, Hanover, MD) with a capacity of 150 kg and a precision of 1kg, height (SECA&#xD;
      model 280 portable stadiometer, Seca North America East, Hanover, MD) with an amplitude of&#xD;
      220 cm and variation of 1 mm. Subjects were weighed and measured with minimal clothing and no&#xD;
      shoes21. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in kg) divided by stature2 (in m).&#xD;
      Classification of nutritional status was based on z-scores of the BMI-for-age and sex from&#xD;
      the distributions of the World Health Organization using the Anthro-Plus software22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition was evaluated by bioelectric impedance, using multiple frequency equipment&#xD;
      (RJL Systems, Detroit, MI). Resistance and reactance were obtained to estimate body fat and&#xD;
      fat-free mass were estimated using equations23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugar-sweetened beverage and water plain consumption were measured at the beginning and end&#xD;
      of the study through a 24-hour recall using ESHA Food software with an SQL processor (version&#xD;
      7.9, ESHA Research, Salem, OR, 2001)., with face-to-face interviews in each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention focused on encouraging students to change their drinking habits&#xD;
      over 6 months (from January to June) in the school year of 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, reusable plastic water bottles and jugs were delivered at school&#xD;
      and water filters were placed. Classroom lessons lasting 30 minutes were conducted weekly by&#xD;
      trained nutritionists. These sessions included general nutritional recommendations,&#xD;
      encouragement of simple water plain consumption and discouragement of consumption of&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages, through a manual of drinks, developed by nutritionists. In the&#xD;
      control group only general nutritional recommendations were given.&#xD;
