  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlorhexidine is the most potent chemotherapeutic agent against mutans streptococci and&#xD;
      dental caries, however, the incidence of side effects such as teeth discoloration, staining&#xD;
      of restorations, undesirable taste, discoloration of tongue, dryness and burning sensation in&#xD;
      the mouth discourage patients to use this mouth wash. Natural products are now preferred by a&#xD;
      large proportion of the population and have been reported to possess antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity.These products have recently been shown to be a good alternative to synthetic&#xD;
      chemical substances for caries prevention like Cinnamon and Ginger. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to compare the antimicrobial effects of aqueous extracts of cinnamon 20% and ginger 20% in&#xD;
      comparison to chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% on oral streptococcus mutans&#xD;

      Sample Size Calculation The aim of this study is to compare the antimicrobial effects of&#xD;
      aqueous extracts of cinnamon 20% and ginger 20% in comparison to chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%&#xD;
      on oral streptococcus mutans. 2 way with repeated measures analysis of variance will be&#xD;
      performed to study the effect of different solutions at different times. Based on previous&#xD;
      papers, a large effect size is expected (f=0.4). a minimum total sample size of 18 patients (&#xD;
      6 in each group) will be sufficient with the power of 85% and a significance level of 5%.&#xD;
      This number is to be increased to 21 to compensate for losses during follow up. The sample&#xD;
      size was calculated using G*Power program (University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany).&#xD;
      Recruitment Patient will be recruited from the outpatient clinic in the conservative&#xD;
      department after explaining the benefits from the application of the interventions to their&#xD;
      oral hygiene which is natural unlike other chemicals mouth rinses that has complications such&#xD;
      as staining, and burning sensation; from which eligible patients will be recruited to fulfill&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be computer generated using (www.randomization.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation of rinsing agents to groups will be done through sealed black opaque envelopes to&#xD;
      ensure complete concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third party will perform the allocation sequence and assign the participants to rinsing&#xD;
      agent in sequentially numbered opaque envelops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation group will be blinded from those assessing the outcome, data collectors, and&#xD;
      data analysts. The microbiologists will be blinded by labeling the specimens with&#xD;
      non-identifying terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.M will collect the baseline data through a chart which is composed of medical, dental&#xD;
      history and clinical examination for every patient will be filled. The report will be&#xD;
      anonymous where patients identified by their serial numbers (the first letter of the first&#xD;
      and last name and date of birth) only will be registered. N.M will write the full detailed&#xD;
      personal data of the patient in a separate sheet having the patient's serial number for&#xD;
      further contact with patient, this sheet can only be seen by N.M. and the M.M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A microbiological technician will assess the viability counts of Mutans Streptococci in&#xD;
      patients saliva at baseline and after 30 minutes, one hour and tow hours of rinsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient retention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.M. should understand the participant the final result will be expected and how it will&#xD;
      differ in his/her oral hygiene. N.M. will told the participant that the whole procedure will&#xD;
      take a short time and it will be painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry will be carried out by N.M. and revised by M.M.. All data will stored on computer&#xD;
      and will be encrypted using a password. This will be done to allow accurate data entry&#xD;
      through revision and protect data from being incorrectly used. Data will be packed up on&#xD;
      another storage device to prevent it from being lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences, version 21 (SPSS Inc. Chicago. IL). Numerical data will be described as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or median and range. while qualitative data will be described as number&#xD;
      and percentage. 2 way with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed.&#xD;
      A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All tests&#xD;
      will be two tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.H. will monitor this study. Her role is to monitor any risk of bias could be done from&#xD;
      participants, operator or assessors. Also to monitor blinding of the assessors and patient&#xD;
      safety, outstanding benefits or harms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.M. should inform participants about the possible harms, if present. Participants are&#xD;
      allowed to contact the operator at moment through telephone. The data will be reported to&#xD;
      N.M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present trial, auditing will be done by the main and co-supervisors (H.H and M.M) to&#xD;
      assure quality of the research methods and interventions. Ethics and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application forms for carrying out the clinical trial, checklist and informed consent of&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (CREC) Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University will&#xD;
      be retrieved and filled, then will be delivered for (CREC) committee for approval, this is&#xD;
      done to prevent any ethical problems during the study or any harm for any of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol amendments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a new protocol will be used a protocol amendment will be submitted; containing a new copy&#xD;
      of the new protocol and brief explanation about the differences between it and the previous&#xD;
      protocols. If there is a change in the existing protocol that affect safety of subjects,&#xD;
      investigation scope or scientific quality of the trial, an amendment containing a brief&#xD;
      explanation about the change will be submitted. If a new author will be added to accomplish&#xD;
      the study, an amendment including the investigator's data and qualifications to conduct the&#xD;
      investigation will be submitted to prevent ghost authorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent or assent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.M. is responsible for admitting and signing the informed consents during the enrollment&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name and personal data of the participants will not appear on the protocol form and will be&#xD;
      maintained secured for 10 years after the trial. This is done for protection of participants'&#xD;
      privacy and civil rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declaration of interests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no conflict of interest, no funding or material supplying from any parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to final data will be allowed to the operator N.M. and main and co-supervisors (H.H.&#xD;
      and M.M.) of the study who are involved in assessment of the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary and post-trial care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be followed up after intervention as there is no harm from our material we&#xD;
      used .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full protocol will be published online in clinical trials website to avoid repetition and to&#xD;
      keep the integrity of the research work. Thesis will be discussed in front of judgment&#xD;
      committee. The study will be published to report the results of this clinical trial.&#xD;
