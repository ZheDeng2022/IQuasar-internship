  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast Track Surgery (FTS) was started in colorectal surgery, but was later applied to other&#xD;
      surgical fields. Core elements include epidural or regional anaesthesia, perioperative fluid&#xD;
      management, minimally invasive surgical techniques, pain control, and early mobilization and&#xD;
      feeding. Beneficial effects of FTS include reduced costs, early hospital discharge, and&#xD;
      increased availability of hospital beds.The main aim of this study was to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of FTS in the Rwandan surgical setting and to demonstrate the benefits of FTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is study comparing the management of surgical patients using traditional management and&#xD;
      fast track surgery. the study was done on patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery only&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fast track surgery (FTS) uses a multifaceted approach to reduce the stress response to&#xD;
      surgery, thereby improving outcomes and decreasing length of hospital stay. The core elements&#xD;
      of FTS include: epidural or regional anesthesia, peri-operative fluid management, minimally&#xD;
      invasive techniques, optimal pain control, early initiation of oral feeding and early&#xD;
      mobilization. The combination of these approaches has led to a significant reduction in&#xD;
      complication rates, morbidity and mortality rates, duration of hospital stay and costs of&#xD;
      hospitalization, and greatly improved postoperative recovery The main aim of this study was&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy of FTS in the Rwandan surgical setting and to demonstrate the&#xD;
      benefits of FTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized control trial was conducted in CHUK over a period of three months (October -&#xD;
      December, 2015). For patients in the FTS arm, the study investigator would assess patients on&#xD;
      a daily basis and work with the primary surgical team. The study investigator would prompt&#xD;
      the primary surgical team for early feeding, mobilization, pain control and fluid management&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected on variables including postoperative analgesia, mobilisation, resuming&#xD;
      oral feeding, hospital stay and complications. The primary outcome was duration of&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay and secondary outcome was major complications.&#xD;
