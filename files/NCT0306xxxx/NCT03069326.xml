    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drugs called&#xD;
      ruxolitinib and thalidomide. Ruxolitinib and thalidomide could shrink the cancer, but it&#xD;
      could also cause side effects.&#xD;

             thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera) requiring therapy, including those previously&#xD;
             treated and relapsed or refractory, or if newly diagnosed, with intermediate-1 or -2&#xD;

             Ruxolitinib for a minimum of 4 weeks immediately prior to enrollment. However, for&#xD;
             patients in the thrombocytopenic cohort A expansion, patients taking Ruxolitinib at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment who are deemed to have a suboptimal response or are refractory&#xD;

             malignancies with indolent behavior such as prostate cancer treated with radiation or&#xD;
             surgery can be enrolled in the study as long as they have a reasonable expectation to&#xD;
