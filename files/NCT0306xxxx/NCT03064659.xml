      During general anesthesia, functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced. If the FRC is lower&#xD;
      than the minimum volume required to maintain the opening of the airways, there is a&#xD;
      derecruitment of the lung parenchyma, leading to the phenomenon of expiratory flow limitation&#xD;
      (EFL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Driving Pressure (DP) is the difference between the plateau pressure (Pplateau) and the&#xD;
      Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), and estimates the lung strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of EFL and the importance of DP are not known in adult cardiac surgery, so it's&#xD;
      necessary a study to assess both. The primary end-point of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      correlation of DP and EFL with PPCs in adult cardiac surgery. The secondary end-point of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate: the mechanical ventilation time, the length of ICU and hospital stay,&#xD;
      the rehospitalization and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a prospective, observational, non-pharmacological study. It will enroll 200&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective adult cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia, functional residual capacity (FRC) is reduced. If the FRC is lower&#xD;
      than the minimum volume required to maintain the opening of the airways (closing capacity),&#xD;
      there is a derecruitment of the lung parenchyma, leading to the phenomenon of expiratory flow&#xD;
      limitation (EFL). Numerous factors contribute to the EFL, including hyperoxia, muscle&#xD;
      paralysis, the increase of the volume of the interstitial fluids and the inflammatory&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the presence of EFL under general anesthesia, it was developed a test known as&#xD;
      PEEP test. It is the sudden removal of 3 cm H2O to the value of positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEP test): in the EFL the subtraction of the expiratory pressure does not produce&#xD;
      an increase of expiratory flow. The use of different modality of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery may impact on the incidence of EFL post CEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Driving Pressure (DP) is the difference between the plateau pressure (Pplateau) and the&#xD;
      Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), and estimates the lung strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate the correlation of DP and EFL with PPCs in patients undergoing elective cardiac&#xD;
      surgery performed with extracorporeal circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-point of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consider whether there are factors associated with the development of EFL, especially&#xD;
           comorbidities and ventilation mode during surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in&#xD;
           intensive care (ICU), PaO2/ FiO2 at discharge from the ICU, development of respiratory&#xD;
           complications, duration of hospital stay and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a prospective, observational, non-pharmacological study. It will enroll 200&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective adult cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate will be set to maintain PaCO2 at values close to eucapnia. It will be used&#xD;
      to pressure-controlled ventilation (Pinsp ≤ 35 cm H2O) only if the controlled ventilation is&#xD;
      reached and exceed the maximum airway pressures. In this case it will be necessary to check&#xD;
      that the volume delivered by the ventilator is really, for the entire period, the chosen&#xD;
      volume. The inspiratory way will be composed of O2, air and maybe the halogenated anesthetic.&#xD;
      The O2 concentration will be increased gradually in case of desaturation up to maintain SpO2&#xD;
      93-95% trying not to exceed the FiO2 of 0.8 if it will be choice a protective ventilation&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning from the CEC will include a single alveolar recruitment maneuver, in which the airway&#xD;
      pressure will be increased to 40 cm H20 for 7 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end the patients will be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for&#xD;
      post-operative monitoring. During the transfer will be supported with mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      performed manually by the anesthetist resuscitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extubation in ICU will run in according to the protocol of the center. It could be used any&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia that provides NRS at rest ≤ 3 and dynamic NRS (cough) ≤ 4 and allow&#xD;
      an active chest physical therapy (CPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the section devoted to the preoperative treats will be fit the patient data related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, weight, height, sex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive respiratory history of: previous pleural-parenchymal disease within 30 days&#xD;
           prior to the intervention, previous surgery of the thorax, pleura or lung, presence of&#xD;
           pleural effusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of smoking cigarettes: Active smoking (number of cigarettes), ex-smoker or&#xD;
           non-smoker;&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other information relevant for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the schedule about the post-operative treats will be collected the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative mechanical ventilation time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative respiratory complications;&#xD;

           hospitalization, length of stay);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other information about the postoperative relevant to the study The study does not&#xD;
           interfere with the normal anesthetic activity, it does not provide for variations from&#xD;
           the procedures currently used and the PEEP test use does not involve pathophysiological&#xD;
           changes for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). It will be collected&#xD;
      anamnestic information, data about surgery and post-operative clinical data, in particular&#xD;
      respiratory parameters. Definitions and use of outcome measures are in according to the&#xD;
      standards for European Perioperative Clinical Outcome (EPCO) definitions [Eur J Anaesthesiol&#xD;
      2015; 32:88-105].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with a professional statistical software. Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. Chi-square test will be used for dichotomous variables,&#xD;
      z-test/t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Statistical significance if p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
