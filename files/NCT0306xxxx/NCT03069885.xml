  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the Danish breast cancer-screening programme and the increased use of genetic&#xD;
      counselling, Danish women are being diagnosed with breast cancer, or a high lifetime risk of&#xD;
      developing breast cancer, at a younger age than previously. An increasing proportion of these&#xD;
      women pursue an immediate breast reconstruction, where the breast is removed and&#xD;
      reconstructed in a single surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As some of these women will need to undergo adjuvant cancer therapy after their breast&#xD;
      surgery, fast recovery is essential in order for the adjuvant therapy not to be delayed. With&#xD;
      the development of new surgical techniques, the complication rate to the immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstructions has improved. However, wound-healing issues remain one of the most common&#xD;
      complications to the surgery with the possibility of delaying the adjuvant therapy and&#xD;
      diminish the aesthetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT), is a new approach for surgical site&#xD;
      closure. Recently, iNPWT has shown promising results in lowering post-operative&#xD;
      complications, including wound-healing issues, in other surgical settings. However, iNPWT has&#xD;
      still not been studied in an immediate breast reconstructive setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current randomized controlled clinical study will investigate if an iNPWT system, is able&#xD;
      to provide women seeking an immediate breast reconstruction with faster healing and superior&#xD;
      aesthetic results compared to the conventional post-operative wound dressings used today. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to include 60 women, randomized in a 1:1 ratio between iNPWT or&#xD;
      conventional wound dressing. The primary outcome measure is the time until removal of the&#xD;
      surgical drains, which corresponds to the healing progression. Secondarily, complications to&#xD;
      the surgery, assessment of the scar (measured using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment&#xD;
      Scale) and patient reported satisfaction with the reconstruction (assessed using the BREAST-Q&#xD;
      questionnaire) will be performed. Included patients are examined pre-operatively, and at the&#xD;
      routine controls at four weeks and four months post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the current study will elucidate if iNPWT aids wound healing after immediate&#xD;
      breast reconstruction, which would lead to fewer patients experiencing delays before their&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, the results from the aesthetic satisfaction will elucidate if&#xD;
      iNPWT provides the patients with a better self-reported aesthetic result.&#xD;

      Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (Prevena™) vs. conventional post-operative&#xD;
      dressing after immediate breast reconstruction; a randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 60 years, there has been a steady rise in the incidence of breast cancer in&#xD;
      Denmark. Due to the Danish breast cancer screening program and the increasing use of genetic&#xD;
      counseling, patients are diagnosed with breast cancer, pre-cursors hereof, or an increased&#xD;
      lifetime risk of breast cancer at an earlier age than previously. In women with high&#xD;
      estimated risk of breast cancer, current studies indicate a reduced lifetime risk of cancer,&#xD;
      and thereby increased survival, when undergoing a risk reducing mastectomy. Therefore, Danish&#xD;
      women may choose to undergo a risk reducing mastectomy, if they have a estimated lifetime&#xD;
      risk of breast cancer at 30% or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Plastic and Breast Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, there&#xD;
      has been a rise in the number of immediate breast reconstructions performed, currently&#xD;
      counting approximately 200 per year. This increase is partly due to the increasing number of&#xD;
      prophylactic risk reducing mastectomies, as well as an increasing number of women choosing&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction when diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As some of these women will need to undergo adjuvant cancer therapy after their breast&#xD;
      surgery, fast recovery is essential in order for the adjuvant therapy to not be delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing surgery at a younger age, will presumably live for a longer time, with&#xD;
      possible complications of the immediate breast reconstruction. Therefore, a good result at&#xD;
      the first surgery and fast rehabilitation, are of essential importance for these women's&#xD;
      recovery and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate breast reconstruction, holds several benefits compared to mastectomy and&#xD;
      subsequent delayed breast reconstruction. Benefits such as rapid return to work, low&#xD;
      complication rate, good aesthetic outcome, and the need for only one surgery, but the surgery&#xD;
      is not free of complications. The complication rate in immediate breast reconstruction, is&#xD;
      reported in the range of 3,9% to 14,8 %, with the most frequent complications being skin&#xD;
      necrosis, surgical site infections (SSI), implant loss and haematoma/seroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT), is a new approach for surgical site&#xD;
      closure using negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Recently, PrevenaTM have been approved&#xD;
      as an iNPWT-system applied at the end of surgery, while still in a sterile environment.&#xD;
      PrevenaTM consist of a sponge foam with a bactericidal silver lining, dressed with an&#xD;
      adherent film, connected to a vacuum device, producing a vacuum of 125 mm Hg. The PrevenaTM&#xD;
      foam and dressing is placed over the suture line, and is recommended to be kept in place for&#xD;
      a continuous period lasting between 2 and 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iNPWT is based on the principles behind NPWT, most known as vacuum assisted closure (V.A.C.),&#xD;
      which is well described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPWT has been shown to be an efficient way of treating chronic wounds, by increasing blood&#xD;
      flow and formation of granulation tissue, stimulate cell proliferation and angiogenesis,&#xD;
      decrease bacterial count, reduce oedema, improve wound closure rates, collagen organization&#xD;
      and wound maturation in animal- and clinical-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, recently iNPWT has shown promising results in lowering post-operative&#xD;
      complications, with lower rate of surgical site infection, lower incidence of wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, and lower loss of split thickness skin grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an experimental porcine setup, indications of increased lymph clearance with lower&#xD;
      production of seroma/hematoma has been shown when using iNPWT. Additionally, in a&#xD;
      biomechanical analysis, Wilkes et al. found evidence of reduced lateral stress on wounds,&#xD;
      which in theory, could lead to faster closure and improved scar aesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, iNPWT has been shown to reduce several of the most frequent complications that may&#xD;
      occur following an immediate breast reconstruction. However, in an immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstructive setting, iNPWT has not yet been studied, and in breast surgery in general,&#xD;
      there is only limited data on the use of NPWT and iNPWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to investigate whether PrevenaTM provides a superior post-operative&#xD;
      wound treatment, when compared to conventional treatment, for women undergoing a prophylactic&#xD;
      or therapeutic mastectomy with an immediate breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      iNPWT, administrated by PrevenaTM, will reduce the post-operative complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing immediate breast reconstruction, compared to conventional post-operative dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate whether iNPWT provides superior wound treatment&#xD;
      for patients undergoing an immediate breast reconstruction, compared to treatment with&#xD;
      conventional post-operative dressing. The results from this study will possibly help to&#xD;
      minimize the complication rate and increase the patient satisfaction, by finding the optimal&#xD;
      wound treatment for immediate breast reconstructions and thereby contributing to a faster&#xD;
      recovery, for women who undergo this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is conducted as a randomized controlled trial. Patients included in the study&#xD;
      will be randomized to either conventional post-operative dressing or PrevenaTM iNPWT&#xD;
      treatment. Patients are allocated in a 1:1 ratio, with 30 patients treated with PrevenaTM and&#xD;
      30 patients treated with conventional post-operative dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           60 patients admitted for immediate breast reconstruction at the Department of Plastic&#xD;
           Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, will upon informed consent be offered participation&#xD;
           in this prospective, randomized study using two types of post-operation dressing after&#xD;
           the breast reconstruction surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks, side effects and disadvantages&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with all surgery, there is a risk of wound infection, blood clots and altered sensation in&#xD;
      the operated area. This can lead to antibiotic treatment, or where appropriate, a second&#xD;
      surgery to stop bleeding or remove damaged tissue. These risks are, however, associated with&#xD;
      the breast reconstruction itself, and not associated with participating in the research&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrevenaTM have been approved and used internationally as a post-operative dressing since&#xD;
      2010. PrevenaTM is well described in the medical literature, achieving good results compared&#xD;
      to conventional post-operative dressing, showing fewer, or the same amount of complications.&#xD;
      The risks for the patients choosing to participate in the project are thus solely related to&#xD;
      the breast reconstruction itself, and not to the participation in the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Economics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiators of this project are the Department of Plastic and Brest Surgery, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital. All costs of the investigated post-surgical wound treatment (PrevenaTM or&#xD;
      conventional post-operative treatment) are held by the Department of Plastic and Brest&#xD;
      Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital. Participating patients are not given any reimbursement.&#xD;
      Patients may, however, apply for reimbursement to cover documented travel expenses, in&#xD;
      regards to the regulations of the Central Denmark Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The salary for the scientific personnel, and cost of materials and conferences will be sought&#xD;
      covered by external funding from private and/or governmental funds. Funding will solely be&#xD;
      sought from foundations and scholarships, where the benefactors do not have a financial&#xD;
      interest in the outcome of the study. Furthermore, funding will only be sought from sources,&#xD;
      where the research project can remain independent from the contributor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive, negative, as well as inconclusive results are expected to be published in a&#xD;
      peer-reviewed international journal with interest in the field. Furthermore, the results are&#xD;
      expected to be presented at a national or international conference in plastic and&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the number of women seeking an immediate breast reconstruction will&#xD;
      increase. The proposed study will aid in finding the most optimal wound dressing following&#xD;
      this surgery. Conducting studies that help bring down the complication rates for these types&#xD;
      of surgery is of utmost importance, both for the individual patient undergoing the surgery&#xD;
      and in a socio-economic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients invited to participate in this study has been evaluated by experienced&#xD;
      breast and plastic surgeons to be best suited with an immediate breast reconstruction with&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrevenaTM, or iNPWT, have shown good results in previous studies in other types of surgery,&#xD;
      showing none or only minor complications. The general treatment, using steri strips, has been&#xD;
      used for many years as the primary choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigators expect fewer or the same amount of complications when using PrevenaTM,&#xD;
      there is no predictable disadvantage for the individual patient in regards to participating&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' privacy, physical and mental integrity and the Danish law concerning the&#xD;
      processing of personal data will be respected. Furthermore, the research project will be&#xD;
      carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is approved by the Central Denmark Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics,&#xD;
      see appendix 2 (in Danish) and registered at the Central Denmark Regions joint application&#xD;
      for the Danish Data Protection Agency, see Appendix 3 (in Danish).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the current study will elucidate if iNPWT aids wound healing after immediate&#xD;
      breast reconstruction, which would lead to fewer patients experiencing delays before their&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, the results from the aesthetic satisfaction will elucidate if&#xD;
      iNPWT provides the patients with a better self-reported aesthetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faster healing could potentially result in a shorter hospital stay. At the Department of&#xD;
      Plastic and Breast Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, the approximate cost per&#xD;
      hospitalization day is 4000 Danish kroner (DKK). With a price of 975 DKK., the&#xD;
      PrevenaTM-device could be a potential economical benefit, with an average reduction in&#xD;
      hospitalization time by just a single day. Finally, the potential cost savings do to fewer&#xD;
      post-operative complications, should be held in consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in all, the results from the current study may provide the increasing number of women&#xD;
      undergoing an immediate breast reconstruction with a shorter hospital stay, a better breast&#xD;
      reconstructive result and faster adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
