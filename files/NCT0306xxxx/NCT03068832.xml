  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early clinical development paradigm for chemotherapeutic agents has significantly&#xD;
      influenced the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, there are major&#xD;
      differences between these two classes of therapeutics that have important implications for&#xD;
      early clinical development. Specifically, the phase 1 concept of dose escalation to find a&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose does not apply to most therapeutic cancer vaccines. Most therapeutic&#xD;
      cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity at a range that is feasible to&#xD;
      manufacture or administer, and there is little reason to believe that the maximum-tolerated&#xD;
      dose is the most effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent article from the biostatistics literature, Simon et al. write that &quot;the initial&#xD;
      clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather&#xD;
      will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine â€¦ in most cases the dose selected will&#xD;
      be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. Using several dose levels in&#xD;
      the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity&#xD;
      relationship is generally not realistic&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial&#xD;
      is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The proposed clinical trial will test a&#xD;
      fixed dose of vaccine. There is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide&#xD;
      vaccine platform. The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety&#xD;
      profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of&#xD;
      the peptide). The dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other&#xD;
      similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. The&#xD;
      sample size (n=10-20) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;

Peptide vaccine administration will continue until supply is exhausted or development of intolerance or disease progression in the case of fatal high grade neoplasms. Otherwise, vaccination will continue until supply is exhausted or intolerance or one year for non-fatal tumors. Additionally, patients with non-fatal tumors who complete one year of vaccinations and have stable disease will be given the option of resuming vaccinations if they develop subsequent progression if remaining vaccine is available.</description>
