  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study outlines the safety of the autologous SVF cells injection in the hands of patients&#xD;
      with SSc. Preliminary assessments at 6 months will suggest potential efficacy needing&#xD;
      confirmation in a randomised placebo-controlled trial on a larger population&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with systemic sclerosis(scleroderma, SSc), impaired hand function greatly&#xD;
      contributes to disability and reduced quality of life, and is insufficiently relived by&#xD;
      currently available therapies. Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is&#xD;
      increasingly recognized as an easily accessible source of regenerative cells with therapeutic&#xD;
      potential in ischaemic or autoimmune disease. The investigators aimed to measure for the&#xD;
      first time the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of autologous SVF cells local&#xD;
      injections in patients with SSc with hand disability.&#xD;

        <description>Kapandji score (ranging 0 to 10) is validated measures in past studies as outcomes for hand disability. The Kapandji score is a tool useful for assessing the opposition of the thumb, based on where on their hand the patient is able to touch with the tip of their thumb. A score of 0 indicates no opposition, a score of 10 indicates maximal opposition.</description>

A total of six parameters (irregularly enlarged capillaries, giant capillaries, hemorrhages, loss of capillaries, disorganization of the vascular array and capillary ramifications) were measured using the semiquantitative manner on the scale ranging 0 to 3, indicating more severe as scores were higher. Each parameter was scored for four fingers of both hands, except thumbs, and the median score value of each parameter in both hands was finally presented.</description>

        <description>In order to assess the severity of microangiopathies in both fingers, a semiquantitative scoring system for nailfold capillary microscopic findings was adopted. A total of six parameters (irregularly enlarged capillaries, giant capillaries, hemorrhages, loss of capillaries, disorganization of the vascular array and capillary ramifications) were measured using the semiquantitative manner on the scale ranging 0 to 3, indicating more severe as scores were higher. Each parameter was scored for four fingers of both hands, except thumbs, and the median score value of each parameter in both hands was finally presented.</description>

        <title>Changes of Nailfold Capillary Microscopic Findings (Disorganization of the Vascular Array)</title>
        <description>In order to assess the severity of microangiopathies in both fingers, a semiquantitative scoring system for nailfold capillary microscopic findings was adopted. A total of six parameters (irregularly enlarged capillaries, giant capillaries, hemorrhages, loss of capillaries, disorganization of the vascular array and capillary ramifications) were measured using the semiquantitative manner on the scale ranging 0 to 3, indicating more severe as scores were higher. Each parameter was scored for four fingers of both hands, except thumbs, and the median score value of each parameter in both hands was finally presented.</description>
