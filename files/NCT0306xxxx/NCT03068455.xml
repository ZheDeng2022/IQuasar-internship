  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an investigational immunotherapy Nivolumab,&#xD;
      when combined with Ipilimumab, is more effective than Nivolumab by itself, in delaying the&#xD;
      return of cancer in patients who have had a complete surgical removal of stage IIIb/c/d or&#xD;
      stage IV Melanoma&#xD;
