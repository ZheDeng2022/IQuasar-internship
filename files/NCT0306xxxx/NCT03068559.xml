  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present prospective study was to assess dysphagia (occurrence, severity,&#xD;
      length) in head and neck cancer (HNC), from diagnosis to 18 months after their first line&#xD;
      treatment regardless of the treatment. The investigators have complied with the pre-listed&#xD;
      clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, pursuant to consensus on the dysphagia assessment, the investigators used&#xD;
      the Deglutition Handicap Index (DHI) questionnaire (Silbergleit 2012) for dysphagia screening&#xD;
      and patient's self-perception. This was the only questionnaire validated in French evaluating&#xD;
      the swallowing function by the patient (Woizard 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 criteria and objective measures of swallowing&#xD;
      function were also recorded and compared to DHI results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing is one of the main functions in which oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal functions&#xD;
      cooperate. Tumors in this area, as well as their treatments, can seriously impair the&#xD;
      swallowing function, inducing dysphagia, a common complication still badly diagnosed.&#xD;
      However, its impact is constant and always negative on the nutritional status, the treatment&#xD;
      feasibility and the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many teams have tried to determine assessment tools, prevalence and dysphagia treatment&#xD;
      strategies. Thus, recently, in 2014, Kraaijenga et al. made a systematic review of the&#xD;
      literature on these topics. Only 19 studies had been selected on the two previous years. Out&#xD;
      of them, 7 were also literature reviews, including Raber-Durlacher's paper listing all&#xD;
      dysphagia publications from 1990 to 2010. In the other 12 selected studies, 9 were&#xD;
      prospective ones but with either a small number of patients or a specific treatment focused&#xD;
      (e.g. Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy, radiochemotherapy). For the dysphagia&#xD;
      assessment, Kraaijenga et al. concluded that there is a need for simple self-evaluation&#xD;
      scales compared to professional evaluation ones. The recording of some global indicators of&#xD;
      functional status such as weight, dietary changes, nutritional tube dependence, is also&#xD;
      advised. They concluded that patient-reported measures were commonly applied and provided&#xD;
      complementary perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, in 2015, Schlinder et al. reported a consensus proposition on the management&#xD;
      of swallowing difficulties in head and neck patients treated by radiotherapy, that was&#xD;
      discussed in the 2013 Milan congress. Six clusters of statements about these difficulties&#xD;
      were reached related to: 1 and 2/ the assessment scales: one patient-reported -the MD&#xD;
      Anderson Dysphagia Inventory- and one operator-reported outcome scales -NCI CTCAE criteria;&#xD;
      3/ the risk factors: research of signs and symptoms of dysphagia consequences e.g.&#xD;
      aspiration; 4/ a preventive swallowing dysfunction evaluation (nutritionist and deglutologist&#xD;
      evaluation); 5/ radiotherapic precautions; 6/ Preventive and therapeutic swallowing&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present prospective study was to assess dysphagia (occurrence, severity,&#xD;
      length) in head and neck cancer (HNC), from diagnosis to 18 months after their first line&#xD;
      treatment regardless of the treatment. The investigators have complied with the pre-listed&#xD;
      clusters.&#xD;

&#xD;

      function were also recorded and compared to DHI results.&#xD;
