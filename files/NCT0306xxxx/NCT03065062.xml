  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for cancer&#xD;
      that might have a specific change in the phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PI3K) pathway.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is an open-label Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug or combination of investigational drugs and also tries to define the&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the investigational drug(s) to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot;&#xD;
      means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Palbociclib for the&#xD;
      participant specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has not&#xD;
      approved Gedatolisib alone or in combination with Palbociclb as a treatment option for the&#xD;
      participant's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study the investigators hope to determine if treatment with Palbociclib and&#xD;
      Gedatolisib will be tolerated and will help to shrink or stop the growth of the participant's&#xD;
      cancer. Palbociclib is an oral drug which has been shown to stop the cell cycle, which is the&#xD;
      way a cell initiates growth. Gedatolisib is thought to work by controlling a series of events&#xD;
      directing cell growth and survival. Gedatolisib may work to stop or slow activity within&#xD;
      tumor cells. By putting these two drugs together the investigators hope that it will have a&#xD;
      greater effect on cancer growth than either drug alone.&#xD;

             squamous cell carcinoma), or any tumor with suspected PI3K-pathway dependence (either&#xD;
             by mutation or by known biologic rationale, such as endometrial cancer. PI3K&#xD;
             dependence includes the presence of a PIK3CA-mutant hotspot mutation, PIK3CA copy&#xD;

             visible on imaging studies but does not meet RECIST criteria for measurable disease).&#xD;
             For Part II, participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be&#xD;
             recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
             See section 10 for the evaluation of measureable disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Creatinine within 1.5x the ULN institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting glucose ≤ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HbA1c ≤ 7.0%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of palbociclib and Gedatolisib (PF-05212384) on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 90 days after&#xD;
             discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from acute effects of any prior therapy to baseline or Grade ≤1 except for&#xD;
             Alopecia or AEs not constituting a safety risk in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently with the study&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;

             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use or anticipated need for food or medications that are known strong CYP3A4&#xD;
             inhibitors/inducers, including their administration within 7-days prior to the first&#xD;
             Gedatolisib (PF-05212384) or palbocilib dose and during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc &gt; 480 msec; history of QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc&#xD;
             prolongation, or Torsade de Pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of diabetes.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of other malignancy are ineligible except for the following&#xD;
             circumstances. Individuals with a history of previous malignancies are eligible if&#xD;
             they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are deemed by the investigator to&#xD;
             be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal or viral infection including&#xD;

             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use or anticipated need for food or medications that are metabolized by&#xD;
             CYP2D6, and of narrow therapeutic index including their administration within 10-days&#xD;
             prior to the first Gedatolisib (PF-05212384) dose and during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of herbal preparations including saw palmetto.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of drugs known to prolong QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors (including, but not limited to,&#xD;

             with palbociclib is prohibited.&#xD;
