  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality is a video game in which a person and their real-time movements are&#xD;
      represented on a screen in a virtual environment. This study will compare the use of&#xD;
      multi-user virtual reality (VR) to single-user VR to determine if either provides superior&#xD;
      engagement in upper extremity therapy and greater motivation to perform repetitive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke survivors will participate in a longitudinal study in which they will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to perform rehabilitative training with multi-user VR and single-user VR modes in&#xD;
      their homes. They will use each mode for 2 weeks, completing 4 session per week, each session&#xD;
      is 1 hour long. Upper extremity motor control, level of engagement, and active range of&#xD;
      motion will be assessed at time points during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject evaluations will take place before the intervention, at the midpoint of intervention&#xD;
      (between switching from multi-user to single-user modes, or vice versa), and at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to address two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if the use in-home multi-user virtual reality treatment results in&#xD;
      greater engagement in therapy compared with in-home single user virtual reality treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if in-home virtual reality treatment results in greater practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that stroke survivors will be more engaged in therapy when&#xD;
      training with the multi-user VR system and this will translate into greater practice.&#xD;
