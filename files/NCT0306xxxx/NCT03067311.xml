    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility of a clinical trial implementing I-CAT, a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention combining strategies to improve stress reactivity and increase meaningful&#xD;
      coping, as well as a range of possible proximal (e.g. autonomic, endocrine, immune indices of&#xD;
      stress reactivity, symptom severity) and distal measures (function, relapse, quality of life)&#xD;
      for 40 people with first episode psychosis in the context of a small randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating disorders that often results in a lack of&#xD;
      functional recovery. Current treatments focused on remediating symptoms have shown only small&#xD;
      successes in a return to functioning despite evidence of a dysregulated stress response.&#xD;
      There is a fundamental gap in understanding the impact of allostatic overload in persons with&#xD;
      schizophrenia that the investigators theorize is associated with deficits in functioning and&#xD;
      with an increased vulnerability and relapse risk. The long-term goal is to test an&#xD;
      intervention aimed at improving stress reactivity. The objective in this application is to&#xD;
      develop and test the feasibility of a novel therapeutic intervention combining strategies to&#xD;
      improve stress reactivity and increase meaningful coping. The central hypothesis is that an&#xD;
      intervention that improves stress reactivity as measured proximally by endocrine, immune, and&#xD;
      autonomic indices will result in improved adaptive capacity, better role functioning, reduced&#xD;
      risk of relapse, and decreased likelihood of disability for people in the early stages of&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the proposed research is that stress reactivity may be a modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor underlying functional deficits in schizophrenia. The intervention integrates two&#xD;
      treatment approaches. The first is based on research showing that mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      practice is associated with alterations in the neural processing of stressful events and&#xD;
      targets adaptive responses to stress. The second focuses on providing a buffer against stress&#xD;
      by using the self-generation of adaptive emotions with a positive psychology intervention,&#xD;
      which is potentially associated with building protective social resources. These&#xD;
      complimentary interventions provide a comprehensive synergistic approach for this population&#xD;
      that could lead to more adaptive coping responses and create a buffer against stress&#xD;

    <measure>Change Over Time on the mDES - Positive</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4.5, 9, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified self-report Differential Emotion Scale (mDES) assessed the frequency of experiencing discrete emotions from the previous week. Items are endorsed on a five-point scale indicating frequency (0 = not at all, 4 = most of the time). Items are summed to yield positive (mDES - Positive) and negative emotion (mDES - Negative) subscales (range for both 0-40). Higher scores on the positive subscale indicate more positive emotions. Assessed at 4.5 months, 9 months, 12 months.</description>

          <title>WASI-II Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Score</title>
          <description>Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence - 2nd Edition (WASI-II) is a standardized test of intelligence consisting of Matrix Reasoning, Vocabulary, Similarities, and the Block Design subtests with a total score that is converted to a standard t-score (possible range 40 - 160). A t-score of 50 is equal to the mean of the population with a standard deviation of 10. Scores less than 50 reflect scores less than the mean of the population whereas scores greater than 50 reflect scores more than the mean of the population. Higher scores indicate higher levels of intelligence.</description>

          <title>Daily Stress Inventory</title>
          <description>The Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) is a 58-item self-report measure assessing the frequency and intensity of stressful events within the past 24-hours. If an event is endorsed, participants rate the amount of stress the event caused (0 = did not occur, 1 = occurred but was not stressful to 7 = occurred and caused me to panic). The DSI yields an average impact rating (AIR; average impact of ratings given items endorsed [sum/frequency]; range 1-7) with higher scores reflecting higher levels of stress experienced.</description>

        <title>Change Over Time on the FESFS</title>
        <description>The First Episode Social Functioning Scale (FESFS) is a 42-item self-report measure assessing social functioning in early SSD. The FESFS includes a total score and eight subscales assessing: independent living skills, interacting with people in different contexts, social activities, intimacy, friendships, family relations, work, and school. Domain scores are averaged with higher scores reflecting better perceived functioning (range 0-4). Assessed at 4.5 months, 9 months, 12 months.</description>

        <description>The Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) is a 58-item self-report measure assessing the frequency and intensity of stressful events within the past 24-hours. If an event is endorsed, participants rate the amount of stress the event caused (0 = did not occur, 1 = occurred but was not stressful to 7 = occurred and caused me to panic). The DSI yields an average impact rating (AIR; average impact of ratings given items endorsed [sum/frequency]; range 1-7) with higher scores indicating more daily stress. Assessed at 4.5 months, 9 months, 12 months.</description>

        <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a 39-item self-report measure assessing facets of being mindful in daily life (i.e., observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-reactivity to inner experience, and non-judging of inner experience). Items are endorsed on a five-point scale (1 = never or rarely true to 5 = very often or always true) and averaged for a total score (range 1-5) with higher scores indicating greater mindfulness ability. Assessed at 4.5 months, 9 months, 12 months.</description>
