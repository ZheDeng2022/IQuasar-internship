      Islet transplantation may be appropriate in up to 10% of adults with Type 1 diabetes who&#xD;
      suffer repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia with severely impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      (IAH) (1). Our Scotland-wide islet transplant programme performed its first transplant in&#xD;
      February 2011 and 30 islet transplants have followed in 18 recipients. Following islet&#xD;
      transplantation we have observed improved glycaemic control in all subjects. When metabolic&#xD;
      control is improved with exogenous insulin, weight gain is common (2). In our transplant&#xD;
      recipients significant reductions in bodyweight and fat mass with no significant reduction in&#xD;
      total caloric intake pre- versus post-transplantation has been observed. We hypothesise that&#xD;
      energy expenditure is increased post-transplantation leading to weight loss and diminished&#xD;
      fat mass. The mechanisms that may be implicated include increased activity energy&#xD;
      expenditure, increased resting energy expenditure (REE) and, or, increased post-prandial&#xD;
      thermogenesis (PPT= the energy expended after a meal) secondary to increased portal&#xD;
      circulation of insulin being partially or fully restored, and diminished circulating systemic&#xD;
      insulin concentrations with a decreased propensity for storing fat. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to understand the mechanism of weight loss and body compositional changes by detailed&#xD;
      examination of energy intake and energy expenditure in transplant recipients along with&#xD;
      control subjects listed for insulin-pump therapy and glucose tolerant controls. These&#xD;
      detailed studies are lacking in islet transplantation and are important as they will reveal&#xD;
      how physiology is altered post-transplantation, if peripheral hyperinsulinaemia (insulin-pump&#xD;
      subjects and pre-transplant subjects) negatively affects energy expenditure and how&#xD;
      quantitative measures such as activity energy expenditure, diet and quality-of-life measures&#xD;
      such as fear of hypoglycaemia alter post-transplant. This will lead to the improved&#xD;
      management of patients with hypoglycaemia and IAH.&#xD;

      Background and rationale for the study: Type 1 Diabetes, Hypoglycaemia, IAH and Islet&#xD;
      Transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells within the islets of the&#xD;
      pancreas. Those with Type 1 diabetes are dependent on daily insulin replacement for survival&#xD;
      and despite major advances in treatment (3), life-expectancy is reduced significantly due to&#xD;
      metabolic crises and increased risk of major atherosclerotic vascular events (4). All&#xD;
      complications of chronic high glucose can be prevented by tight glycaemic control (5) but&#xD;
      this is, however, counter-balanced by a high risk of severe hypoglycaemia leading to a&#xD;
      reduced ability to perceive the onset of hypoglycaemia, with disabling confusion and collapse&#xD;
      without warning, termed Impaired A Awareness of Hypoglycaemia (AIH). IAH affects up to 25% of&#xD;
      people with established Type 1 diabetes every year (10-15 million people world-wide) (6, 7).&#xD;
      Approximately 30,000 people in Scotland have Type 1 diabetes and the prevalence is increasing&#xD;
      (8). Those with recurrent hypoglycaemia with severe IAH, often experience fluctuations in&#xD;
      blood glucose and may be eligible for islet transplantation (5). Islets are transplanted in&#xD;
      high numbers via the portal vein under radiological guidance into the liver with&#xD;
      glucocorticoid free immunosuppression (&quot;Edmonton protocol&quot;). Two or more transplants are&#xD;
      usually necessary to regain insulin secretion to allow adequate control of glucose&#xD;
      concentrations and restore awareness of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UK Islet Transplant Consortium (UKITC), Scottish National Islet Programme and anthropometric&#xD;
      changes post islet transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our transplant programme is one of seven in the UKITC; other sites include Newcastle, Oxford,&#xD;
      London (Kings, Royal Free), Manchester and Bristol. The primary goal in the UK is to reduce&#xD;
      the frequency and restore awareness of hypoglycaemia. Referred patients are assessed in depth&#xD;
      by a multidisciplinary team pre-transplant, at the time of transplant and then serially&#xD;
      post-transplant. In the UK from April 2008-September 2013 there have been 96 transplants in&#xD;
      76 recipients. Graft survival is &gt;88%, as defined by a stimulated c-peptide of &gt;100pmol/L (90&#xD;
      min following a Fortisip meal), and there have been significant decreases in the frequency of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia: pre- vs. post-transplant, median (interquartile range): 21(7-79) vs. 0(0-1)&#xD;
      episodes of hypoglycaemia per annum with significant reductions in HbA1c and insulin dose&#xD;
      (all p&lt;0.01)(9). Body weight at 1 year in the UKITC cohort is significantly diminished;&#xD;
      pre-transplant: mean (±SEM) 66.3(±1.2) vs. 62.3(±1.1) kg (p=0.001). In common with many&#xD;
      programmes (10) peak function is seen at 3 months following the first transplant often with&#xD;
      insulin independence but a variable degree of attrition in function may be seen following&#xD;
      this with many patients on insulin 1 year following their transplant, although at a much&#xD;
      reduced dose versus pre-transplant. In Scotland we have performed 47 transplants in 29&#xD;
      recipients. Those patients with Type 1 diabetes and normal renal function have been assessed&#xD;
      previously (≥3&lt;30 months) post-transplant (n=14; 6 males, 8 females; age (range: 30-57&#xD;
      years); all have functioning grafts. Following islet transplantation we have observed&#xD;
      significant reductions in body weight, pre versus post-transplant: median(interquartile&#xD;
      range) 70.9(64.9-82.5) vs. 66.0(59.8-79.9)kg, p=0.01; BMI: 26.2(24.4-28.6) vs.&#xD;
      24.5(22.2-26.1) kg/m2, p=0.01; %fat mass: 30.0(21.2-35.2) vs. 24.1(18.4-31.2)%, p=0.004; and&#xD;
      waist circumference: 85.5(77-89.7) vs. 77.5(73.5-88.3)cm, p=0.01. Total calorific intake&#xD;
      assessed via 7 day dietary histories were not different pre- versus post-transplant&#xD;
      1700(1581-1842) vs. 1528(1319-1708) kcal, (p=0.09), although frequency of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      (10(6-18) vs 1(0-3)) episodes per week and calorific intake for hypoglycaemia were reduced.&#xD;
      Concurrently HbA1c has improved p&lt;0.001 (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with our observations, significant reductions in body weight of &gt;4kg (10, 12),&#xD;
      waist circumference and body fat mass, the latter measured using bioelectrical impedence,&#xD;
      within a year of islet transplantation, have been previously reported, despite no significant&#xD;
      changes in caloric intake post-transplant (12). In the latter study 30 subjects had all&#xD;
      assessments completed and 12 subjects were not on insulin at the time of their last data&#xD;
      collection. Insulin use reduced 10 fold and glycaemic control improved. Regression analyses&#xD;
      adjusting for confounding variables including exogenous insulin dose and glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 agonist use, confirmed the association of weight loss with islet transplantation.&#xD;
      Of note in this cohort of islet transplant recipients, no measurements of energy expenditure&#xD;
      were made and the patients including those with islet transplants following kidney&#xD;
      transplants were on a variety of immunosuppressant agents which may affect energy balance.&#xD;
      More recently the same group published a retrospective study in islet transplant recipients&#xD;
      and found a decrease in BMI in their cohort of 33 recipients at 3 years post-transplant&#xD;
      versus pre-transplant (13). Dietetic habits and caloric intake and activity, both assessed by&#xD;
      open ended questionnaires, were not significantly altered pre- versus post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that other components of energy expenditure are increased following islet&#xD;
      transplantation secondary to the diminished ratio of systemic to portal insulin&#xD;
      concentrations. The energy expenditure components that may be modulated in this way include&#xD;
      REE and PPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed study aims to prospectively assess energy intake and food choices using the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; of serial 7 day weighed food diaries (14, 15) and assess the multiple&#xD;
      components of energy expenditure pre- and post-islet transplantation versus subjects&#xD;
      commencing insulin pump therapy who have relatively high ratios of systemic to portal insulin&#xD;
      concentrations along with control subjects with normal glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of body weight and relationship with energy intake and energy expenditure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bodyweight reflects the balance between food intake and energy expenditure. Total energy&#xD;
      expenditure may be separated into three main components: REE, PPT and physical activity. REE&#xD;
      may be defined as energy expenditure at rest in the fasted state measured in a thermoneutral&#xD;
      environment. PPT or diet induced thermogenesis is an increase in metabolic rate above REE;&#xD;
      PPT demonstrates more variability between people than REE (16, 17). It is the energy&#xD;
      generated following food ingestion and has an obligatory component reflecting the energy&#xD;
      required to digest, absorb, interconvert and store fuels and a facultative component in which&#xD;
      the sympathetic nervous system has a major role (17). The increment in energy expenditure may&#xD;
      be accounted for in part by the cost of glucose storage as glycogen but often the measured&#xD;
      cost of glucose storage is much higher than this and it is this increment above this&#xD;
      &quot;obligatory component&quot; that is termed &quot;facultative thermogenesis&quot; (18). This facultative&#xD;
      component can compromise 50% of the thermic effect of food and large inter individual&#xD;
      variations may be present (19, 20). With a sedentary lifestyle, REE constitutes 75 to 80%,&#xD;
      PPT 10 to 15% and physical activity 10 to 15% of total daily energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modulators of energy expenditure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lean body mass, thyroid status and protein turnover of a subject determines the REE (21).&#xD;
      We and others have shown that PPT is negatively related to insulin sensitivity in a group at&#xD;
      risk for Type 2 diabetes (22). PPT may be affected by beta-adrenergic blockade and other&#xD;
      drugs (23, 24). Insulin, a known vasodilator, may also affect energy expenditure (25).&#xD;
      Intraportally transplanted islets may become revascularised by tributaries from both the&#xD;
      portal vein and the hepatic artery (26) or perhaps by tributaries from just the hepatic&#xD;
      artery (27). It is untested if PPT increases as a consequence of islet transplantation&#xD;
      secondary to increased insulin concentrations in the portal and splanchnic circulations (28).&#xD;
      There has been much progress in the induction agents and immunosuppression therapy used over&#xD;
      the last 10 years with improved insulin independence rates (29). Our centre uses the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab at induction (30) and maintenance immunosuppression is with&#xD;
      the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Liver transplant patients on&#xD;
      tacrolimus have diminished REE, suggesting an inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (31)&#xD;
      although in liver transplantation hepatic denervation occurs with autonomic nerve dysfunction&#xD;
      which may also decrease energy expenditure (32, 33). It is unlikely therefore that the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies increase energy expenditure although there may certainly be&#xD;
      negative effects on appetite and energy intake (34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic fatty acid oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free Fatty Acids (FFA) are oxidised within mitochondria which are present within the whole&#xD;
      body with large concentrations in the liver, muscle and heart. Most methodologies measure&#xD;
      whole body fatty acid oxidation rates and cannot distinguish between these sources. Hepatic&#xD;
      fat oxidation may be altered following islet transplantation and may influence hepatic&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity. It is not known whether hepatic fat oxidation is increased following&#xD;
      islet transplantation which may explain the weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in the liver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of hepatic mitochondrial function has been hampered by invasive and complex&#xD;
      techniques, which have in general lacked specificity. Recently, breath testing using stable&#xD;
      carbon isotopes has been proposed as a safe, non-invasive and non-radioactive method to&#xD;
      assess mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Sodium13C-octanoate can be employed as a substrate&#xD;
      used in assessing hepatic mitochondrial oxidative function, particularly, β-oxidative&#xD;
      pathway. Sodium octanoate is a medium chain fatty acid, which is metabolised through&#xD;
      mitochondrial β-oxidation, producing acetyl Coenzyme A (acetyl Co-A). Acetyl Co-A enters the&#xD;
      Krebs cycle to undergo further oxidation leading to the production of CO2 that can be&#xD;
      measured during the breath test (35a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms of the weight loss and fat mass&#xD;
      observed. No study has examined energy expenditure prospectively in this detailed way in a&#xD;
      cohort of pre- and post-islet transplant and insulin pump therapy recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed plan of investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Islet transplantation is associated with increased energy expenditure as a&#xD;
      consequence of the reduction in the ratio of systemic to portal insulin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measures: body weight, waist circumference, skin fold thickness, body&#xD;
           composition using air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total energy intake, including the excess energy intake required in the treatment of&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia, using 7 day weighed food diaries, The Fear of Hypoglycaemia Survey, Gold&#xD;
           and Clarke Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The activity component of energy expenditure using accelerometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. REE and PPT (using meal tolerance tests) and total metabolic rate (TMR) using doubly&#xD;
           labelled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hepatic fat oxidation using Sodium 13C octanoate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Liver fat, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat using MRS and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the islet transplant recipients and insulin pump patients MRS of liver and MRI of liver&#xD;
      fat; abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat; glycaemic lability; frequency of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      assessed using continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS); awareness of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      assessed subjectively with the Gold Score and Clarke Scores (35), and mixed meal tolerance&#xD;
      tests will continue as per the UKITC protocols, including pre-transplantation. In the glucose&#xD;
      tolerant controls all the above will be done except the MR imaging studies, the Fear of&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia Survey (36), the Gold and Clarke scores and CGMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN In the islet transplant programme recipients are assessed pre-transplant and at&#xD;
      1, 3, 6, 12 months post-transplant and then 6 monthly. The investigations in the transplant&#xD;
      or insulin pump subjects, will be based around these timelines. Specifically, we anticipate&#xD;
      peak islet function at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 3 groups of participants: those with Type I diabetes that are on the&#xD;
      waiting list for islet transplantation, those with Type I diabetes that are on the waiting&#xD;
      list for insulin pump therapy, and controls who do not have diabetes (glucose tolerant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains 3 parts as described below. The participants will be expected to complete&#xD;
      all 3 parts at each time point. The 3 parts are completed over 5 separate time points&#xD;
      totalling 13 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following visits are for the patients with type 1 diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- intervention and then 1,3, 6 and 12 months post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-intervention there are 3 study visits over a 4 week period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 1 post intervention there are 2 visits over 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 3 post invention there are 3 visits over a 4 week period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 6 post intervention there are 2 visits over 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 months post intervention there are 3 visits over 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes normally have 1 routine clinic visit at each time point described as&#xD;
      part of their normal follow-up post-intervention. The other visits will be surplus to their&#xD;
      usual follow-up following intervention, apart from during their first month post-intervention&#xD;
      where they would be followed-up weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose-tolerant controls will only have one set of examinations carried out which will&#xD;
      involve 3 visits over 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention, 3 &amp; 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests (FBC, LFTS, U&amp;Es, Coagulation Screen, Lipid Profile, Thyroid function,HbA1c,&#xD;
      Glucose, post-transplant Tacrolimus level) this is approx 18ml (3 ½ teaspoons). This is part&#xD;
      of the routine follow-up for islet transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry -body weight, waist, calf and arm circumference, skin fold thickness (including&#xD;
      bicep, tricep, scapula, illiac crest and calf), body composition using air displacement&#xD;
      plethysmography (BODPOD). These examinations are study specific and not part of the routine&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) device and accelerometer will also be fitted to&#xD;
      measure energy expenditure over seven days. The participant will be given a food diary and a&#xD;
      set of weighing scales to record food intake over this seven day period (including the excess&#xD;
      calories required in the treatment of hypoglycaemia) at home. CGMS is frequently used during&#xD;
      the follow-up of patients with diabetes. Glucose tolerant controls will not have a CGMS&#xD;
      fitted or complete the following surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will complete &quot;The Fear of Hypoglycaemia Survey&quot;. This is a questionnaire&#xD;
      asking how/whether they modify their behaviour in order to avoid hypoglycaemia and how&#xD;
      frequently they worry about their hypoglycaemia in different circumstances. The participants&#xD;
      will also be asked about their degree of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia using specific&#xD;
      scoring systems (Gold and Clarke Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects within the islet transplant cohort and pump therapy cohort will be asked to go to&#xD;
      the clinical research imaging centre and will have magnetic resonance scanning done of their&#xD;
      abdomen including their liver and their abdominal fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (week 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be invited back a week later to assess their resting energy expenditure&#xD;
      (REE). At this visit all the equipment from week 1 will be returned. The participant will be&#xD;
      weighed on arrival and have a cannula inserted into an arm. Blood samples for glucose,&#xD;
      insulin and c-peptide will be taken (15mls). The participants will then be given a &quot;mixed&#xD;
      meal&quot; in the form of &quot;Fortisip concentrate&quot; which tastes like a milk shake. Their energy&#xD;
      expenditure after this mixed meal will be measured for two hours by a device called an&#xD;
      indirect calorimeter which is an open hood ventilation device which measures the amount of&#xD;
      oxygen breathed in and the amount of carbon dioxide breathed out. The energy expended after a&#xD;
      meal is called post-prandial thermogenesis (PPT) and represents the calories burnt after a&#xD;
      meal. Simultaneously blood samples will be taken every 30 minutes for three hours to measure&#xD;
      insulin, c-peptide and glucose levels (150 mls). This is the gold standard test for assessing&#xD;
      islet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Doubly-labelled Water&quot; studies will be carried out on a proportion of participants. The&#xD;
      participant will be given &quot;doubly labelled water&quot; to drink at their second visit, a urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected just prior to drinking the water and then they will be instructed to&#xD;
      collect further urine samples at home on day 1, 5, 10 and 14 following this, the research&#xD;
      nurse will call them regularly during this time period. The samples will be stored in the&#xD;
      freezer in a zip locked bag contained in a plastic tub with tight-fitting lid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 (week 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be invited back two weeks after part 2 for a study specific visit. The&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected. Hepatic Mitochondrial studies will carried out this involves&#xD;
      the participant drinking a solution containing Sodium 13C Octanoate which is a fatty acid&#xD;
      found in foods. They will then be asked to blow into a bag intermittently over a period of&#xD;
      two hours (0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 mins) in order to measure how their&#xD;
      liver handles the fatty acid and whether they &quot;burn&quot; it quickly or slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 month and 6 months post intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only blood test, anthropometry, accelerometer, weighed food diary and CGMS will be carried&#xD;
      out. Islet transplant recipients will have a clinical mixed meal tolerance test carried out&#xD;
      to assess islet function. These visits will coincide with routine visits.&#xD;
