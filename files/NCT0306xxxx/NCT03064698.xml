  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In uncomplicated pregnancies, the uterine spiral arteries undergo a series of structural&#xD;
      changes that result in a low resistance in the uterine arteries as pregnancy progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia, growth restriction and other placental&#xD;
      related complication, the described change does not occur. In pregnancies at high risk for&#xD;
      placental complications, doppler measurement of Uterine artery flow has been shown to be a&#xD;
      reliable predictor of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum there is a reversal of vascular changes seen in normal pregnancies. It is unclear&#xD;
      if there is a full reversal of these changes in complicated pregnancies with abnormal flow&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Doppler uterine artery measurements after complicated&#xD;
      pregnancies will show some abnormality compared to doppler measurements following&#xD;
      uncomplicated pregnancies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The postpartum reversal of pregnancy-related changes in uterine artery (UA) flow is not well&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While long-term vascular changes have been noted in women with prior preeclampsia (PE), and&#xD;
      in a dose- dependent manner, long-term changes to UA vascular resistance following PE have&#xD;
      not been analyzed. Moreover, regardless of whether they experienced PE or intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction (IUGR), it is not known if women with elevated UA pulsatility index (PI) in&#xD;
      mid-pregnancy have higher UA well after pregnancy, compared to women whose UA PI was normal&#xD;
      in mid-pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate if UA flow remains abnormally high postpartum in women&#xD;
      who had elevated UA flow mid-pregnancy, compared to women whose UA flow was normal in&#xD;
      mid-pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational prospective study. The study recruits women that have recently&#xD;
      delivered and have undergone a Uterine Doppler ultra sound (US) during the second trimester&#xD;
      of their pregnancy. Eligible women will undergo one post-partum ultrasound examination.&#xD;
