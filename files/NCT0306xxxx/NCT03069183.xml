  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THR) is a common and major surgical procedure performed in elderly&#xD;
      patients with significant comorbidities. Optimizing a patient's anesthetic and analgesic&#xD;
      modalities could play a significant role in minimizing the risk of adverse events in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and potentially shorten time to discharge and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a safe and effective post-operative analgesic plan is of central importance to&#xD;
      successful THR anesthesia care. The application of ultrasound visualization has improved the&#xD;
      efficacy of the fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB). However, ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      suprainguinal FICB has not yet been evaluated clinically in a large trial as a method of&#xD;
      providing post-operative analgesia following THR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by performing the suprainguinal fascia iliaca block with&#xD;
      ultrasound, it will be possible to achieve superior and more reliable analgesia in the first&#xD;
      24 hours than without a block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The search for the optimal pain treatment strategies is a work in progress. As techniques and&#xD;
      technology evolve so should our approach for the best analgesic regimen that would minimize&#xD;
      unwanted side effects and potential risk and more importantly improve patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature has supported the use of peripheral nerve blocks for analgesia as well as&#xD;
      improved functional outcome after total knee arthroplasty. The addition of peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks for THR has been more controversial, as the only effective nerve block, the posterior&#xD;
      approach to the lumbar plexus, is an advanced regional technique with potential for serious&#xD;
      complications. The application of ultrasound visualization has improved the efficacy of the&#xD;
      infrainguinal fascia iliaca block. However, ultrasound guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca&#xD;
      block has not yet been evaluated clinically in a large trial as a method of providing&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia following primary hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by performing the suprainguinal fascia iliaca block with&#xD;
      ultrasound, it will be possible to achieve superior and more reliable analgesia than that&#xD;
      obtained using the landmark &quot;2-pop&quot; technique and the infrainguinal blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess whether the ultrasound guided suprainguinal fascia iliaca&#xD;
      block can provide superior early postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing primary hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty, and minimizing the pain immediately after the resolution of the spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform the first triple-blinded RCT examining the early&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided suprainguinal FICB after THR (lateral approach) under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
