  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. It is&#xD;
      lack of effective drugs for systemic treatment of HCC. Currently, Sorafenib is the only&#xD;
      choice approved by FDA for advanced HCC, although it prolongs the survival for less than 3&#xD;
      months. The treatment of advanced HCC still has a long way to go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the relevant phase II and phase III clinical studies of apatinib on advanced HCC&#xD;
      are ongoing. Based on our important discovery of previous clinical studies, we intend to&#xD;
      enlarge the sample size and make further observation for the efficacy and safety of apatinib&#xD;
      in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the lethal human cancers worldwide and its incidence&#xD;
      matches mortality, reflecting the poor prognosis of this disease. The surgical resection rate&#xD;
      of HCC is low, and the prognosis is poor. Although transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is&#xD;
      the main treatment for HCC patients who are not candidates for surgical resection, it is not&#xD;
      considered a curative procedure. For HCC, poor TACE efficacy or TACE failure may be related&#xD;
      to tumor angiogenesis of the residual disease. Among the many regulatory factors in tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) play vital roles in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is the first systemic treatment drug, which has been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      advanced HCC. In order to find an new VEGFR-inhibitor with better effect and lower toxicity,&#xD;
      Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. developed Apatinib, a high-performance VEGFR-2 tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor. Apatinib plays anti angiogenic effect in the treatment of malignant tumor&#xD;
      mainly through inhibition of VEGFR-2, in vivo and in vitro experiments showed good tumor&#xD;
      growth inhibitory activity on Hepatocellular carcinoma, this study aims to further verify the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Apatinib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients who are not candidates&#xD;
      for curative surgery, the primary endpoint is Progression Free Survival (PFS).&#xD;
