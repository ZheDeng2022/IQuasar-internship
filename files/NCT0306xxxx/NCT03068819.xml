  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) following salvage chemotherapy is the one of the most widely&#xD;
      used treatment approaches in patients who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplant (allo-HCT). However, the complete remission (CR) rates and long term survival&#xD;
      remain very poor in these patients and, therefore, there is an unmet need to develop more&#xD;
      effective treatment approaches in patients who relapse after allo-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the initial promising results with our ongoing cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cell trial, the investigators hypothesize that combining the CIML NK&#xD;
      cells with DLI approach will significantly enhance the graft versus leukemia and therefore&#xD;
      potentially provide potentially curative therapy for these patients with otherwise extremely&#xD;
      poor prognosis. Combining CIML NK cells with the DLI platform will also potentially allow&#xD;
      these adoptively transferred cells to persist for longer duration as they should not be&#xD;
      rejected by donor T cells as the CIML NK cells are derived from the same donor. The use of&#xD;
      CIML NK cells is unlikely to lead to excessive graft versus host disease (GVHD) as previous&#xD;
      studies have not been associated with excessive GVHD rates.&#xD;
