  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      trauma-focused Equine-Assisted Therapy (EAT) for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). While several well-studied, validated treatments for PTSD exist, some individuals&#xD;
      find these treatments ill-suited, ineffective, or undesirable. EAT is an alternative therapy&#xD;
      widely used by organizations, such as PATH International Equine Services, that endorse its&#xD;
      effectiveness for treating a variety of mental health issues. These claims have drawn&#xD;
      criticism because the published research contains glaring methodological flaws, making it&#xD;
      difficult to assess how effective these therapies actually are (Anestis et al., 2014).&#xD;
      Equine-assisted therapies present a unique treatment modality that might effectively treat&#xD;
      PTSD, particularly for individuals who have difficulty with other treatment modalities. In&#xD;
      EAT, a psychotherapist and equine specialist work together to help the patients negotiate&#xD;
      interactions with a horse using structured interventions or activities.&#xD;

      In this pilot study the investigators will develop the EAT intervention and determine whether&#xD;
      research methods (evaluation interviews, assessment measures, videotaping procedures) are&#xD;
      acceptable to participants. Specifically, the investigators will focus on issues such as&#xD;
      session length, appropriateness of the &quot;content&quot; for treatment of PTSD, ordering of session&#xD;
      content, adherence to the manual of the equine therapeutic team (based on observations made&#xD;
      during supervision and feedback from the consultants), and will detail logistics of data&#xD;
      collection and how best to record the sessions (camera angles, etc.).&#xD;
