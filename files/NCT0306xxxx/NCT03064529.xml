      The present study aims to establish the feasibility of the clinical use of 3-axis&#xD;
      accelerometers to measure physical activity in hospitalized children after elective surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nearly universal aspect of hospitalization is a loss of physical activity due to&#xD;
      confinement to bed, deconditioning, respiratory compromise, and pain with recovery comprising&#xD;
      multifactorial components such as the return to activity, adequate pain control, and overall&#xD;
      neurologic function. Assessment of recovery from surgery and the ability to return to full,&#xD;
      normal activity has previously been dependent upon subjective clinical evaluation that are&#xD;
      subject to observer-to-observer variability, selection bias, or variable interpretation of&#xD;
      the qualitative description of movement. Bedside assessments utilizing an accelerometer could&#xD;
      change clinical practice by having readily available, quantifiable, reliable and highly&#xD;
      accurate data for healthcare providers when they make day-to-day decisions of medical care,&#xD;
      as. The present study aims to establish the feasibility of the clinical use of 3-axis&#xD;
      accelerometers to measure physical activity in the hospitalized children after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target study population will be 25 English- or Spanish-speaking children ages 3-18&#xD;
      undergoing elective abdominal surgery with anticipated overnight hospitalization of at least&#xD;
      one day. Children must be freely ambulatory without any pre-existing mobility-limitations.&#xD;
      Study enrollment and recruitment will occur in Lurie outpatient urology and pediatric surgery&#xD;
      clinics over a 6 month period. Parental/guardian consent will be obtained at the preoperative&#xD;
      clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometers Actigraph accelerometers (model GT3X; Pensacola, FL) will be obtained from&#xD;
      Lurie Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children (CLOCC). Study participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear accelerometers at the same location throughout the study period unless there is&#xD;
      a contraindication to maintain the same location and requires relocation (e.g. interference&#xD;
      by IV access). Location preference is the wrist. Patients will wear accelerometers&#xD;
      continuously (except for when bathing) for 7 days prior to surgery, the accelerometer will be&#xD;
      removed for the operation and placed back on the patient immediately after the operation&#xD;
      through 14 days postoperative. Accelerometers will be mailed to children 10 days&#xD;
      preoperatively for those whose surgeries are scheduled &gt;2 weeks from preoperative clinic&#xD;
      visit along with a return envelop for return of the accelerometer postoperatively; those&#xD;
      children who are scheduled for surgery within 2 weeks of their preoperative clinic visit will&#xD;
      be provided accelerometers at that clinic visit. Accelerometers will be returned at&#xD;
      postoperative clinic visit if within 8 days after surgery or mailed back if postoperative&#xD;
      clinic visit is more than 8 days postoperative. Actigraph software will be purchased and will&#xD;
      allow preprogramming of accelerometers to begin collection of data 1 week prior to planned&#xD;
      surgery date. Reminder phone calls will be placed remind patients to start wearing&#xD;
      accelerometers 1 week prior to surgery. Accelerometer movement count data epoch will be&#xD;
      measured at 5-second intervals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children ages 3-18 undergoing elective surgery with anticipated overnight&#xD;
             hospitalization of at least one day&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any children who are non-ambulatory, have any pre-existing mobility limitations, or&#xD;
             have a doctor-ordered physical activity limit &gt;48 hours post surgery. Also, patients&#xD;
             with surgery scheduled less than 7 days out as protocol calls for the accelerometer to&#xD;
