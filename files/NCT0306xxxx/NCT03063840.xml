  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is&#xD;
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than&#xD;
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70% to 85%) of patients&#xD;
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured&#xD;
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been&#xD;
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular&#xD;
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an&#xD;
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor&#xD;
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,&#xD;
      could not be ablated completely sometimes. Microwave ablation (MWA) can ablate tumor by&#xD;
      higher temperature than RFA, so is supposed not to be diminished by adjacent vessels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated microwave ablation (MWA) is a safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment for live cancers. The system (Emprint Microwave Ablation system) with&#xD;
      2.45 GHz microwave generator the investigators will use has been approved as safe by the&#xD;
      European Union (EU) in 2009 and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2014.&#xD;
      However, there are still few experiences in using MWA for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this&#xD;
      study, we will perform MWA for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels&#xD;
      who are suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in our hospital. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by abdominal computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators will also&#xD;
      follow-up this patients for 1 years to evaluate the overall survival and local recurrence&#xD;
      rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of the system&#xD;
      by this study.&#xD;
