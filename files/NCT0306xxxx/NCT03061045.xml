      The aim of the proposed project is therefore to utilize the CEUS technique to assess cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion changes before and after ventricular shunting in neonatal cases of PHH. The&#xD;
      expectation of the proposed project is to validate statistically significant cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion differences before and after shunting in neonates with PHH, as a preliminary&#xD;
      feasibility study prior to conducting a large scale, prospective clinical trial incorporating&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions using the CEUS technique.&#xD;

      Timely decompression of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) due to intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage in premature babies is key to reducing long-term cognitive and motor disability.&#xD;
      Exactly when to place a ventricular shunt for decompression and alleviation of increased&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a dilemma for neurosurgeons, and the only guidance is&#xD;
      based on changes in size of the ventricles not necessarily reflective of cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics. There is a dire need for a novel diagnostic tool that can perform serial,&#xD;
      bedside assessment of cerebral perfusion. At times, intermittent shunting may be needed&#xD;
      depending on the dynamic changes in brain perfusion, and this is not practical with the&#xD;
      current diagnostic tools. While most diagnostic techniques require sedation or transport&#xD;
      (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging), few available bedside techniques (i.e. near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy or Doppler ultrasound) are limited soft tissue contrast, depth of penetration,&#xD;
      and/or ability to quantify cerebral perfusion. Potential long-term effects of sedation in&#xD;
      neonates are also relatively unknown. In this regard, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is&#xD;
      easily repeatable technique that can be performed at bedside in less than 5 minutes and&#xD;
      provide dynamic cerebral perfusion quantification. The aim of the proposed project is&#xD;
      therefore to utilize the CEUS technique to detect cerebral perfusion changes before and after&#xD;
      ventricular shunting in neonatal cases of PHH. The specific hypothesis behind the proposed&#xD;
      research is that impaired cerebral perfusion in PHH correlates with long-term cognitive and&#xD;
      motor disability. The hypothesis is based on the following evidence. First, substantial data&#xD;
      from animal studies of hydrocephalus demonstrate a significant role of impaired cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics in the pathophysiology of brain injury in PHH. Second, animal studies have&#xD;
      clearly shown that early treatment of hydrocephalus reduces brain injury and cognitive&#xD;
      development. Third, preliminary studies of human infants validate aforementioned findings&#xD;
      from animal studies. The expectation of the proposed project is to validate statistically&#xD;
      significant cerebral perfusion differences before and after shunting in neonates with PHH, as&#xD;
      a preliminary feasibility study prior to conducting a large scale, prospective clinical trial&#xD;
      incorporating therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
