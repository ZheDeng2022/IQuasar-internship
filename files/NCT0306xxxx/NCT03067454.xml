  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spiral metacarpal fractures (metacarpal II-V) can be treated conservatively or with&#xD;
      operation. With minimal displacement this fracture is usually treated with immobilisation or&#xD;
      early mobilisation. With appreciable displacement especially any malrotation the patient&#xD;
      usually is treated with an operation. This usually includes an open reduction of the fracture&#xD;
      and fixation with plates and screws or just screws. Even if this is an standard procedure&#xD;
      both mild and severe complications have been reported. New studies have shown that even&#xD;
      displaced fractures can be treated with early mobilization. In those cases the fractures may&#xD;
      heal with some shortening but very good function. An advantage of early mobilization is that&#xD;
      the patient avoids the risk of an operation and the costs for the treatment are decreased&#xD;
      markedly. The study is designed to answer the question if early mobilization is not inferior&#xD;
      to operative treatment but with lower costs and without any operation related risks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an prospective, randomised controlled trial. The patients are&#xD;
      divided into two groups (operative and conservative treatment with early mobilisation). The&#xD;
      operative group is treated with internal fixation and 2 weeks in a cast. The conservative&#xD;
      group is instructed to do a fist to correct any malrotation and to rehabilitate quickly. By&#xD;
      this procedure shortening oft he metacarpalfractures is limited by the function of the deep&#xD;
      transverse metacarpal ligament connecting the distal parts of the metacarpalbones II-V.&#xD;
      Furthermore the participants in the conservative group are allowed to use their hands without&#xD;
      any restrictions. A physiotherapist controls that early mobilisation is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be seen for a follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 weeks and 1 year. Radiographs&#xD;
      will be performed at 1v and 6v. The finger ranges of motion and pain will be evaluated with&#xD;
      every follow-up, DASH score, range of motion, pain and grip-strength will be measured after&#xD;
      12v and 1 year. The investigators will measure return to driving, work and sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be registered continuously for all patients. The overall satisfaction of&#xD;
      the patients and the costs for both treatments will be documented as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is planned to be 21 patients in each group.&#xD;
