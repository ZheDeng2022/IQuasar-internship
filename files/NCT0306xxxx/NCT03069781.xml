  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function is critical for healthy aging. Muscle&#xD;
      loss with disuse, termed muscle disuse muscle atrophy, leads to impaired functional capacity,&#xD;
      the onset of insulin resistance, as well as a heightened risk for morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      With advancing age there is a chronic wasting of muscle. This is especially true in women,&#xD;
      where rapid rates of decline in muscle mass and greater anabolic resistance are experienced&#xD;
      around the time of menopause, despite higher protein synthesis rates. As women have a longer&#xD;
      life expectancy, they are particularly venerable to age-related frailty and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle protein turnover serves to maintain the optimal function of proteins and also&#xD;
      provides plasticity of the tissue during altered demands such as during increased loading or&#xD;
      unloading of the muscle. Reduced periods of physical activity also have a similar, albeit&#xD;
      milder, impact on skeletal muscle and most, people will likely experience multiple bouts of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle disuse during their lifetime from which some, particularly older adult women,&#xD;
      will fail to fully recover. Thus, muscle disuse atrophy is a significant and continuing&#xD;
      problem as reclamation of lost muscle mass, strength/function, and potentially metabolic&#xD;
      health (particularly insulin-induced glucose disposal), following disuse is oftentimes&#xD;
      incomplete and may be further exacerbated after menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous evidence has demonstrated that in the loss of muscle mass is less pronounced in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women when receiving hormone replacement therapy. Skeletal muscle has&#xD;
      estrogen-β-receptors on the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm and on the nuclear membrane, and&#xD;
      therefore a direct mechanistic link between low estrogen levels and a decrease MPS.&#xD;
      Interestingly, despite higher rates of protein synthesis, older women still lose muscle mass&#xD;
      with advancing age. It has been suggested that the negative muscle protein balance is due to&#xD;
      an enhanced rate of MPB. Insulin is a potent inhibitor of MPB and estrogen has been shown to&#xD;
      enhance insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. However, to our knowledge, no study has&#xD;
      examined the efficacy of estrogen supplementation to attenuate the losses of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass and function during a period of disuse. The findings of this investigation may yield&#xD;
      critical data for those who wish to combat skeletal muscle disuse atrophy, particularly after&#xD;
      menopause.&#xD;

      Design and detailed description of methodology This is a parallel-group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, blinded to the 17β-estradiol (n=10) or placebo (n=10) supplement administered every&#xD;
      day for 10 days. Twelve healthy young men (age: 18-25yrs; BMI: 22-33 kg/m2) will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate in this study. During phone or e-mail conversations we will explain the&#xD;
      purpose and experimental design of the study and address all questions the participants might&#xD;
      have (see telephone and email scripts). Participants will visit the laboratory for a&#xD;
      screening to assess whether they are eligible to participate in this study. During the&#xD;
      screening we will first explain the experimental design and obtain written informed consent.&#xD;
      A medical questionnaire will be completed by the participants to assess their general health&#xD;
      and use of medication. Body height and mass will be measured as baseline characteristics of&#xD;
      the participants. Participants will be requested to fill out a 3-d dietary record to assess&#xD;
      habitual energy and protein intake. Participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      17β-estradiol (n=10) or placebo (n=10) supplementation group. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      using a computerized list randomizer (https://www.random.org/lists/), and participants will&#xD;
      be sequentially allocated to a condition according to the randomized list. The experimental&#xD;
      trial is composed of 10 days of 17β-estradiol (Estrace, Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation,&#xD;
      Mississauga, ON, Canada or placebo (400 mg/day Polycose, Abbott Laboratories, St. Laurent,&#xD;
      QC, Canada) supplementation, including 3 days of pre-immobilization, and 7 days of single leg&#xD;
      immobilization. Three days prior to immobilization (t=-3 d) a blood sample will be obtained&#xD;
      and muscle strength will be assessed before daily 17β-estradiol or placebo supplementation&#xD;
      will be initiated. Participants will consume 1mg/day for 3-days and 3mg/day for 7-days of&#xD;
      Estrace or 400 mg/day of Polycose for 7-days. The estrogen and placebo bottles are coded to&#xD;
      ensure complete blinding to both researchers and participants. Additional blood samples will&#xD;
      be obtained to assess the compliance of the participants to the supplementation. In addition,&#xD;
      at t=-3 d a saliva sample will be obtained before ingesting 150 mL of deuterium-labeled water&#xD;
      (D2O). Daily saliva sampling will be continued until the end of the experimental trial to&#xD;
      assess precursor pool enrichments. Dietary intake will be controlled for 10-days (including 3&#xD;
      d prior to immobilization and 7 d of immobilization) providing an energy balanced diet&#xD;
      containing 1 weight per day equally distributed over breakfast, lunch, and dinner (15).&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to refrain from vigorous-intensity physical activity&#xD;
      (running, fast cycling, competitive sports, carrying heavy loads, etc.) and refrain from&#xD;
      alcohol consumption for 3 d prior to and during the 7-day single leg immobilization. Daily&#xD;
      activity will be monitored with a SenseWear Armband, which subjects will be required to wear&#xD;
      from t=-3 d until the end of the experimental trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have one leg immobilized by means of knee bracing&#xD;
      (http://www.breg.com/products/knee-bracing/post-op) thus the contralateral limb will act as&#xD;
      an internal control. The leg to be immobilized will be chosen in a random counterbalanced&#xD;
      manner to result in equal numbers of participants having their weaker or stronger legs being&#xD;
      immobilized. The brace (http://www.breg.com/products/knee-bracing/post-op) will be worn in a&#xD;
      fixed flexion position at 140° (i.e., 40° from full extension) with a plastic band that is&#xD;
      removed to check for pressure points daily and resealed with a custom-modified plastic strap&#xD;
      that is melted to seal the strap, as we have done previously19,20. The reason for this is&#xD;
      that the brace cannot be removed without breaking the plastic seal, but could be broken in&#xD;
      the case of an emergency and the brace removed entirely, if required. Using this model of&#xD;
      disuse we have found the immobilizing brace to be well tolerated, not restrictive, and&#xD;
      importantly it does not occlude for popliteal and/or femoral artery blood flow, and we have&#xD;
      had no cases of edema or venous thrombosis in previous studies. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided with elastic support bandages to lessen the risk of deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On t=0 d, a blood sample, saliva sample and muscle biopsy will be collected for the&#xD;
      assessment of muscle protein synthesis rates. Muscle strength and volume will be assessed&#xD;
      using a Biodex and ultrasonography respectively. A knee brace will be placed to start the&#xD;
      7-day single leg immobilization phase. The choice of leg for immobilization will be&#xD;
      randomized and balanced for dominance according to maximal isometric strength. At the end of&#xD;
      the immobilization phase (t=7 d), a blood sample will be obtained, muscle biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected from both the immobilized and non-immobilized leg, and muscle volume and strength&#xD;
      will be assessed. After strength is assessed in both legs, a further muscle biopsy will be&#xD;
      taken to assess the effect of 17β-estradiol on muscle response to a single bout of exercise&#xD;
      (Biodex) in both the non-immobilized and immobilized leg 3-hrs after the exercise bout.&#xD;
