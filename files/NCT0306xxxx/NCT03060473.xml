      Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 4% of pregnancies annually. This&#xD;
      pregnancy complication is a major contributor to preterm births and results in neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for PPROM subjects between the&#xD;
      gestational age of 24 weeks and 0 days and 33 weeks and 6 days, is to administer ampicillin&#xD;
      and erythromycin for a total of 7 days. Erythromycin can cause GI upset and some subjects do&#xD;
      not tolerate this regimen over the course of 7 days. In addition, there is a national&#xD;
      shortage of erythromycin, and published expert opinion proposed to use a second-generation&#xD;
      macrolide (azithromycin) instead of erythromycin. Azithromycin can be taken once daily, is&#xD;
      cheaper than erythromycin and has less GI upset adverse effects. The investigators' objective&#xD;
      is to compare the effectiveness of the 2 regimens in prolonging pregnancy after PPROM. The&#xD;
      investigators' working hypothesis is that there is no measurable difference in the primary&#xD;
      outcome between the group randomized to the azithromycin regimen versus the group randomized&#xD;
      to the erythromycin regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) complicates 4% of&#xD;
      pregnancies annually. This pregnancy complication is a major contributor to preterm births&#xD;
      and results in neonatal morbidity and mortality. Without treatment, 70-80% of women deliver&#xD;
      within the 1st week following membrane rupture. Multiple trials have proven that antibiotics&#xD;
      given to this population prolong the latency from time of PPROM to delivery, hence reducing&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the current standard of care&#xD;
      for PPROM subjects between the gestational age of 24 weeks and 0 days and 33 weeks and 6&#xD;
      days, is to administer ampicillin 2 gm IV every 6 hours for 48 hours followed by amoxicillin&#xD;
      250 mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days, with erythromycin 250 mg IV every 6 hours for 48&#xD;
      hours followed by 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days. In this regimen, multiple doses of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) doses of erythromycin are needed to achieve the desired&#xD;
      outcome. Erythromycin can cause GI upset and some subjects do not tolerate this regimen over&#xD;
      the course of 7 days. In addition, there is a national shortage of erythromycin, and&#xD;
      published expert opinion proposed to use a second-generation macrolide (azithromycin) instead&#xD;
      of erythromycin. This strategy was adopted nationwide including the maternal center at UTMB&#xD;
      since 2014. Compared to erythromycin, advantages of azithromycin include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is taken once orally (due to its long intracellular half-life).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entire regimen is much cheaper than the multiple does of erythromycin (23 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has less gastrointestinal adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, azithromycin is now commonly being used as a substitute for erythromycin on many&#xD;
      labor and delivery units around the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its common use, there exists no level 1 evidence that azithromycin is equivalent to&#xD;
      erythromycin. Haas and colleagues published a retrospective comparison of the two regimens in&#xD;
      2014 and concluded that the substitution of azithromycin for erythromycin in the recommended&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen did not impact latency or any other measured maternal or fetal outcomes.&#xD;
      This study, however, was limited by its non-randomized retrospective nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objective is to compare the effectiveness of the 2 regimens in prolonging&#xD;
      pregnancy after PPROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be a comparative effectiveness pragmatic randomized trial performed in&#xD;
      singleton pregnancies with the diagnosis of PPROM between 24 weeks and 0 days - 32 weeks and&#xD;
      6 days. It will be comparing two well-accepted standardized treatments of care in this&#xD;
      subject population: Erythromycin (FDA Category B) versus Azithromycin (FDA Category B). The&#xD;
      investigators' primary outcome will be the proportion of women still pregnant by day 7 after&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PPROM is made. The investigators' working hypothesis is that there is no&#xD;
      measurable difference in the primary outcome between the group randomized to the azithromycin&#xD;
      regimen versus the group randomized to the erythromycin regimen. The investigators' secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be latency defined as interval from PPROM to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected will consist of demographics, obstetrical history, relevant vital signs&#xD;
      and laboratories. Examples of data to be collected but not limited to include: age,&#xD;
      ethnicity/race, gravida, para, received tocolytics, received antenatal steroids, gestational&#xD;
      age at rupture of membranes, reason for delivery, mode of delivery, gestational age at&#xD;
      delivery, chorioamnionitis, date &amp; time of initiation of antibiotics, date &amp; time of&#xD;
      delivery, placental abruption, hospital length of stay, number of women undelivered at day 7&#xD;
      of admission, NICU admission, infant intubation days, neonatal NEC and neonatal sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, drug adverse effects profiles between the two will be assessed in a post&#xD;
      treatment patient survey. The latter will be assessing the severity and incidence of diarrhea&#xD;
      and other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and their severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a total of 324 subjects will be needed to complete the study.&#xD;
