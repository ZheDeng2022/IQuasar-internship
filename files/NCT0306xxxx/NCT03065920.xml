      This study is a prospective observational multicentre cohort study of asthma patients in&#xD;
      Eastern Africa whose objectives will be; The primary objective of this project is to identify&#xD;
      and characterize severe asthma in Eastern Africa in order to understand its demographic,&#xD;
      clinical, physiologic, pathologic, genomic and immunologic determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective(s) are; Compare the annual healthcare utilisation (HCU) (emergency room&#xD;
      visits, hospitalization including admission to critical care units and unscheduled outpatient&#xD;
      clinic or office visits), exacerbation, quality of life and mortality rates of severe and&#xD;
      not- severe asthma patients Determine the factors associated with the asthma HCU events,&#xD;
      quality of life, exacerbations and mortality The study will enroll 1676 patients aged between&#xD;
      12 and 70 years and follow up each patient for up to one year.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective observational multicentre cohort study of asthma patients in&#xD;
      Eastern Africa. whose objectives will be; The primary objective of this project is to&#xD;
      identify and characterize severe asthma in Eastern Africa in order to understand its&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, physiologic, pathologic, genomic and immunologic determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective(s) are; Compare the annual healthcare utilisation (HCU) (emergency room&#xD;
      visits, hospitalization including admission to critical care units and unscheduled outpatient&#xD;
      clinic or office visits), exacerbation, quality of life and mortality rates of severe and&#xD;
      not- severe asthma patients Determine the factors associated with the asthma HCU events,&#xD;
      quality of life, exacerbations and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 1676 patients aged between 12 and 70 years and follow up each patient&#xD;
      for up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements; The following will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma Diagnosis. This will be done and will be an entry point to the study. It will be&#xD;
           done to ensure patients enrolled onto the study fulfill a clinical diagnosis of Asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort Characterisation. Through use of a predeveloped clinical review form, data on&#xD;
           demographics, symptoms, exposures to pollutants, known asthma triggers, tobacco smoking,&#xD;
           psychosocial issues, comorbidities, asthma control, adherence to medication and inhaler&#xD;
           technique will be collected. Asthma quality of life will also be ascertained through use&#xD;
           of a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further measurements to characterise asthma will be performed and include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing using methacholine challenge tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin prick test (SPT), total IgE assays and complete blood count (for eosinophils)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FeNO for airway inflammation according to published guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool microscopy for helminths infestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Replicative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV testing Each patient will be followed up at intervals (initially monthly for 6&#xD;
           months and then at month 9 and 12). At each clinic visit, treatment will be optimised.&#xD;
