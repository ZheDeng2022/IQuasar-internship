  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects completing study DIUR-005 and those who have already completed study DIUR-003 will&#xD;
      be offered the opportunity either to continue Chronocort® therapy or to switch from their&#xD;
      current glucocorticoid therapy to Chronocort® in this open-label study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will have a screening visit prior to the baseline assessment to allow DIUR-006&#xD;
      procedures to be fully explained and informed consent to be given by the subject. For&#xD;
      subjects from DIUR-003 this screening visit will include safety blood tests. Any subjects not&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria following these blood tests will be not be entered&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will then return for the baseline visit. For subjects entering from study&#xD;
      DIUR-003 the full set of baseline assessments will be completed, including 2 blood samples&#xD;
      (one at 09:00 and one at 13:00 hours) for 17-OHP and A4. For subjects entering from DIUR-005,&#xD;
      test results from their last visit in the feeder study (Visit 4) will be used for this&#xD;
      baseline assessment, with the 09:00 and 13:00 hour results taken from the 24-hour hormone&#xD;
      profiles conducted at the visit. Any subjects not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      following these blood tests will be withdrawn from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the baseline assessments are completed, the subjects will be given sufficient&#xD;
      Chronocort® to use until the next visit at Week 4. Subjects from study DIUR-005 who were&#xD;
      previously on Chronocort® will continue on the same dose of Chronocort® that they were&#xD;
      receiving at the end of the feeder study. Subjects from study DIUR-005 on standard therapy&#xD;
      and subjects from study DIUR-003 will have their initial dose of Chronocort® determined using&#xD;
      the hydrocortisone equivalent of baseline therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return to the study centre at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after starting study&#xD;
      DIUR-006 for additional blood tests and dose titration, if necessary. Visits thereafter will&#xD;
      take place at 6-monthly intervals. If there is a change of dose, an interim visit or phone&#xD;
      call will be needed inbetween the 6-monthly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive telephone calls at 3 monthly intervals, and unscheduled visits will&#xD;
      be arranged if necessary. Subjects will also be provided with Chronocort® supplies from the&#xD;
      study pharmacy at 3-monthly or 6-monthly intervals.&#xD;
