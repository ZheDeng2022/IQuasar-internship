      This study is a proposed a comprehensive prospective assessment of exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency (EPI), nutritional status, and quality of life (QOL) during the early&#xD;
      re-feeding phase, at 3 months, and 12 months following an AP attack. A blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected for measurement of nutritional markers and a fecal sample for elastase-1, and data&#xD;
      regarding demographics, etiology, history of previous pancreatitis episodes, and their&#xD;
      hospital course (imaging findings, interventions, length of stay, intensive care admission,&#xD;
      and severity based on the Revised Atlanta Classification) will be obtained from medical&#xD;
      records at hospital discharge. Subsequently, each subject will be prospectively followed at 3&#xD;
      months and 1 year after hospital discharge. In each follow-up, he/she will be asked to answer&#xD;
      a questionnaire focusing on symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and quality of&#xD;
      life. Furthermore, blood and stool samples will be collected at the 3 and 12-month follow up&#xD;
      for measurement of nutritional markers and fecal elastase-1 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available literature and our own data, we hypothesize that a significant fraction of&#xD;
      AP patients develop EPI that may persist up to 1 year after the discharge, and result in&#xD;
      nutritional deficiencies and impaired QOL. This study will help to clarify the incidence,&#xD;
      natural history and duration of EPI, as well as identify subgroups of patients at high risk&#xD;
      of EPI after AP. It will serve as the basis for the design of future randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials of pancreatic enzyme replacement following AP. This is a novel proposal by an&#xD;
      investigator with extensive experience and a well-established record in AP research from an&#xD;
      internationally known pancreas center of excellence. The methodological strength of our&#xD;
      proposal lies on its prospective nature, the 1-year follow up with serial assessments of EPI,&#xD;
      nutritional status and QOL, and the detailed phenotypical characterization of the AP patient&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the incidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency at 12 months after an attack&#xD;
           of AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify subgroups of patients at risk for EPI at 12 months after an attack of AP based&#xD;
           on severity classification, etiology, and demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the incidence of transient (present at 3 but no at 12 months) and persistent&#xD;
           (present both at 3 and 12 months after AP) exocrine pancreatic insufficiency following&#xD;
           an AP attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the incidence of nutritional deficiencies, and impaired quality of life at 3 and&#xD;
           12 months from an attack of AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether EPI is associated with nutritional deficiencies or impaired quality of&#xD;
           life at 3 and 12 months from an AP attack.&#xD;
