      The proposed study aims to use a form of neuromodulation, known as transcranial alternating&#xD;
      current stimulation (tACS), to improve the effectiveness of the metacognitive training (MCT)&#xD;
      program for treatment of delusions in schizophrenia. tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      method utilizing weak electrical currents applied to the head to influence neural firing&#xD;
      (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013). Brain regions implicated in delusional thinking will be targeted in&#xD;
      the hopes of promoting thinking patterns that will allow participants to question delusional&#xD;
      beliefs, reducing the severity of delusions and increasing the positive effects of MCT&#xD;
      (Whitman et al., in press; Whitman, Minz &amp; Woodward, 2013). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and&#xD;
      behavioural assessments will be used to measure treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before tACS will be administered to individuals experiencing delusions associated&#xD;
      with schizophrenia we will conduct various control-phase (pilot) studies to gain a better&#xD;
      understanding on how tACS temporarily alters performance on cognitive processes by biasing&#xD;
      dominant patterns of oscillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the pilot studies is to establish the effectiveness of the EGI GTEN system&#xD;
      in modulating brain oscillations in the cortex of healthy participants by means of&#xD;
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In this control/pilot phase of our&#xD;
      study, we aim to establish that we can induce changes in the power of a specific frequency&#xD;
      band in targeted cortical regions with neuromodulation using the GTEN system, and we will&#xD;
      assess whether doing so temporarily alters performance on simple cognitive and perceptual&#xD;
      processes in healthy controls. This will be the first step towards translating our&#xD;
      stimulation protocol to the patient population for our primary study of interest (tACS as an&#xD;
      adjunct to metacognitive training for delusions in psychosis).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to enhance a form of nonpharmacological treatment of delusions&#xD;
      in schizophrenia using neuromodulation, and confirm the effect using electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) and behavioural measures (Whitman et al., in press; Whitman, Minz &amp; Woodward, 2013).&#xD;
      Specifically, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) will be used to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of participation in metacognitive training (MCT) for the treatment of psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCT is a group-based program developed directly from current cognitive neuropsychiatry&#xD;
      research findings on schizophrenia and psychosis. MCT shares knowledge gained in research&#xD;
      labs to help individuals experiencing psychosis become more aware of the thinking patterns&#xD;
      involved in their illness. The main purpose of the metacognitive training is to help people&#xD;
      change the thinking patterns that cause delusions, thereby avoiding relapse into illness or&#xD;
      reducing the impact of delusions (Moritz et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which a weak electrical current is&#xD;
      applied to the head in order to change the likelihood of neural firing in a region of cortex&#xD;
      under the stimulation electrodes (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation will enhance the benefit of the non-pharmacological treatment program, MCT,&#xD;
      in the reduction of severity of delusions in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now clear that helping individuals with schizophrenia become aware of the thinking&#xD;
      patterns that underlie delusions provides effective tools for countering these thinking&#xD;
      patterns (Moritz et al., 2013; Mortiz et al., 2014). The MCT program for treatment of&#xD;
      delusions involves experiencing situations where everyday interpretations of reality must be&#xD;
      questioned. Empirical studies and meta-analyses indicate that MCT is effective, even up to&#xD;
      three years after completion of treatment (relative to active control conditions and&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these successes, no treatment of schizophrenia can be considered highly effective,&#xD;
      and there is always room for improvement in effect size. Neuromodulation can provide this&#xD;
      improvement by biasing pathological brain functioning towards a healthy state prior to MCT,&#xD;
      enhancing the openness to questioning everyday interpretations of reality, and enhancing the&#xD;
      effect of MCT treatment of delusions. tACS is almost entirely non-invasive and purely&#xD;
      modulatory, changing the likelihood of neural firing in a region of cortex under the&#xD;
      stimulation electrodes. It is now possible to modulate at different frequencies of&#xD;
      oscillation, in accordance with how the healthy brain functions when interpreting reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research involves application of oscillation-targeted neuromodulation protocols&#xD;
      to bias brain functioning towards a state that promotes questioning everyday interpretations&#xD;
      of reality, thereby reducing severity of delusions, and enhancing response to a training&#xD;
      program for treatment of delusions in schizophrenia by raising insight about the thinking&#xD;
      patterns that lead to delusional thought. The investigators plan to document the brain&#xD;
      changes induced by neuromodulation using performance and EEG measures taken on a decision&#xD;
      making task that involves interpretation of reality, and for which performance correlates&#xD;
      with the severity of delusions. This task involves judging the likelihood that evidence&#xD;
      matches a hypothesis, and it has been shown that this judged likelihood increases when&#xD;
      patients are strongly delusional. The investigators have shown that this task state (i.e.,&#xD;
      evidence-hypothesis match) elicits an increase in alpha power in the task positive network,&#xD;
      and a decrease in beta power the default-mode network (Whitman et al., in press). This&#xD;
      suggests that maximizing the power of the alpha band in the task-positive network should bias&#xD;
      the brain towards a healthier state for weighing evidence to test hypotheses about reality,&#xD;
      and this can be confirmed with EEG and behavioral measures taken on the aforementioned&#xD;
      decision making task, a heightened response to MCT, and a corresponding decrease in the&#xD;
      severity of delusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation involving tACS will target increasing the power of the alpha band at&#xD;
      dorsomedial prefrontal regions, and this is expected to also decrease the power of the beta&#xD;
      band in ventro-medial regions. This will be confirmed by EEG recordings and source estimation&#xD;
      (Whitman et al., in press; Whitman, Minz &amp; Woodward, 2013). MCT is a four week program with&#xD;
      eight one-hour sessions. TAU is a four week waitlist control group. Sham neuromodulation will&#xD;
      involve application of random patterns of low-grade currents to the same brain region as the&#xD;
      neuromodulation conditions (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013). Severity of delusions will be measured by&#xD;
      the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales in psychosis (PSYRATS) (Haddock et al., 1999). The&#xD;
      behavioral measure of interest is the rating of the match between the evidence and&#xD;
      hypothesis, which should decrease as delusions decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between-groups (neuromodulation/MCT vs. sham/MCT vs neuromodulation/TAU) analyses of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) will be carried out on change scores computed on behavioral measures and severity of&#xD;
      delusions, pre- and post MCT or TAU, under the hypothesis that decreases in the severity of&#xD;
      delusion will be greater in the neuromodulation/MCT condition relative to the sham/MCT and&#xD;
      neuromodulation/TAU conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control-Phase Studies: DREAM Study, Hearing Brain Study and The Effect of Neuromodulation on&#xD;
      Saccades Study. Each described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose for Control Phase Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of these studies is to establish the effectiveness of the EGI GTEN system in&#xD;
      modulating brain oscillations in the cortex of healthy participants by means of transcranial&#xD;
      alternating current stimulation (tACS). In this control/pilot phase of our study, we aim to&#xD;
      establish that we can induce changes in the power of a specific frequency band in targeted&#xD;
      cortical regions with neuromodulation using the GTEN system, and we will assess whether doing&#xD;
      so temporarily alters performance on simple cognitive and perceptual processes in healthy&#xD;
      controls. This will be the first step towards translating our stimulation protocol to the&#xD;
      patient population for our primary study of interest (tACS as an adjunct to metacognitive&#xD;
      training for delusions in psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for Control Phase Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive method used to&#xD;
      influence ongoing brain oscillations in humans by applying sinusoidal currents to the scalp&#xD;
      (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013; Vosskuhl, Strüber, &amp; Herrmann, 2018). Human brain oscillations, as&#xD;
      measured with electroencephalography (EEG), range from 1 to 100 Hz and are referred to as&#xD;
      delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz)&#xD;
      oscillations. The oscillations, generated either spontaneously or in response to external&#xD;
      stimuli, are the result of rhythmic or repetitive electrical activity of cells, and are known&#xD;
      to be involved in the communication of brain regions (Vosskuhl et al., 2018). The&#xD;
      synchronization of rhythmical electrical activity leads to increased power in the frequency&#xD;
      band of the rhythmical activity. For example, the presentation of an auditory stimulus&#xD;
      (&quot;auditory entrainment&quot;) at a frequency of 40Hz increases the power of the 40Hz brain&#xD;
      oscillations in the auditory cortex ;this phenomenon is known as Auditory Steady-State&#xD;
      Response (ASSR; Galambos, Makeig, &amp; Talmachoff, 1981; O'Donnell et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have mainly relied on systems that use two large electrodes on the scalp to&#xD;
      modulate the underlying brain activity in the oscillation frequency range of interest. The&#xD;
      GTEN has 256 potential stimulation sites, as well as advanced source localization techniques,&#xD;
      allowing for precise planning and application of current via tailored combinations of&#xD;
      electrodes according to the 'reciprocity principle' (Dmochowski, Koessler, Norcia, Bikson, &amp;&#xD;
      Parra, 2017; Fernandez-Corazza, Turovets, Luu, Anderson, &amp; Tucker, 2016). The 'reciprocity&#xD;
      principal' is a process enabling optimal targeting/stimulation of the brain sources of&#xD;
      recorded EEG signal. The GTEN system has in-built software for this very purpose, allowing&#xD;
      researchers to program electrodes with the dominant power of frequencies of oscillation,&#xD;
      using a small subset of electrodes (4-7) to optimally target the brain regions of interest.&#xD;
      This reciprocity principal is ground-breaking in its capacity to demonstrate causal&#xD;
      relationships between brain and behavior: by targeting the very brain sources producing brain&#xD;
      activity of interest, and applying tACS while observing the behavioral effects on performance&#xD;
      (e.g., reaction time, accuracy), one can experimentally link cognitive processes to specific&#xD;
      patterns of brain oscillations. Establishing that we are able to use these methods in this&#xD;
      way will be an important precursor to our study of tACS as an adjunct to metacognitive&#xD;
      training for delusions. Our work using tACS to bias ongoing network activity in the brain&#xD;
      rests on being able to accurately target those networks producing the activity of interest,&#xD;
      and document whether doing so temporarily changes performance on simple cognitive tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our &quot;pilot/control&quot; phase with healthy controls will familiarize us with the GTEN system and&#xD;
      enable us to optimize the parameters under which GTEN tACS produces short-term changes in&#xD;
      cortical excitability and cognitive processes. These insights will inform our larger study&#xD;
      focussing on enhancing metacognitive treatment of delusions in schizophrenia using&#xD;
      neuromodulation To validate that the GTEN tACS is able to bias ongoing oscillations in&#xD;
      targeted cortical areas in a biologically-relevant manner, an initial study in healthy&#xD;
      controls (&quot;The Hearing Brain&quot;) will investigate the degree to which GTEN tACS applied to the&#xD;
      auditory cortex mimics and/or influences the ASSR that endogenously occurs during perception&#xD;
      of an auditory tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand whether GTEN tACS temporarily alters performance on cognitive processes by&#xD;
      biasing dominant patterns of oscillations, a second set of initial studies in healthy&#xD;
      controls will be run called the &quot;Dynamic Reciprocal Electroencephalography and Modulation&#xD;
      (DREAM&quot;) study. The DREAM study will apply the reciprocity principle while participants&#xD;
      undergo simple cognitive and perceptual tasks. This data collection in healthy controls will&#xD;
      include the methods we have already received ethics permission to use with clinical&#xD;
      populations (e.g., see 'Enhancement of Treatment of Delusions in Schizophrenia through&#xD;
      Neuromodulation Protocol'). Piloting these methods will serve as a verification that tACS can&#xD;
      alter cortical excitability in the cortical regions that are implicated in delusional&#xD;
      thinking, which we have already been granted permission to neuromodulate in our primary study&#xD;
      of patients with schizophrenia. The pilot study will also serve as a preliminary&#xD;
      investigation of whether tACS has detectable influences on cognitive tasks that correlate&#xD;
      with psychopathology (e.g., delusions). One task involves judging the likelihood that&#xD;
      evidence matches a hypothesis, and it has been shown that this judged likelihood increases&#xD;
      when patients are strongly delusional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also aim to study the behavioural effects of tACS in the &quot;The Effect of Neuromodulation on&#xD;
      Saccades Study.&quot; Instead of using complex behavioural tasks, we aim to use a simpler and&#xD;
      better-understood behaviour response - the oculomotor response. In this study, we aim to use&#xD;
      tACS to stimulate the areas involved in oculomotor control to affect eye movements.&#xD;
      Participants' gaze will be tracked binocularly using the Eyelink 1,000 system (SR Research,&#xD;
      Kanata, ON). The oculomotor response is a well understood behavioural response that is not&#xD;
      complex in nature and would allow us to study the effects of tACS on behaviour, this would&#xD;
      expand our knowledge on the behavioural effects of tACS. The rationale behind using tACS is&#xD;
      that we can target a specific ongoing brain oscillation. In this proof-of-concept study, we&#xD;
      plan to use tACS to stimulate frontal eye fields (FEF), which we expect to interrupt the&#xD;
      natural network balance, and slow saccades. Thus, the overall objectives of this study are&#xD;
      (1) to identify the brain oscillations in FEF underlying saccade preparation and execution,&#xD;
      and (2) change activity in these networks through neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;Hearing Brain&quot; proof-of concept pilot study, we hypothesize that auditory entrainment&#xD;
      at 40 Hz as well as GTEN stimulation at 40Hz, but not sham stimulation, will increase the&#xD;
      gamma band power in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, we hypothesize stronger gamma band&#xD;
      power after GTEN stimulation compared to auditory entrainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the &quot;DREAM studies,&quot; we predict that that GTEN applied based on the reciprocity&#xD;
      principle will alter participants' accuracy and reaction time while undergoing simple&#xD;
      cognitive and perceptual tasks. In particular, regarding the pilot of the methods of the&#xD;
      primary study( Enhancement of Treatment of Delusions in Schizophrenia through&#xD;
      Neuromodulation), we hypothesize that neuromodulation involving tACS will target increasing&#xD;
      the power of the alpha band at dorsomedial prefrontal regions and bias our behavioral measure&#xD;
      of interest (the rating of the match between the evidence and hypothesis (see Figure 1 in&#xD;
      'Enhancement of Treatment of Delusions in Schizophrenia through Neuromodulation Protocol').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the &quot;The Effect of Neuromodulation on Saccades Study,&quot; we predict the following: 1.&#xD;
      Increased power of alpha oscillation in the FEF will be detected by hdEEG when saccades are&#xD;
      execute 2. GTEN-induced alpha oscillations in the FEF will increase saccade latency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: proof-of concept study &quot;The Hearing Brain&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a between-subjects design to investigate the influence of auditory entrainment,&#xD;
      neuromodulation, sham stimulation (control condition), and control frequency stimulation&#xD;
      (active control condition) on the power of the gamma band (30-40Hz) in the auditory cortex.&#xD;
      All participants will be assigned to either the Neuromodulation, Sham, or Active Control&#xD;
      (control frequency) condition, with or without also undergoing the Auditory entrainment&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation: For each participant, we will establish a threshold at which the participant&#xD;
      first detects the stimulations (e.g., due to phosphenes or skin sensations). In line with&#xD;
      other threshold protocols, we will start with tACS stimulation at 40 Hz and 1000 µA for 1&#xD;
      second and increase the amplitude of the stimulation stepwise by 250 µA to a maximum of 3000&#xD;
      µA (Zaehle et al., 2010). Participants will be asked to indicate the presence of any&#xD;
      sensations they experience. Each participant's maximum stimulation intensity will be kept 250&#xD;
      µA below their threshold for experiencing phosphenes or skin sensations (whichever threshold&#xD;
      is lower).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During stimulation, tACS will be applied over the auditory cortex with a frequency of 40 Hz.&#xD;
      For each stimulation, the current will be slowly ramped up to the participant's tailored&#xD;
      intensity and ramped down at the end of the segment. The stimulation electrodes in the&#xD;
      current proof-of-concept study will be those identified as showing the largest increase in&#xD;
      gamma power in an auditory entrainment pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory entrainment: Participants will be listening to a sequence of tones presented at&#xD;
      40Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham: This condition is used to control for expectation effects. Similar to the&#xD;
      neuromodulation condition, the current will be ramped up and ramped down; however there will&#xD;
      be no stimulation in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control frequency: People in this active control group would be modulated on the same&#xD;
      electrodes and with the same current intensity, but at a different frequency band. An active&#xD;
      control group is needed in order to make sure the effects are due to the applied frequency of&#xD;
      interest and not just due to the current itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest: After each neuromodulation, entrainment, and sham trial there will be rest period of 50&#xD;
      seconds to measure resting-state EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each condition ( modulation, sham, auditory entrainment) will be 50 seconds long and&#xD;
      presented 7 times in blocks. In between the conditions there will be a 50 seconds&#xD;
      resting-state measurement to assess the durability of interventions on brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: proof-of concept &quot;Dynamic Reciprocal Electroencephalography and&#xD;
      Modulation&quot; (DREAM) study&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a between-subjects design to investigate the influence of neuromodulation based&#xD;
      on the reciprocity principle vs. sham stimulation (control condition) vs. control frequency&#xD;
      stimulation (active control condition) on reaction time and accuracy in simple cognitive and&#xD;
      perceptual tasks. These tasks include the Stroop Interference Task, listening to/ reading&#xD;
      non-offensive non-emotional words, and remembering words or visual arrays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also plan to pilot tACS in the evidence-integration task which has been shown to correlate&#xD;
      with delusional severity in psychosis. To illustrate the reciprocity principle method for&#xD;
      this task, participants will be assigned to receive either tACS or sham neuromodulation.&#xD;
      Neuromodulation involving tACS will target the dominant pattern of brain oscillations, which&#xD;
      we expect to be the alpha band at dorsomedial prefrontal regions, and doing so is expected to&#xD;
      also decrease the power of the beta band in ventro-medial regions (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013).&#xD;
      This will be confirmed by EEG recordings and source estimation (Whitman et al., in press;&#xD;
      Whitman, Ward, &amp; Woodward, 2013) during the task used to produce Figure 1. Sham&#xD;
      neuromodulation will involve application of random patterns or very brief low-grade currents&#xD;
      to the same brain region as the neuromodulation condition (Antal &amp; Paulus, 2013). The&#xD;
      behavioral measure of interest in this task is the rating of the match between the evidence&#xD;
      and hypothesis (see Figure 1), which has been shown to correlate with delusional severity in&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: proof-of concept study &quot;The Effect of Neuromodulation on Saccades&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiments proposed are standard saccade experiments, similar to the ones conducted by&#xD;
      Chen Zhang et al. In the prosaccade task, each trial begins with a fixation point at the&#xD;
      center of the screen that lasts for 800-1200 ms picked randomly from an exponential&#xD;
      distribution. Participants will be instructed to fixate on the fixation point. The fixation&#xD;
      point disappears and, after a time gap of 200 ms, a peripheral target appears randomly at 10°&#xD;
      to the left or right of the central fixation point. Participants will be instructed to make a&#xD;
      rapid saccade in the direction of the target. They have 1,000 ms to complete the saccade to&#xD;
      the correct location. In the anti-saccade task, the procedure remains the same but the&#xD;
      participants are instructed to make a saccade in the opposite direction of the target. In the&#xD;
      memory-guided saccade task, participants will be instructed to maintain fixation, after which&#xD;
      two targets will appear sequentially for 100 ms each in one of four quadrants around the&#xD;
      periphery of the screen. Participants will be required to maintain fixation for additional&#xD;
      time and wait for the go signal (disappearance of the fixation point). Then the participants&#xD;
      are required to make two saccades as accurately as possible to the remembered locations of&#xD;
      the targets in the same sequence in which they occurred. The prosaccade, anti-saccade, and&#xD;
      memory-guided saccade trials will be interleaved in a block. The different types of tasks&#xD;
      will be differentiated by different colors of the fixation cross.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tACS Protocol: All the participants will perform three blocks of the above experiment:&#xD;
      pre-stimulation block (pre), stimulation block (stim/sham), post-stimulation block (post). In&#xD;
      the pre-stimulation block, participants will perform all the above tasks, simultaneously&#xD;
      their EEG data is recorded and their eye-movements are tracked. Based on the EEG data, the&#xD;
      exact montage for frontal eye fields (FEF) stimulation will be estimated for each&#xD;
      participant. Also, the exact alpha frequency for stimulation will be estimated. Based on&#xD;
      these parameters, half the participants will be stimulated in the stimulation block. The&#xD;
      other half of the participants will act as controls will undergo a sham block. In both cases,&#xD;
      the participants also perform the saccade tasks. The post block is similar to the&#xD;
      pre-stimulation block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proof-of concept study &quot;The Hearing Brain&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Spectrum density (PSD) for the range of 1 to 50Hz will be calculated for each of the&#xD;
      resting-state measurements and averaged for each of the conditions. Repeated-measures&#xD;
      (entrainment vs. neuromodulation vs. sham vs. control frequency) analyses of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be carried out for the PSD values of gamma band and the control frequency bands (alpha,&#xD;
      beta), under the hypothesis that neuromodulation and entrainment but not sham will lead to&#xD;
      increased gamma band power but not to differences in the control frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proof-of-concept &quot;DREAM&quot; study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between-groups (neuromodulation vs. sham vs. control frequency stimulation) analyses of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be carried out on change scores computed on behavioral measures&#xD;
      (accuracy, reaction time) in order to assess whether tACS applied using the reciprocity&#xD;
      principle to bias ongoing brain oscillations alters cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proof-of concept study &quot;The Effect of Neuromodulation on Saccades&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG preprocessing: The hdEEG data recorded using the GTEN system will be analyzed using&#xD;
      MATLAB 2019b using in-house scripts. EEGLAB 13.6.5b (Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004) functions were&#xD;
      used to generate the topographical plots. The spectral analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      Chronux 2.12 toolbox (Bokil et al., 2010). The EEG data will be preprocessed using a&#xD;
      Statistical Correction of Artifacts in Dense-array Studies (SCADS) (Junghöfer et al., 2000),&#xD;
      which removes EEG artifacts based on statistical parameters. Firstly, the data will be&#xD;
      filtered using an FIR bandpass filter with stop band frequencies at 2Hz and 55Hz. The filter&#xD;
      will be designed using the MATLAB based signal processing toolbox. Then the EEG data will be&#xD;
      epoched to contain the entire trial. Then, electrodes contaminated with artifacts will be&#xD;
      rejected by the SCADS algorithm. The parameters used for electrode rejection are - maximum&#xD;
      amplitude, maximum gradient and standard deviation of signal amplitude in each epoch, and&#xD;
      each electrode. Further, the EEG data will be re-referenced to the average signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montage estimation using EEG: The exact electrode montage and stimulation frequency to be&#xD;
      used in the stimulation block, will be estimated based on the EEG data collected in the&#xD;
      pre-stimulation block. The EEG data is preprocessed and epoched w.r.t the saccade onset. EEG&#xD;
      data from -1000ms to 500ms from the saccade onset is used to generate epochs. The source of&#xD;
      the preparatory activity before the saccade is estimated using Constrained Principal&#xD;
      Component Analysis (CPCA) (Takane &amp; Hunter, 2001). CPCA generates a component for the saccade&#xD;
      preparation. The electrode loadings for the component will be used as a montage for tACS&#xD;
      stimulation. Also, the frequency whose phase encodes the saccade latency (For more details&#xD;
      refer to the methods in Drewes &amp; VanRullen, 2011) will be used as the stimulation frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye-tracking data analysis: All the data analyses will be performed on MATLAB 2019b. The&#xD;
      eye-tracking data will be analyzed using in-house scripts. The eye-tracking data is parsed&#xD;
      into different types of epochs. Missing data corresponding to eye-blinks will be rejected&#xD;
      from the analysis. Also, the trials in which the participant does not maintain fixation will&#xD;
      be rejected. The gaze velocity is used to discriminate saccades from fixations. Then data&#xD;
      from each trial is analyzed to check if the participant performed the correct saccade. E.g.,&#xD;
      if in an anti-saccade trial, the participant saccades away from the target, then the trial is&#xD;
      assigned as correct; otherwise, it is assigned as an incorrect trial. Then, for all the&#xD;
      trials, behavioral metrics such as saccade accuracy, latency, velocity, amplitude, and&#xD;
      trajectories will be extracted. The online effect of stimulation (Stim - Pre) and the&#xD;
      long-term effect of stimulation (Post - Pre) is checked for each behavioral metric and each&#xD;
      of the saccade tasks. To test hypotheses, analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be carried out on&#xD;
      the dependent measures - saccade latency, accuracy, velocity, amplitude, etc, with&#xD;
      Sham/Stimulation as the between-subjects variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary studies will be conducted in healthy controls order to establish that we&#xD;
      can induce changes in the power of a specific frequency band with neuromodulation using the&#xD;
      GTEN system. Further, we aim to establish that we are able to detect short-term changes in&#xD;
      EEG signal following tACS and alter cognitive processes that are relevant to the experience&#xD;
      of psychiatric illness. Conducting this pilot research will be essential in translating our&#xD;
      stimulation protocol to the patient population.&#xD;

             greater than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recently suffered a serious concussion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;

&#xD;
        For control-phase studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects. We will recruit 440 participants total in the &quot;Enhancement of Treatment of&#xD;
        Delusions in Schizophrenia through Neuromodulation&quot; study H16-01791; The current protocol&#xD;
        describes the methods to be used in the Control Phase of our research, during which we will&#xD;
        recruit 290 healthy controls between 19 and 60 years in order to establish proof-of-concept&#xD;
        for using GTEN tACS in modulating brain oscillations and performance on simple cognitive&#xD;
        tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for healthy controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of neurological problems (e.g., stroke, aneurysm, Parkinson's, Multiple&#xD;

          -  History of seizure disorder or family history of seizure disorder. While there is no&#xD;
             direct evidence to suggest that tACS increases the risk of seizure in those with a&#xD;
             history of seizure disorder in their family, research in this area is still relatively&#xD;
             recent (&lt; 15 years). Given the unlikely potential for an unknown elevated risk of&#xD;
             seizure, we are including this as a conservative precautionary exclusion factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of migraines or other types of frequent severe headaches. tACS can induce a&#xD;
             headache in those prone to migraines and other forms of severe headaches.&#xD;
