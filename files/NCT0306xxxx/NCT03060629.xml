      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the preventive vaccine efficacy (VE), safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of a heterologous prime/boost regimen utilizing Ad26.Mos4.HIV and&#xD;
      aluminum-phosphate adjuvanted Clade C gp 140 for the prevention of Human Immuno Virus (HIV)&#xD;
      infection in HIV-seronegative women residing in sub-Saharan Africa from confirmed HIV-1&#xD;
      infections diagnosed between the Month 7 and Month 24 visits.&#xD;

             Team) PSRT will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live attenuated vaccines received within 30 days before first vaccination or scheduled&#xD;

             vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were received within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to first vaccination (example, tetanus, pneumococcal, Hepatitis A or B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressive medications received within 6 months before first vaccination&#xD;
