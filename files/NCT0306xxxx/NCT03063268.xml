  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a novel, electronic informed consent&#xD;
      application for research involving electronic health record (EHR) data. In response to NIH&#xD;
      RFA-OD-15-002, this study addresses research using clinical records and data, including the&#xD;
      issues of the appropriate content and duration of informed consent and patient preferences&#xD;
      about research use of clinical information. This study will design an electronic consent&#xD;
      application intended to improve patients' satisfaction with and understanding of consent for&#xD;
      research using their EHR data. The electronic application will provide interactive&#xD;
      functionality that creates a virtual, patient-centered discussion with patients about&#xD;
      research that uses EHR data. Also, to correct potential misconceptions and increase&#xD;
      informedness, the application will present trust-enhancing messages that highlight facts&#xD;
      about research regulations, researcher training, and data protections. This study (Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2 of the linked study protocol) will compare the effectiveness of the interactive,&#xD;
      trust-enhanced consent application to an interactive consent and standard consent (no&#xD;
      interactivity, no trust- enhancement) using a randomized trial of the three consents with 750&#xD;
      adults in a network of family medicine practices. Primary outcomes will be satisfaction with&#xD;
      the consent decision and understanding of the consent content. This application will allow&#xD;
      patients to learn more about clinical research and make informed choices about whether or not&#xD;
      they want their health records and data to be used for research. This first phase of this&#xD;
      project (IRB#:201500678) was innovative because it created a virtual, patient-centered&#xD;
      discussion about research using EHR data. Moreover, this project produced a consent&#xD;
      application that clinicians and researchers will use in this phase (Phase two) of the trial&#xD;
      as an ethically sound and practical tool for consenting patients, in a clinical setting, for&#xD;
      research involving EHRs. Overall, this study will improve understanding of how to best give&#xD;
      patients information about research that uses their health records and data. With this&#xD;
      understanding, this study will develop a new computer application that patients can use in&#xD;
      their doctors' offices. This application will allow patients to learn more about clinical&#xD;
      research and make informed choices about whether or not they want their health records and&#xD;
      data to be used for research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study (Specific Aim 2 of the linked study protocol) will compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the interactive, trust-enhanced consent application to an interactive consent and standard&#xD;
      consent (no interactivity, no trust- enhancement) using a randomized trial of the three&#xD;
      consents with 750 adults in a network of family medicine practices. Primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      satisfaction with the consent decision and understanding of the consent content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptually, the hypothesized effectiveness of this study's new consent application relies&#xD;
      on two constructs, interactivity and trust. Many studies have identified the importance of&#xD;
      trust in researchers when it comes to people's willingness to participate in research.&#xD;
      Moreover, trust in the source of information is critical to participants' evaluations of risk&#xD;
      information. And, risk information is an important element of the research consent process.&#xD;
      Thus, highlighted relevant messages to participants at the outset of a research consent&#xD;
      process. It is expected that these messages will not coerce participants nor will they&#xD;
      dramatically alter participants' general trust in researchers. More importantly, empirically&#xD;
      assessments of both of these expectations to ensure the application delivers an ethically&#xD;
      appropriate consenting experience. However, it is expected that presenting key facts about&#xD;
      research data protections, researcher training, and research regulations will increase the&#xD;
      likelihood that participants will be willing to learn about research using medical records.&#xD;
      In turn, this will increase participants' understanding and help them make a more informed&#xD;
      decision. In the absence of these trust-related messages, it is expected that many&#xD;
      participants will simply disengage from the details of the consent information and thus make&#xD;
      a less informed decision about participating. Next, the investigators' use of interactivity&#xD;
      is supported by research on the effectiveness of communications that interactively deliver&#xD;
      detail, empower audiences, and allow a self - discovery process. Indeed, an interactive,&#xD;
      person-to-person consent process is the standard approach in clinical trials. Therefore, in&#xD;
      the new consent application, the interface will allow participants to interactively explore&#xD;
      the details that are most important for their personal understanding of research using EHRs&#xD;
      and most relevant to their personal information needs and satisfaction with the consent&#xD;
      decision. Without this interactive information exploration, which is essentially dynamically&#xD;
      tailored to their personal information needs, participants are more likely to be overwhelmed&#xD;
      by the volume of information presented and unable to obtain the information they want most.&#xD;
      Under these circumstances, participants' overall understanding of the consent information is&#xD;
      likely to decrease, and they are likely to make less satisfactory decisions. There are two&#xD;
      specific hypotheses: (1) compared to the standard consent, the interactive consent will lead&#xD;
      to increased decisional satisfaction and understanding of the consent; and (2) compared to&#xD;
      the interactive consent, the interactive, trust-enhanced consent will lead to increased&#xD;
      decisional satisfaction and understanding of the consent.&#xD;
