  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CK-2127107 versus placebo on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle fatigue assessed as change from baseline versus 14 days of treatment in sum&#xD;
      of peak torque during isokinetic knee extensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess the effects of CK-2127107 on physical performance via a short&#xD;
      physical performance battery (SPPB), stair-climb test and 6 minute walk test.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either CK-2127107 or Placebo first and&#xD;
      then will be crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. The study will consist of two&#xD;
      treatment periods of 14 days separated by a washout period of 14 days.&#xD;
