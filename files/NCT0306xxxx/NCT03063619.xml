    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well afimoxifene works in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer in women with mammographically dense breast. Estrogen can cause the growth of&#xD;
      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using afimoxifene may fight breast cancer by blocking&#xD;
      the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate and compare the percent change in mammographic breast density (using Cumulus&#xD;
      software) from baseline to month 12 in women applying 4mg afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen&#xD;
      [4-OHT]) gel per breast versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the Cumulus versus (vs.) Volpara breast density measurement methods to estimate&#xD;
      percent change in mammographic breast density from baseline to month 12 in women applying 4mg&#xD;
      of 4-OHT gel per breast vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the percentage of women who underwent a change in Breast Imaging Reporting and&#xD;
      Data System (BIRADS) category, comparing pre-and post- treatment measurements, for recipients&#xD;
      of active agent versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate percentage of women with &gt;= 10% absolute decrease in quantitative&#xD;
      mammographic density percentage between baseline and 12 months, comparing between treated&#xD;
      group 4mg per breast 4-OHT gel to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe symptoms assessed by breast cancer prevention trial (BCPT) eight symptom&#xD;
      scale (BESS) questionnaire and laboratory toxicity assessment (factor VIII [F VIII], Von&#xD;
      Willebrand [vWB] factor, sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], lipid profile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate serum measurements of 4-OHT and related metabolite levels and factors related&#xD;
      to tamoxifen exposures, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway members, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), estradiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate tissue biomarkers (among women undergoing optional pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      biopsies): terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution; collagen structural changes;&#xD;
      SETER/PR index: estrogen related transcription, Ki-67, COX-2, p16, CD68.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To examine whether any reductions in mammographic density seen after 1 year of 4-OHT vs.&#xD;
      placebo gel application persist at 24 months, one year after gel application has stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients apply placebo gel topically to each breast once daily (QD) for up to 52&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically to each breast QD for up to 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 months.&#xD;
