  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Offspring of mothers with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are at serious risk for&#xD;
      developing mental illness at every stage of their life, and yet little is known about how&#xD;
      this risk is transmitted. This study will leverage Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills as an&#xD;
      experimental intervention to determine if preschool emotion regulation develops more rapidly&#xD;
      as a result of improvements in mothers' ability to regulate her own emotions. The knowledge&#xD;
      from this study will identify a modifiable pathway by which maternal BPD places offspring at&#xD;
      risk for later mental disorders and will quantify how much improvement in children's ability&#xD;
      to regulate their emotions can be achieved by treating mothers alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by extreme&#xD;
      emotions, chaotic interpersonal relationships, suicidal behaviors, and a poor sense of self.&#xD;
      Offspring of mothers with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are at an elevated risk for&#xD;
      developing mental illness across the lifespan. Difficulty managing emotions are a hallmark&#xD;
      feature of BPD, and yet the ability to do so is necessary for responding effectively to&#xD;
      childrens' emotions. This process is called maternal emotion socialization, which has a major&#xD;
      impact on how children develop their own emotion regulation (ER) skills. ER develops rapidly&#xD;
      during preschool and deficits in preschool ER are recognized as underlying future mental&#xD;
      disorders. This proposal will test a model examining the extent to which maternal ER and&#xD;
      emotion socialization impact child ER, which may be a significant pathway by which mental&#xD;
      health problems are transmitted to offspring of mothers with BPD. This proposal will leverage&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills training, a robust and effective method for&#xD;
      improving ER as a tool to change maternal ER in mothers with BPD. By completing multiple&#xD;
      assessments of biobehavioral markers of child and mother ER, this study is poised to uncover&#xD;
      a potentially modifiable pathway by which these offspring are at risk. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a stratified randomized controlled trial of DBT Skills for&#xD;
      mothers with BPD who have preschoolers. A total of 300 dyads (initial child age: 36-54&#xD;
      months) will be collected in Eugene, Oregon and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, with 100 pairs in&#xD;
      each of three groups: children who have mothers with BPD who receive DBT Skills, children who&#xD;
      have mothers with BPD who receive Family Services as Usual, and children who have&#xD;
      non-disordered mothers, matched on income, with this final group only participating in&#xD;
      assessments (as to quantify normative ER growth). All children will be assessed 4 times every&#xD;
      2-months, with the first assessment occurring prior to treatment assignment. Investigators&#xD;
      will use a biobehavioral laboratory battery to measure child ER, assessing emotion&#xD;
      understanding, strategy use, attention regulation and inhibitory control, and parasympathetic&#xD;
      regulation. In mothers, a similar multi-method approach to assess emotion acceptance,&#xD;
      strategy use, recognition, and parasympathetic regulation will be employed. Finally, during&#xD;
      each laboratory assessment, there will be observations of mother's ability to effectively&#xD;
      respond to children in the context of child negative emotions. Growth curve modeling will&#xD;
      chart child ER trajectories for all 3 groups so that investigators can compare child ER&#xD;
      growth as a function of: group status (DBT Skills vs. Family Services as Usual vs. income&#xD;
      matched, non-disordered controls), changes in maternal ER, and changes in maternal emotion&#xD;
      socialization. Findings from this proposal will identify a modifiable pathway by which&#xD;
      offspring of mothers with BPD are at risk, determine the extent to which child ER can be&#xD;
      restored by treating mothers, and will be the first DBT Skills trial to measure outcomes in&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
