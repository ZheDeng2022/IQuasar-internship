      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to&#xD;
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40, then every&#xD;
      16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled&#xD;
      date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria&#xD;
      for 3 treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue AZD2014 beyond progression&#xD;
      (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are clinically&#xD;
      benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue&#xD;
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks following objective disease&#xD;
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation&#xD;
      of treatment, will be collected. The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will&#xD;
      be CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. RECIST 1.1 scans will be analysed by the&#xD;
      investigator on site.&#xD;
