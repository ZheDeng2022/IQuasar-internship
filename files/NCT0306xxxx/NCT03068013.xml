  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with advanced cancer suffer from a variety of psycho-social symptoms&#xD;
      that impair quality of life and may benefit from psychotherapeutic treatment. We describe&#xD;
      here the methodology of a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a novel&#xD;
      and brief semi-structured psychotherapeutic intervention, called Managing Cancer and Living&#xD;
      Meaningfully (CALM), originally developed in Canada and now cross-culturally tested in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions:&#xD;
      CALM intervention versus nonspecific supportive intervention (SPI) and assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. The coordinating site is the Program on Psycho-Oncology and&#xD;
      Psychiatry in Palliative Care, University of Ferrara and Integrated Department of Mental&#xD;
      Health, S. Anna University Hospital, in Ferrara, Italy. Another centre from northern and&#xD;
      southern Italy will collaborate. Eligibility criteria include: ≥ 18 years of age; Italian&#xD;
      fluency; no cognitive impairment; and diagnosis of advanced cancer. The intervention consists&#xD;
      of 12 sessions , following the CALM manual and allowing for flexibility to meet individual&#xD;
      patients' needs. It is delivered over a 6-month period and provides reflective space for&#xD;
      patients (and their primary caregivers) to address 4 main domains: symptom management and&#xD;
      communication with health care providers; changes in self and relations with close others;&#xD;
      sense of meaning and purpose; and the future and mortality. The primary outcome is depression&#xD;
      and the primary endpoint is at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include demoralization,&#xD;
      generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life, attachment&#xD;
      security, posttraumatic growth, communication with partners, and satisfaction with clinical&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This trial is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of CALM in an&#xD;
      Italian cancer setting. The intervention has potential cross-national relevance and, if shown&#xD;
      to be effective, has the potential to be disseminated as a new approach in oncology to&#xD;
      relieve distress and promote psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is coordinated by the Program on Psycho-Oncology and Palliative Care, University of&#xD;
      Ferrara Northern Italy. Another centre from northern Italy will collaborate. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a single-blinded randomized-controlled trial with two arms. Participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group will receive the CALM intervention, while those in Control Group will&#xD;
      receive a supportive intervention, which is usual psycho-oncology care in our settings.The&#xD;
      primary outcome is depression. The primary endpoint is 6 months. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      demoralization, generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life,&#xD;
      attachment security, posttraumatic growth, communication with partners, and satisfaction with&#xD;
      clinical interactions.The study has received approval from Ethical Committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:Patients in the experimental group will receive the CALM intervention, a&#xD;
      semi-structured psychotherapy designed for patients with advanced cancer. In this Italian&#xD;
      adaptation, CALM consists of 12 individual sessions (45-60 minutes each), instead of the&#xD;
      original 6 sessions. The sessions are delivered bimonthly over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention covers four domains: 1) Symptom management and communication with health&#xD;
      care providers; 2) Changes in self and relations with close others; 3) Spiritual well-being,&#xD;
      sense of meaning and purpose; 4) Preparing for the future, sustaining hope and facing&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-manualized supportive psycho-oncology intervention (SPI):The Control group intervention&#xD;
      includes counseling, information, crisis intervention, which is the usual care intervention&#xD;
      provided in our center. As with CALM patients, SPI patients receive up to twelve sessions of&#xD;
      individual therapy during a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:18 years of age or more;fluency in Italian language; absence of&#xD;
      cognitive deficit documented in the clinical records;diagnosis of &quot;wet&quot; stage IIIB or IV lung&#xD;
      cancer; any stage of pancreatic cancer, stage III or IV ovarian and fallopian tube cancers,&#xD;
      or other stage IV gynecological cancer; and stage IV breast, genitourinary, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      melanoma, sarcoma, or endocrine cancers (all with an expected survival of 12-18 months); a&#xD;
      score ≥10 at the Patient Health Questionnaire and/or ≥ 20 at the Death and Dying Distress&#xD;
      Scale. Exclusion criteria are: language barriers hindering psychotherapy;inability to commit&#xD;
      to the required 12 sessions; concomitant psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure:Study participants are randomly assigned to receive either CALM or&#xD;
      SPI. After obtaining informed consent , a research assistant includes patient's data on the&#xD;
      random allocation list and informs the PI's about treatment allocation (CALM or SPI). The&#xD;
      patient is not informed about treatment condition (CaLM or SPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9-item measure of depression. It is&#xD;
      composed by nine items, reflecting DSM-IV criteria for major depression. A four-point Likert&#xD;
      scale scores from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), with a cut-off score of ≥10&#xD;
      suggesting depression. For study purposes, two additional items assessing self-harm intention&#xD;
      and rating how difficult these symptoms have made it to do lead one's life, have been&#xD;
      included.The Demoralization Scale (DS) is a 24-item self-report tool assessing demoralization&#xD;
      components of loss of meaning and purpose, dysphoria, disheartenment and helplessness. Items&#xD;
      are scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (all the time). Low&#xD;
      levels of demoralization were indicated by a score 10, moderate demoralization by a score&#xD;
      11-36, and high demoralization by a score &gt; 37.The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire&#xD;
      (GAD-7) is a 7-item self-report instrument screening the severity of GAD symptoms. Items are&#xD;
      scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).&#xD;
      Scores ≤4 indicate absence of anxiety, scores from 5 to 9 suggest that mild anxiety is&#xD;
      present, and scores from 10 to 15 indicate moderate levels of anxiety. An eighth item rating&#xD;
      how difficult these symptoms have made it to lead one's daily life has been included. The&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-SP)[v] is&#xD;
      a 12-item self-report tool, exploring spiritual well-being, in terms of sense of meaning,&#xD;
      faith and inner peace. Items are scored on a five-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4&#xD;
      (very much), with higher scores indicating a greater spiritual wellbeing.The Posttraumatic&#xD;
      Growth Inventory (PTGI) is a 21-item self-report measure of positive psychological changes&#xD;
      after traumatic events. It consists of four subscales: New Possibilities, Appreciation of&#xD;
      Life, Relating to Others and Spiritual Change. Items are scored on a three-point Likert scale&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (not at all) to 2 (very much) with higher scores indicating greater&#xD;
      post-traumatic growth.The Quality of Life at the End of Life-Cancer Scale (QUAL-EC) is a&#xD;
      self- report measure of quality of life in patients near the end of life. It originally&#xD;
      consists of four subscales: Symptom Control, Relationship with Health Care Providers,&#xD;
      Preparation for End of Life and Life Completion. For this study purposes, the symptom control&#xD;
      subscale is not included, thus only items 4-17 are used. Items are scored on a five-point&#xD;
      Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely), with higher scores indicating&#xD;
      higher quality of life.The Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS), is a 15-item self-report&#xD;
      measure assessing specific concerns of advanced cancer patients about end of life, feeling a&#xD;
      burden to others and wasted opportunities. It is scored on a six-point Likert scale from 0&#xD;
      (no distress) to 5 (very much distress), with higher scores indicating higher death anxiety&#xD;
      and distress.The Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory Modified Short Form Version&#xD;
      (ECR-M16), is used in its 16-item self-report form to measure the attachment style. The scale&#xD;
      yields scores on two dimensions of attachment: avoidance and anxiety. Items are scored on a&#xD;
      seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 7 (agree), with a total sum score on&#xD;
      each subscale ranging from 16 to 56. Higher scores on both subscales indicate higher&#xD;
      attachment insecurity.The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) [x]assesses the disease&#xD;
      symptom severity. The scale, in its shortened version (MSAS- short form), measures the&#xD;
      presence and severity of 28 common physical symptoms of cancer. Items are scored on a&#xD;
      five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Couple Communication Scale (CCS) is used for participants who have a partner. The 10-item&#xD;
      CCS taken from the PREPARE/ENRICH Inventory is concerned with an individual's feelings,&#xD;
      beliefs, and attitudes about the communication in his/her romantic relationship. Each item is&#xD;
      scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and control participants will complete the Clinical Evaluation Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CEQ) at 3 and 6-months. The CEQ is a seven-item self-report questionnaire which assesses the&#xD;
      amount of clinical benefit patients have experienced by from therapy at the time of the&#xD;
      assessment. Items are rated from 0 to 4, with 0 (no clinical benefit) and 4 (a great clinical&#xD;
      benefit).Satisfaction of patients will also be qualitatively assessed by inviting them to&#xD;
      share comments in a written form after completing CEQ questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:At baseline (T0), participants provide demographics and medical and treatment data&#xD;
      using a standardized questionnaire and will complete all outcome measures, with the exception&#xD;
      of the CEQ. The PHQ-9 and DADDS are first administered to assess eligibility prior to study&#xD;
      entry, followed by the remaining baseline outcomes. Follow-up assessments on all outcomes are&#xD;
      collected at three months (T1) and six months (T2). The CEQ is administered only at three&#xD;
      months (T1) and six months (T2) as it is an evaluation of the intervention received to date.&#xD;
      At T2, participants will also be queried about their having remained blind (or not) to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:To calculate the required sample size, we used a validated, manualized&#xD;
      online power and sample size calculator that is ideal for longitudinal multilevel designs,&#xD;
      GLIMMPSE [ ]. A total sample size estimate for our primary hypothesis, that the treatment&#xD;
      group (CALM) will demonstrate a greater higher improvement ind depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) at&#xD;
      follow-up periods, as compared to the control group (SPI), was derived with a target power of&#xD;
      80% and alpha of .05 and with estimated mean scores, with variability, and cross-time&#xD;
      correlations entered. For the primary hypothesis, the calculated total sample size is 124&#xD;
      patients (62 patients per treatment arm). To account for anticipated attrition while&#xD;
      maintaining the targeted power, we used the following equation to calculated an adjusted&#xD;
      sample size: N = N0 * (1 + DRP), where N0 = original estimated sample size required at&#xD;
      baseline; DRP = anticipated dropout rate across participants. For an anticipated completion&#xD;
      rate of 70% rate (30% dropout rate), the adjusted sample size for this attrition rate is N =&#xD;
      124 * (1 + .30) = 161.2. The adjusted sample size at baseline will therefore be 162, with 81&#xD;
      patients per treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be carried out by using SPSS Statistics program. For the final&#xD;
      analyses we will use an intention-to-treat approach (ITT) and compare patients in the&#xD;
      assigned treatment arms. To test the pPrimary hypothesis : we hypothesize that mean&#xD;
      depression scores in the intervention arm will be lower than in the control arm at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months, . We will use multilevel modeling (MLM) with maximum likelihood estimation to conduct&#xD;
      the intent-to-treat analysis in testing hypotheses. MLM includes all participants, including&#xD;
      those with missing data, in model estimation and also accounts for both inter-center and&#xD;
      intra-center variability.To test for treatment-arm differences, we will compare the CALM and&#xD;
      SPI groups on the primary outcome of PHQ-9 scores and on the secondary outcomes at the&#xD;
      follow-up periods. This will entail the following set of MLM analyses:i)We will first test&#xD;
      the level-1 predictor of Time, coded for the primary hypothesis as a categorical variable&#xD;
      representing baseline and the 6-month follow-up period (primary endpoint). To code time for&#xD;
      tests of secondary hypotheses, the categorical time variable will include baseline and the&#xD;
      3-month (secondary endpoint) and 6-month follow-up periods. ii)Next, we will add the level-2&#xD;
      treatment-group main effect and the cross-level treatment group x time interactions to test&#xD;
      the hypothesized treatment-group differences at follow-up periods. Pairwise comparisons will&#xD;
      evaluate the treatment-group difference at each follow-up period.iii)We will finally test&#xD;
      whether the fixed effects in step ii change when any identified covariates are added to&#xD;
      control for their effects. As a sensitivity analysis, we will use multiple imputation to&#xD;
      examine the influence of missing values. Lastly, prior trial results suggest that there may&#xD;
      be arm differences in the processing of death-related distress such that individuals with&#xD;
      moderate death anxiety tend to be more responsive to the intervention than either those with&#xD;
      low death anxiety (approximately the lower third of the distribution) or those with high&#xD;
      death anxiety (the upper third). We will conduct a sub-analysis to confirm this effect, by&#xD;
      examining the effect of removing individuals with low and high death anxiety scores at&#xD;
      baseline (i.e., DADDS &lt; 15), following the Canadian protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also qualitatively analyze the participants' comments about CALM and SPI on the CEQ.&#xD;
      NVivo Plus software package will be used for the qualitative analysis of data.&#xD;
