      The First-In-Man study is a multi-centre, randomised, controlled, study to generate data for&#xD;
      the evaluation of safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device in 24 evaluable&#xD;
      patients with Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) versus standard of care (SOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The First-In-Man study will evaluate the safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis&#xD;
      Device in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) patients and will compare the outcome with&#xD;
      patients treated under standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that DIALIVE will significantly improve the prognosis of ACLF patients by&#xD;
      modulating systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target patient population are men and women ≥18 years, ≤81yr. Patients with ACLF grade 1&#xD;
      and ACLF grade 2 on the background of alcoholic cirrhosis. During the study, inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were expanded to include also AKI-1 and ACLF 3a patients. Treatment will be&#xD;
      undertaken in an intensive care (ICU) or renal dialysis unit setting if the patients are&#xD;
      randomised to the DIALIVE treatment arm. For patients randomised to the 'Standard of care'&#xD;
      arm, the location of treatment (ICU or general ward) will be determined by their clinical&#xD;
      need and will be decided by the site Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and&#xD;
      innovation programme under grant agreement No 733057.&#xD;
