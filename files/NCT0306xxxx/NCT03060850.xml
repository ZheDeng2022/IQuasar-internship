      This is an open label, dose escalation, phase I study to determine the PR2D by assessing the&#xD;
      DLT, safety and efficacy of AC0010 in patients with B-cell lymphoma. This study includes two&#xD;
      parts. During Part 1 Dose Escalation, the &quot;3+3&quot; design will be applied. Dose escalation will&#xD;
      begin at dose level 1 = 400 mg. This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory&#xD;
      expansion phase in 3 or 4 groups of 15~41 patients each (CLL group, MCL group, non-germinal&#xD;
      center B cell-like DLBCL group, and/or FL/WM(macroglobulinemia) group). The study will&#xD;
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AC0010 in these patients in each group&#xD;
