    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 when&#xD;
      given together with decitabine and venetoclax in treating patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia that does not respond to treatment (refractory), has come back (relapsed), or is&#xD;
      newly diagnosed and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 and&#xD;
      decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or&#xD;
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving STAT inhibitor OPB-111077, decitabine, and venetoclax&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to decitabine&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 (OPB-111077) in&#xD;
      combination with decitabine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe any preliminary efficacy of OPB-111077 in combination with decitabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and perform metabolomics in patients&#xD;
      with AML who are receiving OPB-111077 and decitabine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess apoptosis and proliferation assays in patients with AML who are receiving&#xD;
      OPB-111077, decitabine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION CYCLE 1: Patients receive STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on&#xD;
      days 1-28, and venetoclax PO QD on days 4-28 of cycle 1. Patients also receive decitabine&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on days 4-8 of cycle 1. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) after 1 cycle move on to Maintenance, and patients who do not achieve&#xD;
      a CR move on to Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION CYCLE 2: Patients receive STAT inhibitor OPB-111077, venetoclax, and decitabine as&#xD;
      in Induction Cycle 1. Patients who achieve CR, complete remission with incomplete hematologic&#xD;
      recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), or stable disease (or clinically significant&#xD;
      hematologic improvement as determined by the investigator) move on to Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive STAT inhibitor OPB-111077, venetoclax, and decitabine as in&#xD;
      Induction Cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
