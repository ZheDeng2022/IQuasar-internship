  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.&#xD;
      Higher response rates were observed in a subset of patients with female gender, Asian&#xD;
      ethnicity, no smoking history, mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase, high EGFR gene copy number&#xD;
      and adenocarcinoma histology. However, the therapeutic effect of Erlotinib is not confined to&#xD;
      patients whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations and other predictors of efficacy of this agent.&#xD;
      And these tests require time and sufficiently large specimens for processing, whereas many&#xD;
      patients with advanced NSCLC are diagnosed based on cytology alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to evaluate FLT-PET or FDG-PET usefulness in the early assessment of&#xD;
      treatment response and in predicting patient outcome after erlotinib monotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer prospectively. Changes in tumor FLT or FDG uptake 7 days&#xD;
      after the initiation of treatment will be compared between responders and nonresponders based&#xD;
      on subsequent CT scans.&#xD;

      1. Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To see whether the % change in SUVmax of a tumor with FLT-PET or FDG-PET at 7 days after&#xD;
           initiating erlotinib treatment compared with baseline SUVmax (ΔSUVmax) would predict the&#xD;
           tumor's responsiveness. And the responsiveness will be decided with the CT scan after 6&#xD;
           weeks of erlotinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare ΔSUVmax and the degree of tumor shrinkage in longest diameter during erlotinib&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see ΔSUVmax in the tumors with stable disease. To see the time to progression and overall&#xD;
      survival according to ΔSUVmax. To compare the result of FDG-PET and FLT-PET.&#xD;
