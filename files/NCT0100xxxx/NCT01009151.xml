  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot project is aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability and impact of&#xD;
      a web-based home tele-monitoring system among congestive heart failure patients at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan Health System. The intervention consists of daily reporting via the&#xD;
      internet on health parameters, such as weight, blood pressure, heart rate and heart failure&#xD;
      symptoms. In addition to symptom and data reporting, the system provides links to educational&#xD;
      material on heart failure and reminders for self-care measures. It is designed as an&#xD;
      inexpensive, user-friendly, and clinically effective system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be provided with a unique name and password, and will be instructed on how&#xD;
      to use the self-management website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed home monitoring system study holds the potential to improve the lives of heart&#xD;
      failure patients treated at the University of Michigan Health System by empowering them to&#xD;
      participate actively in their care and to reduce the risk of hospitalization. As heart&#xD;
      failure represents the most common hospital diagnosis related group (DRG)among the elderly,&#xD;
      this study offers a significant public health benefit.&#xD;

      The study will be based on a sample of 25 heart failure patients enrolled with the UMHS Heart&#xD;
      Failure Program who give informed consent to participate in the study. The clinical protocols&#xD;
      and electronic software were developed by the UMHS-CVC Heart Failure Program in collaboration&#xD;
      with the UMHS Telemedicine Resource Center. These protocols contain automated trigger&#xD;
      mechanisms when certain values are exceeded to alert the provider and the patient for the&#xD;
      need to take appropriate remedial action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UMHS Heart Failure Disease Management Program contains a registry of more than 3000&#xD;
      patients with heart failure problems. Currently, a multidisciplinary nursing team maintains&#xD;
      routine contacts with these patients through telephone calls and paper records. The program&#xD;
      has been acknowledged for its adherence to quality of care measures, and was the first to be&#xD;
      awarded accreditation by JCAHO for ambulatory heart failure care. Despite its relative&#xD;
      success, patients continue to be at high risk for re-hospitalization due to worsened heart&#xD;
      function. The proposed tele-monitoring system is expected to reduce the need for&#xD;
      re-hospitalization and to improve health outcomes by virtue of automated daily reporting and&#xD;
      greater patient involvement in self-management. Because of its high promise, this area of&#xD;
      research has been receiving increased attention, but so far without definitive results.&#xD;
      Previous research has provided evidence of reduced emergency room visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations, improved patient compliance with care and overall cost containment among&#xD;
      high-risk patient populations. But the studies relied on relatively expensive systems&#xD;
      involving specialized hardware and proprietary software. The cost of these interventions&#xD;
      presents a limitation to the broad adoption and use of the technology. The proposed project&#xD;
      is an attempt to ascertain the optimal method from a clinical and cost standpoint for in-home&#xD;
      telemonitoring for this large patient population that is likely to grow with the aging of the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-points of this pilot are: (1) patient willingness to use the system,&#xD;
      perceptions regarding its efficacy and effectiveness and problems encountered in its use; (2)&#xD;
      patient adherence to heart failure-specific self care practices; (3) patient health literacy&#xD;
      and quality of life; and (4) provider perceptions of the efficacy and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      system and problems encountered in its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings should be helpful in refining the clinical protocols and data management&#xD;
      algorithms and establishing a solid foundation for large-scale randomized clinical trials for&#xD;
      obtaining the necessary evidence for wide-scale adoption of these systems in the United&#xD;
      States and elsewhere.&#xD;
