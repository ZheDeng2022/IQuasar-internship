  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine whether application of a non-invasive battery powered device&#xD;
      called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve recovery of hand weakness&#xD;
      after stroke beyond what is achievable with rehabilitative treatment alone.&#xD;

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is a quantitative index of upper extremity motor ability determined through the use of timed and functional tasks. The score represents the average speed the subject could perform of the timed motor tasks.&#xD;
The score is the average of the scores calculated from &quot;how many times would a person have completed the task, had he or she been performing it continuously for 60 seconds&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to no theoretical maximum, with higher numbers meaning faster/ better performance. (See publication Dr. Hodics et al. 2012.)</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Mental Status Scale is a test of cognitive function; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills, scored 0-30, the higher scores mean the better performance.</description>

    <measure>NIHSS</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The NIHSS was originally designed as a research tool to measure baseline data on patients in acute stroke clinical trials. The score ranges 0-42, a score of 0 represents no deficit, lower score is better.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>21-item, self-rated scale that evaluates key symptoms of depression. The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 63. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living. Ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are scored. The total score ranges 0-100, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.</description>

    <measure>Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle scale grades muscle strength on a scale of 0 to 5 in relation to the maximum expected for that muscle. The patient's effort is graded on a scale of 0 (no movement) -5 (muscle contracts normally against full resistance).</description>

        <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is a quantitative index of upper extremity motor ability determined through the use of timed and functional tasks. The score represents the average speed the subject could perform of the timed motor tasks.&#xD;
The score is the average of the scores calculated from &quot;how many times would a person have completed the task, had he or she been performing it continuously for 60 seconds&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to no theoretical maximum, with higher numbers meaning faster/ better performance. (See publication Dr. Hodics et al. 2012.)</description>
