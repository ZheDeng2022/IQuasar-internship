  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients do not respond to conventional&#xD;
      treatments (medications or behavior therapy). For some of them, a neurosurgical treatment can&#xD;
      be indicated. Among various surgical techniques, Gamma Knife radiosurgery has the advantage&#xD;
      of not requiring the production of burr hole openings in the skull. However, there are no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials of radiosurgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim is to investigate whether radiosurgery for the treatment of severe and&#xD;
      refractory OCD is efficacious and safe, by a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Forty-eight refractory OCD patients will be randomized into two different groups: the first&#xD;
      one will receive standard radiosurgery; the second group will be submitted to a false&#xD;
      radiosurgery (&quot;sham operation&quot;). Patients who had been previously submitted to sham surgery&#xD;
      will be able to undergo real operations after one year of follow-up, when blinding is broken.&#xD;
      For a minimum period of one year, patients will be periodically followed-up in terms of&#xD;
      psychiatric changes (including OCD symptoms), global functioning, cognitive/personality&#xD;
      changes and neuroimaging findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various studies have demonstrated that good treatment responses in Obsessive Compulsive&#xD;
      Disorder (OCD) are often obtained in 60 to 80 % of patients, whether employing serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors or behavior therapy. However, a subgroup of OCD patients are refractory&#xD;
      to the classical therapeutic options, even after maximum dosage regimens and sufficiently&#xD;
      long treatment follow-ups are devised. Severe psychosocial and occupational impairments are&#xD;
      meanwhile observable. These subjects are often referred to stereotactic neurosurgeries. Among&#xD;
      the various surgical techniques, a radiosurgical modality (double-shot ventral&#xD;
      capsular/ventral striatal - VC/VS gamma capsulotomy, or simply double-shot gamma ventral&#xD;
      capsulotomy) has been recently developed. On the other hand, there are no randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials of Gamma Knife radiosurgeries in Psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether double-shot VC/VS gamma capsulotomy is&#xD;
      efficacious and to describe its adverse events/complications profiles, in a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of this radiosurgical technique for the treatment of refractory&#xD;
      OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight refractory OCD patients will be randomized into two different groups: the first&#xD;
      one will receive standard radiosurgery; the second group will be submitted to a false&#xD;
      radiosurgical intervention (&quot;sham operation&quot;). All subjects will be previously assessed by a&#xD;
      preliminary clinical/psychiatric interview, as well as by extensive specific instruments&#xD;
      regarding psychiatric diagnosis, OCD evolution and severity, anxiety/depression symptoms,&#xD;
      tics expression, psychosocial impairment, personality changes, etc. A neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests battery will also be employed. All patients will be offered a periodical follow-up,&#xD;
      during which assessment scales and neuroimaging exams (magnetic resonance imaging) will be&#xD;
      repeated. Patients who had been previously submitted to placebo surgery will be able to&#xD;
      undergo real operations after the one-year follow-up period, when blinding is broken. Scores&#xD;
      results will be analyzed among the groups, as well as adverse events profiles,&#xD;
      cognitive/personality changes, clinical global functioning and neuroimaging findings.&#xD;
      Improvements in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
      (CGI) scores will be taken as the primary treatment response criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD as the main diagnostic entity. If comorbid axis I or II&#xD;

          -  Previous participation in a cognitive behavior therapy program (exposure and response&#xD;
             prevention), for a minimum of 20 hours' time; or participation for some time, without&#xD;
             subsequent adherence, due to severe OCD symptoms, and acceptance of the independent&#xD;
             review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  YBOCS scores reductions after adequate drug therapy and psychotherapy not better than&#xD;

             symptoms, or cumulative signs of alcohol or drug abuse in the Central Nervous System&#xD;
             (such cortical atrophy), confirmed by a neuroimaging scan.&#xD;
