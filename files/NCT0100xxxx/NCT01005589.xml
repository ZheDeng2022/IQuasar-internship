      Bacterial infections are a major cause of death in newborn infants. And are linked to&#xD;
      complications including: sepsis (an over exaggerated immune response to infection) and&#xD;
      necrotising enterocolitis (a potentially fatal inflammatory bowel disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detecting infections at an early stage is difficult in newborns as the signs and symptoms can&#xD;
      be non-specific, the most commonly used lab test is to culture a sample of blood, urine or&#xD;
      spinal fluid to try and grow and identify any bacteria that is present; however these tests&#xD;
      take 24-48 hours to give results, and this means that neonates who present with signs of&#xD;
      infection are prescribed broad spectrum antibiotics whilst results are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of a test that can detect infection at an early stage and give rapid results is one&#xD;
      of the major problems in the diagnosis and management of infection in newborns. This study&#xD;
      will investigate neutrophils, which are white blood cells that are important in fighting&#xD;
      infection. When neutrophils detect and infection they become activated, and produce a protein&#xD;
      called CD64 (a cell marker) on their surface, and it is this protein that we want to measure.&#xD;
      Neutrophils produce the CD64 protein within 1 hour of first detecting an infection, so we&#xD;
      could hopefully detect and treat infections much quicker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis this study will test are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide a highly sensitive and specific marker&#xD;
           of infection in neonates AND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does neutrophil membrane CD64 measurement provide a highly sensitive and specific marker&#xD;
           of NEC in neonates&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New born infants (neonates) and particularly premature infants are more at risk of developing&#xD;
      bacterial infections due to a number of different factors including immature immune systems,&#xD;
      and because they are more likely to need invasive procedures such as chest drains that&#xD;
      increase the potential for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signs of infection in babies can be non-specific and difficult to diagnose. Undetected&#xD;
      infections which are not treated can quickly lead to sepsis, which is an over-exaggerated&#xD;
      response by the immune system which can spread throughout the whole body and attack 'self'&#xD;
      tissue leading to organ failure and death. It is therefore vital that infection in neonates&#xD;
      can be diagnosed quickly in order to administer the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current 'gold standard' laboratory test for detecting infection is to culture samples of&#xD;
      blood, urine or spinal fluid, which allows any bacteria present to be grown in the lab and&#xD;
      identified. However this test can take 24-48 hours to give results, and due to the&#xD;
      devastating consequences of not treating an infection in neonates it is now common practice&#xD;
      to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to any neonate who presents with signs of infection&#xD;
      and await test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at what happens to the white blood cells that make up part of the immune&#xD;
      defence against infection when they encounter an infection. One type of white blood cell that&#xD;
      is particularly important in fighting bacterial infections is called the neutrophil, and when&#xD;
      it detects an infection, it becomes activated in order to fight it; during this activation&#xD;
      process it expresses a protein marker called CD64 on its surface. The CD64 protein is&#xD;
      expressed within hours of the onset of bacterial infections, so measuring the CD64 marker&#xD;
      could provide much faster results than laboratory tests that are currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we could detect infections in neonates more rapidly then non-infected neonates (with&#xD;
      negative CD64 result) could have antibiotic treatment stopped. This is beneficial as it&#xD;
      reduces unnecessary treatment therefore reducing hospital stays and cost. It also reduces the&#xD;
      use of antibiotics, the overuse of which can promote the development of antibiotic resistant&#xD;
      strains of bacteria, which can colonize entire wards. It would also mean that infected&#xD;
      neonates could receive more appropriate care, for example more specific antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is another common condition that affects newborn infants.&#xD;
      Exactly how and why some infants develop NEC is still unclear, but is thought to be due to a&#xD;
      number of different factors including bacterial infection. Advanced NEC is characterised by&#xD;
      bowel necrosis, bowel perforation, sepsis and death and remains one of the major causes of&#xD;
      morbidity and death in neonates, with a mortality rate of 30-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of NEC is currently based on X-ray findings and features such as air in the&#xD;
      abdomen are very diagnostic. Other biochemical and haematological parameters are also used to&#xD;
      support X-ray findings. Because we know that one of the 'triggers' for the initiation of the&#xD;
      disease is a bacterial infection: culturing samples of blood, urine or spinal fluid is&#xD;
      important to try and identify/isolate any infection. However these tests all take time, and&#xD;
      current practice means that any neonate who presents with signs of NEC/infection will be&#xD;
      subjected to gut rest i.e. nil by mouth (in order to prevent any further damage to the gut)&#xD;
      and also be prescribed broad spectrum antibiotics. Patients who have suspected NEC will often&#xD;
      be continued on a treatment/monitoring regime, the length of which will be dictated by&#xD;
      clinical judgment: and this may be unnecessary if there is no sign of infection/inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the greatest challenges in the management/diagnosis of NEC is the lack of an early,&#xD;
      reliable and consistent marker of 'intestinal inflammation' in peripheral blood. This study&#xD;
      will investigate if the CD64 marker can fill this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory process seen in NEC is probably initiated by the presence of bacteria. The&#xD;
      bacteria activate cells of the innate immune system which produce a number of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators causing inflammation. The CD64 marker is not a 'direct' marker of inflammation,&#xD;
      however the cells that are activated in order to produce inflammation i.e. neutrophils will&#xD;
      be positive for CD64 once activated, therefore if CD64 is not present on the cells: they have&#xD;
      not been activated, which means there is no infection and therefore no inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the CD64 marker can rule out infection in neonates with suspected NEC, then it also rules&#xD;
      out any ongoing inflammatory process. Clinicians could use the CD64 assay in conjunction with&#xD;
      X-ray findings in order to stop treatment in non affected neonates and restart feeding&#xD;
      sooner, which has many benefits to the neonate's growth and nutritional development, and also&#xD;
      negates the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment and hospital stays. It also means that&#xD;
      affected neonates could receive more appropriate treatment and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking serial (repeated) measurements from patients with suspected or confirmed NEC at&#xD;
      various intervals (24 48 hours etc.) and seeing how this compares with the clinical picture,&#xD;
      could possibly be used to monitor the disease progression/severity e.g. could a rapid rise in&#xD;
      the expression of CD64 indicate progression to the advanced stage and need for surgery, and&#xD;
      could a reduced expression of CD64 indicate remission or response to treatment.&#xD;
