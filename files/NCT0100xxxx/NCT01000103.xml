  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visuospatial neglect is a common neurological symptom which appears following strokes on&#xD;
      regions of the right hemisphere of the brain. It affects patient's self representation and&#xD;
      awareness of the space, impairing functional rehabilitation and adaptation back to a normal&#xD;
      life. The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the impact of 10 daily sessions of a&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique, low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS), applied on the intact hemisphere of the brain to treat post stroke&#xD;
      visuospatial neglect at the chronic stage. The hypothesis is that a regime of real but not&#xD;
      sham rTMS on the left posterior parietal cortex of the brain will long-lastingly ameliorate&#xD;
      visuospatial neglect in stroke patients as revealed by clinical paper-and-pencil and&#xD;
      computer-based tests assessing search, detection and discrimination of stimuli presented in&#xD;
      different areas of the visual field.&#xD;

      Scientific aims and goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal aim of this application is to provide evidence of the role of a&#xD;
      non-invasive neuromodulation technique such as rTMS in the treatment of chronic neurological&#xD;
      sequels generated after strokes in human patients. Such interventions are based in an &quot;at&#xD;
      will&quot; modulation the level of activity in intact regions, resulting in an enhancement of&#xD;
      excitatory projections or the suppression of inhibitory influences driven through spared&#xD;
      connectivity. They result in activity increases of the stroke surviving neurons, allowing the&#xD;
      re-emergence of function after brain damage. Such principles can be applied to different&#xD;
      sorts of neurological sequels for which the underlying connectivity and its post-stroke&#xD;
      status is well known. In this specific project, we propose the use of low frequency rTMS on&#xD;
      the intact left posterior parietal cortex (in the intraparietal sulcus, IPS) to improve the&#xD;
      symptoms of visuospatial neglect derived form right stroke injuries including the posterior&#xD;
      parietal cortex. Such project is based in the interhemispheric rivalry hypothesis, according&#xD;
      to which, spatial neglect is in part caused by the over inhibition exerted from the intact&#xD;
      left parietal cortex onto the injured left homologue regions, which are mediated by&#xD;
      well-known overall inhibitory transcallosal projections between the left and the right&#xD;
      hemispheres. According to this hypothesis and preliminary data, the reduction of the left&#xD;
      parietal disinhibition should result into a lesser degree of suppression exerted by the&#xD;
      intact left hemisphere sites onto the right injured parietal areas, process which will along&#xD;
      the emergence of activity.In this context, we defined a primary aim accompanied by two&#xD;
      secondary aims, which will be tackled in parallel:Primary AIMS AIM1: To assess the effects of&#xD;
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of chronic visuospatial&#xD;
      neglect generated by stroke Secondary AIMS AIM 2: To assess the durability of such a recovery&#xD;
      over time once the treatment is completed and discontinued AIM 3: To further assess the&#xD;
      safety of such therapeutic approach based in the deactivation of an intact -but hyperexcited&#xD;
      region- holding connectivity with the damaged area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria Main criteria -Changes in the Spatial Bias Compound Score (SBCS) between&#xD;
      pre (baseline) and post 10 days of rTMS treatment Such score is calculated on the basis of&#xD;
      the result of 4 subtests which include: (1) bells cancellation task, (2) a copy of the&#xD;
      GAINOTTI figure, (3) identification of overlapping figures, and (4) line bisection, according&#xD;
      to the following formula (SBCS=λ=ln(XR/XL), considering the identification or copying of&#xD;
      elements presented on the right or the left visual fields of the patient. The subtests of the&#xD;
      SBCS will be also individually assessed and followed.&#xD;

      Secondary criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Predictive factors assessmentStudy population and duration of studyWe will study a&#xD;
           population of stroke patients with chronic signs of hemispatial neglect with at least 3&#xD;
           months of evolution (n=148, 2 groups of 74 patients) recruited across 48 months at an&#xD;
           approximate rate of 37 patients /year.&#xD;
