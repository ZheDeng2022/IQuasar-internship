      Omalizumab is an anti-IgE recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody.The efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of omalizumab have been demonstrated in patients with moderate-to-severe and&#xD;
      allergic (IgE-mediated) asthma. Clinical benefit with omalizumab is observed when serum free&#xD;
      IgE levels are reduced to 50 ng/mL or less. However, although the causal role of IgE in&#xD;
      allergic disease is well established, the relationship between free IgE and clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of asthma has not been accurately quantified. Recent study demonstrated that omalizumab and&#xD;
      free IgE concentrations are correlated with clinical outcomes. In non responder to omalizumab&#xD;
      the clinical symptoms show random fluctuations around baseline without any tendency toward&#xD;
      improvement despite adequate suppression of free IgE. In these patients it may be the ratio&#xD;
      of specific IgE to total IgE or inter-patient variability in the expression of FceRI on&#xD;
      effector cells that define whether the patient will respond or not to omalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is designed to evaluate the mechanisms of responsiveness to omalizumab&#xD;
      measuring the free IgE, specific IgE and the level of FceRI expression on the effector cell&#xD;
      and the correlation to clinical response.&#xD;

      Omalizumab represents a new therapeutic approach for IgE-mediated disease. Omalizumab is an&#xD;
      anti-IgE recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody designed to treat IgE-mediated disease by&#xD;
      reducing the concentration of free IgE antibody in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses&#xD;
      of Omalizumab have now been studied in more than 2000 patients. Omalizumab compared to&#xD;
      placebo has been demonstrated to reduce the number of asthma exacerbations, reduce the&#xD;
      concomitant medication burden, improve the symptom severity and improve quality of life in&#xD;
      phase III studies in the treatment of patients with allergic asthma, perennial allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis and seasonal allergic rhinitis. For further information the reader is referred to&#xD;
      the investigator brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic (IgE-mediated) asthma is characterized by the presence of IgE antibodies against&#xD;
      common allergens. When allergen cross-links specific IgE bound to high-affinity IgE (FceRI)&#xD;
      receptors on the surface of basophils and mast cells, proinflammatory mediators are released&#xD;
      that trigger and perpetuate airway symptomatology. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE mAb, binds to the&#xD;
      Fc region of all forms of circulating IgE, regardless of IgE specificity, preventing&#xD;
      IgE-mediated responses, and downregulating FceRI expression on mast cells and basophils. The&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of omalizumab have been demonstrated in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe (IgE-mediated) asthma. Clinical benefit with omalizumab is observed when&#xD;
      serum free IgE levels are reduced to 50 ng/mL or less. Omalizumab dosing is based on&#xD;
      pretreatment total serum IgE level and body weight, and calculated using a dosing table.&#xD;
      Omalizumab binds to IgE to reversibly form IgG-IgE complexes. In binding, omalizumab pushes&#xD;
      the reaction toward the IgG-IgE complex, which is incapable of binding to IgE receptors,&#xD;
      thereby suppressing free IgE and reducing the clinical symptoms of allergic asthma. However,&#xD;
      although the causal role of IgE in allergic disease is well established, the relationship&#xD;
      between free IgE and clinical symptoms of asthma has not been accurately quantified. Recent&#xD;
      study demonstrated that omalizumab and free IgE concentrations are correlated with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In non responder to omalizumab the clinical symptoms show random fluctuations&#xD;
      around baseline without any tendency toward improvement despite adequate suppression of free&#xD;
      IgE. In these patients it may be the ratio of specific IgE to total IgE or inter-patient&#xD;
      variability in the expression of FceRI on effector cells that define whether the patient will&#xD;
      respond or not to omalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is designed to evaluate the mechanisms of responsiveness to omalizumab&#xD;
      measuring the free IgE, specific IgE and the level of FceRI expression on the effector cell&#xD;
      and the correlation to clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further characterize the patients' phenotype we will also evaluate fraction of Nitric&#xD;
      Oxide in expired air (FE-NO) levels and eosinophils percentage in induced sputum before and&#xD;
      at the end of the study.&#xD;
