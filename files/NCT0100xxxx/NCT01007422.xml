  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Opioids lessen pain caused by cancer. Titration of opioids in the hospice setting&#xD;
      is suboptimal due to numerous barriers. Order sets may help to provide timely and effective&#xD;
      medical and pharmaceutical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to good pain control in the&#xD;
      hospice setting and to develop an order set that would safely address these barriers.&#xD;

      Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess barriers to pain control in the hospice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a mixed methods approach, key stakeholders including physicians, nurses, patients and&#xD;
      caregivers were queried about pain control in the hospice setting, barriers to pain control&#xD;
      and the desirability of an order set to address this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and conduct pilot testing of an order set designed to improve pain control in the&#xD;
      hospice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An opioid titration order sheet based on our previous R0-1 was modified based on the&#xD;
      information derived from the interviews and questionnaires completed by the physicians,&#xD;
      nurses, patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 20 patients were enrolled on the first phase of the pilot study in order to test&#xD;
      the modified pain assessment form and the feasibility administration of the study materials&#xD;
      to be completed by the patient and caregiver. Forms are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient assessment: At baseline, patients provide demographic data and complete the Pain&#xD;
           Assessment Form and the Pain Communication Survey. The pain assessment form addresses&#xD;
           average pain, worst pain, pain relief, hours in pain, pain-related distress, and&#xD;
           barriers to pain control. Patients are asked to rate pain control. Patients also&#xD;
           complete the Pain Communication Survey to assess how they communicate with healthcare&#xD;
           providers about their pain. After the baseline assessment is completed, patients&#xD;
           complete the Pain Assessment form on a daily basis. Pain is also assessed by the&#xD;
           research nurse at least 3 times weekly (1 home visit* and 2 telephone interviews).&#xD;
           Patients are followed until the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *If a patient is hospitalized or transferred to the inpatient hospice facility, the&#xD;
      patient interview will take place there.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver assessment: At baseline, caregivers complete a demographic survey, a Pain&#xD;
           Assessment Form, the Pain Communication Survey, Caregiver Self-Efficacy in Pain&#xD;
           Management Scale (CSEPMS), Caregiver Pain Management Questionnaire (CPMQ), and the&#xD;
           Stressful Caregiver Adult Reactions to Experiences of Dying (SCARED). Caregivers are&#xD;
           then interviewed by the study nurse using the Pain Assessment Form as a guideline to&#xD;
           obtain more detailed information about adequacy of the patient's pain control, side&#xD;
           effects of medication, barriers to pain control, and caregiver concerns and burden.&#xD;
           Follow-up data from caregivers is obtained through completion of CSEPMS, CPMQ, and&#xD;
           SCARED questionnaires and their assessment of patient's pain form at the end of weeks 1,&#xD;
           2, and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chart review: A research nurse conducts a chart review after patient's death. Cancer and&#xD;
           cancer-related treatment data is obtained and documentation about pain management is&#xD;
           recorded. From the time of study entry, all staff notes are reviewed to document pain&#xD;
           assessment, calls to physician or other support personnel (including pharmacy calls),&#xD;
           identified barriers to pain control, and treatment modifications (including medications&#xD;
           to treat side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 20 patients, it was deemed not feasible to complete the study forms and to recruit&#xD;
      adequately for the trial. The study was suspended.&#xD;
