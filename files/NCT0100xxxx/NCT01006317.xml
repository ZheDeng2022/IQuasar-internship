  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to strengthen and improve the performance of health care system in rural&#xD;
      China in order to improve maternal and child health. It also provides policy-makers and&#xD;
      health service managers with evidence for the development of informed policy on maternal and&#xD;
      child health (MCH). The research focuses on women of reproductive age in rural areas of China&#xD;
      as well as on their antenatal and obstetric care service providers, both clinicians and&#xD;
      policy makers. For the Member States and China, as well as other countries it will provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive analysis and synthesis of current state of affairs, provider and user&#xD;
      perspectives, of antenatal and obstetric care in rural China at national and local level.&#xD;
      This study seeks to assess whether improving financial accessibility to and quality of&#xD;
      maternal health care increase use of and impact of maternity services. This project is&#xD;
      implemented in 3 provinces: Anhui, Shaan'xi and Chongqing. This project will provide a&#xD;
      practical example and information on impact of abolishing user fees on MCH service&#xD;
      utilisation and develop and disseminate evidence-based policy recommendations on how to&#xD;
      improve access to and quality of antenatal and obstetrical care for local and central&#xD;
      government and international organisations, and thus serve as a step toward reaching such&#xD;
      important goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHIMACA includes 3 types of interventions, two behavioural interventions and financial&#xD;
      intervention. Behavioural interventions are training for clinical skills and training health&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

      Province of Chongqing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic design: randomized townships (3 groups) comparing 2 different interventions to one&#xD;
      randomised internal control group and one non-randomized external control group. In&#xD;
      service-training:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. in service-training of clinical skills: Yes. In non-randomized setting, comparing&#xD;
           in-service training to the external control group without training, and in randomized&#xD;
           setting comparing in-service training to the internal control group without in-service&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in service-training of health education: Yes. In non-randomized setting, comparing&#xD;
           in-service training to the external control group without training, and in randomized&#xD;
           setting comparing in-service training to the internal control group without in-service&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control groups: one randomized internal control group and one external&#xD;
                non-randomised control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  20 townships in Rongchang County are divided into 2 intervention groups and one&#xD;
                internal control group (7 clusters)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6 townships in Tongliang County are randomly selected for an external control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Province of Shaan'xi:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic design: Randomized townships, 5 groups (in two counties) comparing 2 different&#xD;
      interventions to the randomized control group (Figure 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Financial intervention: Yes. In randomized setting, comparing coverage of ante- and&#xD;
           postnatal care to in service-training of clinical skills, in non-randomized setting&#xD;
           comparing coverage of ante- and postnatal care to normal local coverage system (control&#xD;
           group of matched pairs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In service-training:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Clinical skills: Yes. In randomized setting, comparing in service-training of&#xD;
                clinical skills to coverage of ante- and postnatal care, in non-randomized setting&#xD;
                comparing in service-training of clinical skills to normal local coverage system&#xD;
                (control group of matched pairs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Health education: Yes. In randomized setting, comparing in service training of&#xD;
                health education to normal local system, control group (in one county) and to group&#xD;
                of clinical skills and control group (in one county).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: randomized townships. - 25 townships in Zhen'an County are divided into 2&#xD;
           groups (12 clusters): one intervention and one control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  29 townships in Lantian County are divided into three groups (10 clusters): two&#xD;
           intervention groups and one control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Province of Anhui Basic design: randomized townships, 3 groups (in two counties), comparing 4&#xD;
      different interventions to randomized control groups (Figure 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Financial intervention: Yes, in a randomized setting, comparing coverage of antenatal&#xD;
           and postnatal care to the control and in-service training groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In service-training of clinical skills: Yes, in a randomized setting, comparing the&#xD;
           in-service training group to the control group and to the group of antenatal and&#xD;
           postnatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In service-training of health education: Yes, in a randomized setting, comparing two&#xD;
           different types of health education to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control groups: randomized townships&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 townships in Fanchang county are divided into 2 intervention groups (Group 1 and&#xD;
           Group 2) and one control group (Group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 townships in Xuancheng county are divided into two intervention groups (Group 4 and&#xD;
           Group 5) and one control group (Group 6).&#xD;
