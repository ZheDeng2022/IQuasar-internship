      Biopsies of the outer thigh muscle and serum samples will be collected from untreated healthy&#xD;
      subjects. These biological samples will be provided to the Diabetes Research Unit&#xD;
      Translational Biomarker Laboratory for use in developing and validating human muscle malonyl&#xD;
      CoA and serum malonate biomarker assays.&#xD;

      This non-drug method study was terminated on November 19, 2009. The decision to terminate was&#xD;
      based on safety concerns (biopsy-related pain) observed in the first set of subjects. Four&#xD;
      subjects were give a sample and did not tolerate it well. No data was collected to report.&#xD;

    <description>Collection of muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be performed by a consulting specialist. The first muscle biopsy (Day 1, 2 hour) will be obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of the non-dominant leg. The second biopsy (Day 1, 4 hour) will be obtained from the same vastus lateralis muscle on the same leg approximately 10 centimeters from the first muscle biopsy site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed&#xD;
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate&#xD;
             measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Female subjects will be of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic,&#xD;
             allergic, (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal&#xD;
             allergies at time of dosing), muscle disease, diabetes, or severe uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant bleeding diathesis which could preclude recovery from the biopsy&#xD;
             procedure. ASA, ibuprofen, and any other oral anti platelet agent should be&#xD;
             discontinued at least 7 days prior to procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/INR and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) above&#xD;
             the respective local laboratory normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal CK as per CRU laboratory ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with either a medical history of or physical evidence of keloid scar&#xD;
             formation upon physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating a clinically significant abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing potential, pregnant or nursing females or females less than 6&#xD;
             months postpartum from the scheduled date of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine or any component of the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in non-routine rigorous exercise (eg, road races, heavy lifting, etc.)&#xD;
             within one week prior to the muscle biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Professional athletes.&#xD;
