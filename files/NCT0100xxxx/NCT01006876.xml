      This study aims to explore the risk of periprocedural thromboembolic events in continuous&#xD;
      versus interrupted Coumadin therapy in a large, randomized high-risk patient population&#xD;
      undergoing radio-frequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice,&#xD;
      affecting 2.3 million people in the United States (1). A major cause of stroke, AF&#xD;
      substantially increases the risk of thromboembolism which necessitates oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapy (OAT) for high-risk patients. Radiofrequency percutaneous catheter ablation (RFCA) is&#xD;
      an effective strategy for the treatment of symptomatic drug-refractory atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
      However, periprocedural cerebrovascular accident (CVA) due to thrombus or air embolism&#xD;
      remains one of the most serious complications of AF ablation. In spite of precautions taken&#xD;
      before, during, and after the ablation to minimize the risk of CVA, the reported event rate&#xD;
      remains 0.5-2.8% (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of thromboembolic events is dependent on the extensiveness of the ablation&#xD;
      procedure as well as the periprocedural anticoagulation strategy (2). Some studies have&#xD;
      described charring and soft thrombus formation when the temperature exceeds 100 degree C&#xD;
      during RFCA, which probably is caused by blood protein denaturation and coagulation (3).&#xD;
      Currently an open saline irrigation-tip ablation catheter (3.5 mm Thermocool catheter) is&#xD;
      used which reduces the thermal injury by keeping the temperature under control (4), while&#xD;
      enabling the operator to use high wattage RF energy to effectively ablate the arrhythmogenic&#xD;
      focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two most utilized periprocedural OAT strategies are; 1) discontinuation of Coumadin three&#xD;
      to five days prior to ablation, utilization of heparin or enoxaparin before the procedures,&#xD;
      and &quot;bridging&quot; low molecular weight heparin with Coumadin after ablation, and 2) RFCA with&#xD;
      continuation of Coumadin before, during and after the procedure (2) without any change in&#xD;
      dosage. Limited data are available regarding the risk of thromboembolism with and without&#xD;
      periprocedural Coumadin in AF patients undergoing catheter ablation .The aim of this&#xD;
      prospective randomized study is to evaluate the effect of the above two OAT strategies on the&#xD;
      incidence of TE within 48 hours post-RFCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection, Treatment and Follow-up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized as study group would continue Coumadin without any periprocedural change&#xD;
      while undergoing catheter ablation. Those randomized as control group would discontinue&#xD;
      Coumadin 3-4 days prior to ablation and replace it with heparin till the end of the procedure&#xD;
      and bridge LMWH with Coumadin 48-72 hours after ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An INR of 2-3 would be ascertained in all patients prior to procedure. Patients with&#xD;
      subtherapeutic INR would not be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Coumadin therapy would be started at least two months prior to the ablation in&#xD;
      order to achieve the therapeutic INR at least three weeks prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation strategy I (Coumadin interrupted): Twice daily until the evening prior to&#xD;
      ablation procedure, 0.5-1 mg/kg of enoxaparin would be administered and bridged to Coumadin.&#xD;
      At the time of the procedure, enoxaparin would be replaced by heparin. At the end of the&#xD;
      procedure, the sheaths would be removed during full anticoagulation. After the procedure&#xD;
      heparin would be discontinued, and protamine 10 to 15 mg would be given. Sheaths would be&#xD;
      pulled when activated clotting time (ACT) would be &lt;250 seconds. Aspirin 325 mg would be&#xD;
      given before the patient leaves the electrophysiology laboratory. Warfarin would be&#xD;
      administered the evening of pulmonary vein isolation. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg BID and 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      BID would be routinely started and would be stopped when the INR is &gt; 2. Patients with LSPAF,&#xD;
      left ventricular dysfunction or history of thrombo-embolism would receive overlapping&#xD;
      anticoagulation with enoxaparin for three days after the procedure. The remaining patients&#xD;
      would receive a double dose of Coumadin on the night of the ablation followed by the routine&#xD;
      pre-procedure dose from the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation strategy II (continuous Coumadin): Coumadin would not be discontinued in this&#xD;
      group of patients. The INR would be monitored every week for four weeks preceding the&#xD;
      ablation and it should be above 2.0. All patients in AF on the day of the procedure where an&#xD;
      INR above 2 is not demonstrable for four consecutive weeks preceding the procedure would&#xD;
      undergo TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVAI would be done while on Coumadin treatment. No heparin or enoxaparin would be&#xD;
      administered to any patient prior to the procedure. Before transseptal punctures, a heparin&#xD;
      bolus (100 to 150 U/Kg) would be administered to all patients. During the procedure, the&#xD;
      infusion rate would be adjusted to keep the activated clotting time in the range of 350 to&#xD;
      450 sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedures, heparin infusion would be stopped and anticoagulation would be reversed&#xD;
      with 10 to 15 mg of Protamine, and sheaths would be pulled when the activated clotting time&#xD;
      is less than 250 sec. Patients would receive 325 mg of Aspirin before leaving the EP lab.&#xD;
      They would continue their Coumadin dosage regimens with no changes before or after the&#xD;
      procedure aiming to an INR of 2 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, patients are considered to be in the treatment period 2 months&#xD;
      before the procedure to 48-72 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation Procedure: Standard radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure based on physician's&#xD;
      discretion would be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline and post-procedure MRI within 24-hours of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period is 48 hours post-procedure; during which all patients would have neurologic&#xD;
      evaluation; at the end of the procedure and every four hours for the next 48 hours. Clinical&#xD;
      neurologic evaluation would include assessment of mental status such as ability to pay&#xD;
      attention, memory, judgment and orientation to self, place and time; maneuvers to test the&#xD;
      cranial nerves, assessment of motor functions by testing strength in different muscle groups&#xD;
      and assessment of sensory functions by evaluating touch, pain, vibration and positional&#xD;
      awareness as well as the deep tendon reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with questionable neurologic impairment would undergo neuroimaging evaluations like&#xD;
      head CT or MRI.&#xD;
