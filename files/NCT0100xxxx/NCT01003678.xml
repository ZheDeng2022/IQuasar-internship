  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial for patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study agent, clofarabine, is produced by Genzyme Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific purpose of the study is to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended Phase II dose of clofarabine in patients with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will start at a dose of 1 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will treat a group of 3 patients with clofarabine at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are no severe side effects seen at that dose level, then the next group of 3&#xD;
           patients will receive a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of groups of 3 patients will continue at higher dose levels until severe&#xD;
           side-effects are noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If more than 1 of the 3 patients experiences a severe side effect, dosing will be&#xD;
           stopped at that level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If only one of the three patients experience a severe side effect, then three more&#xD;
           patients will be treated, at that dose level and if they too experience severe side&#xD;
           effects, then dose escalation will be stopped and the maximum tolerated dose will be&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 more patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be up to 5 dose levels tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We plan to test how much of the drugs are in the patient's blood at different times, and&#xD;
           the levels of certain proteins in their blood.&#xD;
