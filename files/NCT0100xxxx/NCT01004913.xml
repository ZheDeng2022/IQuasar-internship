    <textblock>
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of vertigo of&#xD;
      peripheral vestibular origin with life time incidence of 2.4%. BPPV is characterized by bouts&#xD;
      of acute whirling vertigo lasting less than one minute provoked by changes in head position&#xD;
      in relation to the gravitational vector. The vertigo is accompanied by typical rotational or&#xD;
      horizontal nystagmus that is often demonstrated by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and less&#xD;
      frequently by testing for positional nystagmus. BPPV pathogenesis is currently explained by&#xD;
      the fall of otoconia (calcium-carbonate crystals) or otoconial debris from the tectorial&#xD;
      membrane of the otolithic organs into the dependant semicircular canals (canalithiasis) or&#xD;
      adherence of such particles to the semicircular canal's cupula (cupulithiasis). Under these&#xD;
      circumstances, the semicircular canal which normally responds only to angular velocity and&#xD;
      acceleration is stimulated by gravity. Otoconial remnants as free floating particles inside&#xD;
      the semicircular canal arms or attached to the cupula have been observed by few&#xD;
      investigators. Although the presence of such particles explains most characteristics of the&#xD;
      positioning nystagmus described in BPPV, it does not account for the dizziness and&#xD;
      disequilibrium which are described by many patients even without changes in head position and&#xD;
      the continuation of such symptoms after successful treatment of BPPV as evidenced by the&#xD;
      resolution of positional vertigo and nystagmus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that otolithic pathology is an important component in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of BPPV explaining these symptoms, BPPV recurrence, and the refractoriness of&#xD;
      some BPPV cases to the vastly employed particles repositioning treatments. In the present&#xD;
      study the Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) testing would be employed to measure&#xD;
      the function of one of the otolithic organs - the saccule. The study objectives are: 1. To&#xD;
      investigate possible malfunction of the saccule in patients suffering from BPPV. 2. To look&#xD;
      for association between saccular pathology and BPPV recurrence and between such pathology and&#xD;
      BPPV treatment failure. 3. To study possible relation between saccular pathology and&#xD;
      continuation of dizziness and disequilibrium despite the resolution of positional vertigo.&#xD;
