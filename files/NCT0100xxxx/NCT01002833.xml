  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum isolates display a wide genetic diversity with possibly different&#xD;
      properties to induce immune responses. These properties could directly influence the ability&#xD;
      to induce protective efficacy. Since 1998 an experimental human malaria infection model at&#xD;
      the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center (RUNMC) has been very successful in answering&#xD;
      questions with regards to immunological mechanisms of human Pf infection. To date only the&#xD;
      NF54 strain of Pf has been deployed in this Nijmegen model. However, investigation of&#xD;
      heterologous Pf challenge is not only highly informative for our basic understanding of&#xD;
      induction of immune responses but also provides an essential model for protective capacity&#xD;
      testing in the clinical development of candidate malaria vaccines. Recently, the parasite&#xD;
      culture laboratory of the RUNMC has been able to overcome technical hurdles to produce&#xD;
      infectious mosquitoes of two genetically different isolates from different geographical&#xD;
      regions to increase the portfolio for Phase IIa trials. These isolates, PfA and PfB will be&#xD;
      compared with the NF54 strain for parasitic, immunological and clinical features in humans.&#xD;
