    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) study is to assess&#xD;
      the mid- and long-term outcomes of bariatric surgeries and to analyze the relationship&#xD;
      between these outcomes and 1) patient demographics and comorbidities, 2) clinical and&#xD;
      surgical characteristics, and 3) pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative care and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Participants in the BOLD study include all patients who 1) have their bariatric surgery&#xD;
      performed by either a Participant in the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
      designated Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence or by a Fellow of the American Society for&#xD;
      Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery 2) have been provided with a copy of the BOLD Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet. Patients under 18 years of age are included if a copy of the Patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet is provided to an authorized legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Information Sheet containing information pertaining to the BOLD study is provided&#xD;
      to the patient at the first pre-operative visit. The patient is not required to sign a&#xD;
      consent form to participate in the study but must let the bariatric surgeon staff know if&#xD;
      he/she does not wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected for every bariatric surgery patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal information: gender, race, employment status, insurance status, medical record&#xD;
           number, year of birth, height, weight and prior surgeries. The surgeon has the option of&#xD;
           entering patient name for internal tracking purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about surgery: date of admission, date of surgery and date of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about medical condition before, during and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information is entered into BOLD through a secure website and permanently stored in a&#xD;
      database that is managed by Surgical Review Corporation (SRC). This database is secure and&#xD;
      meets the requirements for the protection of patient confidentiality as required by the&#xD;
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that is used for research does not include the patient name or medical record number.&#xD;
      Information about the patient's surgery will be combined with data from all other study&#xD;
      participants in a separate research database and SRC research staff will analyze this&#xD;
      combined information. The results of the study will be reported or published for the total&#xD;
      population - no individual patient information will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons participating in the study will attempt to obtain follow-up data on all patients who&#xD;
      had surgery once a year for a minimum of at least five years following the date of surgery.&#xD;
      Follow-up data can be obtained by the operating surgeon or designee, or by the patient's&#xD;
      primary care physician and reported to the surgeon.&#xD;
