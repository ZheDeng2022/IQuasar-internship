      The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a home programme (diagnosis and&#xD;
      follow-up) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) syndrome treated with CPAP and to&#xD;
      analyze the cost of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description: We conducted a prospective comparative study. Patients referred for&#xD;
      suspected OSAS were evaluated. In the first visit patients completed four questionnaires:&#xD;
      Epworth sleepiness scale, Impact Functional Illness Questionnaire (FOSQ), activity&#xD;
      questionnaire and symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomised to three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (domiciliary group): home based diagnosis by home respiratory polygraphy (RP)&#xD;
           and home review conducted by a specialist nurse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (Hospital group): hospital based diagnosis by polysomnography (PSG) and clinical&#xD;
           review conducted by a Pulmonologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (mixed group): home based diagnosis by home respiratory polygraphy (RP) and&#xD;
           clinical review conducted by a Pulmonologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the diagnostic test (PSG or RP), patients were visited by the Pulmonologist, who&#xD;
      identified the need for CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated after 1,3 and 6 months of CPAP treatment. In all follow-up visits&#xD;
      compliance was evaluated by objective methods and questionnaires described above were filled&#xD;
      in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In domiciliary group, phone calls or hospital appointments were made if low compliance was&#xD;
      detected or if some problem with treatment was detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional PSG was performed in hospital supervised by a trained nurse. PSG used for&#xD;
           the study was Somnostar alfa®. Parameters obtained were: electroencephalogram (C3-A2,&#xD;
           C4-A1), electrooculogram electromyogram, electrocardiogram (V2 modified), respiratory&#xD;
           effort by thoracic and abdominal resistance bands, air flow with nasal cannula pressure&#xD;
           connected to a transducer, oxygen saturation with a pulseoximeter, and snoring with a&#xD;
           selective microphone. PSG was manually interpreted in 30 seconds epochs, according to&#xD;
           Rechschaffen and Kales criteria.The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was defined as the number&#xD;
           of apneas-hypopneas divided by the number of hours of sleep. OSA diagnosis was done if&#xD;
           AHI was &gt;10 /h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory polygraphy was performed in a non-attended way in patient's home. The nurse&#xD;
           who monitorized the patient in the home setting, instructed the patient on the proper&#xD;
           use of the RP. A validated respiratory polygraphy system corresponding to ASDA level III&#xD;
           (Stardust®) was used. The parameters monitorized were: nasal flow, chest movement,&#xD;
           oxyhemoglobin saturation, pulse and body position. The same cardio-respiratory variables&#xD;
           that we identified in PSG, were registered. An event rate (number of apneas + number of&#xD;
           hypopnea divided by the number of hours recorded)&gt; 15 was considered as a diagnosis. The&#xD;
           study were recorded by computer system and manually interpreted by a physician. In case&#xD;
           of invalid registration we performed a second PR. If in doubt after the second study a&#xD;
           PSG was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits and assessment of compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital monitoring group: Effective compliance was calculated by mean of the CPAP hour&#xD;
           meter, dividing the total number of hours timer by the number of days of use. We&#xD;
           discounted 10% of the time, which is the average time of ineffective pressure. Patients&#xD;
           were considered adherent if they use CPAP at least 4 hours during 70% of the week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits by nurses: This group of patients was treated at home through a system&#xD;
           of fixed pressure CPAP (REMstar Pro, Respironics ®), with a memory card which can store&#xD;
           information about the number of hours of effective pressure. It also allows to know the&#xD;
           number of days of CPAP use. In all visits the nurse collect the memory card for later&#xD;
           analysis, which was performed by a physician.The nurse responsible for the program&#xD;
           evaluated the need of reinforcing in order to get an optimal compliance. If it was&#xD;
           considered necessary, the patient was evaluated by the Pulmonologist either by mean of a&#xD;
           phone call or of an hospital appointment. All patients in this group were contacted by&#xD;
           phone at least once during the first month of CPAP treatment&#xD;
