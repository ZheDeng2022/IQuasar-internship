  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the effects of the non-ergot dopamine&#xD;
      agonist piribedil on vigilance and cognitive performances in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease in comparison with other oral non-ergot dopamine agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be tested whether piribedil is superior to continued pramipexole or ropinirole&#xD;
      treatment regarding improvement of reduced vigilance and cognitive performance in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of motor symptoms associated with PD by non-ergot dopamine agonists has been proven&#xD;
      to be effective, both as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa. Non-motor symptoms&#xD;
      like cognitive or sleep-related disorders and disturbed vigilance, however, are common in PD&#xD;
      and can significantly worsen health and quality of life of the patient and family members.&#xD;
      Some of these non-motor symptoms may also be caused by the antiparkinsonian medication per&#xD;
      se. The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) initiated a review of dopamine&#xD;
      agonists in relation to episodes of sudden onset of sleep already in 2000 which resulted in&#xD;
      special warnings of somnolence and sudden sleep attacks in the non-ergot dopamine agonists'&#xD;
      summary of product characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beneficial effects of piribedil on parameters of vigilance and cognition have been described&#xD;
      in several studies. But, as it seems, no study has been performed so far to identify such&#xD;
      effects in the setting of a comparative study with different oral non-ergot dopamine agonists&#xD;
      in patients with PD, and utilizing vigilance and cognitive parameters as primary and main&#xD;
      secondary objective. The neuropsychological tests being applied in this study are validated&#xD;
      and routinely used tests in studies investigating different aspects of attention or vigilance&#xD;
      and cognition.&#xD;
