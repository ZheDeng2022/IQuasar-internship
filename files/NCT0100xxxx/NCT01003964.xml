    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized phase II study is to compare the Response Rate of&#xD;
      each sequence of treatment approach in patients with advanced NSCLC. Additionally,&#xD;
      development of gene expression profiles and genotypes that can predict response to commonly&#xD;
      used chemotherapy may provide a unique opportunity to better utilize drugs shown to be&#xD;
      effective in first- or second-line therapy. Here, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic study to provide rational approach to the treatment of NSCLC by developing&#xD;
      predictors of cisplatin (first-line agent) and pemetrexed or docetaxel (second-line agents)&#xD;
      sensitivity and demonstrating the clinical value of identifying the most appropriate drug on&#xD;
      the basis of sensitivity profile for the treatment regimen of each individual patient. Such&#xD;
      an approach is likely to maximize response to chemotherapy and may change the current&#xD;
      empirical paradigm of NSCLC therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is currently considered to be the standard treatment in advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, overall response is only 30-40%, suggesting that&#xD;
      a majority of the patients do not respond to platinum. Subsequently, those patients who&#xD;
      experience treatment failure with platinum-based therapy typically received pemetrexed or&#xD;
      docetaxel as second-line treatment, with response rate of approximately 7% to 10%. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this randomized phase II study is to compare the Response Rate of each&#xD;
      sequence of treatment approach in patients with advanced NSCLC. Additionally, development of&#xD;
      gene expression profiles and genotypes that can predict response to commonly used&#xD;
      chemotherapy may provide a unique opportunity to better utilize drugs shown to be effective&#xD;
      in first- or second-line therapy. Here, we will conduct a pharmacogenomic study to provide&#xD;
      rational approach to the treatment of NSCLC by developing predictors of cisplatin (first-line&#xD;
      agent) and pemetrexed or docetaxel (second-line agents) sensitivity and demonstrating the&#xD;
      clinical value of identifying the most appropriate drug on the basis of sensitivity profile&#xD;
      for the treatment regimen of each individual patient. Such an approach is likely to maximize&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy and may change the current empirical paradigm of NSCLC therapy.&#xD;
