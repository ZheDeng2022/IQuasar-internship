  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic disorder characterized by erythematous scaly patches which affect the&#xD;
      scalp, trunk, extensor surfaces of the limbs and the genital area. The common form of&#xD;
      psoriasis is referred to as psoriasis vulgaris. There are several variants of psoriasis such&#xD;
      as guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, pustular psoriasis and erythrodermic psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is highly prevalent in the general population, mainly as a result of its chronicity&#xD;
      and the absence of a cure. The estimates of psoriasis prevalence are within the range of 0.5%&#xD;
      to 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of psoriasis is made on a clinical base, usually by physical examination,&#xD;
      performed by a dermatologist. Although skin biopsy may be useful in some cases, there is no&#xD;
      laboratory test which may serve as a reference standard to the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis in its mild cases per se is not associated with excess mortality, however, the&#xD;
      disease may affect quality of life of affected patients to a substantial degree. Psoriasis&#xD;
      may be readily apparent to others because of scales and redness of the skin. The skin may&#xD;
      itch and scales may shed from the patients to the environment or directly on other people.&#xD;
      Feelings of stigmatization and major changes in life-style caused by psoriasis have been&#xD;
      documented in numerous studies. The burden of the disease may be exaggerated due to expensive&#xD;
      therapy and complicated therapeutic regimes Patients with mild to moderate psoriasis are&#xD;
      usually treated with topical treatments. Photo-therapy or systemic treatments are reserved to&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical corticosteroids may lead to rapid improvement in psoriasis, however rapid relapse&#xD;
      following discontinuation is the common practice leading to chronic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcipotriene ointment may also be used and requires 8 to 12 weeks of use for maximal effect&#xD;
      and often causes local irritation, particularly when used on the face. The use is limited to&#xD;
      100 gr/week due to hypercalcemia that might follow systemic absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin A derivative tazarotene may be also be used for plaque psoriasis. Although it can&#xD;
      produce longer remissions than topical steroids, local irritation, cost, and teratogenicity&#xD;
      limit its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coal tar products may be used as steroid-sparing agents, especially useful for enhancing the&#xD;
      efficacy of natural sunlight and phototherapy. Application can be cumbersome because of&#xD;
      irritation, unpleasant smell, brown color that can stain clothing, and propensity to cause&#xD;
      folliculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the above treatments are particularly problematic for the face and genital psoriasis&#xD;
      due to the potential side effects and mainly possible severe irritation reducing patients&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psirelax is a novel topical medication directed for the treatment of patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
      The formulation of Psirelax includes the following substances: 5%-15% quince seeds jelly,&#xD;
      10%-40% natural base cream (e.g. Ferntree Cottage Pure Base Cream), 55%-75% mixture of&#xD;
      natural anti-oxidants (e.g. Vitamin E, wheat germ oil, Safflower oil), natural skin softening&#xD;
      agents (e.g. sweet almond oil, sesame oil), natural absorption aids (e.g. jojoba oil,&#xD;
      vegetable squalene), natural tissue regenerating and protecting agents (e.g. grape seed oil,&#xD;
      sunflower oil), natural preservatives (e.g. paraben, tea trea essential oil, thyme essential&#xD;
      oil, grapefruit seed extract, Vitamin E) and natural thickening agents (e.g. bee wax,&#xD;
      aloevera, medicinal Vaseline, coconut oil, guar gum, palm oil, borax)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary observation, a patient with severe psoriasis applied Psirelax three times&#xD;
      each day during four days. The patient reported complete disappearance of the psoriatic&#xD;
      plaques and pruritus was reduced by 70%. It was suggested to conduct an open study to assess&#xD;
      the effect of Psirelax in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Psirelax in the treatment of&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
