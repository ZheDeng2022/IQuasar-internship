  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blueberry powder on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in obese, non-diabetic, and insulin resistant subjects. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that supplementation with blueberry powder will result in an increase in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in obese subjects with insulin resistance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a key pathophysiologic feature of the &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; and is&#xD;
      strongly associated with co-existing cardiovascular risk factors and accelerated&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Due to the clinical consequences associated with insulin resistance in&#xD;
      subjects with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, clinical regimens directed at&#xD;
      increasing insulin sensitivity in vivo remain one of the most desirable goals of treatment.&#xD;
      Although it is well established that lifestyle modification can improve insulin resistance&#xD;
      and effectively improve many of the risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, the&#xD;
      success of maintaining lifestyle changes in humans over a chronic period is poor. Therefore,&#xD;
      strategies to improve insulin resistance by pharmacological means have represented the&#xD;
      traditional approach for clinical medicine. However, because of the widespread use of dietary&#xD;
      supplements by the general public, nutritional supplementation with the use of botanical&#xD;
      extracts that effectively increase insulin sensitivity represent a very attractive and novel&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, considerable controversy exists regarding the effect of botanical supplements&#xD;
      on the metabolic syndrome in large part because efficacy data for many of the supplements&#xD;
      used for this purpose consists of only uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports. As such,&#xD;
      there is a paucity of data in humans in regard to the effect of botanicals to improve&#xD;
      measures of insulin action in vivo or on cellular aspects of insulin action. However, several&#xD;
      lines of evidence in both in vitro and in vivo models suggest that botanicals may modulate&#xD;
      intracellular pathways of glucose metabolism. Specifically, preclinical data with use of&#xD;
      extracts from grapes and blueberries suggest that components of these botanical mixtures,&#xD;
      e.g. anthocyanins and resveratrol, may play a role in enhancing cellular pathways of insulin&#xD;
      action. On a clinical level, if cellular pathways of insulin action are enhanced, e.g. PI-3&#xD;
      kinase activity, this should be associated with an increase in whole body glucose disposal as&#xD;
      reflected in measures assessing insulin sensitivity. However, there is limited experience in&#xD;
      human studies for which insulin sensitivity has been assessed with use of &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      techniques assessing in vivo insulin action. Therefore, this project's overall objective is&#xD;
      to examine the role of a specific botanical (i.e., blueberry powder) on insulin action in&#xD;
      vivo with use of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. This pilot trial is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      a fixed consumption of blueberry powder and to provide data of the effect so that a larger,&#xD;
      more comprehensive study can be planned. To accomplish our goal, we will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical study with blueberry powder designed to assess&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in subjects who are obese and insulin resistant. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      blueberry powder will be effective, when compared to placebo, to increase insulin action in&#xD;
      vivo. If so, this pilot trial will provide the necessary background to progress to studies in&#xD;
      subjects with Type 2 diabetes. An increase in insulin sensitivity in patients with Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes will be expected to markedly reduce glucose levels.&#xD;
