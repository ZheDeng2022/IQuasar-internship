      Rationale: The effect of vertical dimension on sleep apnoea and respiratory variables in&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To what extend should a possible worsening of the OSA condition, caused by an&#xD;
      increase of mouth opening be taken into consideration in daily dental practice, when an&#xD;
      occlusal stabilization splint (OSS) is placed in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Cross over RCT-design Study population: OSA patients referred to ACTA from the&#xD;
      Slotervaart Hospital, for treatment with a Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD), at least 18&#xD;
      years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Occlusal stabilization splint (OSS) for the upper jaw and a controlled&#xD;
      condition in a cross-over design Main study parameters/endpoints: Apnoea- Hypopnoea Index&#xD;
      (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of vertical dimension of OS on sleep and&#xD;
      respiratory variables in OSA patients. The hypothesis is that insertion of an OSS and an&#xD;
      increase of the vertical dimension will result in a significant increase in the AHI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mild or Moderate OSA patients (AHI 10-30) referred by Slotervaart Hospital, to ACTA, for&#xD;
      treatment with an MAD. Both males and females will participate in the study. All participants&#xD;
      will be over 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients invited should be at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OSA patients, diagnosis based on a baseline polysomnographic recording (at the hospital)&#xD;
           with AHI values until 30 (mild+ moderate OSAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate retention in the dentition for an occlusal stabilization splint (OSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine usage that influence sleep (eg Benzodiazepines).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI more than 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unhealthy dentition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe bruxers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMD patients An occlusal stabilization splint (OSS) will be constructed for each&#xD;
           patient, as an intervention device. The splint will be a hard acrylic-resin&#xD;
           stabilization appliance to wear in the upper jaw. The OSS does not come in contact with&#xD;
           the gums of the patient and does not act as an orthodontic device. The OSS will be used&#xD;
           only for the three nights in a row, of the ambulatory-PSG recording with the OSS in&#xD;
           situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent will be obtained, the patients will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of the two groups. To ensure that the groups would be of approx. the same size, block&#xD;
      randomization will be used. Block sizes will be used and sizes will vary randomly. The&#xD;
      allocation sequence will automatically be generated and subsequently concealed by an&#xD;
      independent co-worker, who will keep a paper copy in a lockable drawer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be referred to ACTA, by the Center for sleep wake disorders at Slotervaart&#xD;
      Hospital. There they will have done a PSG-sleep study. The PSG recording will take place in a&#xD;
      dark hospital room, in the Slotervaart Hospital in Amsterdam, at the department of Clinical&#xD;
      Neurophysiology (The multidisciplinary Centre for Sleep-Wake Disorders). OSA patients with&#xD;
      diagnosis mild and moderate OSA will be invited to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the PSG recording and the diagnosis at Slotervaart Hospital, each patient will come&#xD;
      for a first appointment, at the department of Oral Function, section of Oral Kinesiology, at&#xD;
      ACTA. Medical and dental history will be obtained. If the patients fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and agree to participate in the study, impressions of the upper and lower jaw, Body&#xD;
      Mass Index (BMI), neck circumference, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical history will be obtained by using questionnaires, the dental history by using&#xD;
      questionnaires, clinical dental examination, and OPG x-ray (orthopantomogram). The BMI will&#xD;
      be obtained by measuring the height and the weight of the patient. (BMI = kg/ cm Â²). The neck&#xD;
      circumference will be measured in cm. Impressions with alginate and a wax-index with dental&#xD;
      wax will be taken for every patient, in order to make the dental casts for the construction&#xD;
      of the splints. The whole procedure will last approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly divided in two groups. The patients will be randomly placed in&#xD;
      the two groups. The patients will undergo the PSG-recordings without the OSS in situ and the&#xD;
      nights with the OSS in situ, in a cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: The patients will undergo 3 nights of home-PSG recording without the OSS in situ&#xD;
      first. 2 weeks later they will undergo 3 nights of PSG-recording with the OSS in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: The patients in Group 2 will first undergo 3 nights of ambulatory PSG-recording with&#xD;
      the OSS in situ. 2 weeks later they will undergo 3 nights of home-PSG recording without the&#xD;
      OSS in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appointments will be made either for the OSS placement at ACTA or for the mounting of the&#xD;
      equipment for the ambulatory recording, at Slotervaart hospital, depending on in which group&#xD;
      the patient will be randomly placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: The mounting of the equipment for the ambulatory recording will take place at the&#xD;
      department of Clinical Neurophysiology at Slotervaart Hospital. The procedure will last&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour. The Monet hardware (Medcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with 19&#xD;
      recording channels will be used for the recordings and the Rembrandt software will be used&#xD;
      for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will sleep at home with the ambulatory PSG equipment 3 nights in a row, without&#xD;
      the OSS in situ. That means that 3 mounting appointments will be held at the department of&#xD;
      Clinical Neurophysiology at Slotervaart Hospital, 3 afternoons in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every morning after the home PSG-recording, the patients will take off the electrodes&#xD;
      themselves at home (using a solution that we will provide them with, in order to resolve the&#xD;
      glue) and they will have to bring the equipment back to ACTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the meantime (between the first and the second visit to ACTA), an OSS for the upper jaw&#xD;
      will be constructed for every patient. The OSS will be constructed at the same dental&#xD;
      laboratory for all patients. It will be made by hard acrylic resin and no palatal coverage&#xD;
      will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will come back to ACTA after 1 week (second appointment) for the placement of&#xD;
      the splint (OSS). On the second appointment at ACTA the OSS will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will wear the OSS, in order to get used to it, under the period of one week and&#xD;
      after that they will undergo 3 nights of ambulatory sleep recording with the OSS in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: The patients will come back to ACTA after 1 week (second appointment at ACTA) for&#xD;
      the placement of the splint (OSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will wear the OSS, in order to get used to it, under the period of one week and&#xD;
      after that they will undergo 3 nights of ambulatory sleep recording with the OSS in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mounting of the equipment for the ambulatory recording will take place at the department&#xD;
      of Clinical Neurophysiology at Slotervaart Hospital. The procedure will last approximately 1&#xD;
      hour. The Monet hardware (Medcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with 19 recording channels&#xD;
      will be used for the recordings and the Rembrandt software will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will sleep at home with the ambulatory PSG equipment 3 days in a row, with the&#xD;
      OSS in situ. That means that 3 mounting appointments will be held at the department of&#xD;
      Clinical Neurophysiology at Slotervaart Hospital, 3 afternoons in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every morning after the home PSG-recording, the patients will take off the electrodes&#xD;
      themselves at home (using a solution that we will provide them with, in order to resolve the&#xD;
      glue) and they will have to bring the equipment back to ACTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks later, the patients that belong in the 2nd group, will undergo 3 ambulatory&#xD;
      recordings at home, without the OSS in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have to fill in 10 questionnaires at the beginning of the study and at the&#xD;
      end of the study. The ESS and the &quot;morning- questionnaire&quot; and the evening- questionnaire&quot;&#xD;
      will be filled by all patients between nights as well. That means in the beginning, at the&#xD;
      end of the study and in the 6 days while having the home- PSG recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last home PSG recording the below mentioned data will be collected (for all&#xD;
      patients, belonging to both groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Epworth Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of the splints (OSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study parameter/ endpoint is the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) value. The secondary&#xD;
      study parameter is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects of the splint (OSS) will be evaluated.&#xD;
