  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients (with Stages 0-II breast cancer) will receive an accelerated three week regimen&#xD;
      of prone whole breast radiotherapy. The study intends to test the hypothesis that a weekly&#xD;
      boost to the tumor bed, delivered on Friday, before the weekend break, is as well tolerated&#xD;
      as the daily boost during accelerated prone radiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm 1 is a concomitant boost protocol over three weeks which has previously been evaluated in&#xD;
      over 500 patients (NYU 03-30 and NYU 05-181) and has shown excellent tolerance, and results.&#xD;
      Arm 2 evaluates a Weekend Boost Dose (WBD) regimen which may have a radiobiological advantage&#xD;
      by counteracting tumor repopulation which can occur over the weekend break. At the time of&#xD;
      registration in the study, patients will be randomized to either treatment arm and stratified&#xD;
      according to pre or post-menopausal status and on previous chemotherapy received or not.&#xD;

    <description>BCTOS is a validated questionnaire designed to measure breast esthetic and function after breast-conservations treatment. Patients rate the difference between their untreated and treated breast in 3 categories.&#xD;
There are 4 score levels: 1 = &quot;No difference&quot;; 2 = &quot;Slight&quot;; 3 = &quot;Moderate&quot;; 4 = &quot;Large difference&quot;. The total range is 3-12; the lower the score the lower the difference between the untreated and treated breast.</description>

(Answer on scale 1 to 5). 1 = &quot;All of the time&quot;; 2 = &quot;Most of the time&quot;; 3 = &quot;Some of the time&quot;; 4 = &quot;A little of the time&quot;; 5 = &quot;None of the time&quot;.</description>

1-4 = Mild Pain 5-6 = Moderate Pain 7-10 = Severe Pain&#xD;
The total range is 1-10; the higher the score, the higher the pain level.</description>
