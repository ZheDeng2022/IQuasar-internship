      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming more common among youth, particularly in&#xD;
           minority populations. Few drug treatments are approved for T2DM in adolescents, and&#xD;
           behavioral and lifestyle factors may contribute to their difficulties in following&#xD;
           strict treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is unknown whether a minimally invasive patient partner ( buddy ) program, which has&#xD;
           been developed to help improve diabetes control and quality of life, will be successful&#xD;
           in a population of pediatric patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of a minimally invasive intervention (being assigned a patient&#xD;
           partner, or buddy ) on blood sugar levels in adolescents with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes between groups in body weight, number of home glucose monitor checks,&#xD;
           compliance with medications, adherence to visit schedule, and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adolescents and young adults between 12 and 20 years of age who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and whose blood glucose control needs improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided by chance into two groups: in one group, participants will&#xD;
           have a buddy and receive standard care; while in the other group, participants will&#xD;
           receive standard care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The buddy is not a health care professional and is not authorized to provide any medical&#xD;
           advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed in the study for a total of 6 months. All study&#xD;
           participants will receive standard treatment for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be asked to fill out a screening questionnaire (on paper or online) at&#xD;
           the beginning of the study and a quality of life and eating behaviors questionnaire at&#xD;
           the beginning and at the end of the study. These forms will include questions on medical&#xD;
           history, emotions, well-being, and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in both groups will have one diabetes clinic visit at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center or at Children s National Medical Center (CNMC) at the beginning of the study and&#xD;
           two follow-up visits at the NIH or CNMC approximately 3 months apart. All visits include&#xD;
           a physical examination, detailed medical history, and laboratory testing which is part&#xD;
           of routine care for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants assigned to the buddy group will receive phone or online messages from the&#xD;
           buddy once a week and will meet with the buddy once a month for less than 1 hour. The&#xD;
           purpose of the in-person visit is to get to know each other better outside the usual&#xD;
           hospital or clinic environment. The visits should take place at home, but may also take&#xD;
           place elsewhere, for example, at schools, cafes, or libraries chosen by both the&#xD;
           participant and the buddy. These face-to-face meetings may also take place at NIH or at&#xD;
           CNMC if this is more convenient.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly prevalent among youth, particularly&#xD;
      in minority populations. Few pharmacologic agents are approved for the treatment of T2DM in&#xD;
      adolescents, and behavioral and lifestyle factors may contribute to adolescents difficulty&#xD;
      adhering to treatment regimens. A minimally-invasive buddy-intervention (to help improve&#xD;
      diabetes control and to foster improvement in quality of life) has not been systematically&#xD;
      evaluated in a population of pediatric patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of a minimally invasive intervention the buddy on hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
           (HbA1c) levels in adolescents with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess changes between groups in body weight, number of home glucose monitor checks,&#xD;
           compliance with medications, adherence to visit schedule, and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to conventional treatment versus interventional group (buddy&#xD;
      arm), and will be followed for 6 months. During this period, all patients should undergo two&#xD;
      visits including laboratory testing (HbA1c) approximately 3 months apart. Those in the buddy&#xD;
      arm will have weekly phone or online contact and once-monthly home visits from the buddy (a&#xD;
      volunteer patient partner), with the use of systematic questionnaires and a secure database&#xD;
      for data collection and maintenance.&#xD;
