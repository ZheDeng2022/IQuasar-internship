      Treatment: Immunization with a peptide-mix of 17 Clusters of Differentiation number 8 (CD8) T&#xD;
      cell minimal epitopes and 3 Clusters of Differentiation number 4 (CD4) T cell epitopes and a&#xD;
      new adjuvant (CAF01). The vaccine should induce cellular immunity against human&#xD;
      immuno-deficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target group: Untreated healthy individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection who are not in&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The primary purpose is to evaluate tolerability and safety of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to evaluate the clinical effect of the vaccination treatment as&#xD;
      measured by induction of new T cell immunity, lowering of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral&#xD;
      load in plasma, and improvement in the patient CD4 lymphocyte blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The experiment is designed as a single-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      trial in HIV-1 infected individuals in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers of individuals: 20 fully evaluable HIV-1-infected patients should enter the study (15&#xD;
      vaccine treated and 5 placebo(saline) treated controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a redirection of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to selected&#xD;
      relatively immune silent (subdominant) but conserved CTL targets on multiple sites in HIV-1&#xD;
      could provide a better immune control of the virus replication. This could result in lowering&#xD;
      of viral load thereby prolonging the time to antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HIV-1 vaccine in this trial is designed to prevent disease in healthy already HIV-1&#xD;
      infected individuals not in anti-retroviral treatment by inducing a strong cellular immune&#xD;
      response against several immune subdominant selected target points in the patient's HIV-1&#xD;
      virus. The vaccine treatment is not harmful but could potentially lower viral load and thus&#xD;
      delay the time to acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease or to the need of&#xD;
      antiviral medicine and thereby limit the spread of HIV-1 in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's cellular immune response can only partly control the HIV-1 infection and&#xD;
      eventually leads to a destruction of the immune system, opportunistic infections, and&#xD;
      ultimately death. Normally the natural HIV-1 infection does not provide adequate immunity and&#xD;
      vaccines must therefore induce a more potent and broader and more rationally directed&#xD;
      immunity. Individuals that have this kind of strong immunity have lower viral-load and live&#xD;
      longer. The vaccine in this study is designed to develop this kind of potent cellular&#xD;
      immunity against HIV-1, so the virus is controlled better by the individual and spread in the&#xD;
      population is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine is designed to match most individual's cellular immune system (HLA tissue types)&#xD;
      and several conserved target points in the individual's own HIV-1 virus. On the basis of our&#xD;
      previous vaccine trial of HIV vaccination of HIV-infected individuals in Denmark and years of&#xD;
      research, we have been able to develop this HIV-1 vaccine. Our vaccine contains 18 peptides&#xD;
      (15 major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-I) restricted CD8-t-cell epitopes and 3 MHC&#xD;
      class-II restricted CD4 T-cell epitopes) in a mix and should induce cellular immune responses&#xD;
      to several conserved target points identified in HIV-1. Our vaccine is composed of 18&#xD;
      peptides in a lipid based adjuvant Cationic Adjuvant Formulation number 1 (CAF01) composed of&#xD;
      dimethyl-deoctadecylammonium (DDA) and trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) and is deemed safe and the&#xD;
      technique is simple and also called 'peptide vaccination'. This and similar techniques have&#xD;
      been tried in several studies against virus diseases around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to know to which degree it is possible to immunize already HIVÂ¬ 1 infected&#xD;
      individuals to prolong the healthy period and prevent disease before initiation of antiviral&#xD;
      medicine or other treatments of AIDS. In the present immunization study, healthy HIV-1&#xD;
      infected individuals not in treatment in Denmark will be invited to participate. This vaccine&#xD;
      study will examine the immune responses and effects of the vaccine on these healthy&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected individuals. The first purpose is first to determine if there are any&#xD;
      side-effects of the vaccine. From several trials on animals and humans and in our own recent&#xD;
      HIV vaccination trial on HIV-1 infected individuals in Denmark, with very similar vaccine&#xD;
      techniques (peptides in autologous Dendritic Cells (DC) no serious side-effects has been&#xD;
      observed. The second purpose is to examine if the vaccine induces the expected immune&#xD;
      responses in HIV-1 infected individuals and how it enforces and supplements the already&#xD;
      existing 'own' immune response of the infected individual. Finally, a clinical beneficial&#xD;
      effect (on viral load and CD4 counts) of our vaccine will be evaluated.&#xD;
