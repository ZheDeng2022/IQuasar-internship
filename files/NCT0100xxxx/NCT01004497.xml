      The main aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of first-line&#xD;
      dasatinib plus conventional chemotherapy for newly diagnosed Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia. In this study, the investigators will analyze the clinical outcomes for entire&#xD;
      patient population as well as those for transplants, respectively. In addition, the results&#xD;
      of this study will be compared to those of the investigators current study (imatinib plus&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy). The safety of this treatment will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical trials on imatinib in combination with cytotoxic agents as a front-line&#xD;
      treatment, have demonstrated an improved complete remission (CR) rate and a better outcome in&#xD;
      adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL).&#xD;
      Previously, we also demonstrated the positive impact of first-line imatinib interim therapy&#xD;
      on the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adults with Ph-positive ALL.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients continue to die as a result of disease&#xD;
      progression. Recently, we demonstrated that a reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels of at&#xD;
      least 3 log after the completion of imatinib therapy was found to be the most powerful&#xD;
      predictor of lower relapse and better disease-free survival after allogeneic SCT. In the&#xD;
      light of disease aggressiveness and recurrence, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of&#xD;
      leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, an improved strategy to induce&#xD;
      more effective leukemic cell clearance during the pretransplantation treatment course is&#xD;
      clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib, a potent dual BCR-ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor, demonstrated 325-fold greater&#xD;
      activity against native BCR-ABL compared with imatinib and has shown efficacy against all&#xD;
      imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations with the exception of T315I. According to the START-L&#xD;
      (SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity: Research Trials of Dasatinib) trial, dasatinib&#xD;
      (70 mg twice daily) induced rapid hematologic and cytogenetic responses in a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant Ph-positive ALL (hematologic CR&#xD;
      rate, 33%; major cytogenetic response rate, 57%; cytogenetic CR rate, 54%). However, the&#xD;
      median duration of a major cytogenetic response was 6.9 months. Considering this kinetics of&#xD;
      resistance, it is felt likely that dasatinib monotherapy is not sufficient as a first-line&#xD;
      treatment for Ph-positive ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic SCT clearly benefits certain high-risk patients, such as those with Ph-positive&#xD;
      ALL or those that show a poor initial response to chemotherapy, and long-term survival rates&#xD;
      with SCT are markedly increased when patients are in CR. Recent studies suggest that among&#xD;
      adults with ALL, transplantation from a matched unrelated donor could yield results similar&#xD;
      to those achieved by matched related donor transplantation. While unrelated donor transplants&#xD;
      are generally associated with more transplant-related complications than matched sibling&#xD;
      transplants, a compensatory decrease in relapse rates due to a strong graft-versus-leukemia&#xD;
      effect has narrowed the gap between the two approaches. In addition, reduced-intensity&#xD;
      conditioning allogeneic SCT is increasingly being used for patients who are considered poor&#xD;
      candidates for myeloablative conditioning SCT because of their advanced age or other&#xD;
      concurrent medical conditions. Two recent reports of patients undergoing a transplant using&#xD;
      related or unrelated donor and a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (fludarabine plus&#xD;
      melphalan) showed an optimistic outcome in a group of patients with ALL either at high risk&#xD;
      during first CR or who were transplanted after achieving a subsequent CR. Recently, we also&#xD;
      demonstrated an evidence of positive role of reduced-intensity conditioning SCT for the&#xD;
      management of high-risk adult ALL who are ineligible for myeloablative transplantation with&#xD;
      low leukemic cell burden (especially in first CR) through a prospective analysis (phase 2&#xD;
      study). From this point of view, the role of first-line dasatinib plus conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by allogeneic SCT should be clarified in the era of targeted drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the results of the phase 3 study in patients with chronic phase-chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia suggest that dasatinib (100 mg q.d.) offers the most favorable overall benefit-risk&#xD;
      assessment. On the basis of these results, dasatinib will be administered orally at 100 mg&#xD;
      once a day in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction regimen: &quot;Modified Hyper-CVAD&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2, IV for 2 hours, every 12 hours x 6 doses, days 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/day (maximum 2 mg/day), IV for 30 minutes, days 4 &amp; 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day, IV for 1 hour, days 4 &amp; 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg/day, IV push, days 1~4 &amp; days 11-14&#xD;
&#xD;
      First consolidation regimen: &quot;Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine 2 g/m2, IV for 3 hours, every 12 hours x 10 doses, days 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2/day, IV for 30 minutes, days 1-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second consolidation regimen: &quot;Modified Hyper-CVAD&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2, IV over 2 hours, every 12 hours x 6 doses, days 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/day (maximum 2 mg/day), IV for 30 minutes, days 4 &amp; 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day, IV for 1 hour, days 4 &amp; 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg/day, IV push, days 1-4 &amp; days 11-14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of chemotherapeutic drugs (except vincristine, dexamethasone, and etoposide) will be&#xD;
      reduced by 25% in patients aged between 50 and 59 years; and by 50% in patients 60 years or&#xD;
      older. During the consolidation phase, serious toxicities (more than or equal to grade 3&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicities) will require subsequent dose reductions of 25% to 50% at the&#xD;
      attending physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central nervous system prophylaxis will be performed by intrathecally administering triple&#xD;
      agents (methotrexate 12 mg, cytarabine 40 mg, and hydrocortisone 50 mg; 6 times in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of each induction and consolidation chemotherapy with recovery of&#xD;
      leukocyte and platelet counts, dasatinib will be given as an alternative manner (100 mg once&#xD;
      daily by mouth for 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib dose adjustment will be performed according to the guidelines for managing&#xD;
      hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events during dasatinib treatment. Briefly,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose escalation will be permitted in patients with no hematologic CR (to 140 mg daily;&#xD;
           140 mg q.d. or 70 mg b.i.d.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose reduction (to 80 mg daily; 80 mg q.d. or 40 mg b.i.d.) and interruption will be&#xD;
           permitted after dasatinib-related grades 3-4 hematologic toxicity or grades 2-4&#xD;
           nonhematologic toxicity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib will be administered until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, as&#xD;
      determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an HLA-matched or suitable donor will undergo allogeneic SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without a donor will undergo continuous consolidation (up to 4 courses) and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy (dasatinib 100 mg once daily for up to 2 years as long as the patients&#xD;
      remain in hematologic CR with stable MRD level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of dasatinib plus conventional chemotherapy will be dependent on the speed of&#xD;
      coordination process (for transplants) or the patient's tolerability (for non-transplants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCT from an HLA-matched sibling or a suitably matched (less than or equal to 2-allele&#xD;
      mismatched) family or unrelated donor will be performed according to the policies of the&#xD;
      participating institutions. A preparative regimen will be started 7 days after the last day&#xD;
      of the dasatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prophylactic dasatinib maintenance therapy is planned after SCT.&#xD;
