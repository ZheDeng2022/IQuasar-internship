      The objective of the study is to investigate the drug interaction between LC15-0444 and&#xD;
      pioglitazone by comparing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LC15-0444 and&#xD;
      pioglitazone are administered concomitantly and each alone in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, open-label, three-treatment, three-period, three-sequence and&#xD;
      crossover design in healthy volunteers to evaluate tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      after the multiple administration of LC15-0444 and pioglitazone concomitantly or each alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined by demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      within 3 weeks(-21 d ~ -2 d) before drug administration(1 d). Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three sequence groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the characteristics of anti-diabetic drugs, it is expected to be administered&#xD;
      with other anti-diabetic drugs. Therefore, Drug-Drug Interaction with Pioglitazone should be&#xD;
      identified in this trial.&#xD;
