      This extension protocol is for those subjects that have completed the allowed duration of&#xD;
      participation in an Endocyte-sponsored clinical trial of EC145 (vintafolide) and have&#xD;
      continuing evidence of clinical benefit (stable disease or better) at the time that they&#xD;

      This extension protocol is for those subjects that have completed the allowed duration of&#xD;
      participation in an Endocyte-sponsored clinical trial of EC145 and have continuing evidence&#xD;
      of clinical benefit (stable disease or better) at the time that they completed participation&#xD;
      in that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility, subjects will receive intravenously-administered EC145&#xD;
      at a dose of 2.5 mg. Dosing will occur on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of weeks 1 and 3 of&#xD;
      each 4-week cycle. No therapy will be administered during weeks 2 and 4. Subjects randomized&#xD;
      to non-EC145-containing treatment arms of EC145 trials are not eligible for this study.&#xD;

             Endocyte-sponsored, IRB-approved clinical trial.&#xD;

          -  Disease (i.e., cancer) that was considered &quot;stable&quot; at the last evaluation while&#xD;
             participating in the previous EC145-containing study. &quot;Stable&quot; is defined as not&#xD;
             having progression of disease per standard criteria (RECIST, etc). Stable disease may&#xD;
             be indicated by previously attained complete or partial tumor shrinkage that has not&#xD;
             progressed per standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 10 weeks have elapsed since the last evaluation of &quot;stable disease&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have recovered (to baseline/stabilization) from prior EC145-associated acute&#xD;
             toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic, and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to practice contraceptive methods for men and women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Development of a secondary malignancy requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of receiving any investigational treatment or other systemic therapy directed&#xD;
             at controlling cancer since the subject's last dose on the parent EC145 study.&#xD;
