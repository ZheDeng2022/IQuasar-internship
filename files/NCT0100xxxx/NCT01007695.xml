      The investigators' hypothesis is that valproic acid given before surgery for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      breast cancer will increase breast tumor histone acetylation at tolerable doses and that the&#xD;
      increase in breast tumor histone acetylation will correlate with valproic acid blood levels&#xD;
      and changes in peripheral blood white blood cell histone acetylation. Published in vitro&#xD;
      studies have shown sensitivity of breast cancer cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors&#xD;
      (Fortunati et al., 2008; Fuino et al., 2003; Hodges-Gallagher et al., 2007; Olsen et al.,&#xD;
      2004). The investigators' gene array data predict sensitivity to valproic acid in over half&#xD;
      of breast cancers [Bild, unpublished]. The investigators hypothesize that in women with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed breast cancers valproic acid will have an unacceptable toxicity rate less than 15%&#xD;
      at doses that increase tumor histone acetylation and that valproic acid will decrease the&#xD;
      Ki-67 in at least half of breast tumors by over 20%. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      their genomically-derived signature for sensitivity to valproic acid (GDSS-VPA) can be used&#xD;
      to predict which tumors will have a decrease proliferation as measured by Ki-67 by at least&#xD;
      20%. The investigators hypothesize that valproic acid levels and histone acetylation levels&#xD;
      in peripheral leukocytes will correlate with a decrease in the Ki-67 proliferation index by&#xD;
      20%. The investigators hypothesize that DCE-MRI imaging studies will provide an accurate and&#xD;
      quantitative means of assessing tumor response to valproic acid. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that response to valproic acid will not be affected by intrinsic breast cancer&#xD;
      subtype.&#xD;

      Before treatment each woman needs a DCE-MRI and a biopsy of the breast mass. For women who&#xD;
      have had diagnoses of breast cancer outside our institution, the study procedures are&#xD;
      illustrated in figure 1. Following screening labs and enrollment, a DCE-MRI will be performed&#xD;
      followed by a biopsy to obtain two cores for study immunohistochemistry studies and one core&#xD;
      for the GDSS-VPA. The biopsy will be examined by the pathologist to confirm diagnosis and&#xD;
      stained for markers of histone acetylation, proliferation, and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who are coming to the HCI for a breast biopsy for a suspicious mass that is greater&#xD;
      than 1.5 cm by exam, mammogram, ultrasound, CT, or MRI, study procedures are illustrated in&#xD;
      figure 2. A DCE-MRI will be done on the same day prior to the biopsy under existing research&#xD;
      MRI consents, if possible. Biopsy material is already obtained for research purposes using a&#xD;
      tissue collection consent. One of these cores will be placed in liquid nitrogen for storage.&#xD;
      If no breast cancer is seen on other cores, then the frozen core will be used by the clinical&#xD;
      pathologist and the woman will not be eligible for the study. If the diagnosis of cancer is&#xD;
      confirmed, the woman will then be consented for this trial. If she consents, then the frozen&#xD;
      core may have one section taken to confirm the presence of tumor, and the rest will be sent&#xD;
      for GDSS-VPA. Once clinical examination of the non-frozen parts of core biopsy is completed,&#xD;
      then study immunohistochemistry will be done on the remaining tissue in the paraffin block.&#xD;
      If the DCE-MRI was not done prior to the biopsy, then it should be done as soon as possible&#xD;
      after the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the biopsy and DCE-MRI have been obtained, all women will receive therapy according to&#xD;
      the following schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valproic acid 30mg/kg/day divided BID starting AM of day 1. We will assess toxicity after 2.5&#xD;
      days. If grade 2 side effects are present, continue at the same dose, reassessing every three&#xD;
      days. When all side effects are grade 1 or less, then increase dose by 10 mg/kg/day every&#xD;
      three days to a maximum of 50mg/kg/day. If a grade 3 side effect is encountered, then hold&#xD;
      medicine until side effect resolves and restart at previous dose level for remainder of time.&#xD;
      The highest tolerated dose will be continued until the day of surgery, which will not be&#xD;
      before 7 days of valproic acid therapy or after 12 days of valproic acid therapy. If a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, then the patient will be removed from the study. See&#xD;
      appendix 18.2 for schedule based on what day of the week treatment is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 3 and 6, a valproic acid level and PWBC histone acetylation will be drawn prior to the&#xD;
      dose increase. These labs are used for secondary endpoints and as such are optional for women&#xD;
      for whom transportation here to obtain blood may be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients that experience a dose limiting toxicity is expected to be low.&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicity would be grade 4 confusion, grade 3 encephalopathy, grade 3 cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, grade 3 somnolence, grade 3 dizziness, grade 3 tremor that does not improve with&#xD;
      beta-blocker therapy, or any other grade 4 non-hematologic adverse event. A 2% rate of dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity would be considered acceptable, while a 15% rate of dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      would be considered unacceptable. The stopping rule will allow a maximum of one (1) patient&#xD;
      to experience a dose limiting toxicity per eight (8) patients accrued. Patient accrual will&#xD;
      be stopped for excessive toxicity if this level of toxicity is exceeded. More detail is&#xD;
      provided in section 11.1. With this stopping rule, the probability of stopping the trial for&#xD;
      excessive toxicity is 0.16 if the true rate of DLT is 2%, and the probability of stopping the&#xD;
      trial for excessive toxicity is 0.88 if the true rate of DLT is 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between day 7 and day 12, once the subject has been on the highest tolerated dose of valproic&#xD;
      acid treatment for at least two days, a DCE-MRI will be performed followed by surgical&#xD;
      excision of the primary tumor per standard of care. If surgery is to be delayed for&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy or other non-study related reasons, then a repeat biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed. The last dose of valproic acid will be taken on the morning of surgery or biopsy.&#xD;
      Following the surgery or biopsy, there will be one end of study visit with the subject to&#xD;
      assess for any lingering toxicity. Data on subjects will then be taken from clinical&#xD;
      appointments for 6 months after surgery to assess for relapse rates.&#xD;
