      This is an open trial of ziprasidone (ZIP) in children and adolescents. It is designed to&#xD;
      provide pilot data on the magnitude of ZIP's antipsychotic effects in psychotic youth, dosing&#xD;
      ranges, acute safety, and tolerability. This would then inform the design of a rigorous,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of ZIP in the pediatric population. The primary study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the proportion of pediatric subjects responding to treatment with ziprasidone will be&#xD;
      comparable or greater than reported in trials of ziprasidone in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases: an eight week acute phase and a 44 week continuation&#xD;
      phase for those subjects who show a response during the first eight weeks. All treatment will&#xD;
      be open label and monitored by research clinicians with expertise in treating psychotic&#xD;
      youth. The initial titration is relatively slow to minimize side effects. A flexible dose&#xD;
      strategy in which each individual's ultimate dose is determined by his/her response and side&#xD;
      effects will be used. The maximal dose will be 160mg split as a BID dose. We estimate that&#xD;
      the average dose will be 120mg/d. Concurrent use of benztropine, propranolol, and&#xD;
      benzodiazepines (lorazepam and clonazepam) will be permitted as needed to treat any emergent&#xD;
      extrapyramidal side effects and agitation. Concurrent use of antidepressants and mood&#xD;
      stabilizers will be permitted in those subjects who have been on stable doses of&#xD;
      antidepressants or mood stabilizers for at least four weeks at time of entry, or those with&#xD;
      emergence of significant affective symptoms during the maintenance phase of the study.&#xD;

    <description>20mg pills, dosing will be flexible, ranging from 10 to 160 mg divided BID or TID for the duration of the 52 week trial. In very rare cases, if the subject has shown some benefit and no side effects at a dose of 160mg and the treating clinician feels a further dose increase is necessary, the case would need to be presented to all of the other Principal Investigators for special consideration of further dose increases in 20 mg increments to an absolute maximal dose of 220mg.</description>
