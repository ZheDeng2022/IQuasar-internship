    <textblock>
      The efficacy of vaccination against influenza in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been&#xD;
      assessed using humoral response. However, the cellular immunity is another important pathway&#xD;
      of response to vaccination. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of cellular&#xD;
      immunity response to influenza vaccination. Patient with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy&#xD;
      controls will participate in this study , will undergo a clinical evaluation the day of&#xD;
      vaccination and 4 weeks after. The humoral and cell immunity response will be assessed the&#xD;
      day of vaccination and 4 weeks later&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with RA and 30 healthy , aged matched controls will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, all subjects will be vaccinated with the inactivated split&#xD;
      virion vaccine which will be recommended by the WHO next fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at weel 0 and 6 weeks later. Clinical evaluation will be based on&#xD;
      the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28) which includes number of swollen and tender joints,&#xD;
      visual global evaluation of the physician , ESR and CRP Blood with be collected on the day of&#xD;
      vaccination and 6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells Blood samples will be obtained prior to and&#xD;
      4 weeks after vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated by&#xD;
      centrifugation of heparinized blood on a Lymphoprep gradient (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). Cells&#xD;
      will be washed twice in tissue culture medium RPMI (RPMI1640-Hepes with Glutamax-I, GIBCO&#xD;
      BRL, NY, USA) and resuspended to a concentration of 2 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with&#xD;
      10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO BRL, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISPOT assay The 96-well PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp., MA, USA) plates&#xD;
      will be prewet with 70% EtOH, then coated with 100 l/well of anti-human IFN- monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (mAb) 1-D1K , diluted to 15 g/ml in sterile filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)&#xD;
      . The plates will be kept overnight at 4°C. A total of 100 000 PBMC plus 5 l/well (1 g/ml)&#xD;
      peptides will be added to each well in duplicate for each condition and incubated for 24 h at&#xD;
      37°C in 5% CO2. After incubation the plates will be washed with PBS then 100 l of&#xD;
      biotinylated mAb (7-B6-1-biotin, Mabtech AB), diluted in filtered PBS with 0.5% FBS to the&#xD;
      concentration 1 g/ml were added to each well. The plates will be incubated 2 h at room&#xD;
      temperature, washed with PBS and then incubated with 100 l/well of streptavidine-alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase (Mabtech AB) diluted 1-1000 in PBS with 0.5% FBS for 1 h at room temperature.&#xD;
      After washing, cells will be developed by adding 100 l/well of colorimetric substrate&#xD;
      (BCIP/NBT-plus, Mabtech AB) and then counted in an ELISPOT reader. Each spot was produced by&#xD;
      a single IFN- secreting T-cell-spot-forming cell (SFC). All tests were performed in duplicate&#xD;
      and the mean values were calculated. A response will be considered to be positive when the&#xD;
      number of spots in the wells with peptide-stimulated cells, after subtraction of the&#xD;
      background (wells without peptide stimulation), will be at least two-fold greater than the&#xD;
      number of background spots14 and more than 20/106 SFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of intracellular cytokine production by flow cytometry The intracellular staining&#xD;
      method will be used for identifying the phenotype of INF- producing T cells activated by&#xD;
      peptide stimulation. The staining will be performed using the protocol described by Rauser et&#xD;
      al.15 PBMC were stimulated for 6 h with 1 g/ml influenza peptides. Brefeldin A (10 g/ml,&#xD;
      Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) will be added for the last 4 h of the incubation. A positive&#xD;
      control will be obtained by stimulating the cells with 0.5 g/ml PMA (Phorbol 12-myrestate&#xD;
      13-acetate) and 1 g/ml Ionomycin (both from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The cells will&#xD;
      be permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD3, anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 and&#xD;
      anti-IFN- antibodies (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Samples will be analyzed by flow&#xD;
      cytometry using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The positive limit for this test was 0.05% of&#xD;
      IFN producing T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proliferation of specific CD4+ and CD8+ Cellular response will be evaluated by simultaneously&#xD;
      analyzing proliferation of specific T CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes upon stimulation with&#xD;
      antigens of the three virus strains present in the vaccine and production of activation Th1&#xD;
      cytokines by the same cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, to simultaneously analyze proliferation and cytokine production by influenza&#xD;
      specific T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be obtained at T0 and T1 from each&#xD;
      donor, stained with the fluorescent nuclear dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE;&#xD;
      Molecular Probes) and cultured in duplicate in the presence of peptides of HA from each of&#xD;
      the virus strains contained in the influenza virus vaccine used in the study or control&#xD;
      peptide for 72 h. At the end of incubation cultures will be stopped with brefeldin, cells&#xD;
      resuspended, stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD8 and anti-interferon-γ (IFN-γ)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies (Becton&amp;Dickinson) and analyzed by mean of a six colour flow-cytometer&#xD;
      (FACSCanto-Becton&amp;Dickinson) and FACS DIVA software . As at every cell division the nuclear&#xD;
      fluorescence is halved, proliferating cells fall in the left quadrants of the cytogram, the&#xD;
      more divisions the less fluorescence. IFN-γ producing cells fall in the upper quadrants of&#xD;
      the cytograms. Cells that upon specific influenza peptide or control peptide stimulation both&#xD;
      proliferate and actively produce IFN-γ (Th1 cytokine) fall in the upper left quadrant of the&#xD;
      cytogram. They were measured as frequency (proliferating and IFN-γ-producing cells/total T&#xD;
      CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemagglutination inhibition test The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested by&#xD;
      Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza virus has two important surface glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA) and the&#xD;
      neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic classification and subtyping of influenza viruses is based on&#xD;
      these two glycoproteins. HA plays a key role in virus cell entry by binding to cell surface&#xD;
      receptors, which are found also on red blood cells of certain species. Binding to red cells&#xD;
      results in haemagglutination, which can be observed as a carpet of agglutinated red cells at&#xD;
      the bottom of a tube or microtitre well. In the HI test, antibody directed against the viral&#xD;
      haemagglutinins block the virus from binding to the blood cells and thus inhibits the&#xD;
      haemagglutination reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and post immunization HI antibodies were tested at the Central Virology Laboratory&#xD;
      of the Israeli Ministry of Health using the HI test according to a standard WHO procedure 16.&#xD;
      Sera were separated, code labeled, and stored at -20°C until tested. Sera were treated with&#xD;
      receptor destroying enzyme cholera filtrate to remove non-specific inhibitors, and with&#xD;
      Turkey red blood cells to remove non-specific agglutinins. The treated sera were tested by HI&#xD;
      test against the three antigens included in the vaccine: A/California (CAL), B/Shangai (SHAN)&#xD;
      and A/New Caledonia (NC). The working dilution (test dose) of each antigen contained four&#xD;
      haemagglutinin units in 25 µl of antigen. Test doses were diluted in phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline (PBS) and added to serial dilution of antiserum. The haemagglutinin inhibition titer&#xD;
      was determined as the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibits haemagglutination of&#xD;
      red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The titer of an antiserum not showing any inhibition was recorded as &lt;10. Humoral response&#xD;
      was defined as either a fourfold or more rise in titer, or a rise from a non-protective&#xD;
      baseline level of &lt;1/40 to 1/40 in HI antibodies four weeks after vaccination 17,18.&#xD;
      Geometric mean titers of antibody were calculated to assess the immunity of the whole group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint of the study : the proportion of cells producing Interferon gamma in&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and controls Secondary Endpoint: Safety of the vaccine&#xD;
