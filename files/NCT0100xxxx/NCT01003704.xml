  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (pain originating from where an amputated limb once was) is a common&#xD;
      occurrence after lower extremity amputations, with some sources noting incidence to be as&#xD;
      high as 60-80% six months after surgery. This pain can eventually subside, however, cases&#xD;
      have been reported of incidence 10 years after surgery. This pain is not only physically&#xD;
      detrimental, but can also be psychologically detrimental after a difficult to accept change&#xD;
      in the body. Prior studies have been performed using regional anesthetic techniques&#xD;
      (including spinals and epidurals) and different medications to attempt to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of phantom limb pain, however, the data have been mostly inconclusive. Of interest,&#xD;
      prior studies have not addressed peripheral nerve blocks, a method of anesthesia/analgesia&#xD;
      more commonly employed for amputations recently. The purpose of our retrospective study is to&#xD;
      look at the incidence of phantom limb pain at our institution over a two year period to&#xD;
      determine if peripheral nerve blocks result in a significantly reduced incidence compared to&#xD;
      other techniques (spinal, epidural, general anesthesia only). In addition, there is little&#xD;
      data on relation of reason for amputation and presence of preoperative neuropathy and&#xD;
      incidence of phantom pain. As secondary endpoints, the investigators wish to investigate if&#xD;
      certain reasons for amputation (trauma, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and others)&#xD;
      and/or neuropathy lead to a higher incidence of phantom limb pain. The results of this study&#xD;
      could impact future management of patients who are to receive amputations and may lead to&#xD;
      further prospective studies on the topics involved.&#xD;
