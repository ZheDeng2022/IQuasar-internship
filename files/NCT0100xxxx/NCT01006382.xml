  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction which can affect&#xD;
      the airway, breathing and/or circulation. This reaction can be triggered by a number of&#xD;
      different allergens but the most common are food, medications, insect venom and latex.&#xD;
      Because these reactions occur suddenly and are potentially very serious, the best management&#xD;
      lies in the correct use of the prescribed emergency medication. Epinephrine, or adrenaline as&#xD;
      it is more commonly known, is the recommended drug for the treatment of anaphylaxis.&#xD;
      Injecting the epinephrine into the outer thigh muscle is the preferred route of&#xD;
      administration. For health professionals, patients and carers, this rapid administration is&#xD;
      facilitated by the manufacture of preloaded syringes and autoinjectors. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of these devices, a review of studies shows poor knowledge and skills amongst&#xD;
      both health professionals and patients with regards to using autoinjectable epinephrine&#xD;
      devices correctly. These studies found that as well as poor knowledge in using the&#xD;
      autoinjectors, there was a lack of confidence amongst patients and an unwillingness to carry&#xD;
      the device with them at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other disease groups like asthma and diabetes, psychological models which involve asking&#xD;
      people how they think about their illness and their related behaviours, have been found to&#xD;
      help in the understanding of why some people follow or adhere to health professionals advice&#xD;
      and why others do not. Based on these findings, this study will look at two appropriate&#xD;
      psychological models and their ability to predict variation in adherence to self-care&#xD;
      regimens in adolescents and young adults with food allergy related anaphylaxis.&#xD;

      Study Design: Cross-sectional comparison of the Self Regulatory Model (Leventhal, 1984) and&#xD;
      The Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1966) by which the models will be used to predict and&#xD;
      understand adherence to selfcare regimens of adolescents and young adults with food allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Sample Size / Power Calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation was based on multiple regression analysis for all predictor variables,&#xD;
      25 in total. To predict a minimum of 10% of the variance in adherence with an alpha=0.05 and&#xD;
      power=0.90, a minimum proposed sample size of 275 participants will be needed. A 40%&#xD;
      attrition rate has been anticipated due to the use of postal questionnaires and so a minimum&#xD;
      of 459 participants will need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses Nonparametric item response theory analysis, univariate correlations and&#xD;
      multiregressional analysis for predictor models will be conducted. Structural equation&#xD;
      modelling will also be applied to assess the goodness of fit of the two social cognition&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting This study will be based in an outpatients setting and in the community. Participants&#xD;
      will be identified and recruited from their hospital allergy clinic either whilst attending&#xD;
      an appointment or from a hospital mail out. The third method of recruitment will involve&#xD;
      participants from a convenience sample of the universities of Sussex and Brighton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Phase 1 Recruitment and consent The recruitment of study participants will involve&#xD;
      three methods. The first method will involve recruiting participants in person from their&#xD;
      hospital allergy clinic. Eligible individuals identified by clinic staff will be given a&#xD;
      participant information leaflet and asked if they are interested in taking part in the study.&#xD;
      Once verbal consent is given, participants will be directed to the chief investigator who&#xD;
      will be present in clinic. Interested individuals would then have the opportunity to discuss&#xD;
      the research with the chief investigator and/or the clinic staff. If still interested,&#xD;
      individuals (aged 16-21 or parents of those aged 13-15) will be asked to sign two consent&#xD;
      forms (one copy to keep for themselves) and be given a questionnaire. The participants will&#xD;
      be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaire within the clinic, or take it home to&#xD;
      complete. If the latter option is chosen, a freepost envelope addressed to the research team&#xD;
      will be provided. Participants will also be given a correspondence slip on which to write&#xD;
      their contact details to return separately to the research team if they are interested in&#xD;
      receiving a summary of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second method of recruitment will involve a patient database search by clinic staff and&#xD;
      subsequent mail out to eligible individuals. Clinic staff will search their patient records&#xD;
      for individuals who fit the inclusion criteria. The consultant in charge will confirm their&#xD;
      eligibility and sign the invitation letter prepared on hospital headed paper. This will be&#xD;
      put in an envelope together with the participant information leaflet, two consent forms (one&#xD;
      copy for the participant to keep and the other to be returned), the questionnaire, future&#xD;
      correspondence slip and freepost envelope addressed to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third method of recruitment will be a convenience sample through the Universities of&#xD;
      Sussex and Brighton. A generic email will be sent to staff and students consisting of the&#xD;
      participant information leaflet and detailing the main inclusion criteria. Individuals who&#xD;
      are eligible and interested in taking part in the research will be asked to reply to the&#xD;
      email with their contact details. Similarly to those recruited from the clinic mail out,&#xD;
      these participants will be sent a pack containing another participant information leaflet,&#xD;
      two consent forms, a questionnaire, a correspondence slip and a freepost envelope addressed&#xD;
      to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Questionnaire In order to measure the models, carefully constructed and piloted&#xD;
      questionnaires have been developed. Each participant will be asked to complete one&#xD;
      questionnaire on one occasion. The questionnaire will collect demographic details, assess&#xD;
      knowledge of how and when to use medication, confidence in the individual's own ability to&#xD;
      use the medication, management of food allergy, the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire&#xD;
      (Moss-Morris et al., 2002) which is the validated questionnaire to measure items from the&#xD;
      Self-Regulatory Model (Leventhal, 1984), items which relate to factors found within the&#xD;
      Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1966) and finally the Revised Life Orientation Test (Scheier&#xD;
      et al., 1994). The questionnaire completion time has been confirmed with individuals within&#xD;
      the targeted age range and is expected to take no longer than 40 minutes to complete. In&#xD;
      order to improve the response rate of questionnaires, a second mail out will be sent to all&#xD;
      eligible participants one month after the initial mail out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Feedback to participants Those participants who expressed an interest in receiving&#xD;
      a summary of findings and provided contact details will be sent a summary document upon&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Demographic/background Participants will be asked their age, gender, ethnicity, size&#xD;
      of family, history of food allergy and anaphylaxis, use of the emergency medication&#xD;
      autoinjectable epinephrine, membership of an allergy support group, possession of a&#xD;
      management plan for their food allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Knowledge about how and when to use an autoinjectable epinephrine device will be&#xD;
      measured and the individuals confidence in their ability to do so correctly will also be&#xD;
      looked at. This will enable us to explore whether underuse is as a result of poor knowledge&#xD;
      or whether this can be better explained by other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence Adherence will be measured by asking participants about their current methods of&#xD;
      managing their food allergy. This will include questions on allergen avoidance and carrying&#xD;
      emergency medication (auto-injectable epinephrine and additional medicines they may use to&#xD;
      treat their food allergy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (Moss-Morris et al., 2002), Health Belief Model&#xD;
      (Rosenstock, 1966) items and the Revised Life Orientation Test (Scheier et al., 1994) The&#xD;
      Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (Moss-Morris et al., 2002) measures constructs from&#xD;
      the Self-Regulatory Model (Leventhal, 1984) which include symptoms, the duration of food&#xD;
      allergy, the consequences of having food allergy, the personal control an individual feels&#xD;
      they have over their food allergy, the amount the individual feels the treatment can control&#xD;
      their food allergy, emotions they associate with their food allergy, how much they comprehend&#xD;
      their food allergy and what they believe are the causes. The Health Belief Model (Rosenstock,&#xD;
      1966) similarly looks at attitudes but in this case how susceptible and serious individuals&#xD;
      feel suffering an allergic reaction would be, the barriers and benefits to following&#xD;
      recommended advice and what prompts these individuals to follow this advice. The Revised Life&#xD;
      Orientation Test (Scheier et al., 1994) will also be measured to determine levels of optimism&#xD;
      which has been found in other studies to impact on the way participants respond to items on&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
