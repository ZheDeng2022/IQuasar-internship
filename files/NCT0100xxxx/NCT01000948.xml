      This is a prospective, open, one-arm, two-centre, Phase II clinical safety pilot-study. The&#xD;
      trial is designed to gain initial safety and efficacy-related data on once-daily orally&#xD;
      administered ZD4054 10 mg in prior chemotherapy treated patients with metastatic&#xD;
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Study centres and number of patients planned This pilot study will be conducted in&#xD;
      approximately 24 patients recruited from two hospital-based Danish centres: department of&#xD;
      Urology K, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby and department of Urologic Surgery D,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet. The recruitment of patients will be competitive among centres. 1-2 months&#xD;
      before expected LSI it should be discussed if the target accrual should be expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period Phase of development Estimated date of first patient enrolled August 1th 2009 II&#xD;
      Estimated date of last patient completed July 31th 2012 Total study duration is approximately&#xD;
      36 months, which includes 12 months' recruitment, 36-month follow-up for safety and final&#xD;
      survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability profile of ZD4054 after treatment with chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECGs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effect of ZD4054 on rate of rise of PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of ZD4054 on prostate cancer related pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the effect of ZD4054 on the plasma concentration of circulating tumour&#xD;
           cells (CTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Time to Progression and Overall Survival (time to death) will be compared with&#xD;
      historical data in a post chemotherapy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a prospective, Open, One-arm, Phase II clinical safety pilot-study. The&#xD;
      trial is designed to gain initial safety and efficacy-related data on once-daily orally&#xD;
      administered ZD4054 10 mg in prior chemotherapy treated patients with metastatic&#xD;
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients could receive other therapies including prednisolone, estramustine, ketoconazole and&#xD;
      second-line or third-line antiandrogens at investigator's discretion without being considered&#xD;
      treatment failures or having to stop study therapy; however every attempt will be made to&#xD;
      avoid changes in medication for at least 12 weeks to minimise potential for confounding on&#xD;
      study endpoints over this time period. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be&#xD;
      administered in addition to study therapy at investigator's discretion after objective&#xD;
      progression if the patient is considered likely to derive benefit. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target patient population A total number of 24 male patients aged 18 years or older with&#xD;
      metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer who have progressive disease (defined by rising&#xD;
      serum prostate-specific antigen levels despite medical or surgical castration) and previously&#xD;
      received cytotoxic chemotherapy (docetaxel) for the treatment of HRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be randomised and all patients will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • ZD4054 10 mg given orally, once daily in tablet form. Duration of treatment Patients will&#xD;
      receive daily ZD4054 as long as they meet no withdrawal criteria. Following completion of 24&#xD;
      months of ZD4054, patients, who in the investigator's opinion are experiencing benefit from&#xD;
      study treatment, may continue on ZD4054, for as long as they meet no withdrawal criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods The study is a pilot study designed to collect safety/tolerability data&#xD;
      and assess markers of efficacy. A total of 24 patients will be recruited into this pilot&#xD;
      study and this is based primarily on the number of patients that can be recruited in a&#xD;
      reasonable time period at the centres and should be sufficient to make an initial assessment&#xD;
      of safety/tolerability and the efficacy markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of tolerability and safety, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      (based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3&#xD;
      (NCI CTCAE) grading), laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs and physical exam will be&#xD;
      summarised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be presented and analysed to investigate trends in the data. The&#xD;
      interpretation of the analyses will consider the number of assessments being undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Demography and baseline data will be&#xD;
      summarised. Any analyses will be performed using SPSS and other validated software as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
