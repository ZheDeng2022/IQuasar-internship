      The purpose of this research study is to determine if treatment with Low Level Laser Therapy&#xD;
      (LLLT) is effective in treating the pain, numbness or tingling patients are experiencing&#xD;
      following their chemotherapy. The investigators would also like to know the number of&#xD;
      treatments that were needed in order to reduce their symptoms.&#xD;

      LLLT is a technique of applying a low energy or low-level laser to tissue. It is used to&#xD;
      trigger tissue to increase cellular production by giving off a low-level, or cold light&#xD;
      energy. This low level energy passes through the skin, into the cell membrane producing a&#xD;
      process called photobiostimulation. LLLT works by capturing and increasing the beneficial&#xD;
      wavelengths of light. These lasers do not cut or burn, but instead penetrate into the skin.&#xD;
      This process has multiple effects on cells and can enhance the body's natural regenerative&#xD;
      functions. It can also stimulate the release of endorphins and collagen. Endorphins work as&#xD;
      &quot;natural pain relievers&quot; and are produced by the body during strenuous workouts, excitement&#xD;
      and pain. Collagen is a natural substance within body tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center trial conducted at Legacy Health System. Twenty patients from Legacy&#xD;
      Health System with chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy will be enrolled in this study. Arm 1&#xD;
      will receive LLLT twice a week for a total of eight weeks. Arm 2 will follow a crossover&#xD;
      study design where patients will receive sham (fake) LLLT twice a week for the first four&#xD;
      weeks, followed by true LLLT twice a week for four weeks, (total of 8 weeks). Each patient in&#xD;
      Arm 2 will serve as his or her own comparison for the purpose of examining the effects of&#xD;
      LLLT. Both arms will have a follow-up visit following the last treatment.&#xD;
