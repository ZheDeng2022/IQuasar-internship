    <textblock>
      The prophylactic use of small doses of ephedrine may be effective in obtunding of the&#xD;
      hypotension responses to propofol with minimal hemodynamic and ST segment changes. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of small doses of ephedrine on hemodynamic&#xD;
      responses of propofol anesthesia for valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is widespread interest in the use of propofol for the induction and maintenance of&#xD;
      anesthesia for fast track cardiac surgery. However, its use for induction of anesthesia is&#xD;
      often associated with a significant rate related transient hypotension for 5-10 minutes. This&#xD;
      is mainly mediated with decrease in sympathetic activity with minor contribution of its&#xD;
      direct vascular smooth muscle relaxation and direct negative inotropic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ephedrine has demonstrated as a vasopressor drug for the treatment of hypotension in&#xD;
      association with spinal and general anesthesia. Prophylactic use of high doses of ephedrine&#xD;
      [10-30 mg] was effective in obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol with associated&#xD;
      marked tachycardia. However, the use of smaller doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) was successfully&#xD;
      attenuated, but not abolished, the decrease in blood pressure with transient increase in&#xD;
      heart rate. This vasopressor effect is mostly mediated by β-stimulation rather than&#xD;
      α-stimulation and also indirectly by releasing endogenous norepinephrine from sympathetic&#xD;
      nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the effect of decreasing the dose of ephedrine from 0.1 to 0.07 mg/kg may be&#xD;
      clinically insignificant, the investigators postulated that the prophylactic use of small&#xD;
      dose of ephedrine may prevent propofol-induced hypotension after induction of anesthesia for&#xD;
      valve surgery with minimal in hemodynamic, ST segment, and troponin I changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of pre-induction administration&#xD;
      of 0.07, 0.1, 0.15 mg/kg of ephedrine on heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP),&#xD;
      central venous and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (CVP and PAOP, respectively), cardiac&#xD;
      (CI), stroke volume (SVI), systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (SVRI and PVRI,&#xD;
      respectively), left and right ventricular stroke work (LVSWI and RVSWI, respectively)&#xD;
      indices, ST segment, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) changes in the patients anesthetized with&#xD;
      propofol-fentanyl for valve surgery.&#xD;

      One hundred fifty ASA III-IV patients aged 18-55 years scheduled for elective valve surgery&#xD;
      were included in this randomized double blinded placebo-controlled study at the author's&#xD;
      center after obtaining of approval of the local ethical committee and a written informed&#xD;
      consent from the participants. The sample size was determined by a prior power analysis&#xD;
      indicated that 27 patients in each group would be a sufficiently large sample size to be&#xD;
      adequate to detect a 20% changes in SVRI values, with a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of&#xD;
      approximately 85%. We added 10% more patients to account for patients dropping out during the&#xD;
      study. All operations were performed by the same surgeons. Participants were allocated&#xD;
      randomly to five groups (n=30 for each) to receive saline [group 1] or ephedrine 0.07, 0.1 or&#xD;
      0.15 mg/kg [group 2, 3, and 4, respectively]and phenylephrine 1.5 ug/kg [group 5] 1 min&#xD;
      before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with documented un-controlled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction less than 45%, peripheral vascular disease, thyrotoxicosis, neurological,&#xD;
      hepatic, and renal diseases, pregnancy, re-do or emergency surgery, allergy to the study&#xD;
      medications, those requiring preoperative inotropic, vasopressor or mechanical circulatory or&#xD;
      ventilatory support, and those who had electrocardiograph (ECG) characteristics that would&#xD;
      interfere with ST segment monitoring, included baseline ST segment depression, left&#xD;
      bundle-branch block, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, digitalis effect, QRS&#xD;
      duration &gt;0.12 s, as well as pacemaker-dependent rhythms, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All routine medications except angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were continued until&#xD;
      the morning of the operation. All patients were premedicated with 0.03 mg/kg IV midazolam and&#xD;
      fentanyl 1 µg/kg before invasive instrumentation. All patients were monitored with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, non invasive blood pressure and five leads electrocardiography (leads II and V5)&#xD;
      (Life Scope Monitor, BSM-4113, Nihon Kohden Corp, Japan). Continuous ST segment trends were&#xD;
      electronically measured at the J-point + 60 ms to exclude the T wave during the episodes of&#xD;
      tachycardia. The tabulated and graphic ST segment data were reviewed by two investigators who&#xD;
      are not involved in the study and are blinded to the patient's group for significant ischemic&#xD;
      responses. The later were defined a reversible ST segment changes from baseline of either ≥ 1&#xD;
      mV ST-segment depression or ≥2 mV ST-segment elevation lasting for at least 1 minute. A&#xD;
      radial artery catheter and a flow-directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter were&#xD;
      placed under local anesthesia before induction. The final position of the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter tip was confirmed with portable chest x- ray film and pulmonary artery diastolic&#xD;
      pressure &gt; PAOP. CI was measured by thermodilution using ice cold injectate. Five&#xD;
      measurements were performed, the lowest and highest readings were discarded, and the mean of&#xD;
      the readings was recorded. Intravenous infusion of 5-7mL/Kg of 6% Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4&#xD;
      (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Hombourg, Germany) was given before induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia when the baseline PAOP was less than 10 mm Hg. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring&#xD;
      and placement of a nasogastric tube, and rectal and nasopharyngeal temperature probes were&#xD;
      done after induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were allocated randomly to four groups by drawing sequentially numbered sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes containing a computer-generated randomization code. The subjects received&#xD;
      intravenous injection of 0.1 mL/kg of a study solution containing either saline 0.9% solution&#xD;
      [group 1 (n=30)], ephedrine 0.7 mg/mL [group 2 (n=30)], ephedrine 1 mg/mL [group 3 (n=30)] or&#xD;
      ephedrine 1.5 mg/mL [group 4 (n=30)], or phenylephrine 15 mcg/mL [group 5 (n=30)]. All study&#xD;
      solutions were injected over 1 min at 1 min before induction of anesthesia. The placebo and&#xD;
      the ephedrine solutions were prepared in identical syringes labeled 'study drug' by the local&#xD;
      pharmacy department before induction of anesthesia. The anesthesia providers were blinded to&#xD;
      the study solution and were not involved in the study. All staff in the operating room were&#xD;
      unaware of the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 5 µg/kg, propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg, and cisatracurium 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg was given for muscle relaxation. After endotracheal intubation, the lungs were&#xD;
      ventilated with a mixture of oxygen in air to maintain an arterial carbon dioxide tension at&#xD;
      4.5-6 kPa. Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusions of propofol 4-6 mg/kg/ h,&#xD;
      fentanyl 0.025 µg/kg/min, and cisatracurium 1-3 µg/Kg/ min to maintain suppression of the&#xD;
      second twitch using a train-of-four stimulation. All patients received a slow injection of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid 50 mg/kg before initiation of CPB. Target MAP and HR were within 20% from the&#xD;
      mean baseline values. Hypotension (MAP ≤ 60 mm Hg ≥ 2-3 minutes) was treated with intravenous&#xD;
      fluids; reduction of the infusion rate of propofol by 50%, or bolus doses of ephedrine 5 mg.&#xD;
      Hypertension (MAP ≥ 20% from the mean baseline for ≥ 2-3 minutes) was treated with increasing&#xD;
      of the infusion rate of propofol by 50%, or bolus doses of labetalol 20 mg, or nitroglycerin&#xD;
      0.05 mg. Tachycardia ≥20% from the baseline values for ≥1 minute was treated with the&#xD;
      modulation of propofol infusion rate or boluses of esmolol 20 mg. Bradycardia (HR ≤ 40/min)&#xD;
      was treated with atropine 0.5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) lines, oxygenator, and venous reservoir were primed. Heparin&#xD;
      sodium 300 IU/kg was given after pericardiotomy to achieve celite-activated clotting time&#xD;
      became higher than 480 s. Standard CPB technique was established with the ascending aorta&#xD;
      cannula and the bicaval venous cannulae. During CPB, the non-pulsatile pump flow rate was 2.4&#xD;
      L min/ m2 using a twin roller pump and a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator, perfusion pressure&#xD;
      was 50-80 mmHg, arterial carbon dioxide tension was 35-40 mmHg, unadjusted for temperature&#xD;
      (α-stat), arterial oxygen tension was 150-250 mmHg, and moderate systemic hypothermia&#xD;
      (nasopharyngeal temperature 33-34°C) was maintained. Myocardial viability was preserved with&#xD;
      topical hypothermia and cold blood antegrade cardioplegia administered intermittently into&#xD;
      the aortic root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before separation from CPB, all patients were rewarmed (nasopharyngeal temperature 37°C,&#xD;
      bladder temperature 36°C) and epinephrine and nitroglycerine infusions were used to as needed&#xD;
      after CPB. Heparin was neutralized after discontinuation of CPB with protamine sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery propofol 1-2 mg/kg/ h was used for sedation in the ICU and morphine 0.05 µg/kg&#xD;
      was used as needed for analgesia. Propofol infusion was discontinued and ventilator weaning&#xD;
      was started once patients were awake and cooperative, hemodynamically stable without high&#xD;
      doses of inotropic support, no severe arrhythmias, body core temperature &gt;35.5°C, bleeding&#xD;
      &lt;100 mL/h, urine output&gt; 0.5 mL/kg/h, and arterial oxygen tension &gt;100 mm Hg with oxygen&#xD;
      concentration &lt;0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables include the changes in hemodynamic variables namely; HR, MAP, CI,&#xD;
      SVRI, LVSWI, and ST segment changes. Secondary outcome variables were CVP, PAOP, RVSWI, and&#xD;
      troponin I changes, and the need for vasoactive drugs. Anesthesia providers were not involved&#xD;
      in the assessment of the patients. Other anesthesiologists who were blinded to the study&#xD;
      group and were not in the operative room performed the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR, MAP, CI, SVI, CVP, PAOP, SVRI, PVRI, LVSWI, and RVSWI changes were recorded before&#xD;
      (baseline), and 5 min after induction, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after endotracheal intubation;&#xD;
      and 15 min after sternotomy. The changes in hemodynamic data were calculated as percentages&#xD;
      of the baseline measurements. The numbers and total time of intra-operative ischemic episodes&#xD;
      were recorded in each group. Venous blood samples were drawn before, 3, 12, 24, and 48 hours&#xD;
      after CPB to measure cardiac troponin I. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10&#xD;
      min and serum samples stored at-20°C. Two specific monoclonal antibodies were used to avoid&#xD;
      the cross-reactivity with human skeletal muscle for the measurement of cTnI. The upper&#xD;
      reference limits for cTnI in a control population was 0.6 µg/L. The number of patients who&#xD;
      received rescue doses of labetalol, ephedrine, atropine and esmolol, times from induction to&#xD;
      intubation (I-T) and to skin incision (I-S) and all major complications (hypoxemia&#xD;
      (SaO2&lt;90%), arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular events) were recorded in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Repeated-measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance was used for analysis of serial changes in the hemodynamic and cTnI data at&#xD;
      different times after administration of study solution. Fisher exact test was used for&#xD;
      categorical data. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for continuous&#xD;
      parametric variables and the differences were then corrected by post-hoc Bonferoni test. The&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA was performed for intergroup comparisons for the non-parametric&#xD;
      values and post hoc pairwise comparisons was done using the Wilcoxon rank sum t test.&#xD;
      Univariate analyses of the preoperative risk factor, namely EuroSCORE for the frequency of&#xD;
      significant hypotension and ST segment changes after propofol anesthesia were performed.&#xD;
      Univariate predictors were examined in a stepwise manner into a multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression model, with entry and retention set at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 to assess&#xD;
      the independent impact of this risk factor on the outcome. Data were expressed as mean (SD),&#xD;
      number (%), or median [range]. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered to represent statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
