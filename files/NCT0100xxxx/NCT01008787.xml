  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to learn why some African American (AA) women&#xD;
      choose not to exercise often and to learn if teaching African American women how to support&#xD;
      the exercise habits of a partner will increase their physical activity and help them to stay&#xD;
      more active over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the proposed intervention is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To conduct formative research using semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups with sedentary AA women to investigate the role and importance of social support for&#xD;
      PA;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the feasibility of recruiting and implementing &quot;Culturally Appropriate&#xD;
      Physical Activity Motivational Interviewing&quot; (CAPMI) intervention in sedentary AA women;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To pilot test and evaluate the efficacy of the CAPMI in increasing PA, social support,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and reducing barriers to Physical Activity (PA) at post-intervention compared&#xD;
      to an attention control group.&#xD;

      Focus Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in a focus group or individual&#xD;
      interview. A focus group is a group of people who are asked questions about certain topics&#xD;
      and then discuss these topics with other group members. During the focus group, you will talk&#xD;
      about ways that African American women may increase their physical activity. You will also be&#xD;
      asked questions about the ways in which you support other women to help them become more&#xD;
      physically active. There will be 4 focus groups, each made up of 8-10 women. The focus group&#xD;
      session should take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus group will be audiotaped and transcribed (the spoken words will be typed up). Your&#xD;
      individual name will not be used during the focus group and will not be recorded. For&#xD;
      example, you will be listed as Participant #1. After the focus group comments are copied&#xD;
      down, the focus group tapes will be destroyed. The study staff may also interview you alone.&#xD;
      During the individual interview, you will talk about ways that African American women may&#xD;
      increase their physical activity. You will also be asked questions about the ways in which&#xD;
      you support other women to help them become more physically active. The staff will interview&#xD;
      10 women. The individual interview should take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual interview will be audiotaped and transcribed. Your individual name will not be&#xD;
      used during the interview and will not be recorded. For example, you will be listed as&#xD;
      Participant #1. After the interview comments are copied down, the interview tapes will be&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study until you complete the focus group session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 40 women will take part in the focus groups. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need a partner (a female friend or family member) to take part in this study. Both&#xD;
      you and your study partner will need to meet the same eligibility requirements, and both of&#xD;
      you will be enrolled as participants. If you choose a partner that is not eligible, you will&#xD;
      will need to choose another eligible partner before you can be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can take part in this study, you will be asked if you are between the ages of 18&#xD;
      and 65 years old, if you are currently not engaging in physical activity for more than 3 days&#xD;
      per week and more than 20 minutes each day, and if you are ready to be physically active. You&#xD;
      will be asked if you have a home address where information can be mailed, are able to read at&#xD;
      a 6th grade level, and are able to participate in a training course that will take place on a&#xD;
      weekend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the next 12&#xD;
      weeks. You will also be asked if you plan to move outside of the Houston area in the next 12&#xD;
      weeks. If you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, and/or plan to move, you will not be&#xD;
      able to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will complete the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and how often you exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out a questionnaire about issues related to your physical activity. It&#xD;
           will take 45-60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take a walking test, in which you will walk for 6 minutes at a comfortable&#xD;
           pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a pedometer (a monitor that shows how far you walk).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may receive an accelerometer and complete a 7-day accelerometer assessment. An&#xD;
           accelerometer is a small device that is worn on your hip that measures the amount of&#xD;
           physical activity you do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an&#xD;
      equal chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in an 8-hour training course conducted as 2&#xD;
      in-person 4-hour sessions (for example, scheduled on 2 Saturdays in a row) to help you learn&#xD;
      how to support the exercise habits of your study partner. At this course, a trainer will give&#xD;
      you information and you will take part in activities with your study partner. Sample&#xD;
      activities include role playing and watching a video. This will take place on a weekend. The&#xD;
      goal of the training course is to help you and your partner engage in physical activity. You&#xD;
      will be asked to be physically active for 30 minutes each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a workbook and a DVD about physical activity. You will also be given a form&#xD;
      to complete each time you speak with your study partner about physical activity. You will be&#xD;
      asked to speak with your partner at least 1 time a week about your physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week during Weeks 1-4, 8, and 12 you will be asked to answer questions on the form given&#xD;
      to you at the training course about the conversations you have with your study partner, and&#xD;
      to complete recorded conversations via toll-free number. All telephone diaries must be&#xD;
      completed and returned to research staff members by week 12 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 4 and 8, you will be called and asked several questions about your mood and your&#xD;
      physical activity. The phone call should take about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 5 and 9, you will be mailed a physical activity newsletter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, at Weeks 4 and 8, you will be called and asked several questions about&#xD;
      your mood and your physical activity. The phone call should take about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 5 and 9, you will receive a physical activity newsletter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12 of the study, you will complete the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked several questions about your mood and your physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take a walking test, in which you will walk for 6 minutes at a comfortable&#xD;
           pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may receive an accelerometer and complete a 7-day accelerometer assessment. An&#xD;
           accelerometer is a small device that is worn on your hip that measures the amount of&#xD;
           physical activity you do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study You will be on study for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 80 women will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
