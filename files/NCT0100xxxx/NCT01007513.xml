    <textblock>
      Preterm birth rate is 7.2% in Quebec, it's risen worldwide in the past decade and it's the&#xD;
      leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Preterm birth is a major public health&#xD;
      problem. Preterm labor leading to preterm birth is difficult to diagnose and prediction of&#xD;
      preterm birth is a medical challenge. In the past years, research found that transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound to assess the cervix of the uterus and vaginal detection of inflammatory protein,&#xD;
      specific bacteria and fetal fibronectin can help to detect women at increase risk of preterm&#xD;
      delivery. The investigators believe that a combination of these tests can lead to a better&#xD;
      prediction of preterm delivery. The investigators want to conduct a study among women judged&#xD;
      at increase risk of preterm delivery by their physician (having contractions, modified&#xD;
      cervix, past-history of preterm delivery or multiple pregnancy) and assess their cervix by&#xD;
      ultrasound and sample their vaginal secretion. The investigators want to analyze the vaginal&#xD;
      sampling and look for inflammatory proteins. The objective of this study is to prove the&#xD;
      feasibility of this assessment method and elaborate a better predictive test that the&#xD;
      investigators can easily use in obstetrics clinics and hospitals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preterm birth rate in Quebec is 7.2% and, despite extensive research, the rate of preterm&#xD;
      birth has risen worldwide over the past decades. Preterm birth is, all over the world, the&#xD;
      first cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) groups&#xD;
      premature births with intact and ruptured membranes and represents 70% of preterm delivery.&#xD;
      The two conditions associated with sPTB share a common physiopathology and a progressive&#xD;
      cascade of events. Extensive evidence supports a central role for the production of&#xD;
      prostaglandins, inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in the cervix and&#xD;
      decidua to promote cervical ripening and decidual and fetal membrane activation but, the&#xD;
      exact progression of events remains unclear. Several factors were described as risk factor&#xD;
      for sPTB like bacterial vaginosis, inflammatory cytokines and fetal fibronectin in vaginal&#xD;
      secretions. The transvaginal ultrasound of the cervix (TVUS), which estimates the length and&#xD;
      the aspect of the cervix, can be used as predictive factor of preterm birth. To date, no&#xD;
      study has addressed the supra-cervical region by transvaginal ultrasound. This region may be&#xD;
      an important key of the inflammatory process leading to sPTB. The assessment of this region&#xD;
      by ultrasound can be a predictive marker of sPTB. We want to prove the feasibility of this&#xD;
      new approach of sPTB prediction : the transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the supracervical&#xD;
      and cervical region associated with detection of vaginal inflammation.&#xD;
