    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use and efficacy of the Reverse® Shoulder&#xD;
      Prosthesis for treatment of rotator cuff deficiency in subjects who are candidates for a&#xD;
      total shoulder replacement (primary and revision subjects).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Reverse shoulder arthroplasty for the treatment of rotator cuff deficiency and glenohumeral&#xD;
      arthritis have shown favorable outcomes in pain and function over the short and medium term.&#xD;
      A prospective, multi-center study on the outcomes of subjects treated with the RSP would be a&#xD;
      valuable addition to the literature and give important information regarding an&#xD;
      ever-increasing treatment option for subjects with rotator cuff deficiency. The study will&#xD;
      take place at multiple sites across the United States and will be managed by the DJO Surgical&#xD;
      Clinical Affairs Department. The study will include only subjects who meet the indications&#xD;
      for use criteria for the Reverse® Shoulder Prosthesis and who are candidates for total&#xD;
      shoulder replacement surgery.&#xD;
