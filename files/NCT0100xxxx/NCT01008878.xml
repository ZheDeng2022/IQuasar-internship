    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled and opened trial designed to compare the effects of an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary moderate-intensity lifestyle modification program vs. conventional&#xD;
      treatment by primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to show the benefits of coherent interdisciplinary care in the obesity clinic of CHUS&#xD;
      (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke) in comparison to the conventional treatment&#xD;
      in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve subjects' characteristic features of metabolic syndrome: weight, waist&#xD;
           circumference, fatty mass, plasma lipid profile, blood pressure, fasting glycaemia, and&#xD;
           HbA1c;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve our patients' nutritive practices;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease our patients' sedentary lifestyle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve our patients' motivation to lose weight, and to improve their quality of life;&#xD;
           We also wish to define predictors of answer in order to better select the patients if&#xD;
           necessary, and evaluate the costs incurred by the health system.&#xD;

      Eligible participants recruited from patients, referred through the obesity clinic were&#xD;
      separated into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interdisciplinary treatment group received interventions at our clinic for 6 months.. The&#xD;
      intervention included a visit every 6 weeks including a nursing consultation (listening,&#xD;
      psychological support, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure), an endocrinologist&#xD;
      consultation, a nutritionist consultation (initial evaluation of food intake and&#xD;
      counselling), a psychologist consultation if needed, an interactive group information session&#xD;
      (to discuss the following: diet, psychological aspects associated with obesity, physical&#xD;
      education, complications and pharmacological treatments of obesity), and a questionnaire on&#xD;
      the individual costs of their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group was monitored during this 6 months by their family physician, as per usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biological assessment, questionnaires, and tests will be carried out in beginning and end&#xD;
      of program: the questionnaires are to evaluate the physical activity (Sallis, Canada fitness&#xD;
      survey); the quality of life (IWQOL-Lite, SF-36); the motivation (analogical visual Scales);&#xD;
      knowledge (pretest and post-test); and costs. Tests to assess physical activity (6-minute&#xD;
      walk test and accelerometer) will also be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 6 months, both groups were followed at the obesity clinic for another 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
