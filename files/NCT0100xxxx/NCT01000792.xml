  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of allergic rhinitis is high and appears to be rising worldwide. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is important and necessary to understand and visualize therapy effects on this disease. In&#xD;
      this study we will demonstrate the effect of levocetirizine on nasal cavity dimensions by&#xD;
      assessing not only standard nasal flow diagnostics such as rhinomanometry and acoustic&#xD;
      rhinometry, but supplement exami¬nation procedures with long-term rhinometry and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). With the aid of a virtual model and computer fluid dynamics, we are&#xD;
      able to simulate nasal air flow and provide three-dimensional visualization of the computed&#xD;
      flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous trials ([Bachert], [deBlic], [Day] and [Deruaz]) it has been shown that allergic&#xD;
      symptoms, especially nasal congestion, diminish significantly under treatment with&#xD;
      levocetirizine. We will demonstrate this anti-obstructive effect by comparing the reaction to&#xD;
      nasal allergen challenge before and after four-week treatment with levocetirizine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be informed and give written informed consent for study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be able to adhere to dose and visit schedules and meet study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be aged 18 to 65 (inclusive); gender and race are irrelevant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have at least a two-year history of allergic rhinitis consistent with&#xD;
             persistent allergic rhinitis (defined as symptoms of allergic rhinitis present on four&#xD;
             days or more per week or for four or more consecutive weeks per year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the previous pollen season, subject must have been sufficiently symptomatic, with a&#xD;
             T6SS (reflective) symptoms severity score of at least 10 (out of max. 18). (Symptoms&#xD;
             include nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, congestion, conjunctival itching, redness&#xD;
             and tearing graded on a scale of 0 -absent, 1 - mild, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a positive skin prick test at screening to one or more allergens in&#xD;
             the local panel of seasonal allergens (e.g. grass, tree pollen), but not to perennial&#xD;
             allergens. Subject must demonstrate an antigen-induced skin prick wheal of at least&#xD;
             3mm greater in diameter than the diluent control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have had a positive nasal allergen challenge within the previous six&#xD;
             months. (see [Riechelmann])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonsterile or premenopausal female subjects must use a medically accepted method of&#xD;
             birth control, e.g. oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to frequently occurring perennial allergens, e.g. house dust&#xD;
             mites, cats&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylaxis and/or severe local reactions to skin testing with allergens&#xD;

          -  Any viral inflammation of the upper respiratory system, acute or chronic sinusitis,&#xD;
             rhinitis medicamentosa, nasal polyps, clinically relevant anatomic deviations of the&#xD;
             nose, active or inactive tuberculosis of the respiratory tract, or asthma other than&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any kind of clinically significant disease, especially any signs of active persistent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
