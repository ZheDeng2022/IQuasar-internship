      The purpose of this study is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether bevacizumab increases the amount of oxygen in cancer as measured by a special&#xD;
           positron emission tomography (PET) scan using 64Cu-ATSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the amount of oxygen in cancer as measured by 64Cu-ATSM PET scan predicts how&#xD;
           well the cancer responds to treatment with chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically or pathologically proven Stage IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20&#xD;
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm irrespective of scanner type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of 64Cu-ATSM in&#xD;
        combination with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
        children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2&#xD;
        combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin &gt;9 gm/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  alkaline phosphatase &lt;3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine &lt;1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cockcroft Gault)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 1+&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate coagulation function - INR &lt; 1.5 and PTT &lt; institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of 64Cu-ATSM on the developing human fetus at the recommended imaging dose&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason and because chemotherapeutic agents as well as other&#xD;
             therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of the patient to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior radiation therapy for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known central nervous system metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to 64Cu-ATSM or other agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of claustrophobia, since patients might not be able to tolerate 64CuATSM-PET&#xD;
             imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gross hemoptysis - bright red blood of &gt; ½ teaspoon in quantity - in past 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent or history of active malignancy in the prior five years except for&#xD;
             basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticoagulation at treatment/therapeutic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing neuropathy &gt; grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with aspirin &gt; 325 mg/day, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and/or&#xD;
             cilostazol that cannot be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel, carboplatin, and&#xD;
             bevacizumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
