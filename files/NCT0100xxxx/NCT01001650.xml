    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a non-replicating,&#xD;
      metabolically active Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine in malaria-naïve&#xD;
      healthy volunteers following multiple-dose subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID)&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators wish to evaluate PfSPZ vaccine-mediated protection against P.&#xD;
      falciparum challenge in the following 4 groups (see below) and compare protective efficacy of&#xD;
      the PfSPZ vaccine when given by SC v ID administration in all these groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 4 doses of 7,500 PfSPZ/immunization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 4 doses of 30,000 PfSPZ/immunization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: 4 doses of 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: 4 or 6 doses of 135,000 PfSPZ/immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If &gt; 80% protective efficacy is not achieved in Groups 1, 2, or 3, volunteers in Group 4 will&#xD;
      receive a fifth and sixth dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first clinical trial of the Pf SPZ vaccine is a Phase 1 trial in non-immune healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. Sanaria is the Sponsor and PATH MVI is funding the trial. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted as a collaborative effort between Sanaria, PATH MVI, the NMRC Malaria Program (U.S.&#xD;
      Military Malaria Vaccine Program), and the Center for Vaccine Development at the University&#xD;
      of Maryland at Baltimore (CVD-UMB). The study will take place at the NMRC Malaria Program&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Center on the campus of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD and&#xD;
      at the CVD and/or General Clinical Research Center, UMB. The study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of successively higher doses&#xD;
      of the vaccine administered by the subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID) route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 4 groups of volunteers with each group comprised of a subset of volunteers who&#xD;
      receive the vaccine by the SC route and a subset who receive the vaccine by the ID route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1-3: The first 3 groups will receive 3 ascending doses of vaccine administered as 4 SC&#xD;
      or ID injections separated by 4 week intervals (7,500 PfSPZ/dose, 30,000 PfSPZ/dose, and&#xD;
      135,000 PfSPZ/dose respectively). Each of these groups will be challenged a minimum of 3&#xD;
      weeks after the final dose by exposure to A. stephensi mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum&#xD;
      sporozoites. All 3 groups will be followed for safety until 48 weeks after the first&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Group 4 will start a minimum of 3 weeks after the first immunization of Group 3. If&#xD;
      there is &gt; 80% efficacy in one or more of the subsets of Groups 1, 2, or 3 (SC or ID), Group&#xD;
      4 volunteers will receive 4 immunizations (just like Group 3) but will not have experimental&#xD;
      challenge; they will simply be followed for safety for 12 months after the first&#xD;
      immunization. The FDA has requested that we follow a group of volunteers receiving the&#xD;
      highest dose (135 PfSPZ/immunization) without challenge at 3 weeks. However, if there is NOT&#xD;
      &gt; 80% efficacy in one of more subsets of Groups 1, 2, or 3, after a 6 month observation&#xD;
      period, Group 4 volunteers will receive two additional monthly immunizations (Immunizations&#xD;
      #5 and #6) followed by challenge at approximately 3 weeks after the sixth immunization. All&#xD;
      volunteers in Group 4 will be followed for safety until 52 weeks after the first&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of malaria infection, or travel to a malaria endemic region within 6&#xD;
             months prior to first immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of long term residence (&gt;5 years) in area known to have significant&#xD;
             transmission of P. falciparum.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as &gt; 10%, 5 year risk)&#xD;
             as determined by the method of Gaziano (Gaziano 2008). Risk factors include sex, age&#xD;
             (years), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status, body mass index (BMI,&#xD;
             kg/mm2), reported diabetes status, and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current use of systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy.&#xD;

             albumin within the diluent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use or planned use of any drug with anti-malarial activity that would coincide with&#xD;
             immunization or challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
