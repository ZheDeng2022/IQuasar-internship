    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to develop techniques to identify the course of the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve in patients already undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation or&#xD;
      candidates for future CRT devices undergoing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation. Specifically, the study intends to identify the location and course&#xD;
      of the left pericardiophrenic vein, and thus the left phrenic nerve, to guide the location&#xD;
      for coronary vein lead placement and minimize the risk of phrenic nerve stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phrenic nerve stimulation from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a common adverse&#xD;
      event occurring in 1.5-3% of patients and sometimes as high as 10%. Phrenic nerve stimulation&#xD;
      is frequently observed during the implantation procedure but often appears shortly after&#xD;
      implantation as well. Clinically, dyspnea, cough, and hiccups can occur, some of which are&#xD;
      uncomfortable and not tolerated by the patient for very long periods of time. Resolution of&#xD;
      these clinical outcomes requires repositioning the left coronary vein lead in a second&#xD;
      procedure with its attendant serious clinical sequelae. As CRT leads become smaller the&#xD;
      incidence of phrenic nerve stimulation is likely to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) exists during CRT implantation and is only&#xD;
      minimally dependent of the type of coronary lead and highly dependent upon location of the&#xD;
      left coronary vein lead in relationship to the left phrenic nerve and stimulation strength.&#xD;
      Tedrow et al. demonstrated in a cohort of 71 patients PNS can reach 16% if stimulation&#xD;
      strength is increased to maximize mechanical benefit of CRT. No current methods have been&#xD;
      able to predict PNS, the one likely method of preventing PNS is to identify the location of&#xD;
      the phrenic nerve in the specific patient, as confirmed by visualization and ability to&#xD;
      stimulate the phrenic nerve and by maximizing the distance between the coronary vein lead&#xD;
      position and nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the incidence of phrenic nerve stimulation, Vaseghi performed&#xD;
      non-selective injections of contrast media and was able to identify the left&#xD;
      pericardiophrenic vein in only about 12% of patients undergoing biventricular pacemaker&#xD;
      placement. However, in these patients, identification of the left pericardiophrenic vein&#xD;
      provides a landmark for positioning of the left ventricular (LV) lead that totally eliminated&#xD;
      the incidence of phrenic nerve pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of cardiac structures to the right and left phrenic nerves is generally&#xD;
      known but is significantly variable between patients. There is no imaging or other clinically&#xD;
      available modality that allows the physician to identify the location of the left phrenic&#xD;
      nerve and attempt to avoid it during the left coronary vein lead implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pericardiophrenic veins are a deep collateral venous drainage of the pericardium, pleura&#xD;
      and diaphragm and lie adjacent the phrenic nerves on both the right and left sides between&#xD;
      the parietal pericardium and adjacent pleura. The ostium of the left pericardiophrenic vein&#xD;
      is usually in the left brachiocephalic vein opposite the entrance of the left jugular vein.&#xD;
      The left phrenic vein is located in the general vicinity of the thymic veins which often have&#xD;
      multiple ostia in close proximity. There are several case reports in the literature of&#xD;
      inadvertent cannulation of the pericardiophrenic veins with Swan-Ganz catheters, central&#xD;
      venous catheters and one report of cannulation with a pacing lead leading to inadvertent&#xD;
      phrenic nerve pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to develop techniques to identify the course of the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve in patients already undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation or&#xD;
      candidates for future CRT devices undergoing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation. Specifically, the study intends to identify the location and course&#xD;
      of the left pericardiophrenic vein, and thus the left phrenic nerve, to guide the location&#xD;
      for coronary vein lead placement and minimize the risk of phrenic nerve stimulation.&#xD;
