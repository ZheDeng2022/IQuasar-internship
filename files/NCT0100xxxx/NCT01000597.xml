  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown potentially higher exposure to fluticasone furoate in Japanese&#xD;
      subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. The reasons for these potential differences are&#xD;
      unclear. Therefore this study is being done to look at and compare how fluticasone furoate is&#xD;
      processed by the body in healthy Caucasian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese subjects after&#xD;
      inhaled and intravenous administration. The data obtained will be used to help in the&#xD;
      clinical development of the drug in Japanese and other East Asian populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids are a highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy in allergic conditions such&#xD;
      as asthma and rhinitis. Fluticasone Furoate (FF) is a novel corticosteroid with potent&#xD;
      glucocorticoid activity similar to fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. Phase II&#xD;
      studies have shown FF to be an effective once daily inhaled steroid for asthma and it is&#xD;
      being developed as a potential steroid component in a once daily combination with GW642444M,&#xD;
      for once-daily administration for the maintenance treatment of asthma and COPD. FF is&#xD;
      approved worldwide (including the US, EU and Japan) as an intranasal steroid for the&#xD;
      treatment of allergic rhinitis (VERAMYST™ /AVAMYS™ /ALLERMIST™). Previous inter-study&#xD;
      comparisons have indicated potentially higher systemic exposure to FF in Japanese subjects&#xD;
      compared with treatment groups that recruited predominantly Caucasian subjects. The reasons&#xD;
      for these potential differences are unclear. This study is being performed to evaluate and&#xD;
      directly compare the PK and systemic PD effects of FF in healthy Caucasian, Japanese, Korean&#xD;
      and Chinese subjects when delivered from the novel dry powder inhaler and intravenously. The&#xD;
      data obtained will be used to facilitate clinical development of the FF/GW642444 combination&#xD;
      in Japanese and other East Asian populations.&#xD;
