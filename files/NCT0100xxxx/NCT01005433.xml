      Regional anesthesia has become the anesthetic of choice for cesarean section in most&#xD;
      countries; however, some women still prefer general anesthesia techniques. There are many&#xD;
      trials for the pharmacological modifications of the sympathetic response to surgery,&#xD;
      including opioids, tenoxicam, ketorolac, lidocaine and paracetamol. However, opioid&#xD;
      administration to the mother before delivery has adverse neonatal effects. This research is a&#xD;
      novel trial on the use of dexmedetomidine for suppression of the hemodynamic and hormonal&#xD;
      responses of cesarean delivery.&#xD;

      Literature Review Regional anesthesia has become the anesthetic of choice for cesarean&#xD;
      section in most countries; however, some women still prefer general anesthesia rather than&#xD;
      regional techniques. There are many published controlled trials for the pharmacological&#xD;
      modifications of the sympathetic response to laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, and surgical&#xD;
      stimulation, including opioids, tenoxicam, ketorolac, lidocaine and paracetamol.1-6 However,&#xD;
      opioid administration to the mother before delivery has adverse neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      depression.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine, a specific [alpha]2-adrenoceptor agonist, has been approved for clinical use&#xD;
      for sedation of patients who need mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. 7 It has&#xD;
      shown sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects after intravenous (IV) administration.8It&#xD;
      is felt that the sedative effect of dexmedetomidine is safe and suited for extubation under&#xD;
      sedation because it has little effect on respiration.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      An older study tested the effects of preoperative administration of dexmedetomidine 10 min&#xD;
      prior to the induction of anesthesia on hemodynamic changes after intubation in 96 women&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. They found that the increase in blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate was significantly less in the higher dexmedetomidine (0.6 µg/kg) group than in the&#xD;
      saline group (P &lt; 0.01). Also, the postintubation increase in heart rate was significantly&#xD;
      less (P &lt; 0.05) with the use of dexmedetomidine 0.6 µg/kg (increase of 18 ± 3 bpm) compared&#xD;
      to fentanyl (increase of 26 ± 3 bpm). In patients receiving dexmedetomidine 0.3 µg/kg, the&#xD;
      increase in blood pressure or heart rate did not differ from those receiving saline.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others found that a single pre-induction intravenous dose of dexmedetomidine 2 µg/kg in 50&#xD;
      patients undergoing minor orthopaedic and general surgery was associated with reduced the&#xD;
      hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and extubation, intra-operative heart rate&#xD;
      variability, postoperative analgesic and anti-emetic requirements and lower peri-operative&#xD;
      serum catecholamine concentrations. However, there were more frequent episodes of hypotension&#xD;
      and bradycardia.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, others reported that preoperative administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 50 patients scheduled for elective minor surgery resulted in progressive&#xD;
      increases in sedation, blunted the haemodynamic responses during laryngoscopy, and reduced&#xD;
      opioid and anaesthetic requirements. 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, others found that a single dose of 0.5 µg/kg dexmedetomidine given before induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia in 40 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 20 to 60 years, who were&#xD;
      scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, decreased thiopental requirements, lower heart rate&#xD;
      values, minimal effects on ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic index (EDI), cardiac index&#xD;
      (CI), and stroke volume index (SVI), or any effect on recovery time.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esmaoglu and co'workers compared the use of midazolam loading dose of 0.05 mg/kg followed by&#xD;
      an infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/h and dexmedetomidine loading dose 1 µg/kg per 20 minutes, followed&#xD;
      by continuous infusion at 0.7 µg/kg/h in 40 women with eclampsia requiring termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy by caesarean delivery in intensive care unit (ICU). They concluded that&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine sedation in eclampsia patients is effective in reducing the demand for&#xD;
      antihypertensive medicine and duration of ICU stay.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the use of dexmedetomidine on neonatal outcome is a very important issue.&#xD;
      Experimental study on acute exposure of rats to dexmedetomidine at the anticipated delivery&#xD;
      time recorded absence of any adverse effects on perinatal morphology of pups, their birth&#xD;
      weight, crown-rump length, physical growth and postnatal behavioural performances.15 Others&#xD;
      studied the transfer of clonidine and dexmedetomidine across the isolated perfused human&#xD;
      placenta. Dexmedetomidine disappeared faster than clonidine from the maternal circulation,&#xD;
      while even less dexmedetomidine was transported into the fetal circulation. This was due to&#xD;
      its greater placental tissue retention, the basis for which probably is the higher&#xD;
      lipophilicity of dexmedetomidine.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many published reports about the safety use of dexmedetomidine in neonates and&#xD;
      infants. Some authors described the successful use of dexmedetomidine as the sole anesthetic&#xD;
      for four infants requiring general anesthesia for direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation with adequate surgical conditions and the hemodynamic and respiratory&#xD;
      profiles.17-18 Others suggested that invasive procedures can be successfully performed in&#xD;
      spontaneously breathing infants and toddlers with congenital heart disease using&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 1-3 µg/kg alone or in combination with low dose ketamine.19Others reported a&#xD;
      case of an infant undergoing endoscopic repair of a laryngeal cleft where the combination of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine and propofol infusions was successfully used as the anesthetic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no FDA-approved usage in children. Despite this fact, there are more than&#xD;
      1,000 pediatric-aged patients reported in the literature who have received dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      for a variety of clinical applications in and out of the operating room. 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there is a published interested case report about the successful use of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg followed with 1 µg/kg/h for 10 minutes before cesarean delivery to&#xD;
      facilitate awake fiberoptic endotracheal intubation patient with spinal muscular atrophy type&#xD;
      III with provided adequate sedation, without respiratory compromise. Although pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data cannot be determined, this case confirms existing in vitro data that dexmedetomidine has&#xD;
      significant placental transfer. Nevertheless, serious neonatal effects were not detected.21&#xD;
      Similarly, others used, i.v. dexmedetomidine successfully as an adjunct to opioid-based PCA&#xD;
      and general anesthesia for the respective provision of labor analgesia and cesarean delivery&#xD;
      anesthesia in a parturient with a tethered spinal cord, with favourable maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcome.22&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an interested editorial report summarized that the practitioners of obstetric&#xD;
      analgesia would probably appreciate an additional agent for the provision of pain relief for&#xD;
      parturients who are unable or unwilling to receive neuraxial block. The role of low-dose&#xD;
      infusion of dexmedetomidine to maintain light sedation and haemodynamic stability with&#xD;
      minimal risk of respiratory depression could be advantageous, especially with proper patient&#xD;
      selection and monitoring. Its effects on the pregnant uterus, utero-placental unit and the&#xD;
      neonate must be rigorously examined.23&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the the preoperative use of different doses of i.v. dexmedetomidine ,&#xD;
      namely 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 µg/kg/h from the preanesthesia period to the postoperative period for&#xD;
      uncomplicated cesarean delivery would reduce the maternal hemodynamic and hormonal responses&#xD;
      to endotracheal intubation, surgical stimulation and extubation with improved quality of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia without harmful neonatal effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research efforts will focus on identifying the effects of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 µg/kg/h&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for uncomplicated cesarean delivery on the followings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hemodynamic [heart rate, systolic and mean blood pressure] changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The perioperative changes in plasma cortisol concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The perioperative changes in plasma catecholamines concentrations, namely, epinephrine&#xD;
           and norepinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The neonatal outcome as regarding Apgar score, the neurologic and adaptive capacity&#xD;
           score (NACS), and umbilical cord venous and arterial blood gases analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The quality of extubation conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The quality of postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The incidence of the major complications (respiratory, cardiovascular events, and&#xD;
           neonatal adverse outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study will be carried out from&#xD;
      at the Maternity Unit - King Fahd University Hospital, after approval of the Local&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phases: The project comprised of five phases as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase I: Literature review collection and writing which will spend 1 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase II: Pilot Study for 1 months to determine the sample size required to detect&#xD;
      significant changes [Alpha error 0.05] in the hemodynamic responses [heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure] to intubation, surgical stimulation and extubation with the preoperative use of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for uncomplicated cesarean delivery to achieve an 85% power for that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase III: (7 months) A. To test the primary effects of the preoperative use of different&#xD;
      doses of dexmedetomidine [0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 µg/kg/h] for uncomplicated cesarean delivery: on&#xD;
      perioperative hemodynamic responses, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine changes B. To&#xD;
      test the secondary outcome variables included; the neonatal outcome as regarding Apgar score,&#xD;
      the neurologic and adaptive capacity score (NACS), and umbilical cord venous and arterial&#xD;
      blood gases analyses, the quality of extubation conditions and postoperative analgesia and&#xD;
      the incidence of the major complications (respiratory, cardiovascular events, and neonatal&#xD;
      adverse outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the DR suite and maternity unit at the King Fahd Hospital of&#xD;
      the University - Al khobar Study period: For 9 months. I. Patient Selection: patients aged&#xD;
      18-60 years (ASA physical status II-III) scheduled for elective in about 80 women (American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I and II), with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies of at&#xD;
      least 36 weeks' gestation, who will receive regional anesthesia and were scheduled for&#xD;
      elective cesarean delivery under general anesthesia. We will exclude women with a history of&#xD;
      cardiac, liver, or kidney diseases; allergy to amide local anesthetics; epilepsy; those&#xD;
      taking cardiovascular medications; and those with pregnancy-induced hypertension, evidence of&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Patient Groups and Study Protocol: All patients will be randomly assigned using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes included the computer generated randomized code into four groups; to receive either&#xD;
      placebo (saline) [group 1], dexmedetomidine [0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 µg/kg/h in groups 2, 3, and 4&#xD;
      respectively, will started 10 minutes before induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Anesthesia and Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parturients will receive oral ranitidine 150 mg on the night before and on the morning of&#xD;
      surgery and 30 mL of 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate 15 min before induction. Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution (500 mL) will infused over 20 min. Left uterine displacement will be maintained&#xD;
      before induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be allocated randomly to two groups,using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization code. The placebo group (n = 20) will receive an i.v. infusion of 0.1 mL/kg/h&#xD;
      saline 0.9%, at 20 min before induction of anesthesia. The dexmedetomidine groups (n = 20 for&#xD;
      each) will receive i.v. infusion of 0.1 mL/kg/h of solution containing 2, 4, and 6 µg/mL of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, at 20 min before induction of anesthesia. The placebo and the&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine solutions will be looked identical and their infusions will be continued&#xD;
      until skin closure, when their infusion rate will be decreased by 50% until 20 min after&#xD;
      extubation. The test solution will be prepared by one anesthesiologist before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Another anesthesiologist, who will be blinded to the study solution, will give&#xD;
      the anesthetic and will perform the assessments. All staff in the operating room will be&#xD;
      unaware of the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal monitoring will include electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, end-tidal sevoflurane and carbon dioxide (EtCO2) concentrations, neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade, and response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) using the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Entropy&#xD;
      Module (M-EntropyTM) (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corporation, Helsinki,&#xD;
      Finland).. After preoxygenation for 5 min, a rapid-sequence induction will be performed with&#xD;
      propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Cricoid pressure will be applied,&#xD;
      laryngoscopy will be performed after the 1-min blood pressure recording, and tracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be completed before the 2-min reading. Anesthesia will be maintained with a&#xD;
      45% of oxygen with 0.5-1 MAC of sevoflurane based on entropy reading where the end-point was&#xD;
      SE 50 and SE-RE difference less than 10. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will be given for muscle&#xD;
      relaxation to maintain suppression of the second twitch using a train-of-four stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The patients'lungs will be ventilated to maintain an EtCO2 of 4-4.6 kPa. After the&#xD;
      umbilical cord will be clamped, infusions of 10 U oxytocin and fentanyl 2 μg/kg will be&#xD;
      given. Sevoflurane will be discontinued and study drug infusion rate will be decreased by 50%&#xD;
      at the start of skin closure. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block will be&#xD;
      antagonized with neostigmine 50 μg/kg and atropine 20 μg/kg, and the trachea will be&#xD;
      extubated. The study drug infusion will be discontinued 20 min after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. The Investigators who will be involved with subsequent postoperative patient assessment&#xD;
      will be blinded of the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Clinical Examination: will include times for induction to delivery (I-D), extubation&#xD;
      (time from discontinuation of sevoflurane to extubation), and spontaneous ventilation (time&#xD;
      between beginning of spontaneous breathing and extubation) will be recorded. The quality of&#xD;
      tracheal extubation will be was evaluated using a 5-point rating scale: 1, no coughing or&#xD;
      straining; 2, very smooth, minimal coughing; 3, moderate coughing; 4, marked coughing or&#xD;
      straining; and 5, poor extubation, very uncomfortable.25 Heart rate and mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) will be recorded before and 15 min after bolus infusion; at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&#xD;
      7, 8, 9, and 10 min after induction; 15 and 30 min after delivery; and 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, and&#xD;
      60 min after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obstetrician will be assessed uterine tone by palpation every 5 min after delivery of the&#xD;
      placenta, using a 10-cm visual analogue score (VAS; 0, well contracted; 10, completely&#xD;
      relaxed). If uterine tone remained unsatisfactory after 3 min, an additional 5-U bolus of&#xD;
      oxytocin will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All neonates will be assessed by a pediatrician unaware of the mothers' randomization. Apgar&#xD;
      scores at 1 and 5 min, and newborns' blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and the neurologic and adaptive capacity score (NACS) will be recorded at 15 min&#xD;
      and at 2 and 24 h after delivery. NACS gives a total score: the maximum is 40, and a score of&#xD;
      35-40 denotes vigor.26 The percentages of infants scoring 35 or less will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of perioperative side effects, including bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, sedation,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, neonatal hypothermia, bradycardia or respiratory depression will be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Blood Biochemistry: will include the neonatal umbilical artery (UA) and umbilical vein&#xD;
      (UV) samples collection from a double-clamped segment of umbilical cord for the measurement&#xD;
      of blood pH, gas tensions, and base excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Samples Collection and Analysis For the hormonal assays: Maternal venous blood samples&#xD;
      (MV) will be collected for assay of cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations,&#xD;
      at five points: preoperatively, immediately after bolus infusion, 5 min after intubation, 1 h&#xD;
      after delivery, and 1 h after continuous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Type of samples: centrifuged stored aliquots of serum at -70°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Laboratory Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Plasma cortisol levels will be determined using a radioimmunoassay technique (Gamma&#xD;
                Coat Cortisol 125IRIA; Nihon Sheering, Chiba, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Plasma catecholamines [epinephrine and norepinephrine] levels will be determined&#xD;
                using a radioimmunoassay technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Statistical Analysis: 1month Statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data will be tested for normality&#xD;
      using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance will be used for&#xD;
      analysis of serial changes in the hemodynamic data at different times after administration of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine . Chi-square test will be used for categorical data. Parametric variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed by one way ANOVA comparisons among the four groups and will be followed by&#xD;
      the post hoc Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA will be performed for intergroup comparisons for the non-parametric hormonal values and&#xD;
      post hoc pairwise comparisons will be done using the Wilcoxon rank sum t test. Data will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean (SD), number (%), or median [range]. A value of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      to represent statistical significance.&#xD;
