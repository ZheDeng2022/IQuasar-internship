    <textblock>
      The goal of this laboratory research study is to see if researchers can predict whose cancer&#xD;
      will stay in remission and whose will return in patients receiving treatment for bladder&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers are looking at markers that they could use to identify - at an&#xD;
      early time point - those patients who might not respond to this treatment. This would allow&#xD;
      researchers to provide future patients with information about their chances of responding to&#xD;
      such treatment. And, with this information, researchers could better counsel those patients&#xD;
      who might benefit from a different therapy at an earlier time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with BCG or BCG plus interferon is currently the most effective nonsurgical&#xD;
      treatment for superficial bladder cancer. However, at this time, there is no reliable test&#xD;
      that can help researchers predict which patients will respond to this therapy. You will be&#xD;
      receiving BCG or BCG plus interferon therapy as planned by your physician. This is a standard&#xD;
      therapy that will be decided by your doctor and based on your disease characteristics. If you&#xD;
      agree to take part in this study, your participation will not affect the treatment you will&#xD;
      receive in any way. Your follow-up and disease monitoring will be done according to standard&#xD;
      routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By participating in this study, you agree to provide researchers with 4 tablespoons (or as&#xD;
      much as you can produce) of urine at the following time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before you start therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Just before and 4 hours after your last treatment (which usually occurs 6 weeks after&#xD;
           start of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Just before and 4 hours after your last treatment of the second course of therapy (which&#xD;
           is usually about 3 months after the beginning of the first course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you will provide researchers with a bladder wash sample. This sample will be&#xD;
      collected during routine catheterization (for your planned treatment) or during your routine&#xD;
      cystoscopic exam. Bladder wash samples will be collected at the following time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before you start therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Just before your last treatment (which usually occurs 6 weeks after start of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At your first routine cystoscopic follow-up (which usually occurs at 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At your second routine cystoscopic follow-up (which usually occurs at 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your follow-up cystoscopies and maintenance therapy will be done according to routine care as&#xD;
      decided by your doctor and are not affected by your participation in this study. You will be&#xD;
      part of the study for about 24 months after beginning the treatments. At the end of that&#xD;
      period, between 23 and 27 months, you will be checked with cystoscopy and cytology to see if&#xD;
      the tumor has come back, as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, information will be collected from your medical chart about other medications&#xD;
      that you are taking and other conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, that you may&#xD;
      have. Information will also be collected about previous treatment that you have had for&#xD;
      bladder cancer as well as other treatments that you may receive during this study. This may&#xD;
      include treatments that are received at an outside health facility. Neither your name nor&#xD;
      your medical record number will be kept with this information. All of the information&#xD;
      collected for this study will be kept in a locked cabinet to which only the researchers have&#xD;
      access. Upon completion of the study, the information sheets will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             carcinoma with an intact bladder&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Grade 1, 2, or 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary disease site must be the urinary bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of tumor invasion of the muscularis propria by cystoscopy and biopsy&#xD;
             within the past 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Gender: Male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy: 24 months or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status: 0 - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biologic therapy: allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy: allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy: no prior pelvic radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery: recovered from prior transurethral resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intravesical Immunotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the treating physician, the patient must be a candidate for&#xD;
             &quot;standard of care&quot; intravesical immunotherapy, defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Induction with 6 weekly treatments of intravesical BCG followed by maintenance&#xD;
                  with 3 weekly treatments of intravesical BCG at 3 months. Continued maintenance&#xD;
                  therapy at 6 months and then every 6 months for total of 36 months (&quot;Lamm&#xD;
                  regimen&quot;) (38) is optional and left to the discretion of the physician or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Induction with 6 weekly treatments of intravesical BCG plus IFN-alfa-2b followed&#xD;
                  by maintenance with 3 weekly treatments of BCG plus IFN-alfa-2b at 3 months.&#xD;
                  Continued maintenance therapy at 9 months, and 15 months (&quot;O'Donnell regimen&quot;)&#xD;
                  (39) is optional and left to the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included in the study based on 'intent to treat'. If, after start of&#xD;
             induction, the treating physician decides to alter the treatment regimen, patients&#xD;
             will still be included for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Special Situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A special situation arises when during the course of the study, a patient develops&#xD;
        recurrent tumor, and is deemed by the treating physician to require either a reinduction&#xD;
        course of BCG therapy or therapy with BCG plus Interferon. In that case, the patient will&#xD;
        remain in the protocol and, since urine cytology/FISH and cytokine responses are dependent&#xD;
        on the treatment time-table, we will start collecting urine samples all over again, as&#xD;
        already described previously in the protocol. Also, starting from the change in the&#xD;
        treatment plan, the patient's overall time in the protocol will be prolonged up to the&#xD;
        completion of a 24-month period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not eligible to receive standard-of-care intravesical immunotherapy&#xD;
             such as&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  histologically confirmed pure squamous cell carcinoma or pure adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients with nonurothelial bladder cancer such as sarcoma, and immunocompromised&#xD;
                  patients&#xD;
