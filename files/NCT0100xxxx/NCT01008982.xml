  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease&#xD;
      characterized by chronic inflammation of salivary and lachrymal glands, frequently&#xD;
      accompanied by systemic symptoms. The presence of various autoantibodies such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor (RF) and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia, reflect B cell&#xD;
      hyperactivity. About five percent of patients with SS develop malignant B cell lymphoma,&#xD;
      usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type and most frequently located in&#xD;
      the major salivary glands. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based intervention therapy&#xD;
      which may influence SS-related chronic inflammation and lymphoproliferation. B cells are&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of SS, and B cell downregulation may lead to a decrease of&#xD;
      disease activity. Patients with more residual exocrine gland function, e.g., those with SS of&#xD;
      shorter duration, might better benefit from systemic therapy, as reported in a preliminary&#xD;
      study on the efficacy of B-cell depletion in SS.This study will examine the effect of the&#xD;
      drug Belimumab in patients with SS. Patients aged more than 18 years with SS may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates will be screened with complete history and physical examination,&#xD;
      chest x-rays, and oral and eye examinations.&#xD;

      A Phase 2, proof of concept, 52 Week Open Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of&#xD;
      Belimumab (HGS1006, LymphoStat-B), a Fully Human Monoclonal Anti-BLyS Antibody, in Subjects&#xD;
      with Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Development Phase: 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 patients will be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the proof of concept of efficacy of belimumab in subjects with SS To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of belimumab in subjects with SS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, proof of concept, 52-week open study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of belimumab in subjects with active SS. In addition to receiving standard stable therapy,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 10 mg/kg belimumab. At week 28, if worsening any patient will exit the&#xD;
      study band considered as a treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease is stable at week 28, and if both the referent clinician and the patient agree&#xD;
      in continuing the study, the study will continue up to week 52 in that patient, since a&#xD;
      delayed response may occur (as shown in systemic lupus erythematosus patients treated with&#xD;
      belimumab: Chathman et al. Arthritis Rheumatism 2008 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a diagnosis of primary SS according to the updated American European Consensus Group&#xD;
      Criteria. In addition, patients must be always positive for anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have the presence, at screening, of Systemic involvement (polysynovitis, skin, renal, lung,&#xD;
      CNS involvement, peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis, autoimmune cytopenia, defined in Annex 1)&#xD;
      or persistent (up to 2 months) parotid, submandibular or lachrymal gland swelling of more&#xD;
      than 2 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective sicca (positive oral and/or ocular tests reported in the American European&#xD;
      Consensus Group Criteria) with at least one among the following biological features of serum&#xD;
      B lymphocyte activation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      increased IgG levels increased free light chain levels of immunoglobulins (according to&#xD;
      central laboratory ranges) increased serum beta2-microglobulin levels decreased C4 levels (C4&#xD;
      levels inferior to central laboratory ranges) monoclonal gammapathy cryoglobulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) SS of more recent onset, i.e., less than 5 years of duration of symptoms, associated with:&#xD;
      i) oral or ocular dryness and ii) fatigue and iii) musculoskeletal pain (i.e, 3 criteria for&#xD;
      response as reported at page (ix-x), characterized by VAS score more than 50/100 in all the 3&#xD;
      fields.&#xD;
