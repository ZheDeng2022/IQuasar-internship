  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new investigational drug called Panobinostat&#xD;
      is safe, tolerable and to obtain an initial assessment of efficacy, when given in combination&#xD;
      with Sorafenib for the treatment of certain types of lung cancer, kidney cancer and soft&#xD;
