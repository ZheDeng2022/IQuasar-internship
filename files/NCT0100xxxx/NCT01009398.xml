  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic operations are known to be painful and requiring an adequate postoperative pain&#xD;
      therapy. A well documented technique to achieve postoperative analgesia is the use of&#xD;
      paravertebral catheters. Theoretically the thoracic paravertebral block results in an&#xD;
      unilateral thoracic anaesthesia. However, in the daily clinical practice it remains unclear&#xD;
      whether catheters are placed correctly into the paravertebral region. The investigators'&#xD;
      experiences with paravertebral catheters suggest that there may be many displacements of&#xD;
      catheters since the pain control is reduced compared to epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective observational clinical trial is to postoperatively evaluate the&#xD;
      exact location of paravertebral catheter placed for thoracoscopic interventions by using the&#xD;
      classical land-mark puncture technique. After radiological detection of the catheter&#xD;
      position, the spread and distribution of contrast dye injected through the catheters will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paravertebral block is a regional anaesthetic technique which can be used for analgesia&#xD;
      after thoracic, cardiac, breast surgery, upper abdominal surgery or for pain therapy.&#xD;
      Thoracic paravertebral blockade is performed by injecting a local anaesthetic solution into&#xD;
      the paravertebral space, which contains the thoracic nerves, their branches and the&#xD;
      sympathetic trunk. This space is a wedge-shaped area sandwiched between the heads and necks&#xD;
      of the ribs. The posterior wall is formed by the superior costo-transverse ligament, the&#xD;
      antero-lateral wall is the parietal pleura with the endothoracic fascia and the medial wall&#xD;
      is the lateral surface of the vertebral body and disc. Also medially, there is communication&#xD;
      with the epidural space via the intervertebral foramen. It has been shown, that each space&#xD;
      communicates inferiorly and superiorly across the heads and necks of the ribs. Thus injecting&#xD;
      local anaesthetic in the paravertebral space should results to an analgesia corresponding to&#xD;
      a unilateral epidural anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unilateral multisegmental anaesthesia after single-shot paravertebral injection of local&#xD;
      anaesthetics is well established. On the other hand, a variety of different studies on&#xD;
      volunteers, patients and cadavers showed conflicting results regarding the vertical spread&#xD;
      over several adjacent segments after paravertebral injection leading to the recommendation of&#xD;
      some authors to use a multi-injection technique to achieve a multilevel somatic nerve&#xD;
      blockade, specially described during breast surgery using paravertebral block alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can we explain these different contradictory reports and recommendations? Available&#xD;
      radiologic and anatomic studies show many different patterns of contrast dye spread after&#xD;
      single shot paravertebral contrast dye injection. One study even reports different&#xD;
      distribution of dye even after several paravertebral single shots of the same operator in the&#xD;
      same patient. Some radiological studies report cloud-like contrast dye accumulation without&#xD;
      significant cranio-caudal spread. This could be due to the restricted intercostal spread or&#xD;
      to subpleural spread or even to injection of the contrast dye into the autochthonic muscles&#xD;
      of the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spread of local anesthetics (or contrast dye as substitute) is affected by nuances of&#xD;
      differences in the needle placement because of the fine membranes like the endothoracica&#xD;
      fascia. This might be the major problem during the insertion of catheters. The final location&#xD;
      of catheter tip is hard to predict. Catheters might dissect during the insertion and possibly&#xD;
      the difference is only a more medial or more lateral puncture. The placement of catheters&#xD;
      into the paravertebral space leading to a clear cranio-caudal spread of local anaesthetics&#xD;
      resulting in multisegmental spread of anaesthesia is the goal of a catheter for paravertebral&#xD;
      analgesia but it seems not easy to be achieved - despite of an uncontestable clinical benefit&#xD;
      of paravertebral catheters for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies describing the exact emplacement of catheters, distribution of contrast dye and&#xD;
      correlation of this distribution with the clinical effect after catheter placement by the&#xD;
      classical land-mark based approach as described by Eason and Wyatt are lacking. We therefore&#xD;
      aim to describe the different possible emplacements of the catheters, the resulting spread of&#xD;
      contrast dye after injection through the catheters as well as the corresponding area of&#xD;
      somatic and sympathetic block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of prospective observational clinical trial is to evaluate the exact location of&#xD;
      paravertebral catheter placed for thoracoscopic interventions using the classic landmark&#xD;
      approach by injecting a small amount of contrast dye (1 ml) through the catheter and&#xD;
      subsequent fluoroscopic documentation of the catheter tip localisation. Thereafter a larger&#xD;
      amount (20 ml) of diluted contrast dye will be injected and its spread will be documented&#xD;
      fluoroscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the paravertebral catheter is placed as usual after the end of surgery, 1 ml of contrast&#xD;
      dye will be injected through the catheter. After fluoroscopic documentation of the catheter&#xD;
      tip, further 10 ml of diluted contrast dye will be injected and its spread again documented&#xD;
      fluoroscopically in two planes. All saved pictures, showing the catheter tip position and the&#xD;
      contrast dye spread, will be evaluated subsequently by an independent radiologist. After&#xD;
      these fluoroscopic examinations a test dose of Bupivacaine 0.25% mixed with Adrenaline 5&#xD;
      mcg/ml of 3ml will be injected through the catheter followed by an injection of 0.3ml/kg of&#xD;
      local anaesthetics (Bupivacaine 0.25% mixed with Adrenaline 5 mcg/ml). One hour later a&#xD;
      clinical testing of the skin area with somatic and sympathetic block provided through the&#xD;
      paravertebral catheters will be performed and the data recorded.&#xD;
