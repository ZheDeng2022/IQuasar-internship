      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one&#xD;
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of combination chemotherapy and to&#xD;
      see how well it works in treating adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of a high-risk pediatric treatment&#xD;
           regimen in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relative toxicity of pegaspargase IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relative efficacy and toxicity of adding imatinib mesylate to multi-agent&#xD;
           chemotherapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the complete remission (CR) rate at the end of induction therapy and&#xD;
           calculate the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from achieving a CR to&#xD;
           the first disease recurrence or death, of a subset of patients who achieve a CR at the&#xD;
           end of induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS), defined as the time from study entry to death&#xD;
           from any cause, of all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the median, 2-year, and 3-year DFS and OS rates and their corresponding 95%&#xD;
           CI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prognostic significance of the prednisone prophase response, minimal&#xD;
           residual disease at various time points, the frequency and type of tyrosine kinase&#xD;
           mutations, and gene expression profiles at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steroid prophase therapy (for patients who have not received steroids within the past 7&#xD;
           days): Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 0 or 1 and&#xD;
           methylprednisolone IV 3 times daily on days 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy (weeks 1-4): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 4, 11,&#xD;
           18, and 25; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 4 and 5; methotrexate IV on day 6;&#xD;
           pegaspargase IV over 1 hour on day 7; and prednisone or prednisolone orally 2-3 times&#xD;
           daily or methylprednisolone IV 3 times daily on days 4-32. Patients also receive&#xD;
           methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone IT on day 18 and methotrexate IT on day 32.&#xD;
           After completion of induction therapy, patients with documented complete remission (CR)&#xD;
           proceed to consolidation IA therapy (group A). Patients with partial remission proceed&#xD;
           to consolidation IC therapy (group B). Patients with refractory disease are removed from&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation I therapy (weeks 5-13): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according&#xD;
           to their CR status.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A (patients who achieved CR by day 32 or patients with delayed recovery):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IA therapy (weeks 5-7): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV,&#xD;
                     doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, methotrexate IT, and high-dose methotrexate IV&#xD;
                     on day 1. Patients also receive oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14.&#xD;
                     Patients then proceed to consolidation IB therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IB therapy (weeks 8-10): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
                     over 1 hour and methotrexate IT on day 1, low-dose cytarabine IV or&#xD;
                     subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-5 and 9-12, and oral mercaptopurine once daily&#xD;
                     on days 1-14. Patients then proceed to consolidation IC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IC therapy (weeks 11-13): Patients receive high-dose cytarabine&#xD;
                     IV over 3 hours twice daily on days 1 and 2, etoposide phosphate IV over 2&#xD;
                     hours on days 3-5, and oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-5. Patients&#xD;
                     also receive pegaspargase IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks beginning on day 8 and&#xD;
                     continuing during CNS therapy and consolidation II therapy until a total of 15&#xD;
                     doses are administered. After completion of consolidation IC therapy, patients&#xD;
                     proceed to CNS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B (patients who failed to enter a CR after 32 days of multi-agent induction&#xD;
                chemotherapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IC therapy (weeks 5-7): Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV&#xD;
                     over 3 hours twice daily on days 1 and 2, etoposide phosphate IV over 2 hours&#xD;
                     on days 3-5, and oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-5. Patients who&#xD;
                     achieve CR at the end of consolidation IC therapy proceed to consolidation IA&#xD;
                     therapy. Patients with &gt; 5% blast count at the end of consolidation IC therapy&#xD;
                     are removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IA therapy (weeks 8-10): Patients receive vincristine sulfate&#xD;
                     IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, methotrexate IT, and high-dose methotrexate&#xD;
                     IV on day 1. Patients also receive oral mercaptopurine once daily on days&#xD;
                     1-14. Patients then proceed to consolidation IB therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consolidation IB therapy (weeks 11-13): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
                     over 1 hour and methotrexate IT on day 1, low-dose cytarabine IV or SC on days&#xD;
                     2-5 and 9-12, and oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14. Patients also&#xD;
                     receive pegaspargase IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks beginning on day 8 and&#xD;
                     continuing during CNS therapy and consolidation II therapy until a total of 15&#xD;
                     doses are administered. After completion of consolidation IB therapy, patients&#xD;
                     proceed to CNS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CNS therapy (weeks 14-16): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV and doxorubicin&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV on day 1, oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14, oral&#xD;
           dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-5, and pegaspargase as described in consolidation I&#xD;
           therapy. Patients also receive methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone IT twice&#xD;
           weekly for 4 doses and undergo cranial irradiation once daily for 8-10 days. After&#xD;
           completion of CNS therapy, patients proceed to consolidation II therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation II therapy (weeks 17-43): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV and&#xD;
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1, oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14, oral&#xD;
           dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-5, and pegaspargase as described in consolidation I&#xD;
           therapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until patients have received a cumulative&#xD;
           dosage of 300 mg/m^2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride and 30 post-remission weeks of&#xD;
           pegaspargase have been administered. When patients complete doxorubicin hydrochloride,&#xD;
           they receive methotrexate IV once weekly (except on the week that they receive&#xD;
           methotrexate IT). Patients also receive methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone IT&#xD;
           every 18 weeks (first dose is given 18 weeks after the first lumbar puncture&#xD;
           administered during CNS therapy). After completion of consolidation II therapy, patients&#xD;
           proceed to continuation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuation therapy (weeks 44-113): Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on day 1;&#xD;
           methotrexate IV on days 1, 8, and 15; oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14; and&#xD;
           oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total&#xD;
           of 104 weeks (24 months) of continued CR. Patients also receive methotrexate,&#xD;
           cytarabine, and hydrocortisone IT every 18 weeks. Patients do not receive methotrexate&#xD;
           IV on the week that they receive methotrexate IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease or with bcr-abl translocation on&#xD;
      molecular studies also receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily beginning on day 14 of&#xD;
      induction therapy and continuing until completion of continuation therapy. These patients&#xD;
      should proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation as soon as feasible based on donor&#xD;
      availability and the patient's medical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow, peripheral blood, and other samples are collected periodically for research&#xD;
      studies (including minimal residual disease analysis, gene expression profiling, and tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months, every 2&#xD;
      months for 6 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
