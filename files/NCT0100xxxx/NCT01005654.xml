      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endocrine neoplasms (tumors) are among the fastest growing tumors in incidence in the&#xD;
           United States. Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish between benign or&#xD;
           malignant tumors in cancers of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland, and pancreas.&#xD;
           More research is needed to improve detection and treatment options for patients who&#xD;
           develop these kinds of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in studying the molecular changes that are involved in&#xD;
           endocrine cancer development and growth. To collect a sample of tumor specimens and&#xD;
           healthy tissue for further study, researchers are specifically looking for samples from&#xD;
           patients who are scheduled for surgery or biopsy on endocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect samples of precancerous, cancerous, and healthy tissue from individuals who are&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery or biopsy of endocrine system tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have a tumor in or around their thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland,&#xD;
      pancreas, or any neuroendocrine tissue, and are scheduled for surgery at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in this study will provide blood and urine samples prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the surgery or biopsy, pieces of the tumor or precancerous growth and pieces of&#xD;
           normal tissue near to the tumor will be removed for ongoing and future research. The&#xD;
           rest of the tumor or growth will be sent for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After surgery, participants will receive routine care until discharge, and doctors will&#xD;
           discuss possible treatment options. If there is an appropriate NIH protocol,&#xD;
           participants may choose to be treated at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After discharge, participants will return to the clinic for a routine postoperative&#xD;
           check about 6 weeks following the operation, and then may be followed yearly at the&#xD;
           Clinical Center or by phone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine neoplasms are among the fastest growing tumors in incidence in the United States.&#xD;
      Between 1995 and 2005, the incidence of thyroid carcinoma has increased 98 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal gland and gastrointestinal-pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors are among some of the most difficult tumors to clinically and&#xD;
      histopathological distinguish as benign or malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, endocrine neoplasms provide an extremely important model for studying the important&#xD;
      molecular changes that lead to carcinogenesis because of their diverse clinical behavior,&#xD;
      even when having the same TNM stage and histologic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surgical Oncology Program (formerly known as Endocrine Oncology Branch), NCI has a focus&#xD;
      on studying the molecular changes that are involved in endocrine cancer initiation and&#xD;
      progression. In addition, this section has primary responsibility for providing endocrine&#xD;
      surgery consultative services to the NIH. As such, we are uniquely positioned to acquire and&#xD;
      perform important studies to help identify diagnostic and predictive markers as well as&#xD;
      therapeutic targets that may have significant clinical ramifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic, and proteomic profile of endocrine neoplasm&#xD;
      that will allow us to distinguish benign from malignant tumor for each of the endocrine&#xD;
      histologies under study. This objective will drive the statistical endpoints of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with radiographic evidence of, biochemical evidence of, or&#xD;
      histologically/cytologically proven, endocrine neoplasms, including lesions of the thyroid,&#xD;
      parathyroid, adrenal, extra-adrenal endocrine nests, paragangliomas, neuroblastomas, pancreas&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal tract. Or patients with a described pre or potentially malignant&#xD;
      condition that requires surgery or biopsy as a part of the standard of care treatment and/or&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable limits by&#xD;
      standard of practice guidelines prior to biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of surgical&#xD;
      operation for the removal of neoplasms of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas,&#xD;
      paragangliomas and/or extra adrenal nests of neuroendocrine tissue, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of surgical operation, blood samples will be obtained from the operative field&#xD;
      during the removal of neoplasms of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas,&#xD;
      paragangliomas and/or extra adrenal neuroendocrine tissue and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational therapy will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that 1,900 patients will be enrolled over a period of 16 years.&#xD;
