    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate of combination pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) (Alimta) and&#xD;
      carboplatin (Paraplatin) in recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression free interval, overall survival, and adverse effects among&#xD;
      patients receiving this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 8-15 minutes and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is overall response rate defined by proportion of patients achieving complete response, partial response based on RECIST V1.1 or Rustin's criteria as appropriate.&#xD;
Based on RECIST V1.1 for targeting lesions from CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD; Overall response CR + PR.&#xD;
Based on Rustin's criteria, a response to ca125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in ca125 level from a pretreatment sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days.</description>

          <description>The stage reported here for the patients enrolled was the stage at their initial diagnosis. Surgical staging was performed primarily for the patients. Patients with stage I/II disease had tumor spread that was confined to the pelvis. Patients with stage III/IV disease had tumor spread to the upper abdomen, retroperitoneum, or other distant organs including lung and liver. Grade 1 tumor cells resemble normal cells the most. Grade 3 tumor cells looked most abnormal and tend to have more mitosis and spread most aggressively.</description>

      <time_frame>The median exposure to combination pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy was 18.9 weeks (range: 3-37.9 weeks). The safety population included all patients who received one cycle of chemotherapy and was included in the analysis of safety data.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were graded on a scale of 1 to 4, for unfavorable medical occurrences in a participant whether or not considered related to the participant's participation in the research. The types of toxicities evaluated consisted of &quot;hematologic&quot; versus &quot;non-hematologic.&quot; Treatment related deaths were recorded separately from all-cause mortality cases. Frequency of adverse events are calculated based on the total number of events divided by the total number of chemotherapy cycles given.</desc>
