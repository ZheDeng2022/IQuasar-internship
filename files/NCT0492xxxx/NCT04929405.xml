  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental bereavement experiences are unique and require interventions adaptable to individual&#xD;
      experiences.The web-based, multi-modal intervention, labeled ADAPT, incorporates varied&#xD;
      self-management strategies including: A: Asking for assistance (option to connect with&#xD;
      child's healthcare team); DA: Developing Adaptive ability (self-management tools: e.g. stress&#xD;
      reduction, legacy building); P: Accessing Pertinent online resources (grief support&#xD;
      networks/websites); and T: Tracking one's health (self-administered surveys for grief, sleep,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression). A quasi-experimental, treatment-only design will be used for this&#xD;
      study. The hypothesis is that the ADAPT intervention will promote positive adaptation to&#xD;
      influence grief integration and consequently affect health outcomes (improved sleep and&#xD;
      social interactions, and decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms).The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to describe the nature and degree of clinical benefit of the intervention on bereaved&#xD;
      parents' health outcomes.&#xD;

      ADAPT, is multi-modal intervention that promotes a targeted approach to individual parental&#xD;
      bereavement experiences. ADAPT is based on the theoretical foundations of the Adaptive&#xD;
      Leadership (AL) framework. ADAPT, incorporates varied self-management strategies including:&#xD;
      A: Asking for assistance (option to connect with child's healthcare team); DA: Developing&#xD;
      Adaptive ability (self-management tools: e.g. stress reduction, legacy building); P:&#xD;
      Accessing Pertinent online resources (grief support networks/websites); and T: Tracking one's&#xD;
      health (self-administered surveys for grief, sleep, anxiety, and depression). Parents can&#xD;
      download ADAPT on any digital device (phones/computers) using weblink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Purpose and Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to describe the nature and degree of clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      intervention on bereaved parents' health outcomes. The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the ADAPT intervention components.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be assessed with a modified standardized acceptability survey and&#xD;
      cognitive interviews. Feasibility will be assessed by accrual (recruitment), attrition, and&#xD;
      intervention engagement (i.e., frequency, duration, and interaction). Intervention engagement&#xD;
      data will be obtained via Google analytics and cognitive interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: ADAPT is acceptable to participants (&gt; 80% acceptability based on survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Delivery of ADAPT is feasible in terms of accrual (N=30), attrition (15%),&#xD;
      and intervention engagement (minimally accessed 3 times for &gt;15 minutes and used at least 2&#xD;
      self-management strategies) Aim 2: Determine if the use of the ADAPT intervention components&#xD;
      results in a clinically meaningful change in grief integration (Brief Grief Questionnaire)&#xD;
      and bereaved parents' health outcomes (Visual Analogue Scale for overall health and PROMIS&#xD;
      surveys for sleep, social isolation, anxiety, and depression). Hypothesis 2.1: After&#xD;
      completing the ADAPT intervention, participants will demonstrate improvement in health&#xD;
      outcome scores when compared to baseline (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: quasi-experimental, treatment-only design. Sample: N=35 parents of children who have&#xD;
      died while being followed for care at either Akron Children's Hospital or Cardinal Glennon&#xD;
      Children's hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited into two groups. Group 1 will be parents whose&#xD;
      child died 4 weeks (+ 2 weeks) prior; Group 2 will be parents whose child died three months&#xD;
      (+/- 2 weeks) prior to enrollment. Either a mother or a father for any one child will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the groups, a Study Information Sheet will be included in each bereavement packet&#xD;
      sent or mailed home, at either 4 week (group 1) or 3 months (group 2) after the child has&#xD;
      died. This Study Information Sheet will have a study-specific phone number and email address&#xD;
      for a clinical research coordinator, through which the parent can immediately opt in or opt&#xD;
      out. If there is no response following one to two weeks after the bereavement packet was&#xD;
      sent, the bereaved parents will be contacted by study staff via telephone to assess interest,&#xD;
      discuss the study, and answer any questions they may have. If the parent agrees to&#xD;
      participate, econsent will be completed using REDCap. After completing the econsent,&#xD;
      participants will have access to ADAPT and will be provided a REDCap survey link to allow&#xD;
      self-completion of baseline questionnaires (T0) (see Table 1). Three months after completing&#xD;
      the intervention (T1), participants will again be provided a REDCap survey link to&#xD;
      post-intervention questionnaires (see Table.1). At that time, a semi-structured cognitive&#xD;
      interview with participants will be scheduled. The interviews will be conducted via telephone&#xD;
      and will be recorded, transcribed, and verified for accuracy by the study team.&#xD;
