  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The compassionate use programme will give participants concizumab for free, even though it is&#xD;
      not yet approved by health authorities. This is because participants need this medicine to&#xD;
      treat their haemophilia properly. The programme will check that participants are safe and&#xD;
      that the medicine works for them. The programme may last for years. Participants will take&#xD;
      one injection under their skin every day. Participants will have 4-5 visits with the study&#xD;
      doctor for the first half year. After that they will have 1 visit every half year. At all&#xD;
      clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. Participants will fill in a diary&#xD;
      between the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient is considered to have completed the programme when any of the following criteria&#xD;
      occurred first: 1) when the patient is included in a clinical trial with concizumab or 2) up&#xD;
      to 6 months after concizumab is commercially available in the patient's country and approved&#xD;
      for the patient (The time span of 6 months should provide ample time for the patient to&#xD;
      obtain concizumab commercially) or 3) the sponsor decides to discontinue concizumab clinical&#xD;
      development for the patient's population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent obtained before any programme-related activities. Programme-related&#xD;
             activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with congenital haemophilia:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. severe haemophilia A (coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) less than 1%) or&#xD;
                  moderate/severe haemophilia B (coagulation factor IX (FIX) less than or equal to&#xD;
                  2%) without inhibitors or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. any haemophilia severity with documented history of inhibitors (more than or&#xD;
                  equal to 0.6 bethesda unit (BU)) who cannot be treated satisfactorily with&#xD;
                  authorised and marketed medicines (example: due to inhibitors or allergic&#xD;
                  reactions to factor-containing products, or due to poor venous access), and who&#xD;
                  are not able to enrol in clinical trials designed to support the development and&#xD;
                  registration of concizumab medicines (example: due to inhibitors or allergic&#xD;
                  reactions to factor-containing products, or due to poor venous access) as per&#xD;
                  investigator and Novo Nordisk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The potential benefit for the individual patient justifies the potential risks of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to investigational medicinal product or related&#xD;
             products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition (current or medical history), which in the investigator's or Novo&#xD;
             Nordisk's opinion might jeopardise patient's safety or compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
