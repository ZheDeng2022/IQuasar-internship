  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a state of multiple organ dysfunction caused by a generalized immune-inflammatory&#xD;
      response of the body to an infectious agent, with pronounced heterogeneity and&#xD;
      interchangeability of clinical and laboratory manifestations. Violation of autoregulation and&#xD;
      multiple organ dysfunctions in case of not timely started and / or ineffective therapy lead&#xD;
      to the development of multiple organ failure and thanatogenesis in 40-90% of cases. At the&#xD;
      moment, there is no standardized approach to the treatment of the entire pool of sepsis&#xD;
      patients. Pharmacological effects on receptors for interleukins and endotoxin, antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy and immunoprotection do not allow taking the process under complete control. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis and clinical diversity of manifestations dictates the need for a personalized&#xD;
      approach based on identifying a group of patients with homogeneous characteristics and the&#xD;
      course of the process, where one or another technique would have the greatest benefit. The&#xD;
      choice of tactics for extracorporeal therapy should be based on early support of organ&#xD;
      function and consistent elimination of high concentrations of trigger compounds (endotoxin,&#xD;
      other metabolic products of microorganisms and products of cytolysis of a macroorganism), as&#xD;
      well as aimed at minimizing the loss of proteins and immune complexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the selective&#xD;
      adsorption of endotoxin in patients with severe multiple organ dysfunction after complicated&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PMX versus SS (polymyxin B versus septic shock) is a single-center, historic, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of polymyxin B columns (PMX 20R, Toray)&#xD;
      in adult patients with severe endotoxemia for the prevention and correction of septic shock&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. All patients must sign an informed consent prior to surgery. The study&#xD;
      group will be represented by patients with severe multiple organ dysfunction (SOFA ≥5 points,&#xD;
      PCT&gt; 2 ng / ml; CRP&gt; 150 ng / ml, vasopressor use, intestinal paresis and / or positive blood&#xD;
      culture data) and endotoxin activity level on the test EAA is higher than 0.6. Patients by&#xD;
      outcome will be divided into 2 groups according to the EAA test values: values from 0.6 to&#xD;
      0.89 (group A) and 0.9 and above (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the presence of renal failure in such patients, hemoperfusion will be performed in&#xD;
      combination with the oXiris (Baxter) kit on the Prismaflex (Baxter) apparatus (PMX20R - 12&#xD;
      hours; oXiris - 72 hours). The effectiveness of PMX will be assessed based on the decrease in&#xD;
      the EAA value below 0.6 12 hours after the end of the hemoperfusion session. If EAA2 is&#xD;
      greater than 0.6 PMX will reconnect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • For patients with a baseline EAA1 value greater than 0.9, PMX reuse is included in the&#xD;
      study protocol and performed 12 hours after the first set is turned off. The EAA3 test runs&#xD;
      12 hours after the PMX2 is turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of hemoperfusion will be assessed based on the presence of side effects&#xD;
      (progression of signs of hemodynamic impairment) during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of 10 patients (historical randomization without endotoxemia&#xD;
      assessment) with septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction (SOFA ≥5, use of vasopressors)&#xD;
      using the Oxyris universal renal replacement therapy kit for 72 hours. The comparison group&#xD;
      will be formed by the matching method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the following will be assessed: the length of stay in the intensive care unit,&#xD;
      mortality on the 14th and 28th days after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also planned to assess the dynamics of changes in the immunological status (cellular&#xD;
      and humoral immunity) and microbiota metabolism (the level of aromatic microbial metabolites)&#xD;
      during hemoperfusion.&#xD;
