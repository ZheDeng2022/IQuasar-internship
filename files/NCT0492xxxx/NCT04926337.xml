  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies investigating apnoea oxygenation has shown that delivering oxygen via a high&#xD;
      flow can maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels in a patient for over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been demonstrated, in several studies, that High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)&#xD;
      used during preoxygenation in patients undergoing emergency surgery is at least equally&#xD;
      effective as preoxygenation with standard tight fitting mask. Data from these recent studies&#xD;
      investigating arterial oxygen saturation levels during rapid sequence induction anaesthesia&#xD;
      have not been able to detect any difference between the two methods. The mean apnea time&#xD;
      among the patients in the previous studies have been relatively short.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering traumatic injuries could be more prone to desaturate during prolonged&#xD;
      apnea due to being hemodynamic unstable or suffering injuries to the respiratory tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, the aim is now to conduct a trial where trauma patients are preoxygenated&#xD;
      with high flow nasal oxygen before anaesthetised with rapid sequence induction (RSI)&#xD;
      technique. The trial is set to be a before-and-after study. During approximately 6 to 9&#xD;
      months data will be registered from trauma patients undergoing emergency anaesthesia where&#xD;
      preoxygenation is performed according to standard rutin, with traditional facemask. During&#xD;
      the coming six to nine months trauma patients undergoing emergency anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      preoxygenated with high flow nasal oxygen. Data will be registered and compared to the data&#xD;
      collected from the patients preoxygenated with facemark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general purpose of this project is to compare the preoxygenation technique based on HFNO&#xD;
      with traditional preoxygenation with a tight fitting mask, with the main focus being oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels, during rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation in trauma patients in&#xD;
      need of immediate anaesthesia.&#xD;
