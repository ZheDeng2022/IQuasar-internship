  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II clinical trial that studies the effect of&#xD;
      reduced dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery in treating patients with human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) caused throat cancer. Giving reduced dose radiation therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy after surgery may improve quality of life compared with standard of care primary&#xD;
      chemoradiation approach without compromising survival.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure swallowing function and disease specific quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer treated with transoral surgery and reduced intensity adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine kinetics of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in patients treated&#xD;
      with transoral surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate local control, progression free and overall survival using transoral surgery&#xD;
      and reduced intensity adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Based on pathologic findings after standard of care transoral surgery, patients are&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (LOW RISK): Patients whose small tumor was removed completely and have only one lymph&#xD;
      node involved will undergo clinical observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (MEDIUM RISK): Patients whose tumor was removed completely but has certain features&#xD;
      that make it more likely to come back such as growth around the nerves or into the vessels,&#xD;
      or has more than one lymph nodes involved, will undergo external body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (EBRT) for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III (HIGH RISK): Patients whose tumor has a &quot;positive margin&quot;, which means the tumor&#xD;
      could not be removed with healthy tissue around it or tumor grows significantly outside the&#xD;
      lymph node will undergo EBRT for 6 weeks and receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) weekly for&#xD;
      6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>University of Washington Questionnaire is a 15 item quality of life instrument specifically designed for head and neck cancer patients.

    <description>Euro-QOL 5 dimension scale is a generic quality of life and cost utility instrument widely used and validated for multiple disease settings, including head and neck cancer.&#xD;
Euro-QOL 5 dimension scale is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
