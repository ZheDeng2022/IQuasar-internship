        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             colon (high rectal cancer is eligible if resected and no radiation needed). Other&#xD;
             histologies which are treated per NCCN guidelines for adjuvant colon cancer are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer eligible for adjuvant doublet&#xD;
             chemotherapy for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have ctDNA positive assay (tested by Signatera MRD assay) after 3 months of&#xD;
             adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Performance status: ECOG performance status ≤2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. leukocytesL ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. absolute neutrophil count: ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. platelets: ≥ 80,000/mcl&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT): ≤ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal or ≤ 5 X if liver&#xD;
                  metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. creatinine: &lt;1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The effects of TAS-102 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;

             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion&#xD;
             of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Ability to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;

             within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia must have&#xD;
             resolved to grade 1 or baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with known metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to TAS-102, irinotecan or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior treatment with irinotecan or TAS-102.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or curatively treated cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures as judged by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities&#xD;
