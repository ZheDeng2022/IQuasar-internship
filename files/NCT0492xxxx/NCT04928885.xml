  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 11% of the U.S. older adult population is at risk for or suffers from subjective&#xD;
      cognitive decline. While some factors such as genetics and habitual physiological changes&#xD;
      that affect brain health cannot be changed, research has shown that lifestyle changes such as&#xD;
      participation in regular physical activity, staying socially engaged, and managing stress and&#xD;
      diet can help to delay or reduce cognitive decline. Yet few brain health promotion programs&#xD;
      exist and those that do fail to focus on global health and wellness as a strategy to improve&#xD;
      brain health. Wits Workout is a holistic, 12-session, 60-minute per session, multi-modal&#xD;
      workshop series that offers adults ages 50 and older facilitated, interactive dialogue and&#xD;
      activities about behaviors that promote brain health. Each week includes a different themed&#xD;
      module which has four activities and a training component.&#xD;

      While research has shown that lifestyle changes such as participation in regular physical&#xD;
      activity, staying socially engaged, and managing stress can help to delay or reduce cognitive&#xD;
      decline, few cognitive brain health programs exist. Those that do are targeted to a specific&#xD;
      audience (i.e., Alzheimer's and related dementias) and primarily focus on one health domain&#xD;
      (i.e. physical activity, diet) without the additional focus on multi-dimensions of health,&#xD;
      which can also include intellectual engagement, social isolation, stress, sleep, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy. Thus, there is a need for a more holistic cognitive health program aimed&#xD;
      toward the general older adult population and particularly those that are underserved due to&#xD;
      geographic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wits Workout, is a multi-modal 12-session (60 min/week) workshop series designed to enhance&#xD;
      brain health among people ages 50 and older. Wits Workout addresses multiple factors that&#xD;
      affect cognitive health such as physical activity, diet, intellectual engagement, social&#xD;
      isolation, stress, sleep, and self-efficacy. The holistic workshop series is designed to be&#xD;
      lay-leader led, interactive, and experiential. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that this&#xD;
      educational series serves a need in reducing isolation, increasing physical activity,&#xD;
      promoting intellectual engagement, and enhancing overall brain health in older participants,&#xD;
      all of which complement current aging brain health research. The researchers propose to&#xD;
      conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a treatment (workshop) group (n=120) and&#xD;
      wait-list control group (n=120) who will receive the program after the 6-month study period&#xD;
      is completed.&#xD;

    <description>The PROMIS Cognitive Function measure used to measure cognitive functioning. Raw score is converted into the T-score, with 50 being the mean score. 10 T-score is one standard deviation. Therefore, score above 50 means that a person is better than the average population in mental ability, and lower score meaning worse or disability. The score changing over time can indicate decline in cognitive function (lower score) or improved cognitive function (higher score) or no decline or improvement (same score).</description>
