  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the global preventive efforts (physical distancing, face, mask, travel constraints,&#xD;
      and quarantine) to contain the infection, COVID-19 is continuing with its devastating&#xD;
      consequences on health, life, and economics. The world's hopes are attached to a successful&#xD;
      preventive measure that is the vaccination which has proved its capability to stop infections&#xD;
      and save lives over the years. World Health Organization (WHO) declared vaccination hesitancy&#xD;
      as one of the top 10 obstacles for global health. Multicentric study involved Arab countries&#xD;
      measure hesitancy of HCWs toward vaccine, it reported the highest rates of hesitancy were&#xD;
      among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and&#xD;
      Algeria). This study aims to evaluate the attitude and the determinants of this attitude of&#xD;
      HCWs towards receiving or refusing to have their first dose of vaccination.&#xD;
