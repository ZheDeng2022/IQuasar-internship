  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Run-in safety study, to determine the safety of co-administration of irinotecan, raloxifene,&#xD;
      and Xiao Chai Hu Tang (XCHT), and to optimize the blood collection time points for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study for another randomized control trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two cohorts with a total of 24 patients in this study. Cohort A will enroll 6&#xD;
      naïve postmenopausal female patients who have never received irinotecan treatment before.&#xD;
      Patients in this group will have 4 rounds of studies following different protocol to&#xD;
      determine (1) the impact of XCHT on raloxifene PK (Round 0, co-administration of XCHT and&#xD;
      raloxifene); (2) the impact of XCHT on irinotecan PK (Round 1, co-administration of XCHT and&#xD;
      standard FOLFIRI); (3) the safety of co- administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and FOLFIRI and&#xD;
      evaluation of raloxifene as a probe for XCHT treatment to prevent irinotecan-induced severe&#xD;
      delayed-onset diarrhea (Round 2 and 3, co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and standard&#xD;
      FOLFIRI). The reason to recruit postmenopausal women is that these patients usually take&#xD;
      raloxifene to prevent osteoporosis and the risk of raloxifene is expected to be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will recruit 18 patients who were treated with irinotecan previously and have at&#xD;
      least one diarrhea episode with a severity of ≥grade 2. The reason we propose to recruit&#xD;
      patients who had diarrhea induced by irinotecan is that these patients are supposed to be&#xD;
      sensitive to irinotecan so that we can determine the PK changes and safety. Patients in this&#xD;
      group will have 3 rounds of FOLFIRI chemotherapy to determine (1) the impact of FOLFIRI on&#xD;
      raloxifene PK (Round 1, co-administration of FOLFIRI with raloxifene); (2) the complete PK&#xD;
      profile of SN-38, SN-38G, raloxifene, raloxifene-glucuronide, and XCHT components (Round 2,&#xD;
      co- administration of FOLFIRI with XCHT and raloxifene); and (3) the safety of&#xD;
      co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene, and FOLFIRI in sensitive patients and evaluation of&#xD;
      raloxifene as a probe for XCHT treatment to prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea (Round 3,&#xD;
      co-administration of XCHT, raloxifene and standard FOLFIRI).&#xD;
