    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to objectively describe and test the consistency and&#xD;
      reproducibility of instrument-assisted soft tissue manipulation (IASTM).The specific aims of&#xD;
      this current study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze IASTM stroke patterns using objective metrics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the consistency of force application, with and without visual monitoring of&#xD;
           objective metrics, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the reliability of dynamic pressure pain threshold assessment. The ultimate&#xD;
           goal of this continuing line of research is to improve soft tissue manual therapy&#xD;
           practice in research, education, and clinic for use as a non-invasive modality in soft&#xD;
           tissue assessment and treatment. Results from this protocol will inform future clinical&#xD;
           trials, including studies exploring the effects of different IASTM dose-loads in various&#xD;
           musculoskeletal pain conditions.&#xD;

      This is a single-site study consisting of three study phases. Phase I will observe and&#xD;
      analyze clinician's application of instrument-assisted soft tissue manipulation (IASTM) as a&#xD;
      means to identify signature profiles for the stroke rate, angle, and direction that are&#xD;
      characteristic of basic (e.g., linear, curved) stroke patterns. Phase II will assess the&#xD;
      consistency of IASTM force application. Phase III will assess the reliability of dynamic&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold assessment. Clinician participants (Phase I) will attend one study&#xD;
      visit consisting of basic linear and curved IASTM stroke pattern applications and complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire. Total study duration for clinician participants will be 90 minutes.&#xD;
      Non-clinician subjects will attend two study visits (Phase II) or one study visit (Phase&#xD;
      III). Visits will consist of completion of questionnaires, application of IASTM strokes by a&#xD;
      clinician using the QSTM device, and stretching.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Phase I Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Manipulation (IASTM) Stroke Pattern Analysis</arm_group_label>
    <description>Fifteen (n=15) experienced clinicians, each with 8 or more years experiences in instrument-assisted soft tissue manipulation (IASTM), will participate in an observational studying analyzing their application of basic stroke patterns (linear, curved) to a consistent research assistant/model. IASTM is a type of massage that uses rigid devices. A Quantifiable Soft Tissue Manipulation (QSTM) device system will be used for determining objective metrics of stroke parameters (e.g. stroke force, rate, angle) and results will be compared between participants to determine characteristic stroke profile patterns for use in training and research.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase II Consistency of IASTM Force Application</arm_group_label>
    <description>The reproducibility of applying a targeted STM stroke force will be determined within and between therapists, both with and without visual monitoring of the QSTM metrics and graphic display. Two novice and two experienced therapists will be trained using QSTM. A novice is defined as a clinician with &lt;1 year and an experienced with &gt;8 years of practice. Fifty (n=50) healthy, non-obese subjects will be enrolled that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. First, the clinicians will apply a self-perceived &quot;moderate&quot; force for 15sec (non-therapeutic dose), within subject tolerance, without using QSTM feedback. Then, the clinician will apply a targeted force of 10N with visual monitoring of QSTM feedback. This process will be repeated 5-7 days later to determine repeatability. After testing, subjects will participate in simple back and/or leg stretches and an ice pack applied.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Phase III Reliability of Dynamic Pressure Pain Threshold Assessment</arm_group_label>
    <description>The reliability of dynamic pressure pain threshold (DPPT) assessment over a specified area will be determined. Two novice and two experienced clinicians will be trained using QSTM. Subjects (n=50) will be recruited that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of healthy, non-obese, younger (≥18 but ≤30yo) and older individuals (≥50 but ≤75yo) (males and females). The clinicians will apply force to standardized areas of the back and thigh regions for 1 min, using the Quantifiable Soft Tissue Manipulation (QSTM) device system. The force applied will be applied up to but below the threshold of when a subject says to &quot;stop&quot; when they feel the &quot;pressure&quot; change into any sort of &quot;irritating discomfort/pain.&quot; Secondary clinical outcomes will be assessed before and after testing since testing could have effects on the soft tissue, pain, and physical performance measures. After testing, the subject will be instructed in simple back and/or leg stretches and an ice pack applied.</description>
