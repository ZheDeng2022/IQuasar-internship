  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the major health problems worldwide. The consumption of healthy-dietary&#xD;
      patterns can be difficult in some countries due to the availability of certain foods.&#xD;
      Suggestion of alternative foods could be a necessity. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a dietary pattern consisting of fruit, avocado, whole-grains and trout&#xD;
      (FAWGT) on postprandial gene expression, insulinemia and lipemia in Colombian obese people.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled crossover study was conducted. Volunteers underwent to two dietary&#xD;
      models for 8 weeks each, including a 2 weeks washout diet between them. The order in which&#xD;
      they started the interventions was randomized following a computerized assignment list using&#xD;
      Excel software (Microsoft Office 2015, Excel 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the postprandial gene expression of nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1&#xD;
      (NFKB1) gene. Based on previous studies , 20 individuals had to be studied to detect a 0.2&#xD;
      difference in the expression of the NKKB1 gene between diets with 0.05 significance level and&#xD;
      80 percentage power (type II error Z 0.2), assuming a 10 percentage drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of participants was carried out according to the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of clinical histories of patients diagnosed with obesity, according to their Body&#xD;
           Mass Index, ascribed to the chronic non-communicable diseases program of the Clinica&#xD;
           Comfamiliar Risaralda in the city of Pereira Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Telephone call to invite the participants who met the inclusion criteria to participate&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Appointment prior to the start of the study to take a blood sample to corroborate the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria. With this sample the following tests were performed: blood glucose,&#xD;
           lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), C-reactive protein ( and complete&#xD;
           blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process was carried out by personnel not involved in the research. The results obtained&#xD;
      were compared with the clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diets followed during the intervention periods were: (1) a diet consisting mainly of the&#xD;
      consumption of fruit, avocado and other vegetables, whole grains and trout typical of the&#xD;
      colombian coffee region (FAWGT) (experimental diet), and (2) the usual diet consumed by the&#xD;
      participants in their normal lifestyle (UD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the dietary intervention period, each participant was given an&#xD;
      individualized food guide containing the suggested food group and portions, with a wide&#xD;
      variety of foods allowed for greater adherence to the diet. In addition, specific times for&#xD;
      consumption of the foods and precise instructions for the dietary intervention were given. In&#xD;
      addition, the subjects were given a talk advising them how to quantify the portions, which&#xD;
      would later be converted into grams according to the procedure described&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food portions were standardized with all the participants using synthetic models, adapted&#xD;
      according to the Colombian nutritional guidelines, so that they could provide a more accurate&#xD;
      report of the portions consumed during the intervention. In addition, a postprandial studies&#xD;
      were carried out at the beginning of the study (pre-intervention) and another after 8 weeks&#xD;
      of dietary intervention (post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were given an appointment at the health center at 7.00 am, after at least 12&#xD;
      hours of fasting and a 5 day abstinence from alcohol. They consumed a breakfast based on the&#xD;
      same composition of the diet in which they were randomized for the dietary intervention&#xD;
      period. The blood samples were obtained by veni-puncture at baseline and 4 hours after&#xD;
      breakfast. During the postprandial period, the participants did not consume any more food,&#xD;
      although they were allowed to drink water. The breakfasts were composed of the following&#xD;
      foods: FAWGT diet; whole-grain arepa (with unrefined corn flour), cheese, oats, granadilla,&#xD;
      mango, linseed, nuts, almonds, peanuts and yogurt. Usual diet; egg, cheese, butter, whole&#xD;
      milk, traditional white arepa (with re-fined corn flour), traditional buñuelo (made from&#xD;
      wheat flour with cheese), coffee and sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the dietary intervention period (Pre-intervention), at the midpoint of the&#xD;
      study (week 4) and at the end (week 8), all the participants completed three 24-hour recalls&#xD;
      (2 non-consecutive weekdays and one weekend day) to obtain information about food,&#xD;
      ingredients and preparations consumed in the same units of measurement (grams).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a weekly telephone call was made to answer any questions relating to the diet&#xD;
      (recipes, menu and quantities) and to motivate adherence to the assigned dietary model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in week four of each intervention, the participants attended the hospital for an&#xD;
      interview with the main researcher in order to take anthropometric measurements, evaluate the&#xD;
      follow-up of the dietary instructions and answer any questions that may have arisen during&#xD;
      the intervention, and motivate them to continue with the study. To collect the information on&#xD;
      food consumption, formats and questionnaires previously published by the research group were&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
