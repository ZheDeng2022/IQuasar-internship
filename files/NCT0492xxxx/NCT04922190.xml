  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Engage-PD is a single cohort evaluation of implementation of a telehealth-delivered physical&#xD;
      activity coaching program for people with early-mid stage Parkinson's disease. The program&#xD;
      utilizes a physical or occupational therapist to provide one-on-one coaching for individuals&#xD;
      with early-mid stage Parkinson's disease to provide individualized structured support to&#xD;
      facilitate and optimize exercise uptake as part of an effective self-management program. The&#xD;
      structure of the coaching program is based on previous research in neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals will be recruited through the Columbia University Medical Center Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Center of Excellence. Individuals who choose to participate will first be given a&#xD;
      brief evaluation, including history and contraindications for exercise, assessment of gait&#xD;
      and balance, physical activity questionnaire (Brunel Lifestyle Inventory and International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire), pain questionnaire (Brief Pain Inventory), NeuroQOL quality&#xD;
      of life assessment, and a self-efficacy measure about exercise engagement (Exercise Self&#xD;
      Efficacy Scale). For those individuals who report low back pain, we will further administer&#xD;
      the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and a customized low back pain&#xD;
      questionnaire. The therapist will then conduct the coaching session (see below). If this&#xD;
      assessment is not able to be conducted in person, it will be conducted via secure&#xD;
      videoconferencing. There will be between 1-4 follow-up phone call/videosessions and a&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 3 months and 6 months where all assessment will be repeated. A short&#xD;
      questionnaire will also be administered at 3 and 6 months to assess the acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coaching program will utilize the Pre-Active PD program (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03696589)&#xD;
      to guide the delivery of the intervention. This will include a checklist of the key elements&#xD;
      that are important for the therapist in order to facilitate PA behavior change. In addition,&#xD;
      the therapist will utilize motivational interviewing strategies that include four processes&#xD;
      (engaging, evoking, planning, and tracking) and five core communication skills (asking open&#xD;
      ended questions, affirming, reflective listening, summarizing, and informing and advising).&#xD;
      The therapist will introduce the Pre-Active PD workbook and utilize it as a tool and&#xD;
      reference for the participant in order to engage and focus them throughout the coaching&#xD;
      process, and will educate participants on the types of exercise options and the specific&#xD;
      exercise benefits for PD. In the planning process, the therapist will facilitate discussion&#xD;
      on development of specific and measurable goals, and will provide options for tracking their&#xD;
      progress, such as written or web-based exercise logs or an activity monitor. The recommended&#xD;
      exercises will be individualized to each participant but will primarily focus on increasing&#xD;
      general physical activity (e.g. steps per day) as well as engagement in moderate-vigorous&#xD;
      intensity aerobic exercise a minimum of three times per week. Balance and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises will also be recommended as appropriate. At the follow up sessions (15-30 min), the&#xD;
      therapist will review progress with the current exercise plan and progress, record if any&#xD;
      falls have occurred and discuss barriers and facilitators for exercise engagement.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given a short exercise safety checklist to assure safety when&#xD;
      conducting home exercises. Participants will have the option to use a Fitbit device (Charge&#xD;
      4) to monitor their heart rate and physical activity during the course of the intervention&#xD;
      period. Participants will use a study-specific login to track their progress and activity.&#xD;
      Participants who already own a Fitbit or other activity monitor can continue to use their&#xD;
      device during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brunel lifestyle inventory is a 10-item questionnaire that measures both pre-planned (6 items) and un-planned (3 items) lifestyle PA. Scoring for each item is on a scale of 1-5, and the scores for each subscale are averaged. Scores range from 1 (low level of physical activity) to 5 (high level of physical activity).</description>

    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>18-item test that measures an individual's self-efficacy to participate in exercise when numerous barriers are present, including both social and physical barriers. Total score is calculated by summing the responses to each question. This scale has a range of total scores from 0-90. A higher score indicates higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>
