  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has spread rapidly and now affects all over the world. On 11 March 2020, coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate illness, for example fever, cough,&#xD;
      tiredness and joint pain etc. For some older people, and those with comorbidities like&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and malignancy are more likely&#xD;
      to develop serious illness. Also long-term problems such as fatigue, breathlessness and joint&#xD;
      pain experienced by survivors of COVID-19 after discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some clinical and pharmacological studies have suggested Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#xD;
      has achieved remarkable therapeutic effect for active COVID cases of different severity&#xD;
      during SARS epidemic in 2003. Also, some studies shown that using Chinese medicine&#xD;
      interventions together with conventional treatment is more effective than using the&#xD;
      conventional treatment alone in treating chronic fatigue syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long history and played an important role in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of several epidemic diseases. However, there is a lack of clinical&#xD;
      study of using TCM to treat the residue symptom of COVID-19 recovered patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 recovered patients will be screened and randomized into TCM group or placebo group&#xD;
      for 8 weeks and followed by a post-treatment visits at week 12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common&#xD;
      cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been&#xD;
      previously identified in humans. COVID-19 has spread rapidly and now affects all over the&#xD;
      world. As of 31 Jan 2021, over 100 million COVID-19 confirmed cases were reported worldwide,&#xD;
      with more than 2 million related death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, most frequently used therapies are corticosteroids, antiviral agents,&#xD;
      antiviral/immunomodulatory drugs, serotherapy, anticoagulant and inflammation inhibitors.&#xD;
      Recent studies reported that different kinds of residue symptoms were left after patient&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, such as fatigue, breathlessness and joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During SARS epidemic in 2003, the treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has&#xD;
      achieved remarkable therapeutic effect. Many different types of TCM have been proposed to&#xD;
      treat COVID-19, of which the most famous are &quot;three medicines and three formulae&quot;: Jinhua&#xD;
      Qinggan Granule, Lianhua Qingwen Capsule/Granule, Xuebijing Injection; Lung Cleansing and&#xD;
      Detoxifying Decoction, HuaShiBaiDu Formula and XuanFeiBaiDu Formula, which are mainly used&#xD;
      for active COVID cases of different severity. Clinical and pharmacological studies have&#xD;
      suggested their efficacy, safety and possible mechanisms in treating different stages of&#xD;
      COVID-19, either used along with conventional treatment or independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For residual symptoms seen in COVID recovered patients, such as fatigue, dyspnoeaand&#xD;
      insomnia, there are also studies suggesting that TCM may be helpful. Some studies shown that&#xD;
      using Chinese medicine interventions together with conventional treatment is more effective&#xD;
      than using the conventional treatment alone in treating chronic fatigue syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liujunzhi Decoction (LJZD) and Shashen Maidong Decoction (SSMDD) are classic Chinese medicine&#xD;
      formulae that have been used in China for hundreds of years. Their combination is proposed as&#xD;
      the intervention of this trial because, from the perspective of Chinese medicine, the&#xD;
      residual symptoms of COVID-19 can often be seen as the manifestation of &quot;lung-spleen qi&#xD;
      deficiency&quot; or &quot;qi and yin deficiency&quot;. ModifiedLJZD and SSMDD are the two most frequently&#xD;
      recommended formulae versions in the recovery stage of COVID-19. This study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of using COVID Rehab Formula &quot;CRF&quot;(LJZD and SSMDD with variations) on the&#xD;
      residue symptom of COVID-19 recovered subjects. To evaluate the efficacy of using COVID Rehab&#xD;
      Formula &quot;CRF&quot; on the residue symptom of COVID-19 recovered subjects. COVID-19 recovered&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to TCM group or placebo group for study treatment 8 weeks&#xD;
      and followed by a post-treatment visits at week 12.&#xD;
