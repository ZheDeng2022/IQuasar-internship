      Recently, is becoming more evident a relationship between malnutrition, stroke-related&#xD;
      sarcopenia and/or altered systemic oxidative status in patients with subacute stroke .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is the evaluation of nutritional status, the presence of stroke-related&#xD;
      sarcopenia and systemic oxidative status in patients with subacute stroke outcomes; another&#xD;
      aim is to investigate the correlation of nutritional status, the presence of stroke-related&#xD;
      sarcopenia and systemic oxidative status on admission with the rehabilitative outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and the second leading cause of permanent&#xD;
      disability in adults, and is therefore very expensive. Some patients with stroke outcomes,&#xD;
      regardless of baseline motor and cognitive function, for unknown reasons show an unexpectedly&#xD;
      worse outcome than others and this suggests other factors, in addition to the degree of&#xD;
      initial disability, that influence the response to rehabilitative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition is an essential aspect in the overall picture of the stroke patient. Malnutrition&#xD;
      in the hospital setting is an important issue that can negatively influence the&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcome (Cederholm et al. 2017; 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition is also responsible for the increase in complications, negatively affects the&#xD;
      results of treatment, reduces the immune response and predisposes to infections, delays&#xD;
      healing, compromises the function of organs and systems, reduces muscle mass and strength,&#xD;
      induces psychic effects with depression and low interest in food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All this leads to a demand for greater and more prolonged care, with a delay in the recovery&#xD;
      of the performance (National Guidelines for hospital and care catering. Min. of Health,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A picture of malnutrition also leads to an alteration of biochemical and haematochemical&#xD;
      indexes. Our retrospective pilot study on 30 patients with subacute stroke, showed a positive&#xD;
      correlation between the reduction of disability following rehabilitation treatment and the&#xD;
      calcium at admission (Siotto et al, 2020). In addition, a recent study with 100 patients&#xD;
      admitted to a rehabilitation unit showed that the functional status at the time of admission&#xD;
      and the improvement following the rehabilitation program were positively influenced by high&#xD;
      blood levels of vitamin D (Lelli et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnourished patients experience &quot;sarcopenia&quot;, which is characterized by the reduction of&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength, and is a phenomenon strongly related to age: after the age of 70&#xD;
      years, in fact, there is a loss of 15% of muscle mass. It is a risk factor for falls,&#xD;
      fractures, physical disability and mortality and it is a phenomenon dependent on various&#xD;
      factors such as metabolic imbalance, inactivity, malnutrition and inflammatory states.&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is accompanied by body weight loss, neuro-hormonal activation and a systemic shift&#xD;
      towards catabolic over-activation (Knops et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is frequently found in patients with stroke outcomes and can contribute negatively&#xD;
      to the rehabilitation process. A recent study of 267 stroke patients admitted to a&#xD;
      rehabilitation unit showed that those with sarcopenia (n=129 48%) had severe lower limb&#xD;
      paralysis, lower Body Mass Index (BMI) values and a lower Functional Independence Measure&#xD;
      (FIM) score, compared to patients without sarcopenia. In addition, patients with sarcopenia&#xD;
      had a longer average stay with less chance of returning home and were less autonomous in&#xD;
      walking. Finally, patients with sarcopenia showed a lower recovery of functional autonomy&#xD;
      compared to non sarcopenic patients (Matsushita et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stroke patients there is also &quot;stroke-related sarcopenia&quot; (Scherbakov, Sandek, and Doehner&#xD;
      2015) with distinctive features. The reasons are to be attributed to a complex of&#xD;
      pathophysiological reactions including: altered neurovegetative control, alterations in the&#xD;
      local and systemic metabolic system, difficulty in nutrition and inflammation (Scherbakov,&#xD;
      Sandek, and Doehner 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have led to hypothesize a correlation between sarcopenia and systemic oxidative&#xD;
      stress. The general oxidative state is the result between levels of circulating oxidants&#xD;
      (e.g. peroxides) and levels of endogenous or dietary acquired antioxidants (glutathione or&#xD;
      vitamins, such as tocopherols, vitamin E, K). Our research team has recently demonstrated&#xD;
      that circulating peroxides increase in stroke and are related to clinical severity (Squitti&#xD;
      et al., 2018). The measurement of circulating peroxides evaluates the prooxidant state of a&#xD;
      subject because it depends on circulating free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS); these&#xD;
      molecules have a great chemical reactivity, which, in extreme cases, compromises the function&#xD;
      of all cellular macromolecules causing cell death; for this reason it is thought that&#xD;
      sarcopenia may be at least partly due to an over-regulation of oxidative metabolism that&#xD;
      produces high levels of circulating free radicals (Fulle et al. 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that there is a negative relationship between malnutrition,&#xD;
      stroke-related sarcopenia and/or altered systemic oxidative status in patients on admission&#xD;
      and recovery following rehabilitative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      therefore the aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of nutritional status, presence of stroke-related sarcopenia and systemic&#xD;
           oxidative status in patients with subacute stroke outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the correlation of nutritional status, the presence of stroke-related sarcopenia and&#xD;
           systemic oxidative status on admission with the rehabilitative outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the nutritional picture of stroke patients from acute or post-acute wards will lead&#xD;
      to a faster and more effective motor recovery and improve their autonomies and quality of&#xD;
      life. This may lead to a lower impact of disability on families and caregivers and, more&#xD;
      generally, a reduction in health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal prospective multicentric, non-profit, longitudinal observational study conducted&#xD;
      in patients with first stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in subacute phase (within six months&#xD;
      after the acute event). The study involves the collection of clinical, instrumental and&#xD;
      biochemical data that do not deviate from routine clinical practice. Since it is not an&#xD;
      experimental study, no specific intervention is planned; patients will be observed before and&#xD;
      after the usual rehabilitative intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a total duration of 18 months starting in January 2021 and a patient&#xD;
      enrolment time of 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>This test will assess the patient's speed during gait. Patients will be asked to walk at their preferred maximum and safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk 10 meters, and pass the end line approximately 1 meter after. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be measured using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundred of a second (ex: 2.15 s). The test will be recorded 3 times, with adequate rests between them. The average of the 3 times should be recorded.</description>

    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance a subject covers during an indoor gait on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The minimal detectable change in distance for people with sub-acute stroke is 60.98 meters. The 6MWT is a patient self-paced walk test and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test. However, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the test, the time is stopped at that moment. The missing time and the reason of the stop are recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a pulse oximeter to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation, also integrated with Borg scale to assess dyspnea.</description>
