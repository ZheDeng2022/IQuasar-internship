      Observational, cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection from medical records.&#xD;
      During the cross-sectional study visit, data will be captured through the use of electronic&#xD;
      Case Report Forms (eCRFs). As there will be only one study visit, no prospective data&#xD;
      collection will take place, nor collection of data that are not part of the routine clinic&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For understanding the burden of severe exacerbations of COPD and the association between&#xD;
      frequency of severe exacerbations and clinical and health-care utilization outcomes in less&#xD;
      well-resourced countries&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included if they meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. have an investigator-confirmed diagnosis of COPD of at least 5 years and are over&#xD;
                  the age of 40 years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. are smokers or ex-smokers (quit smoking no longer than 15 years before the study&#xD;
                  visit);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. have COPD-related data recorded in (electronic) medical records for at least 5&#xD;
                  years, including spirometry and medication data;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. have signed a written Informed Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from participation if they meet any of the following&#xD;
             exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. have a diagnosis of bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, Interstitial Lung Diseases, or&#xD;
                  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This is because differentiating deteriorations in&#xD;
                  symptoms/exacerbations in these individuals at attributing them to COPD is&#xD;
                  impossible&#xD;
