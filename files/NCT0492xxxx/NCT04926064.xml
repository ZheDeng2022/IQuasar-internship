  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is important for optimal child growth, development, and family functioning. Behavioral&#xD;
      pediatric insomnia is one of the most prevalent sleep disorders identified in young children.&#xD;
      Well-child visits represent an important setting for addressing concerns regarding the&#xD;
      child's sleep patterns and sleep problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aimed to describe sleep/wake patterns of young children, evaluate the&#xD;
      associations between parental depressive, and anxiety symptoms, parental involvement in&#xD;
      child-care, sleep-related behaviors and children's sleep parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a descriptive cross-sectional study design. An estimated sample size was 2089&#xD;
      participants considering the number of children aged between 6-36 months in the country, and&#xD;
      the estimated prevalence of Behavioral Insomnia being 30%. A multi-stage stratification is&#xD;
      used to calculate the number of participants to be taken at the level of 12 geographical&#xD;
      regions according to Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-1). A sleep study&#xD;
      group is established by the study coordinator, and researchers running a well-child&#xD;
      outpatient clinic from each region across the country are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators invite mothers of children aged 6 to 36 months who either visited for a&#xD;
      well-child outpatient clinic or in the waiting list for follow up to complete the online&#xD;
      questionnaire about their children's sleep/wake patterns utilizing mailing lists obtained&#xD;
      from the outpatient clinics. Recruitment will take place from April to June 2021. The&#xD;
      questionnaire included Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ), Edinburgh Postnatal&#xD;
      Depression Scale (EPDS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and separate&#xD;
      questions on fathers' involvement in child care, and sociodemographic characteristics. An&#xD;
      online google survey is developed on the google platform securing data collection by a&#xD;
      confidential log in system which can be filled out from smartphones, tablet or computer. The&#xD;
      questionnaire takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
