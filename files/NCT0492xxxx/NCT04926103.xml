  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to screen for new donors, given that there may a donor effect&#xD;
      (PubMed ID: 25857665), with some donors not inducing remission in any patient whilst others&#xD;
      inducing remission in 20-40% of cases. It is important to give UC patients participating in&#xD;
      RCTs stool that has been demonstrated to be effective in some patients. We therefore propose&#xD;
      to conduct an open label study in patients with active UC to ensure new donors are effective&#xD;
      at inducing remission in some patients. Patients that have FMT will relapse within 18 months&#xD;
      (PubMed ID: 25857665) although further FMT therapy induces remission so it is possible that&#xD;
      maintenance FMT will result in long term remission, but this needs evaluation. We will&#xD;
      therefore follow UC patients that have responded to FMT long term in this open label study.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will come once a week for FMT for 8 weeks. FMT is the administration of the supernatant component of stool and water mixture from a healthy relative or an unrelated donor. The donor's stool and blood is rigorously screened to exclude known communicable diseases. Those that achieve remission with FMT will have the option of continuing FMT once per month for 3 years</description>
