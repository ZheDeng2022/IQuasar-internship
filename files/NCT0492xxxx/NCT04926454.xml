      This study compares the efficacy of Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to Bupivacaine in&#xD;
      Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block versus Caudal Block for post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia in children undergoing congenital inguinal hernia repair especially to provide&#xD;
      prolonged post-operative analgesia and decrease opioid consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia is the most common lower abdominal surgery of childhood. It results from a&#xD;
      small sac that comes through the inguinal ring that is normally open during fetal life and&#xD;
      closes around the time of birth. For reasons we don't understand, it does not close in some&#xD;
      infants. This sac then makes a pathway for abdominal organs to come through the inguinal ring&#xD;
      into the groin . In boys, the organ is usually a loop of bowel and in girls; it may be bowel&#xD;
      or an ovary. In boys and girls, the hernia first appears as a bulge in the groin. It usually&#xD;
      &quot;pops out&quot; when the child cries or strains. If only fluid comes through the inguinal ring&#xD;
      into the sac, the problem is called a hydrocele. It is treated via a low transverse incision&#xD;
      to repair the defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients experience somatosensory pain from the incision site and visceral&#xD;
      irritation and discomfort .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of painful experience on the young nervous system is so significant that long-term&#xD;
      effects can occur, including a lowered pain tolerance for months after a pain-producing event&#xD;
      however, the benefits of adequate analgesia include attenuation of the surgical stress&#xD;
      response, decreased perioperative morbidity and improved outcome in certain types of surgery.&#xD;
      Also effective pain control facilitates rehabilitation and accelerates recovery from surgery&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia and analgesia techniques are commonly used to facilitate pain control&#xD;
      during pediatric surgical practice, decrease parenteral opioids requirements and improve the&#xD;
      quality of post-operative pain control and patient-parent satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caudal epidural anesthesia is considered the gold standard regional technique for pain&#xD;
      management after pediatric pelvic and lower abdominal procedures because it blocks both&#xD;
      somatic and visceral pain. The caudal block has a low complication rate (0.7 per 1000) ,&#xD;
      provides 4 to 6 hours of analgesia, and results in improved patient pain scores than in&#xD;
      patients having general anesthesia alone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increased understanding of abdominal wall anatomy has led to the introduction of the&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) for managing pain after lower abdominal surgery&#xD;
      .TAPB provides reliable unilateral sensory block in the T10-L1 distribution with a single&#xD;
      injection, and resulted in a significant decrease in postoperative pain scores and opioid&#xD;
      requirements after major abdominal surgeries . Similar outcomes have been observed in&#xD;
      pediatric studies, and analgesia after TAPB in pediatric patients is thought to last 10 to 15&#xD;
      hours .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of TAP block has been found to be a safe and effective tool in a variety of&#xD;
      general, gynaecological, and urological surgery, and it is suggested as part of the&#xD;
      multimodal anaesthetic approach to enhance recovery after lower abdominal surgeries .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the duration of analgesia provided by these strategies is limited by the short&#xD;
      duration of action of the local anesthetic .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various adjuvants to local anesthetics have been investigated to improve the quality of block&#xD;
      and duration of analgesia, including Dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, morphine, ketamine,&#xD;
      midazolam, and magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these adjuvants has side effects specific to the type and dose of adjuvant used. For&#xD;
      instance, behavioral changes have been noted with the use of caudal ketamine, opioids are&#xD;
      associated with risk of respiratory depression, and the neurotoxicity of midazolam is still&#xD;
      controversial. Therefore, an ideal adjuvant that provides maximal analgesia with minimal side&#xD;
      effects for these blocks is still a matter of contention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist, possesses sedative,&#xD;
      analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties . When administered in combination&#xD;
      with local anesthetics in the epidural space, it has been shown to reduce postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic requirements and have a significantly&#xD;
