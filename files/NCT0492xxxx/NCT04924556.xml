    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of rıgıd brace treatment on spinopelvic parameters&#xD;
      and GAP score in patients with adolescent hyperkyphosis. This was a retrospective analysis of&#xD;
      prospectively collected data. Thirty-two patients who were diagnosed with structural&#xD;
      hyperkyphosis and treated with CAD-CAM design rigid brace were included in the study in&#xD;
      Formed Healthcare Scoliosis Treatment and Brace Center between December 2015-2020.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months after from beginning of study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline lordosis angle(degree) in standing full-length lateral digital radiographs at 6 months. It will measure from the L1-S1 and L4-S1 levels of the vertebra.</description>

    <measure>Change from the global tilt at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after from beginning of study</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline global tilt(degree) in standing full-length lateral digital radiographs at 6 months. The global tilt is the sum of the C7 vertical tilt and the pelvic tilt.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Global Alignment and Proportion (GAP) score at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after from beginning</time_frame>
    <description>GAP score is a new pelvic incidence-based proportional method to analyze sagittal alignment and balance, developed by the European Spine Study Group (ESSG). The GAP score evaluates the disproportion, magnitude and distribution of lumbar lordosis, and the global spinopelvic alignment proportionally rather than an absolute numerical value when compared to the ideal calculated for any individual. GAP score has five domains including relative pelvic version, relative lumbar lordosis, lordosis distribution index, relative spinopelvic alignment, and age factor. Scores of each of the four domains vary between 0 to 3 and age factor domain varies between 0 to 1. The total GAP score is between 0 and 13 points and obtained by adding the scores of these five domains. If the total score was 0 to 2, alignment accepted as proportional; 3 to 6 as moderate malalignment; ≥7 was accepted as severe malalignment.</description>
