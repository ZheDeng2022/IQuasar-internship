      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors in the genitourinary tracts can occur in the kidney, bladder, prostate, and testicles&#xD;
      and can have common and rare histologies. Some cancers that occur along the genitourinary&#xD;
      (GU) tract are rare. Some GU tumors are so rare that they are not included in treatment&#xD;
      studies or tissue banks. This makes it hard for researchers to determine standards of care.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about common and rare GU tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about urinary tract cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with urinary tract or GU cancer such as bladder, kidney, testicular,&#xD;
      prostate, penis, or neuroendocrine cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions about their medical history. Their medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will&#xD;
      complete a survey about their family cancer history. Clinical photographs will be taken to&#xD;
      document skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have imaging scans of their chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have a&#xD;
      contrast agent injected into their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get recommendations about how to best manage and treat their cancer. They&#xD;
      can ask as many questions as they would like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide existing tumor samples if available. They may have optional tumor&#xD;
      biopsies up to twice a year. For needle biopsies, the biopsy area will be numbed and they&#xD;
      will get a sedative. A needle will be inserted through their skin to collect a tumor sample.&#xD;
      For skin biopsies, their skin will be numbed. A small circle of skin will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some blood and tumor samples may be used for genetic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have frequent follow-up visits. If they cannot visit NIH, their home doctor&#xD;
      will be contacted. They will be followed on this study for life....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rare histological variants of the GU tract include bladder/urachal adenocarcinoma, squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma; variants of urothelial carcinoma including&#xD;
      plasmacytoid, sarcomatoid; renal tumors including sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma and renal&#xD;
      medullary carcinoma; penile cancers; micropapillary, giant cell, lipid rich, clear cell and&#xD;
      nested variants, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and&#xD;
      mixed patterns; small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate, testicular Sertoli or&#xD;
      Leydig cell tumors, and papillary and chromophobe RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some GU tumors occur so infrequently that they are not systematically captured by currently&#xD;
      available registries, treatment protocols or tissue banks. The rarity of these tumors limits&#xD;
      the sufficient numbers of patients needed in larger randomized clinical studies to&#xD;
      characterize standard treatments or disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic and longitudinal collection and annotation of clinical history, tissue samples,&#xD;
      imaging studies, participant reported outcomes, and other pertinent information in&#xD;
      participants with these rare tumors will yield future knowledge and help with the development&#xD;
      of subsequent prospective studies to optimize diagnosis and treatment paradigms for less&#xD;
      common GU tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of the natural history of urothelial and rare GU tract malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &gt;= 18 years of age diagnosed with urothelial and rare GU tract malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a long-term study to comprehensively study participants with rare GU tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will be collected and participants followed throughout the course of their&#xD;
      illnesses, with particular attention to patterns of disease presentation, recurrence and&#xD;
      progression, response to therapies, duration of responses and participant reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples and blood will be obtained from participants during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broad spectrum of scientific experiments, including genomics and immune monitoring will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate accruing 1000 participants on this protocol&#xD;
