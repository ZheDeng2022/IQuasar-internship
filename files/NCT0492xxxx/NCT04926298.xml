      This is an observational mono-centric retrospective study carried out at the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Brest The main objective of this study is to assess the glycemic control before,&#xD;
      during and after the 2016 Paris Marathon in patients with type 1 diabetes using continuous&#xD;
      glucose measurement (CGM) by DEXCOM sensor.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with type 1 diabetes, there are general recommendations in the literature&#xD;
      regarding carbohydrate intake and reduction of insulin doses in case of physical activity,&#xD;
      but these recommendations should be tailored to individual patients. However, there is&#xD;
      limited data on methods that could be applied in case of intense or extreme physical activity&#xD;
      in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diabetes department of Brest University Hospital has received many requests from type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients for individual adaptation of insulin and carbohydrate consumption in order&#xD;
      to participate in extreme sporting events such as marathons. One group of patients wanted to&#xD;
      run the 2016 Paris Marathon. Our service had offered them support to define a validated&#xD;
      method to optimize their glycemic control and prevent acute metabolic complications through 2&#xD;
      preparatory races preceding the Marathon de Paris 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the glycemic control before, during and after&#xD;
      the 2016 Paris Marathon using continuous glucose measurement (CGM) by DEXCOM sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol consisted of 2 preparatory races (PR1 and PR2) and the Marathon. For each&#xD;
      race, two visits were made 2 days before (&quot;PRE&quot; visit) and about 7 days after the race&#xD;
      (&quot;POST&quot; visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first PRE visit (i.e., before PR1), patients were fitted with a DEXCOM G4® GDM device&#xD;
      (Dexcom, San Diego, USA) to avoid a calibration problem during the periods of interest to&#xD;
      record interstitial glycemia before, during and after each race (with calibration done in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours). Patients were educated and trained by our care team on how to use the GCM&#xD;
      device. Based on recommendations and our experience, patients were given advice on how to&#xD;
      adjust their insulin therapy regimen and carbohydrate intake. In the remaining PRE visits,&#xD;
      advice for adaptation of the insulin therapy regimen and carbohydrate intake was given to the&#xD;
      patients based on the results of the GCM data from the previous preparatory race At the POST&#xD;
      visit (D+7), the GCM device was removed and the GCM data was extracted using Diasend®&#xD;
      Uploader 2.4.0 software. The GCM data was analyzed with the patient to debrief on blood&#xD;
      glucose control during and after the race. The data was used to counsel the patient for the&#xD;
      next race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory race and marathon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient had participated in two identical 2H preparatory races (PR1 between January and&#xD;
      February 2016 and PR2 in March 2016). For each preparatory race, 2 or 3 groups of patients&#xD;
      were constituted according to their physical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Paris Marathon is a 42.195 km foot race organized every year since 1976 in the streets of&#xD;
      Paris. On the day of the marathon, the medical and paramedical staff was divided into 3&#xD;
      groups. Each group was positioned at refreshment stations on the 19th, 30th and 42nd&#xD;
      kilometers respectively.&#xD;
