  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-blinded, single-center, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      to assess rate and frequency of wound healing, and associated financial savings, when using&#xD;
      Medaxis debritom+ versus standard of care as a choice of debridement method, where both arms&#xD;
      follow normal wound care practice in use of advanced wound care treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the clinical performance of the&#xD;
      Medaxis debritom+ versus standard of care (sharp debridement using scalpel) in the real world&#xD;
      practice of wound care management in a single center trial by collecting data on wound&#xD;
      healing rates over time, success of advanced wound care treatments, and downstream financial&#xD;
      costs in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds&#xD;
      and traumatic wounds. Medaxis debritom+TM is an advanced micro water jet FDA registered Class&#xD;
      II device, which will be used within the cleared intended use of wound lavage.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria for enrollment into&#xD;
        the study and subsequent randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The index wound (i.e. current episode of the wound or ulcer) has been present for&#xD;
             greater than 4 weeks prior to SV 1 and less than 1 year, as of the subject's consent&#xD;
             for the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The index wound is a minimum of 1.0 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at SV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply&#xD;
             with weekly visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must have read and signed the IRB approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) before&#xD;
             study specific screening procedures that are not standard of care are undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
             DFU&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) that meets all of the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Wagner Grade 1 or 2 (see Appendix A for definitions), including wounds that extend&#xD;
             to the ligament, tendon, joint capsule or fascia&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Without abscess or osteomyelitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if two or more DFUs are present and&#xD;
                  will be the only one evaluated in the study. If other ulcerations are present on&#xD;
                  the same foot, they must be more than 2cm distant from index ulcer (edge to&#xD;
                  edge).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The index ulcer has been offloaded for at least 14 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate circulation to the affected foot as documented by a Clarifi SFDI&#xD;
                  Vascular Assessment Tool, or an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) between 0.7 and 1.3&#xD;
                  within 3 months of SV1, using the affected study extremity. As an alternative,&#xD;
                  arterial Doppler ultrasound can be performed, evaluating for bi-phasic dorsalis&#xD;
                  pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level of the ankle within 3 months of&#xD;
                  SV1 or if monophasic wave forms present must have adequate micro circulation as&#xD;
                  evidenced by Clarifi SFDI Vascular Assessment Tool. Note: A documented record of&#xD;
                  an ABI test performed using the index ulcer leg, within 3 months of SV1 is&#xD;
                  acceptable for the purposes of this study. Otherwise, this must be completed in&#xD;
                  the Screening Visit. Acceptable alternatives include arterial Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
                  evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the level&#xD;
                  of the ankle, or documented adequate microcirculation as determined by a Clarifi&#xD;
                  SFDI Vascular Assessment Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
             VLU&#xD;
&#xD;

             criteria. (See Appendix A for definitions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if two or more VLUs are present and will be&#xD;
             the only one evaluated in the study. If other Ulcerations are present on the same leg,&#xD;
             they must be more than 2cm distant from index ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Surgical Dehisced&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All wounds using the Sandy Grading System, except those in the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
             (See Appendix A for definitions) Traumatic&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All wounds as per the CDC Surgical Wound Classification, with the exception of Class&#xD;
             IV or dirty infected wounds, SSI - Deep incisional and organ space. (See Appendix A&#xD;
