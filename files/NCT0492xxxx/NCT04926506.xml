  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Any pathogen that causes an upper respiratory tract infection can cause bronchitis.The&#xD;
      primary pathogen is virus. On the basis of virus infection, pathogenic bacteria may cause&#xD;
      secondary infection or co-infection。Xiyanping injection is mainly used in the treatment of&#xD;
      bronchitis by intravenous injection。&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To further verify the clinical value and safety of intramuscular injection of Xiyanping&#xD;
      injection in the treatment of acute bronchitis in children, provide reference for subsequent&#xD;
      validation studies, and provide more reasonable and standard application guidance and basis&#xD;
      for clinical practice.A multicenter, randomized, parallel controlled study was conducted on&#xD;
      the treatment of acute bronchitis by intramuscular injection of Xiyanping injection.&#xD;
