  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to collect data to develop a complete package&#xD;
      (hardware, user interface software and algorithms) that can monitor sleep-wake stages in&#xD;
      neonates. Real-time EEG data will be used to develop and refine the prototype monitor's&#xD;
      ability to provide direct real-time information about sleep-wake state. The study design&#xD;
      includes multiple iterative training/testing stages to refine the prototype. The study is&#xD;
      divided into multiple sub-aims conducted in parallel: data acquisition, algorithm development&#xD;
      (including comparison between gold-standard polysomnogram vs. novel algorithm markings of&#xD;
      sleep-stages), and graphical user interface software development. The data acquisition and&#xD;
      algorithm development are iterative and linked, such that the prototype algorithm from one&#xD;
      iteration will be deployed real-time during the next iteration of data acquisition. This&#xD;
      allows verification that the algorithm can perform real-time and provides prospective testing&#xD;
      data, which is later folded into the training data for the next iteration, for verification&#xD;
      and validation of the system.&#xD;

      Use Case: Disruption of sleep is a common experience of hospitalized patients of all ages,&#xD;
      especially if they are in an intensive care unit (ICU); infants in the NICU often stay weeks&#xD;
      to months. The quality of neonatal sleep is strongly associated with later neurodevelopment.&#xD;
      Abnormal sleep quality in neonates is associated with less attention orienting at 4 months,&#xD;
      increased distractibility, decreased developmental function at 12-24 months, and lower&#xD;
      emotional regulation and cognitive development at age 5. Yet disruptions to sleep are&#xD;
      frequent: the study team has found that NICU neonates are handled by staff with a median&#xD;
      interval of 2.3 min. Handling occurred across all sleep-wake stages and frequently resulted&#xD;
      in arousals, awakenings, and respiratory events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ multiple levels of noise reduction and signal quality assessment,&#xD;
      tailored to the specific needs of the algorithm and to the NICU environment. The final&#xD;
      algorithm will include four sleep-wake stages (awake, quiet/non-REM sleep, active/REM sleep,&#xD;
      indeterminate/transitional sleep). The complete algorithm is intended to do what no existing&#xD;
      algorithm does, as it uniquely combines the assessment of data quality, ability to run&#xD;
      real-time on un-curated data, and identification of four sleep-wake stages. In this&#xD;
      observational study, validation of the monitor &quot;read-out&quot; in comparison to the gold standard&#xD;
      polysomnogram happens offline, after the completion of data collection from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is an observational study to develop and validate a new physiologic monitoring&#xD;
      modality (the bedside sleep monitor), there is no subject intervention. No change in care for&#xD;
      these study subjects is envisioned to result from use of this prototype monitor. It is hoped&#xD;
      that the proposed technology will create a unique solution that will one day be deployed in&#xD;
      the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Future Research Use of Monitor: The study team hypothesizes that adjusting the&#xD;
      timing of NICU patient contact to avoid multiple sleep disruptions might improve sleep in the&#xD;
      NICU, which could then lead to better neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, the efficacy of&#xD;
      this approach would need to be proved in randomized controlled trials. The conduct of such a&#xD;
      future randomized clinical trial would be facilitated by availability of a real-time,&#xD;
      objective monitor of sleep-wake states like what the study team proposes to develop. However,&#xD;
      the present observational study serves as an initial stage of research that would lead up to&#xD;
      that kind of trial.&#xD;
