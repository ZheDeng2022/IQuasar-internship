  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial includes 60 healthy adults. The&#xD;
      participants were randomized to four different groups. The first group performed over-ground&#xD;
      walking without GEMS-H, the second group performed over-ground walking with GEMS-H applied&#xD;
      resistance mode, the third group performed stair ascent with GEMS-H applied assist mode, and&#xD;
      the fourth group were designated as the group that performed inclined gait with GEMS-H&#xD;
      applied assist mode on a treadmill. Each group is divided in 15 participants.&#xD;

      At the first visit, the subjects are fully informed of the study if appropriate after&#xD;
      determining whether they meet the selection criteria. If the subjects meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria, the participants were randomized to four different groups. The first group&#xD;
      performed over-ground walking without GEMS-H, the second group performed over-ground walking&#xD;
      with GEMS-H with resistance mode, the third group performed stair ascent with GEMS-H with&#xD;
      assist mode, and the fourth group were designated as the group that performed inclined gait&#xD;
      with GEMS-H with assist mode on a treadmill. Each group is divided in 15 participants. Each&#xD;
      group completed 30 minutes exercise at least three times per week (total 10 sessions). All&#xD;
      measurements were conducted before and after the intervention.&#xD;
