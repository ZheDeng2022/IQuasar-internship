  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By 2050, the expanding world population will consume two-thirds more animal protein than it&#xD;
      consumes today. The increase in chronic diseases associated with the generalization of these&#xD;
      consumption patterns tend to understand the place of meat in our diets. All these elements&#xD;
      participate to the reduction of animal proteins in favor of vegetable proteins in our food.&#xD;
      The elderly are particularly affected by malnutrition, the prevalence of protein-energy&#xD;
      malnutrition increasing with age and promoting the onset of morbidities. Without care, it&#xD;
      leads to the worsening of physiological phenomena linked to aging such as loss of muscle&#xD;
      functionality (sarcopenia) or reduction in bone density (osteoporosis) and increases the risk&#xD;
      of falls - the main cause of dependence. However, in France, protein consumption declines&#xD;
      significantly with age, even though requirements appear to be greater for the elderly. It is&#xD;
      therefore a major challenge for our societies to ensure that the aging of the population and&#xD;
      the increase in life expectancy are not synonymous with a reduction in the physical and&#xD;
      mental capacities of individuals. Thus, it is essential to ensure that the recommendations&#xD;
      for reducing the intake of animal proteins in favor of vegetable proteins can be applied&#xD;
      without risk to aging populations, in particular on the human body cardiovascular risk of&#xD;
      these populations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This human dietary intervention study is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      cross over trial with 3 arms, carried out on subjects with predisposition to cardiometabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (based on weight circumference, blood triglyceride or blood cholesterol, glycemia&#xD;
      and hypertension). This study aims to demonstrate transient improvement in vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function (with Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) as main criteria) with consumption&#xD;
      of vegetable proteins (rich in leucine, cysteine and arginine) by comparison with animal&#xD;
      proteins and with a control without proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 33 recruited participants will receive the 3 yogurts in a random order. For each subject,&#xD;
      the study is divided into 4 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize: Visit 1 (D-7) = inclusion, Visit 2 (D0: treatment period N°1), Visit 3 (D28 :&#xD;
      treatment period N°2), Visit 4 (D56 : treatment period N°3). The wash-out periods between&#xD;
      treatment period (duration: 4 weeks) may be extended until 5 weeks for the convenience of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes a total of 4 visits to PIC/CIC Inserm 1405 of the Clermont-Fd&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
