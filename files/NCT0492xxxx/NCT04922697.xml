  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will conduct an educational intervention to promote knowledge of and&#xD;
      preventive health behaviors related to personal air pollution exposure. Air pollution is n&#xD;
      ubiquitous environmental exposure that is associated with harmful health effects including&#xD;
      lung cancer. The educational intervention is comprised of 2 educational videos that include&#xD;
      information regarding air pollution, health effects, and personal preventive health behaviors&#xD;
      to reduce air pollution exposure and the use of a wearable air pollution sensor. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained from this study may inform future research that will be designed to promote&#xD;
      awareness of air pollution and its health effects.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants watch 2 educational videos during week 3 regarding air pollution, health&#xD;
      effects, and personal preventive health behaviors to reduce air pollution exposure.&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires at weeks 1 and 5.&#xD;
