      Introduction: Cochlear implantation allows the rehabilitation of profound bilateral deafness,&#xD;
      restoring speech perception and verbal communication when the traditional hearing aid no&#xD;
      longer provides satisfactory hearing gain (Nimmons et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cochlear implant includes an electrode array and its functioning is based on the principle&#xD;
      of cochlear tonotopy: each electrode encodes a frequency spectrum according to its position&#xD;
      in the cochlea (high frequencies are assigned to the basal electrodes and low frequencies to&#xD;
      the apical electrodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cochlear implant thus breaks down the frequency spectrum into a number of frequency bands&#xD;
      via bandpass filters corresponding to the number of electrodes in the implant. During the&#xD;
      fitting these bands can be modified by the audiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fitting software developed by the manufacturers proposed a default fitting with a lower&#xD;
      limit between 100 and 250 Hz according to the brands and an upper limit of about 8500 Hz. The&#xD;
      frequency bands assigned to each electrode follow a logarithmic scale with the high&#xD;
      frequencies for the basal electrodes and the low frequencies for the apical electrodes. This&#xD;
      distribution takes into account the number of active electrodes but does not take into&#xD;
      account the anatomy and the natural cochlear tonotopy specific to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have analyzed the anatomical variations of the cochlear dimensions: size of&#xD;
      the cochlea and the ratio between the contact surfaces of the electrodes with the cochlea are&#xD;
      variable from one patient to another (Stakhovskaya O et al., P. Pelliccia et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insertion depth during surgery is also variable due to parameters related to the patients&#xD;
      as well as to the operator, which seems to impact the understanding of speech in noise (Deep&#xD;
      electrode insertion and sound coding in cochlear implants - Ingeborg Hochmair et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathematical algorithms have recently been developed to estimate the cochlear tonotopy of&#xD;
      each patient from a CT scan assessment (Jiam et al., Sridhar et al.). CT imaging of the&#xD;
      implanted ear combined with 3D reconstruction software, provides cochlear length measurements&#xD;
      (Cochlear length determination using Cone Beam Computed Tomography in a clinical setting -&#xD;
      Würfel et al .) Using this approach it is possible to measure the position of each electrode&#xD;
      relative to the cochlear apex. These measurements are applied to the modified Greenwood&#xD;
      equation to obtain the tonotopic frequency for each electrode and to determine for each&#xD;
      patient a fitting based on the tonotopy of each electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show the superiority of tonotopy based fitting strategy compared to default fitting strategy&#xD;
      on the perception speech in noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show the superiority of tonotopy based fitting strategy compared to default fitting strategy&#xD;
      on the perception of musical elements (contour test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show the non inferiority of tonotopy based fitting strategy compared to default fitting&#xD;
      strategy on the perception of speech elements in quiet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show the superiority of tonotopy based fitting strategy compared to default fitting strategy&#xD;
      on the qualitative preference for the listening of musical pieces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective open monocentric randomized crossover study: measures will be done on the&#xD;
      patient at 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-activation.&#xD;

    <description>The Gabrielsson scale (1988) is used to evaluate perceived sound quality as a multidimensional phenomenon, that is composed of a number of separate perceptual dimensions.

Visual analog scales (VAS) are used for each dimension and the patient has to score the dimension on a 10 cm VAS (between 0 to 10).</description>
