  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine beneficial effects of PLASOMA treatment compared to the&#xD;
      standard of care on chronic venous leg ulcers (VLU) that match the size of the plasma area of&#xD;
      the pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is that the data obtained with this study will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate comparative performance of PLASOMA (for two treatment frequencies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide evidence for health technology assessments (HTA) of PLASOMA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PETH study will be an open label three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) on chronic&#xD;
      VLU. The study will be performed at one study site in the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: standard care for 20 weeks or until healing, whichever occurs first;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment group-1: standard care + PLASOMA treatment once per week for 20 weeks or until&#xD;
           healing, whichever occurs first;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment group-2: standard care + PLASOMA treatment twice per week for 20 weeks or&#xD;
           until healing, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment period there will be two follow up timepoints: 2 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      the treatment period (FU1) and 12 weeks after the end of the treatment period (FU2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated to one of the three arms according to a pre-defined randomization&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the percentage of wounds healed after 12 weeks of treatment with PLASOMA for two&#xD;
      treatment frequencies: once per week and twice per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by comparing the treatment groups with the control group&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL1: have a slow-healing or non-healing lower leg ulcer presumed to be caused by&#xD;
             venous insufficiency. The wound should exist for at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: There is no upper limit for the duration that the wound exists. In case a&#xD;
             subject has multiple wounds that meet the in- and exclusion criteria, the wound with&#xD;
             the longest duration will be chosen for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL2: have insufficient healing (&lt;30% surface area reduction during the last two&#xD;
             weeks of standard wound care).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL3: have a wound with a wound surface area that matches the size of the plasma area&#xD;
             of the pad (for the currently CE approved pad C0801 that is a maximum diameter of 3&#xD;
             cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL4: have a wound with a minimum wound size of 1 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL5: have an Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) between 0.8 and 1.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: subject can be included based on a VLU diagnosis from anamnesis. Make sure an&#xD;
             ABPI measurement is performed as soon as possible to verify the diagnosis. The subject&#xD;
             has to be excluded if the ABPI is not between 0.8 and 1.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note 2: For diabetic patients an ABPI measurement is not always reliable. Therefore,&#xD;
             diabetic patients do not haveto meet INCL5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL6: are willing to perform a study visit (at home or at the study site) twice a&#xD;
             week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL7: are willing and physically able to carry out all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL8: have a minimum age of 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INCL9: For home care treatments only: there is a grounded wall socket available for&#xD;
             connection of PLASOMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL1: the subject has a mixed aetiology (venous and arterial) leg ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL2: the subject has an ulcer on the foot or the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL3: the wound is very exudative, i.e. wounds in which moisture is visible again&#xD;
             within a few minutes after patting dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL4: any implanted active electronic device, such as a pacemaker, is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL5: an electronic medical device is attached to the body, including electronic life&#xD;
             support equipment and insulin pumps. If the sole purpose of the medical device is&#xD;
             monitoring, the subject is not excluded but it should be noted that use of PLASOMA&#xD;
             together with such devices has not been tested and may lead to erroneous operation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  of the attached device during PLASOMA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: no exclusion if electronic medical device will be detached during PLASOMA&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL6: a metal implant (including a stent) is present in the treatment area, i.e. the&#xD;
             area between pad and electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL7: a conductive connection from outside to inside the body at or near the heart is&#xD;
             present, e.g. a catheterwith electrolyte fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL8: the subject has a debridement intolerance (e.g. unacceptable pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL9: the subject has a compression therapy intolerance (e.g. unacceptable pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL10: the subject uses systemic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL11: the subject is hospitalized at the time of inclusion or likely to be&#xD;
             hospitalized in the near future (22 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL12: the subject has had vascular surgery related to the to-be-treated wound within&#xD;
             the previous 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL13: the subject experienced an occurrence of deep vein thrombosis in the previous&#xD;
             3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL14: the subject has any known malignant wound degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL15: the subject receives treatment with immunosuppressive agents or oral&#xD;
             corticosteroids; no exclusion if&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subject has received a stable dose for at least 2 months and the oral corticosteroid&#xD;
             dose does not exceed 7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL16: the subject is receiving or likely to receive advanced wound dressings or&#xD;
             advanced therapies- such as negative pressure therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy,&#xD;
             biologicals (e.g. skin substitutes, growth factors), electrophysical therapy - for the&#xD;
             to-be-treated wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL17: the subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus* (HbA1c &gt;10% (86 mmol/mol)&#xD;
             within the previous 6 months; or unknown HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Patients with controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c&lt;10% (86 mmol/mol) within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months) can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note 2: a subject may be enrolled if controlled diabetes is expected. Make sure to&#xD;
             verify as soon as possible that HbA1c &lt; 10% (86 mmol/mol), if not the subject had to&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL18: the subject suffers from comorbidity or there are other circumstances (e.g.&#xD;
             long lasting COVID-19 symptoms), which in the investigator's opinion, are likely to&#xD;
             compromise the outcome of the study or the feasibility of the subject fulfilling the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL19: the subject had a COVID-19 infection (i.e. tested positive for COVID-19 or&#xD;
             very likely infected with COVID-19 but not confirmed by a COVID-19 test) in the past 6&#xD;
             months (counted from disease onset) and still has persistent symptoms (such as&#xD;
             fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL20: the subject has epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL21: the subject is pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL22: the subject does not (agree to) comply with the SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCL23: the subject participates in another study.&#xD;
