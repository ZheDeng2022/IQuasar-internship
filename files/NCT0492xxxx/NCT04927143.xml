    <textblock>
      Combatting the rise of the opioid epidemic is a central challenge of U.S. health care policy.&#xD;
      A promising approach for improving welfare and decreasing medical costs of people with&#xD;
      substance abuse disorders is offering incentive payments for healthy behaviors. This&#xD;
      approach, broadly known as &quot;contingency management&quot; in the medical literature, has repeatedly&#xD;
      shown to be effective in treating substance abuse. However, the use of incentives by&#xD;
      treatment facilities remains extremely low. Furthermore, it is not well understood how to&#xD;
      design optimal incentives to treat opioid abuse. This project will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      evaluation of two types of dynamically adjusting incentive schedules for people with opioid&#xD;
      use disorders or cocaine use disorders: &quot;escalating&quot; schedules where incentive amounts&#xD;
      increase with success to increase incentive power, and &quot;de-escalating&quot; schedules where&#xD;
      incentive amounts decrease with success to improve incentive targeting. Both schemes are&#xD;
      implemented with a novel &quot;turnkey&quot; mobile application, making them uniquely low-cost,&#xD;
      low-hassle, and scalable. Effects will be measured on abstinence outcomes, including longest&#xD;
      duration of abstinence and the percentage of negative drug tests. In combination with survey&#xD;
      data, variation from the experiment will shed light on the barriers to abstinence more&#xD;
      broadly and inform the understanding of optimal incentive design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, the annual number of drug-related deaths more than doubled in the&#xD;
      United States (Swensen, 2015). In particular, over the 2001-2013 period, overdose deaths&#xD;
      involving prescription pain relievers tripled while those involving heroin increased fivefold&#xD;
      (NIDA, 2015). Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to have significantly increased drug&#xD;
      use, especially opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamines. This upward-sloping trend has&#xD;
      steepened in the past few years. Drug overdoses are now the principal cause of death among&#xD;
      Americans aged less than 50. A primary cause of this escalating public health crisis is the&#xD;
      abuse of opioids (e.g., prescription pain relievers and heroin), which is estimated to&#xD;
      concern more than two million Americans (New York Times, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies in the medical literature have tested whether providing incentives to encourage&#xD;
      abstinence from drugs can further reduce drug abuse in a drug-treatment setting. The results&#xD;
      are very promising: Incentives to reduce opioid abuse increase the average duration of&#xD;
      abstinence by 25 - 60% relative to medication and counseling alone (Petry et al., 2005;&#xD;
      Schottenfeld et al., 2005; Petry et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2013). Similar effects have been&#xD;
      demonstrated repeatedly across a wealth of populations, substance-abuse disorders, and&#xD;
      payment methodologies (Lussier et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2016; Higgins, 2016). A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of psychosocial treatments concluded that providing incentives for abstinence&#xD;
      behavior was the intervention with the greatest effect size in treating substance use&#xD;
      disorders (Dutra et al., 2008). Despite their costs, incentive programs have been estimated&#xD;
      to be cost-effective, with the estimated benefits - including benefits to participants and to&#xD;
      taxpayers from lower health care costs and higher earnings - estimated to be on the order of&#xD;
      20 times as large as normal program costs (WSIPP, 2017). Although such estimates are somewhat&#xD;
      speculative, the case for scaling up incentive programs is strong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And yet, despite evidence that incentives are effective and the ever-more-dire need for&#xD;
      effective approaches to combat the addiction crisis, incentive programs have not been scaled&#xD;
      up widely to date. A key barrier is that while the benefits are largely borne by patients and&#xD;
      taxpayers, there are large logistical costs that must be borne by clinics: existing incentive&#xD;
      programs involve manual, in-person measurement of behaviors, and prize or voucher purchase&#xD;
      and delivery by clinic staff. The significant clinic-level legwork necessary to set up these&#xD;
      programs, including setting up behavioral and payment tracking systems, training staff, etc.,&#xD;
      have prevented the programs from scaling widely (Benishek et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct the first randomized evaluation of an innovative, scalable incentives&#xD;
      program delivered through a mobile application. The application, which was developed by the&#xD;
      implementing company, DynamiCare Health, provides a &quot;turnkey&quot; solution that health clinics&#xD;
      can easily prescribe. The app enables remote monitoring of abstinence behavior: drug tests&#xD;
      can be administered in patients' homes, as patients submit &quot;selfie-videos&quot; showing them&#xD;
      taking saliva drug tests, which are then verified by trained remote staff. The app can also&#xD;
      deliver payments for negative drug tests to linked debit cards1 as soon as the tests have&#xD;
      been scored and verified. This remote approach to incentive monitoring and delivery is also&#xD;
      remarkably well suited to the advent of remote treatment, which has become prevalent with the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its promise, the efficacy of the fully remote approach has not&#xD;
      been rigorously tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will also directly address a key open question in the literature on incentives&#xD;
      for drug-users: how to dynamically adjust incentives for abstinence behaviors according to&#xD;
      how well individuals are complying with incentivized behaviors. Behavior-dependent dynamic&#xD;
      incentive schedules can take two overarching forms: escalating or de-escalating. Escalating&#xD;
      schedules feature incentive payments for compliance that increase as individuals comply with&#xD;
      the behavior, and decrease with failures to comply. Escalating incentive schedules increase&#xD;
      the stakes of good behavior now by hinging the size of future earnings opportunities on&#xD;
      current behavior, and are frequently tested in substance-use settings (Higgins et al., 2014;&#xD;
      Hutchinson et al., 2012; Kirby et al., 2013; Lamb et al., 2010; Packer et al., 2012; Petry et&#xD;
      al., 2012, 2015; Roll t al., 1996; Roll &amp; Higgins, 2000; Roll et al., 2006; Roll &amp; Shoptaw,&#xD;
      2006; Romanowich &amp; Lamb, 2010, 2015; Silverman et al., 1998; Tuten et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a pitfall of escalating schedules is that they are poorly targeted: they pay the&#xD;
      largest incentives to individuals who are complying with behaviors, and offer the smallest&#xD;
      incentives to individuals who are struggling to achieve compliance. De-escalating schedules&#xD;
      can address the poor targeting of escalating schedules. De-escalating schedules feature&#xD;
      incentive payments that increase when individuals fail to comply with the behavior. By&#xD;
      delivering larger incentives where they are needed most, these schedules could particularly&#xD;
      help individuals when they are struggling, an especially desirable feature in the addition&#xD;
      space where the costs of substance abuse may be convex. However, the stakes of good behavior&#xD;
      are lower than in an escalating schedule, because failure to comply now increases the size of&#xD;
      future earnings. There may thus exist a cost-effectiveness/targeting tradeoff: escalating&#xD;
      schedules could more cost-effectively achieve a given average level of abstinence (since they&#xD;
      provide higher stakes for good behavior conditional on the payout), while de-escalating&#xD;
      schedules could be better targeted, improving outcomes more at the bottom of the distribution&#xD;
      and decreasing the variance of outcomes across people. However, there is limited evidence&#xD;
      regarding whether this tradeoff exists empirically or, if it does, on the shape of the&#xD;
      tradeoff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first research goal is therefore to test the effectiveness of two low-touch incentive&#xD;
      delivery approaches, and evaluate whether they can deliver on the promise of high-touch&#xD;
      incentives programs in a scalable way. We propose to do this by performing a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of incentive programs among people with cocaine or opioid-use disorders in&#xD;
      an outpatient treatment program in Wisconsin. Moreover, for cost-conscious health systems,&#xD;
      the most important question may be how to optimize the design of incentive systems. Thus, the&#xD;
      second research goal is to compare the cost-effectiveness and variance of de-escalating and&#xD;
      escalating incentive schedules.&#xD;
