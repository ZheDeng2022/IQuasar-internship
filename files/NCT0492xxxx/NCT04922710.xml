      PEACH is a pilot project which is being conducted to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a 12-week home-based exercise intervention among Black and African American&#xD;
      adults. A secondary aim of the project is to determine whether the exercise intervention&#xD;
      improves cognitive and psychological functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project aims to address the impact of early life adversity (ELA) on brain health&#xD;
      in adulthood by conducting a pilot 12-week physical activity intervention delivered remotely&#xD;
      using aerobic exercise bikes programmed to connect users with a trainer via an app.&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit Black and African American individuals between the ages of 30-55&#xD;
      years (N = 40) who are currently sedentary and report experiencing at least one form of ELA&#xD;
      prior to the age of 10. This study will be conducted at two sites: the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, PA, USA and the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica&#xD;
      (site investigator: Terrence Forrester). At baseline and following the 12-week intervention,&#xD;
      Investigators will collect a harmonized battery of cognitive, behavioral and psychosocial&#xD;
      measures. The intervention itself will be home-based and will involve three 60-minute&#xD;
      sessions of aerobic exercise per week using a Bluetooth-enable exercise bike. Participants'&#xD;
      exercise programs will be supervised remotely by an exercise trainer and individualized&#xD;
      depending on their age-adjusted heart rate reserve, with the goal being to have participants&#xD;
      reach 50 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise per session by the end of the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks of the intervention. The bikes will be outfitted with a tablet featuring an&#xD;
      application called Neotiv. The Neotiv application will collect data from the bike regarding&#xD;
      timing, duration, and intensity of exercise sessions, which will be securely shared with the&#xD;
      exercise trainer to monitor attendance and adherence. The primary goals of this study are to&#xD;
      determine whether the home-based exercise program (1) is feasible and acceptable (as measured&#xD;
      by adherence and attendance), and (2) promotes improvements in cognitive and psychological&#xD;
      functioning among adults who have been exposed to ELA.&#xD;

Adherence will be used as a metric of feasibility and acceptability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in negative and positive affect</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated via scores from the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Scores can range from 1 to 100, with 1 meaning less positive affect and 100 meaning more positive affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, a measure of the frequency of 20 common depressive symptoms rated along a 0 (&quot;rarely or none of the time&quot;) to 3 (&quot;most or all of the time&quot;) Likert scale. Responses are summed to yield a total symptom score (maximum possible score of 60) with higher scores reflecting more severe depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Perceived Stress Scale a measure of the frequency of 20 common depressive symptoms rated along a 0 (&quot;rarely or non, a 14-item measure that assesses experiences of daily life stress. The PSS is an instrument on which respondents use a 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very often&quot;) Likert scale to rate the degree to which daily life events are perceived to be uncontrollable, unpredictable, or unmanageable. Responses are summed to form a total score (maximum possible score of 56).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Flanker performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Flanker task will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (12-weeks). The main outcome from this task is an interference effect (in ms) which indicates how much longer it takes for a participant to make a directional response to a center arrow when the flanking arrows are arranged in congruent vs. incongruent direction from the center stimulus. A higher interference effect indicates worse executive functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Picture Sequence performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Picture Sequence task will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (12-weeks). The main outcome from this task is the cumulative number of adjacent pictures in which a participant correctly remembered the sequence. A lower number of correct items indicates worse episodic memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Dimensional Card Sort performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Dimensional Card Sort task will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (12-weeks). The main outcome from this task is an interference effect (in ms) which indicates how much longer it takes for a participant to match a stimulus to other choice stimuli based on a feature (shape or color), with the feature participants must match on switching without warning during the task. A higher interference effect indicates worse executive functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in List Sorting performance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A List Sorting task will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (12-weeks).

    <description>Guidelines for exercise programming (ACSM, 2018) will be followed including a warmup and cool down, progressive and gradual increments in duration, and instruction regarding avoidance of physical activity related injury. The exercise group will receive moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 60 minutes per day, three times a week, for 12 weeks. The prescribed intensity will be based on estimated heart rate reserve, calculated using resting heart rate and age-adjusted heart rate maximum (220-age in years). Participants will maintain a minimum heart rate from their specific calculation that will be monitored by Polar Heart Rate straps.</description>
