  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains the most frequent healthcare-associated&#xD;
      infection (HAI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and one of the most critical risk factors&#xD;
      associated with both significant morbidity as well as mortality. Although VAP treatment&#xD;
      relies on early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several preventive measures have been&#xD;
      described in the literature in order to limit its incidence and clinical impact in the ICU.&#xD;
      Among these, preventing biofilm formation on the inner surface of the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      appears to hold promise. Yet there is a lack of clinical relevant data documenting a causal&#xD;
      relation between biofilm formation and VAP. Designed to overcome this critical limitation,&#xD;
      the BIOPAVIR study intends to provide a better structural and microbiological&#xD;
      characterization of endotracheal tube biofilm in critically ill patients at increased risk&#xD;
      for the development of VAP in ICU during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
