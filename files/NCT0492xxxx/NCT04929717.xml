      The research was conducted as a randomized controlled trial. The stratified and permutation&#xD;
      block randomization methods were used in the study. The personal information form and BSES-SF&#xD;
      were administered to women in the hospital before the intervention. Breastfeeding education&#xD;
      and counseling were provided via social media (WhatsApp) to support women for breastfeeding&#xD;
      and to ensure the continuity of breastfeeding in the postpartum period. Breastfeeding&#xD;
      education was given to women in the first four weeks after discharge from the hospital. The&#xD;

      women by healthcare personnel as part of the hospital procedures. Except for routine&#xD;
      breastfeeding training, no intervention was applied to the control group.&#xD;
