  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility and usability study of a virtual reality device for patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a study of patients with chronic pain to identify interest in&#xD;
      participating in a large VR trial and, for those willing to join the team to test the device&#xD;
      in person, to pilot 2 sessions of VR to assess usability and collect preliminary data on pain&#xD;
      and mood and to obtain data on patient satisfaction with device use. Researchers expect the&#xD;
      entire session to last 45 minutes to 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited will be in the active arm; this is not a randomized pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention being piloted is the EaseVRx - AppliedVR, Los Angeles, CA - VR hardware and&#xD;
      software. EaseVRx incorporates evidence-based principles of cognitive behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      mindfulness, and pain neuroscience education into an immersive and enhanced biofeedback&#xD;
      experience. EaseVRx includes breathing training and relaxation response exercises that&#xD;
      activate the parasympathetic nervous system. EaseVRx was designed for at-home use and comes&#xD;
      with a sequence of daily immersive experiences, with each VR experience being 2-16 minutes in&#xD;
      length (average of 6 minutes). For this pilot, researchers will be doing one in-person&#xD;
      session, using two interoceptive VR experiences (out of 56 total).&#xD;
