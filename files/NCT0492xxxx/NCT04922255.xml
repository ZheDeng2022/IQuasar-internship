    <textblock>
      Evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of non-surgical urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI) management options for women with CF. The investigators will complete a&#xD;
      pilot, feasibility study (n=30) to compare tolerability and symptom relief in women with CF&#xD;
      and UI. Subjects will be recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Cystic Fibrosis Center&#xD;
      after demonstrating bother from UI on initial phone script. Participants will undergo UI&#xD;
      questionnaires and undergo a pelvic examination, non-invasive bladder scan ultrasound and a&#xD;
      provocative stress test and then be randomized to either a disposable urethral support device&#xD;
      (Impressa®), an absorbent product (Speax Reusable Underwear), or Pelvic floor muscle therapy.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be to determine the feasibility and tolerability of these options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: All three non-surgical UI management options for women are feasible (as measured&#xD;
      by 80% adherence to treatment assignment over 7 days) and tolerable (as measured by patient&#xD;
      report via questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the proposed aims will provide important information about the experiences&#xD;
      and symptom burden of women with CF and UI. Importantly, the investigators will also be able&#xD;
      to answer the important questions of &quot;Can it work?&quot; and &quot;Does it work?&quot; as we seek to&#xD;
      construct the definitive, adequately powered trial of these therapies in women with CF and&#xD;
      UI.&#xD;

      Study Procedures: Participants will be recruited at routine cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic&#xD;
      visits and via telephone screening. The investigators will again utilize the ISI for&#xD;
      screening procedures with subjects required to have at incontinence at least as frequent as&#xD;
      'less than once a month' and at least as 'drops' to be eligible for enrollment. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained before any study procedures are initiated. Initial demographic&#xD;
      questions and the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) will be completed at the baseline visit.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given materials to complete a 2-day bladder diary. The bladder diary has&#xD;
      participants track what they take in (fluids) and also their voided volumes throughout the&#xD;
      day and night. Subjects will be given a hat to void in a collect the numbers/volume of voids&#xD;
      and also leakage episodes. Pregnancy will be excluded by self-report. Participants will then&#xD;
      have a pelvic exam for a visual urethral mobility examination and assessment of pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle strength to be completed by the principal investigator. The principal investigator&#xD;
      will additionally first perform a bladder scan ultrasound to assess current bladder volume&#xD;
      and then a cough stress test (CST). The exam will be performed in the supine/lithotomy&#xD;
      position with ≥300 mL of fluid in the bladder. We will have the subject cough forcefully 1-4&#xD;
      times and the examiner will directly visualize the urethral meatus for the presence of&#xD;
      leakage. Leakage of fluid from the urethral meatus coincident with/simultaneous to the&#xD;
      cough(s) is considered a positive test consistent with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized feasibility trial (Table 2). At the baseline visit, women will be given a brief&#xD;
      description of the three different treatment options and be initially asked to rank initial&#xD;
      choice for treatment. Participants will then be randomized to either a disposable urethral&#xD;
      support device (Impressa®), Speax™ Reusable Underwear, or pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT).&#xD;
      Randomization will be in a 1:1:1 allocation without stratification by incontinence severity.&#xD;
      The disposable Impressa® urethral support is a tampon-like device that is available over the&#xD;
      counter to help women with urinary incontinence (UI). Speax Reusable Underwear are similarly&#xD;
      available for purchase online and are absorbent underwear for bladder leak protection. Both&#xD;
      the Impressa and Speax are commercially available and the Impressa is FDA approved. The Speax&#xD;
      underwear are not a FDA regulated product. Urethral support device cohort - A week supply of&#xD;
      the Impressa device will be provided and participants will be asked to complete a daily&#xD;
      bladder diary for a total of 7 days. The instructions for use booklet will be provided.&#xD;
      Subjects will be told that they can continuously utilize one Impressa for up to 12 hours. We&#xD;
      will ask subjects to wear for at least 12 hours a day but up to 24 if they desire. Reusable&#xD;
      absorbent pad cohort - Three pairs of Speax underwear will be provided and subjects will&#xD;
      complete a similar daily UI diary for 7 days. Subjects will be instructed to wear one pair of&#xD;
      speax daily and may wash as they desire. Subjects will be provided the website for the&#xD;
      product and we will allow them to order whatever pair/size the subject desires.&#xD;
      https://www.shethinx.com/pages/speax. PFMT cohort - Experienced pelvic health physical&#xD;
      therapists (at both University of Pittsburgh) will complete two visits one week apart. Each&#xD;
      PFMT visit will take ~60 minutes. We will develop a standardized pelvic floor exercise&#xD;
      intervention based on previous RCT for PFMT in women with MUI. The intervention will&#xD;
      comprise: 1) Bladder training and delayed voiding techniques 2) Urgency suppression 3) SUI&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., 'knack') and 4) Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training for those agreeable to&#xD;
      internal exams. We will utilize Diaphragmatic breathing, Happy Baby Stretch with pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle (PFM) relaxation and lower abdominal myofascial release (MFR) to start. These are all&#xD;
      non-internal stretching type exercises similar to yoga and will be performed for ~20-30&#xD;
      minutes. If the subject is willing we will consider internal pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      which will involve the physical therapist inserting one digit into the vagina in order to aid&#xD;
      in muscle coordination. This will also be done for 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be blinded to their group assignment given the nature of the differences in&#xD;
      management options. At the end of the treatment assignment all subjects will repeat the KHQ&#xD;
      and a patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I). The PGI-I is a validated one question&#xD;
      measure rating their urinary tract condition now, as compared with how it was prior to before&#xD;
      beginning treatment on a scale from 1 (Very much better) to 7 (Very much worse). All subjects&#xD;
      will complete the follow-up questionnaires 7-days after the beginning of their assigned&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the opportunity to gather acceptability on these options for a sensitive issue,&#xD;
      subjects will be offered an option to further participate in one alternate therapy of their&#xD;
      choosing. If subjects select this option we will organize an additional week of therapy.&#xD;
      Participants will only have to complete a BSW questionnaire and another PGI-I at the end of&#xD;
      therapy. This is an option for all women in the study even if they initially had been&#xD;
      randomized to their preferred option as participants may ultimately have not really liked&#xD;
      that choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability and Feasibility assessment: Urethral support device cohort and Reusable&#xD;
      absorbent pad cohort: Feasibility will be evaluated through assessment of use and product&#xD;
      performance. Logs regarding utilization of assigned product will be completed daily. Patient&#xD;
      treatment preference will be assessed after completion of both therapies utilizing the&#xD;
      product performance questionnaire (PPQ). The PPQ is a 13-item product questionnaire that&#xD;
      consists of product questions that are specific to incontinence products and includes&#xD;
      questions about overall impression of product, ability to hold urine, ability to prevent&#xD;
      odor, fit, discreteness, comfort when wet and dry, and ability to keep skin dry. PFMT cohort:&#xD;
      Feasibility will be evaluated through assessment of adherence and self-reported success with&#xD;
      ability to perform exercises. Adherence to intervention sessions will be documented by&#xD;
      physical therapist using attendance logs. Adherence to home practice will be documented by&#xD;
      participants in home logs that included the dates and times of practice. At the end of each&#xD;
      physical therapy visit, participants will be asked to rate their confidence in performing the&#xD;
      PFMT exercises featured in their program (extremely, very, moderately, somewhat, and not at&#xD;
      all confident).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all participants will be asked to indicate how easy it would be to&#xD;
      continue practicing their assignment intervention (extremely, very, moderately, somewhat, and&#xD;
      not at all easy). All subjects will complete a Benefit, Satisfaction, and Willingness to&#xD;
      Continue (BSW) questionnaire. We will consider therapy feasible (as measured by 80% adherence&#xD;
      to treatment assignment over 7 days) and tolerable (as measured by patient report via&#xD;
      questionnaire). By allowing subjects to choose another one of the arms after their&#xD;
      randomization this will give us further, important information about feasibility and patient&#xD;
      preference for a larger trial.&#xD;
