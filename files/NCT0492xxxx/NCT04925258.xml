  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus have created&#xD;
      unique challenges and stresses for Canadian families. Balancing work, family, and daily life&#xD;
      has become extremely difficult for many families. Economic uncertainty is widespread as many&#xD;
      parents are dealing with increased demands such as working from home, running the household,&#xD;
      and homeschooling and caring for their children without the support of their social networks.&#xD;
      Recent findings from a study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young families&#xD;
      conducted by our lab found that parents reported increased levels of stress, difficulties in&#xD;
      following through with their parenting duties, and challenges managing their children's&#xD;
      behaviour. Accessible programs are urgently needed to help parents cultivate supportive&#xD;
      family relationships during and in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as physical distancing&#xD;
      and public health requirements have further decreased the accessibility of existing&#xD;
      programming. The proposed research aims to test the relative value of multiple light-touch&#xD;
      parenting supports (developed through the REB-approved BRIDGE program, NCT04347707 and&#xD;
      NCT04639557) in a 2-arm randomized control trial including behaviour management and&#xD;
      emotion-focused strategies delivered through psychoeducational parenting videos, structured&#xD;
      family activities, and an online parenting support group. The investigators plan to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of this program at reducing parenting stress (primary outcome) and promoting&#xD;
      family well-being (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supportive parent-child relationships are increasingly understood to be the single most&#xD;
      important predictor of resilient child development because they shape children's ability to&#xD;
      build relationships and navigate the world around them. The emergence of emotion regulation&#xD;
      skills during the preschool years serves as a key step in adaptive trajectories through which&#xD;
      children learn to communicate their needs, engage in prosocial behaviour, and prepare for&#xD;
      learning opportunities at school and beyond. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed&#xD;
      striking pressure on parents' capacities to engage in consistently supportive interactions&#xD;
      due to factors such as limited childcare, financial strain, and poor mental health, which&#xD;
      each present risks for child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team of investigators designed the SPACE Program (Supporting Parent And Child Emotional&#xD;
      well-being) to directly and immediately respond to family needs, with the potential for&#xD;
      long-term impacts through its highly scalable approach. SPACE brings together best practices&#xD;
      in emotion-focused parenting in a format guided by our Parent Advisory Board and over 1000&#xD;
      families who described their unmet needs in our rapid-response Parenting During the Pandemic&#xD;
      survey. SPACE includes the provision of materials (i.e., psychoeducational videos and&#xD;
      hands-on emotion-focused activities) alongside a virtual and interactive, facilitator-led&#xD;
      parenting group to re-enforce skill acquisition and provide social support. The&#xD;
      investigators' mixed-methods assessments are designed to understand the impacts of SPACE&#xD;
      across multiple indicators of family function. The long-term goal is to create an accessible&#xD;
      evidence-based online parenting program to promote child emotional development and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three objectives for the SPACE parenting project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the benefits of the novel SPACE program on parenting stress and parenting quality&#xD;
           compared to services as usual (SAU): free provincial parenting resource guides and&#xD;
           parenting sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the extent to which the SPACE program impacts child emotion-regulation&#xD;
           development and if this relationship is mediated by parents' emotional and behavioural&#xD;
           change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify baseline factors linked to differential efficacy of SPACE. Hypothesis: SPACE&#xD;
           will have higher efficacy for improving outcomes for children who a) identify as girls,&#xD;
           b) exhibit higher cognitive performance, and c) exhibit greater cardiac flexibility.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will recruit a group of parents and primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, adoptive parents, grandparents) who report elevated levels of parenting stress (above the 50th percentile of population norms on the Parenting Stress Index), and are the legal guardians of a child in the 3- to 4-year-old age range. Those parents will be randomly assigned to one treatment condition or the control condition. Parents in the treatment condition will participate in an 8-week parenting program that includes a combination of activities, parenting training, as well as drop-in sessions with a trained psychology student (MA-level or higher) or psychologist. The control group will receive services-as-usual (referral list for online and telehealth parenting and family mental health services).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Parenting Stress Index - Short Form (PSI) is a 36-item self-report measure completed by parents to measure stress level within the context of parenting. Participants respond to items on a 5-point Likert scale. Responses to each item in a sub-category are totaled to calculate three subcategory scores, which are summed to represent a total parenting stress score. Higher scores indicate higher levels of parenting stress. Normal scores fall within the 15th to 85th percentile, and scores above the 85th percentile represent clinically elevated levels of stress.</description>

    <description>Child behaviour from pre-intervention to post-intervention: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A 25-item instrument developed to detect psychosocial problems in children aged 3-16 years. A value is given to each selection of &quot;not true,&quot; somewhat true,&quot; and &quot;certainly true.&quot; It measures five factors: emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention problems, peer problems, and prosocial behaviour. All subscales include five items and range from 0-10. A total score can be summed from the first four factors; the total score ranges from 0-40, with higher scores indicating greater difficulties. Scores on the fifth factor of prosocial behaviour range from 0-10, with a lower score on this scale being less favourable.</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) is a self-administered diagnostic instrument used to assess symptoms of major depressive disorder. The measure uses a 4-point Likert scale to assess the frequency of symptoms ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;nearly every day.&quot; A total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. This measure will be completed by participants weekly throughout the intervention.</description>

    <description>The Parenting Scale (PS) is a self-report measure of parenting style. The scale uses 30 items to assess various aspects of parenting/caregiving on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores are measured on a scale of 1-7 on each item, with 7 being less effective measures. The scale produces three subscale scores of Laxness (5-items), Overreactivity (5-items), and Verbosity (3-items), as well as a total score that includes all items. Scores are calculated by summing the items and dividing by the number of items to create a mean score; for example, the total score ranges from 1-7. Higher scores represent less effective parenting.</description>
