  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the histology of polyps per colonoscopy, offers a&#xD;
      promising solution to reduce variation in colonoscopy performance. This new and innovative&#xD;
      non-invasive technology will improve the quality of screening colonoscopies, and reduce the&#xD;
      costs of colorectal cancer screening. The aim of the study is to performed a cross-sectional,&#xD;
      multi-center study evaluating the diagnostic performance of the CAD EYE automatic&#xD;
      characterization system for the histology of colonic polyps in colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Deep learning to predict the histology of polyps per colonoscopy, offers a promising solution&#xD;
      to reduce variation in colonoscopy performance. Meanwhile, the concept of 'optical biopsy'&#xD;
      where in vivo classification of polyps based on enhanced imaging replaces histopathology has&#xD;
      not been incorporated into routine practice, largely limited by inter-observer variability&#xD;
      and generally meeting accepted standards only in expert settings. Real-time decision support&#xD;
      software has been developed to detect and characterise polyps, whilst also offering feedback&#xD;
      on the technical quality of inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the performance of the CAD EYE automatic characterization system for&#xD;
      the histology compared to histological analysis. And secondary aims : the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of the CAD EYE automated detection device compared to a standardized video&#xD;
      recording with blind independent review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The screening colonoscopy will be performed by an investigator. The automatic&#xD;
      detection and characterization system will be activated at the time of descent of the&#xD;
      colonoscopy (after caecal intubation), with video recording (image without CAD EYE and image&#xD;
      with CAD EYE). The investigator performing the colonoscopy will be blinded by the results of&#xD;
      the CAD EYE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: no specific follow-up is planned after colposcopy&#xD;

    <description>Estimation of the sensitivity of the automatic characterization system CAD EYE for the diagnosis of the malignant character of colonic polyps.&#xD;
The sensitivity is calculated as the proportion of polyps detected by the CAD EYE characterization system among all the polyps that will be classified as malignant by the pathological analysis.The sensitivity estimate will be accompanied by its two-sided 95% confidence interval according to the exact binomial distribution. The estimated proportion will be compared with the theoretical value of 85% (minimum level from which this new technique is considered to be of interest) by a unilateral Chi2 test if the validity conditions are met or by an exact Fisher test, at 2.5% alpha threshold.</description>
