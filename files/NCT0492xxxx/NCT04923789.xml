      This is a single center, prospective cohort study to to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(ASCT) bridging chimeric antigen receptor T&#xD;
      (CART) cell therapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(ASCT)&#xD;
      is still the standard salvage treatment for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      (R/R B-NHL). However, its overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of 3 years and&#xD;
      above are less than 50%. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy has shown great&#xD;
      efficacy in treating B-NHL in recent years. Preclinical studies have indicated that the&#xD;
      infusion of hematopoietic stem cells could promote the amplification and function of adoptive&#xD;
      metastatic anti-tumor CD8+T cells, providing a certain theoretical basis for ASCT combined&#xD;
      with CART cell therapy. In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASCT bridging CART&#xD;
      cell therapy in treating R/R B-NHL, we conduct this single center, prospective cohort study.&#xD;
