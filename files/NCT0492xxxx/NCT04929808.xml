  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Notwithstanding the continuous progress in cancer treatment, patients with cancer still have&#xD;
      to cope with quality of life (QoL) - impairing complications. Especially an extensive&#xD;
      spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with cancer treatments. The number&#xD;
      and type of cutaneous toxicities have evolved over the past 50 years, paralleling the&#xD;
      development of new radiotherapy (RT) techniques. Acute radiodermatitis (ARD) is a distressing&#xD;
      and painful skin reaction that occurs in 95% of the patients undergoing RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important organizations in the field of oncology and supportive care, such as the MASCC, the&#xD;
      ASCO, and the ESMO, have developed guidelines for the management of cancer therapy- related&#xD;
      cutaneous toxicities based on available scientific evidence. Still, for some interventions,&#xD;
      the evidence of recommendation is moderate to insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to&#xD;
      elucidate other new potential management strategies for dermatological complications of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Based on the previously mentioned supportive care guidelines for the RTskin&#xD;
      project, a novel emollient to tackle ARD has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RTskin project general aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel skincare product to&#xD;
      manage ARD in breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Primary objective Evaluate the efficacy of a novel emollient for the management of ARD in&#xD;
      comparison with the current standard of care in breast cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1 Compare the ARD-related symptoms of in breast cancer patients treated&#xD;
      with the novel emollient and the standard institutional skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2 Compare the dermatologic quality of life of in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with the novel emollient and the standard institutional skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 3 Correlate the severity of ARD with the applied RT parameters and&#xD;
      personal - medical characteristics&#xD;
