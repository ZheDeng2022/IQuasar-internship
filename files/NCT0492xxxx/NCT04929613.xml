  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First responders (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical system personnel) are&#xD;
      subjected to daily pressures from their duties with resultant compassion fatigue, burnout,&#xD;
      anger, poor mental and physical health, maladaptive behavior, and sleep disturbance. The&#xD;
      unprecedented heroin and opioid epidemic in West Virginia has accelerated the stresses as&#xD;
      these first responders witness overdoses and overdose death on a frequent basis. The plight&#xD;
      and suffering of children of the overdose victims is an additional overlooked element in the&#xD;
      stress on the first responder community. The proposed project will deliver mindfulness-based&#xD;
      resilience training to improve the mental and physical wellbeing, prevent compassion fatigue,&#xD;
      burnout, and attrition of first responders and performance improvement by reducing&#xD;
      predictable cognitive errors in the Charleston and Huntington areas and measure the effects&#xD;
      of this training on this population using validated questionnaires and salivary cortisol&#xD;
      before and after the training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      West Virginia (WV) is in the midst of an unprecedented opioid and heroin epidemic with&#xD;
      profound social, health, and economic consequences. This stress, especially among law&#xD;
      enforcement officials (LEOs), is often experienced within a context of excessive anger, which&#xD;
      decreases wellbeing and has the potential to negatively impact public wellbeing as well.&#xD;
      These public safety personnel are often left to manage stress and anger in a cultural context&#xD;
      that does not support help-seeking behavior and that encourages maladaptive coping&#xD;
      mechanisms. Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (MBRT) has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      improvement in self-reported mindfulness, resilience, perceived operational and&#xD;
      administrative stress, burnout, emotional intelligence, emotion regulation, mental and&#xD;
      physical health, anger, fatigue, and sleep disturbance Introducing effective evidence-based&#xD;
      training to first responders has the potential to improve well-being and decrease burnout and&#xD;
      improve the performance of the people who protect the community. Should this hypotheses be&#xD;
      confirmed, first responders in West Virginia will have an effective intervention to improve&#xD;
      resilience, address perceived stress and burnout, and lead to greater mental and physical&#xD;
      wellbeing in the face of unprecedented stresses associated with the opioid and heroin&#xD;
      epidemic. This would enable this intervention to be scaled across the state among other&#xD;
      populations of first responders in this unprecedented public health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First responders will be recruited from volunteers targeting leadership and thought leaders&#xD;
      at the frontline from the three-county area, but primarily from the cities of Charleston and&#xD;
      Huntington, to participate in one of two 2.5-day intensive MBRT training sessions. Each&#xD;
      2.5-day session will be coordinated with each agency to ensure maximum participation without&#xD;
      disrupting work schedules. Up to 35 participants will participate in each cohort. This study&#xD;
      aims to recruit 2 cohorts from the pool of first responders in the Cabell, Kanawha, and&#xD;
      Putnam Counties area for a minimum of 50 participants and maximum of 70 participants. Self&#xD;
      report measures will be conducted at time 0 (before the intervention), time 1 (after the&#xD;
      2.5-day intensive training), time 2 (4 weeks after the 2.5-day intensive training and after&#xD;
      the week 4 remote/virtual booster training) and at time 3 (90 days after the initial&#xD;
      intensive training).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mindfulness (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). It examines 5 key domains of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner experience, and nonreactivity to inner experience. Scores range from 39 to 195, with higher scores indicating greater tendency to be mindful.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness (MPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Mindfulness Process Questionnaire (MPQ) is an 8-item self-report measure that assesses the degree to which mindfulness is intentionally practiced or attempted and the ability to bring compassionate awareness to the present moment after observing the attention has drifted off or become judgmental. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert type scale ranging from &quot;not at all characteristic of me&quot; to &quot;entirely characteristic of me,&quot; and total scores range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater engagement in mindfulness practices and skills.</description>

    <measure>Change in Occupational Stress (PSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Police Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) (organizational [OPSQ] and operational [OPS] subscales) is a 40-item questionnaire consisting of 2 subscales measuring operational stressors (20 job content items) and organizational stressors (20 job context items) on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (no stress at all) to 7 (a lot of stress) and resulting in a maximum score of 140; higher scores indicate greater stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Occupational Stress (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS) is a 4-item scale used to assess perceived stress in life situations. Responses are on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often;&quot; higher scores indicate greater perceived stress, with a maximum score of 16.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotional Intelligence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS) is a 33-item scale of emotional intelligence. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and 3 items are reverse scored, producing a score range from 33 to 165. All items are summed to create a total score, and higher scores indicate greater emotional intelligence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotional Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 36-item measure that assesses clinically relevant difficulties in emotion regulation. Items range from 1 (&quot;almost never&quot;) to 5 (&quot;almost always), and the total score ranges from 36 to 180. Higher scores indicate greater difficulties with emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) is a 6-item scale designed to assess the ability to recover from stress using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 5 (strongly agree). Scores are summed, then divided by the total number of items, to produce a total score ranging from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate greater resilience.</description>

    <description>The General Family Functioning Subscale (GFF) consists of 12 items partly comprising the Family Assessment Device (FAD), a 60-item measure utilizing a 4-point Likert-type scale. Altogether, the FAD consists of 6 subscales; however, the GFF incorporates items from the 6 subscales and is commonly used an indicator of global family functioning. Higher scores on the GFF indicate more problematic family functioning, with a maximum score of 48.</description>
