    <textblock>
      The principal aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the Unified Protocol (UP) for the&#xD;
      treatment of the comorbid symptomatology of patients with Ultra High Risk (UHR) for&#xD;
      psychosis. The secondary aims would be to assess the effects of the intervention with the PU&#xD;
      on the subthreshold positive symptoms and the transition to psychosis rates at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up, insight, positive and negative emotions, quality of life, cognitive distortions,&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and the maintenance of the effects at the 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomised controlled trial in which a group will receive UP plus standard&#xD;
      intervention and the other one will be a control group that will receive treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator will be blind to the group that owns every patients. The sample will be 16&#xD;
      patients with UHR for psychosis and are visited at the PIPPEP of the CSMA Ripollet (PSSJD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will be performed at baseline, at the end of treatment and at six months&#xD;
      follow-up and will include: general psychopathology (SCID), anxiety and depression (BDI-II,&#xD;
      BAI), positive and negative emotions (PANAS), personality (NEO-FFI), functionality (EEASL,&#xD;
      MI), quality of life (QLI-sp), cognitive distortions (CBQ), insight (BCIS) and a scale of&#xD;
      satisfaction created ad-hoc. At the end of each session with the UP we will assess depression&#xD;
      and anxiety during the last week (ODSIS, OASIS). Treatment with the UP will consist in 15&#xD;
      group sessions of 8 patients, 120 minutes in addition to the treatment as usual at the First&#xD;
      Episode of Psychosis Programe, PIPPEP.The control group will consist in treatment as usual at&#xD;
      PIPPEP.&#xD;

      Main goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of PU in a group format for the treatment of comorbid symptoms&#xD;
      present in EMAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effects of PU intervention on subthreshold positive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the rates of transition to psychosis at 6 months in patients receiving PU group&#xD;
           intervention and compare them with those in the Control Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effect of PU treatment on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the effect of treatment on cognitive distortions and disease awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the effect of treatment on positive and negative emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate the effect of PU treatment on psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To know the levels of neuroticism and extraversion in EMAR patients and to study if they&#xD;
           constitute a modulating factor of the response to treatment with PU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Evaluate in the medium term the maintenance of the effects of treatment with PU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Evaluate the satisfaction of patients with the PU intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized clinical trial in which one group (Experimental Group) will&#xD;
      receive the intervention of the unified protocol (UP) for the transdiagnostic treatment of&#xD;
      emotional disorders in addition to the treatment as usual and the other group (Control Group)&#xD;
      will receive the treatment as usual of the Early Intervention Program for First Psychotic&#xD;
      Episodes (PIPPEP) exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PIPPEP is a care program that includes patients with a First Psychotic Episode (PEP), a&#xD;
      UHR for psychosis or who are in the Critical Period of the psychotic illness. The usual&#xD;
      treatment of PIPPEP is a multidisciplinary treatment in which psychiatric sessions, nursing,&#xD;
      social work and psychology are performed applying cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. The&#xD;
      frequency of visits can be weekly or fortnightly in the case of psychotherapy and the focus&#xD;
      of the intervention would be the sub-threshold positive symptoms. Traditional&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral techniques such as behavioral experiments, cognitive restructuring, or&#xD;
      exposure will be used as outlined in manuals created for this purpose. The usual duration of&#xD;
      the visits will be one hour and the format will be individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Experimental Group (GE) will receive the usual treatment of PIPPEP plus group&#xD;
      intervention from the PU for the transdiagnostic treatment of Emotional Disorders with a&#xD;
      total of 15 sessions of 2 hours of weekly frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the restrictions arising from the pandemic situation by COVID-19, the group&#xD;
      intervention will be in video conferencing format with a secure platform to maintain data&#xD;
      protection. To ensure the adequacy of the GE intervention, the number of patients will be 5.&#xD;
      Thus, recruitment will be done in two phases: 10 patients at first (5 in the GC and 5 in the&#xD;
      GE) and 10 patients in a second moment (5 in the GC and 5 in the GE), once the first group&#xD;
      intervention was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videoconferencing method will be secure and the personal data of the participants will be&#xD;
      protected. The platform method that the Foundation San Joan de Deu will use is appropriate&#xD;
      and contemplates the data protection regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized for inclusion in the experimental or control group using a list&#xD;
      of random numbers and will be assigned according to the order of collection. The evaluator&#xD;
      will be blind to the group to which the evaluated patient belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fidelity to the PU treatment protocol will be guaranteed through regular supervision with an&#xD;
      accredited therapist (Dr. Jorge Osma, University of Zaragoza).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychiatric medication prescribed for the patients in the study will be monitored, as&#xD;
      well as any changes that may be made during the time of the study.&#xD;
