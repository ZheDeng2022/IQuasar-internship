  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On February 25th, 2019, ITALFARMACO launched Nuperal® in Italy, an association of doxylamine&#xD;
      succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride authorized by AIFA for the symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). This drug is also recommended as first choice drug&#xD;
      therapy by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Guidelines and is&#xD;
      supported by extensive international literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous epidemiological researches conducted in the US and Norway have highlighted the&#xD;
      extent of vomiting and pregnant nausea. Unfortunately to date, there are no information on&#xD;
      the prevalence of this phenomenon in Italy, on its impact on women's lives and on the&#xD;
      interaction between woman and gynecologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis of the present survey is that, using a representative sample of&#xD;
      pregnant women in Italy, it will be possible to identify the prevalence and weight of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting symptoms during pregnancy in this country. The study is an open,&#xD;
      non-comparative, multicenter survey and the aim is to evaluate the prevalence and weight that&#xD;
      the symptoms of nausea and vomiting have in pregnant women in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 600 women found during weeks 18-22 of pregnancy who will&#xD;
      arrive at the three sites or will contact the Investigators after the Ethics Committee (EC)&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
