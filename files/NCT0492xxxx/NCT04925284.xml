             therapies are intolerable or no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort-Expansion Stage Cohort B (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer): Subjects with Stage IV&#xD;
             NSCLC who have documented radiographic disease progression during or following their&#xD;
             last systemic anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
