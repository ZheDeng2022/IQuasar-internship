  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis or scleroderma is an autoimmune condition that cause thickening and&#xD;
      hardening of the skin, but can also affect internal organs. There are two major subsets of&#xD;
      scleroderma: the limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) that usually affects the skin&#xD;
      of the face, neck, lower legs or lower arms, but can also lead to internal organ&#xD;
      complications, and the diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) that may affect blood&#xD;
      circulation and internal organs, as well as the skin. To date there is no drug that has been&#xD;
      definitively proven to cure or modify the course of scleroderma. However, there is emerging&#xD;
      evidence that immunosuppression and specifically mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may be&#xD;
      beneficial in lcSSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MINIMISE-Pilot trial would be an important first step to evaluate the risk and potential&#xD;
      benefit to this disease group. MMF as the intervention of choice is both appropriate and&#xD;
      timely, as it has been routinely used in the management of dcSSc. The aim of this pilot trial&#xD;
      is to explore whether the immunosuppressive agent MMF can slow down disease progression in&#xD;
      patients with lcSSc compared to the current standard of care alone. This pilot trial will&#xD;
      also provide critical information for the development of a future large trial that could&#xD;
      potentially transform lcSSc patient management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The MINIMISE-Pilot trial aims to explore whether the immunosuppressive agent mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF) at a target dose of 2g daily can slow down disease progression in patients with&#xD;
      limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) compared to the current standard of care alone.&#xD;
      This pilot trial will also provide critical information for the development of a future large&#xD;
      trial that could potentially transform lcSSc patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label randomised prospective trial that will recruit 120 participants aged 18&#xD;
      and older with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis across 13 sites in the UK. Following a&#xD;
      screening visit, eligible participants will attend a baseline visit where they will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into one of two groups; MMF or Control. Those in the first group are given&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) taken daily by mouth for up to 96 weeks, in addition to their&#xD;
      background Standard of Care medication for SSc related symptoms. Those in the second group&#xD;
      will not receive any MMF but will remain on their standard of care medication alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are expected to be followed up for a minimum of 48 weeks or a maximum of 96&#xD;
      weeks. The trial will involve five (5) clinic visits which are expected to be carried out at&#xD;
      the same time of the participants' normal hospital appointment with their scleroderma&#xD;
      specialist. Participants from both groups will have the same assessments. Participants are&#xD;
      expected to return to the clinics at Week 24, 48, 72 and 96. However, participants allocated&#xD;
      to the MMF group will have additional blood samples taken for safety monitoring every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks for the following 12 weeks. Thereafter, every 12&#xD;
      weeks up to their final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will receive four (4) routine telephone calls in between their clinic&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
