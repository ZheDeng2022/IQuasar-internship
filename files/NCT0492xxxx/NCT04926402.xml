    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental and longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the kangaroo care education program (KCEP) on Mothers, Nurses, and Infants Outcomes in a&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Forty-eight mother-infant dyads were enrolled per arm in the&#xD;
      control and experimental groups. The control group received standard routine care, while the&#xD;
      experimental group received a maternal kangaroo care education program.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kangaroo care (KC) is a simple, low cost and highly effective evidence-based nursing&#xD;
      intervention that can benefit from mother-infant bonding attachment. Most mothers of&#xD;
      premature infants will experience stress being separated from their premature infants.&#xD;
      Bonding with premature infants will develop their brain and also make them feel loved, safe,&#xD;
      and secure. Therefore, KC will help in bonding attachment, increase weight gain, decrease&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increase breastfeeding rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of two programs; a nursing education program&#xD;
      and a mother education program regarding KC techniques on mothers, nurses, and infant&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of two designs: Quasi-experimental and longitudinal designs with&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires were carried out to evaluate mothers, nurses, and infant&#xD;
      outcomes using the Kangaroo Care Questionnaires Survey (KCQs) and Parental Stressor Scale:&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Parental and Relationship (PSS: NICU: P&amp;R) at a neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) of a Malaysian teaching hospital in Klang Valley. The kangaroo&#xD;
      care education program (KC-EP) included theoretical and practical sessions on the KC benefits&#xD;
      and hands-on KC techniques. The study consisted of three phases: Phase I (n=48 mother-infants&#xD;
      dyads) in the control group, Phase II (n=47 nurses - KC-EP), and Phase III (n=48&#xD;
      mother-infants dyads-KC-EP) in the experimental group. Data collection for mothers and&#xD;
      infants occurred at various time points during the study; pre-intervention (T0) post -&#xD;
      1-month intervention (T1) and post - 3-month intervention (T2). For the nursing outcomes&#xD;
      occurred before and after the 7th day of the intervention program. The results were analyzed&#xD;
      using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences(SPSS) version 23. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      were used to analyze the demographic data and items of the questionnaire. GLM univariate and&#xD;
      repeated measure analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test for mean&#xD;
      comparison between control and experimental groups at (T0, T1, and T2).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, and 3- month.</time_frame>
    <description>The respondents were asked to answer 20 items on perceptions of KC. A 5-point Likert scale was used (strongly disagree-1 to strongly agree-5). A lower mean score reflecting a better perception of KC.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline knowledge of KC at 1-month and 3-month among the mothers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, and 3- month.</time_frame>
    <description>The respondents were asked to answer 11 items on knowledge of KC. They were given 'true', 'false', and 'not sure' to indicate their knowledge of KC, with higher mean scores indicating a better level of knowledge</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline perceived barrier to KC at 1-month and 3-month among the mothers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, and 3- month.</time_frame>
    <description>The respondents were asked to answer 19 items on perceived barriers to practicing KC. The scale ranged from very influential (5) to not influential at all (1). A lower mean score of perceived barriers means the mothers are very positive.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline perceived stress at 1-month and 3-month among the mothers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, and 3- month.</time_frame>
    <description>The respondents were asked to answer 19 items on perceived stress level. A 5-point Likert scale ranging from not at all stressful (1) to extremely stressful (5), to reflect the level of stress faced by mothers with their premature infant's admission into the NICU. The lower the mean stress scores reported by the mothers, the lower the stress level.</description>
