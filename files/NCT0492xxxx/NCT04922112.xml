  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly recognized in patients with squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The prevalence prior and after cancer therapy is not&#xD;
      well understood. OSA is identified as a contributing factor for daytime somnolence and&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL), yet treatment of OSA in the SCCHN population has not been studied. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to identify the disease course of sleep apnea, risk factors for&#xD;
      development, and impact on QOL with treatment of OSA in a population of patients with SCCHN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study of enrolled patients seen in&#xD;
      initial consultation by our H&amp;N cancer surgeons and/or Radiation Oncologists either at AMC or&#xD;
      HRH. Data collected from patients in the form of quality of life and sleep questionnaires and&#xD;
      home sleep study (Alice Night One System by Phillips Respironics), as well as data from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record will be coded into RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection for inflammatory biomarkers will occur during routine laboratory workup to&#xD;
      avoid unnecessary phlebotomy whenever possible. Blood laboratory specimens of the&#xD;
      inflammatory markers will be centrifuged to plasma and stored at -80C in freezers located on&#xD;
      the Anschutz campus in Research Complex 2 on the 7th floor. Patients who require tracheostomy&#xD;
      will be included in this study but will not have any sleep study time-point as indicated.&#xD;
      Patients who are identified to have OSA will undergo counseling and treatment as per standard&#xD;
      of care. CPAP compliance data will be collected every three months after initiation of OSA&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient details including demographics, treatment information such as surgery, radiation, and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, sleep and quality of life questionnaire data, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and&#xD;
      sleep study results will collected. The RedCap database will be maintained by the PI, or&#xD;
      their delegate of the present study, and all persons utilizing the RedCap database for&#xD;
      purposes of entering data will be included on the Delegation of Authority.&#xD;
