  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can be at higher risk of developing abnormal&#xD;
      areas in their bowel. These abnormal areas can be due to active inflammation, healed&#xD;
      inflammation, polyps or pre-cancerous changes (&quot;dysplasia&quot;). It is for this reason that&#xD;
      people with IBD are offered periodic surveillance colonoscopy procedures to identify,&#xD;
      characterize and where necessary remove abnormal areas or lesions from the bowel. These can&#xD;
      be difficult to characterize correctly, which is important to make the correct endoscopic&#xD;
      diagnosis and management plan. Technical advancements in endoscopy mean that more tools are&#xD;
      available to identify and characterize these lesions in real time during colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Specialists regularly performing gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy (&quot;endoscopists&quot;)&#xD;
      will often receive special training, both during their initial postgraduate training and&#xD;
      through continuous professional development programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether an online training platform can improve the ability of&#xD;
      endoscopists to characterize dysplasia in IBD. The goal is to support improved&#xD;
      decision-making during IBD surveillance, reporting of dysplastic lesions, and ultimately the&#xD;
      care and outcomes of people with IBD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether an online training platform can improve the ability of&#xD;
      endoscopists to characterise dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to ultimately&#xD;
      improve decision-making, reporting of dysplastic lesions and management during IBD&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy (endoscopic examination of the lower bowel) is a well-established screening tool&#xD;
      to identify lesions within the bowel and objectively assess the degree of inflammation&#xD;
      present. Patients with IBD, both Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), have a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing cancers of the bowel and it is for this reason that they undergo&#xD;
      regular surveillance procedures. Guidelines recommend surveillance procedures using high&#xD;
      definition white light endoscopy alongside either Dye-Based Chromoendoscopy (DCE) or Virtual&#xD;
      Chromoendoscopy (VCE), with targeted biopsies. However, the real world adoption of DCE and&#xD;
      VCE is still modest. Due to technological advances there are alternative endoscopic imaging&#xD;
      techniques that selectively enhance certain mucosal and vascular features, including&#xD;
      narrow-band imaging (NBI), i-Scan optical enhancement (i-Scan-OE) and blue laser imaging&#xD;
      (BLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These technologies have been demonstrated to be more effective than standard white light&#xD;
      endoscopy. Despite these advances in technology, detecting dysplasia within areas of&#xD;
      inflammation due to IBD is challenging. An endoscopic classification was recently developed&#xD;
      by Iacucci M et al called &quot;FACILE&quot; to characterise in detail the mucosal and vascular pattern&#xD;
      to predict histological colonic lesions in IBD. Since traditional lesion assessment systems&#xD;
      such as (unmodified) Kudo pit pattern are less reliable in IBD, there is a need for a robust&#xD;
      scoring system to assist clinicians in detecting and characterising lesions in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is to validate a training module on surveillance and colonic lesion&#xD;
      characterisation in IBD. We aim to compare polyp detection in IBD surveillance procedures&#xD;
      before and after training and evaluate the impact. As a sub-study, an additional&#xD;
      randomisation process will take place whereby one group will receive additional focused&#xD;
      top-up training and the other group will not. We will seek to compare the impact of feedback&#xD;
      on knowledge retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1. Potential participants are provided an electronic PIS outlining the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2. Participants consent to the study and complete the pre-training assessment on&#xD;
           REDCap (1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 3. Participants are provided with login details for online training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 4. Participants complete the online training in their own time (1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 5. Participants complete the same assessment (as pre-training) and are given 1-2&#xD;
           weeks to complete this after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study: Participants are randomised 1:1 to either receive or not receive a short&#xD;
           refresher training module (15 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 6. After 8-12 weeks post-training participants are invited to complete the same&#xD;
           assessment process (as pre-training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive computer-based training. Training will take place via an online&#xD;
      computer- based self-learning platform. The training will include reviewing short videos of&#xD;
      colorectal polyps in patients with IBD and videos of inflammation in IBD (quiescent, mild,&#xD;
      moderate and severe) using NBI, i-Scan-OE and BLI. Patients were consented for the use of the&#xD;
      use of videos for educational purposes. Videos used have been fully anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants are given access to the secure REDCap platform hosted at the University of&#xD;
      Birmingham. Participants will be required to register using a general survey to include their&#xD;
      email address, anonymised demographic data, procedural experience and familiarity with&#xD;
      optical endoscopic diagnosis platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants comprise three categories: novice, training endoscopist and experienced&#xD;
      endoscopist. The latter two are the key categories for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Novice will include medical students and junior doctors/residents who have previously&#xD;
           had no or little endoscopic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training endoscopists will be gastroenterology and general surgery&#xD;
           trainees/residents/fellows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experienced endoscopists will be fully qualified endoscopists such as GI and general&#xD;
           surgery staff, consultants and nurse endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete pre-training assessment prior to e-learning training. There&#xD;
      are 26 video clips representative of different types of colonic lesions in IBD. Each video&#xD;
      clip is typically 20-30 seconds. The overall duration of the assessment is around one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be given a login for the online training material and will complete&#xD;
      this in their own time. Participants will be taught on endoscopic surveillance in IBD and how&#xD;
      to characterise polyps accurately. The duration of the training module is 1 hour. It is&#xD;
      interactive with optional components for tailored self-directed learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-training assessment will be completed in the next 1-2 weeks, using the same video&#xD;
      clips, allowing us to compare the performance of participants before and after training. The&#xD;
      assessment will be repeated after 8-12 weeks to assess the retention of skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional randomisation process on a 1:1 basis will take place, whereby one group will&#xD;
      receive additional short refresher training following their responses to assessment questions&#xD;
      and the other group will not. We will seek to compare the impact of feedback on&#xD;
      sustainability of knowledge retention.&#xD;
