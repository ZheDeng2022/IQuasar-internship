      This study is a randomized control trial and it was conducted to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      pretreatment with lignocaine versus midazolam on the frequency of myoclonus associated with&#xD;
      etomidate induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was conducted in Holy Family Hospital Rawalpindi in a period of 6 months.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anaesthesia is loss of consciousness induced after administration of one or more&#xD;
      general anaesthetic agent with overall aim of inducing sleep, amnesia, analgesia and skeletal&#xD;
      muscles relaxation. Choosing an induction agent is a very vital step in commencing general&#xD;
      anaesthesia1. Use of sedatives can prevent or minimize potentially harmful physiologic&#xD;
      affects of airway manipulation that include increase in heart rate, BP, and raised&#xD;
      intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etomidate, imidazole-derived, sedative-hypnotic agent, blocks neuroexcitation by its direct&#xD;
      action on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor complex1.Because of its many desirable&#xD;
      properties like rapid onset of action, profound hypnosis, minimal histamine release,&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability, minimal respiratory depression, and favorable cerebral effects,&#xD;
      etomidate is considered as an ideal induction agent2. Concerns with etomidate include adrenal&#xD;
      suppression and myoclonus3, 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 to 60% of unpremedicated patients develop myoclonic movements after an induction dose (0.3&#xD;
      mg/kg) of etomidate1. Myoclonus is described as the involuntary contraction of some muscle&#xD;
      fibers, leading to short observable movements of the body, more pronounced with the limbs5.&#xD;
      In emergency scenarios, myoclonus can lead to increment in the chances of regurgitation and&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various drugs like Lignocaine, Midazolam, Magnesium, Dezocine and dexmedetomidine have been&#xD;
      used as pretreatment for reducing myoclonus after etomidate injection but the best drug for&#xD;
      the purpose is yet to be discovered6, 7, 8, 9. Ideally a pretreatment drug should be&#xD;
      short-acting, should affect respiration and hemodynamic minimally, and should not prolong the&#xD;
      recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lignocaine belongs to amide group of local anaesthetics.Lignocaine alters signal conduction&#xD;
      in neuronal cell membrane8. Various studies have been conducted on lignocaine being used as a&#xD;
      pretreatment drug; before propofol induction to reduce pain or etomidate to prevent myoclonus&#xD;
      associated with etomidateinduction6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam, a benzodiazepine, produce a calming effect on the brain and nerves 1, 10. Its&#xD;
      various favorable effects include antiepileptic properties, anxiolysis, sedation, reduced&#xD;
      attention and amnesia7. In a comparative study conducted by Singh KA (initials for first and&#xD;
      second name of the author) et al, effect of pretreatment with lignocaine, midazolam and&#xD;
      placebo were compared in prevention of etomidate induced myoclonus and the incidence was&#xD;
      found to be 44%, 28% and 76% respectively5 (P&lt;0.05). However, none of these studies have been&#xD;
      conducted in Pakistan. The basic aim of my study is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      pretreatment with Lignocaine versus Midazolam on the frequency of myoclonus associated with&#xD;
      etomidate induction, generate data regarding the effects, so that the more effective drug can&#xD;
      be used routinely for the prevention of myoclonus associated with etomidate induction in&#xD;
      routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining approval from the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent, 112&#xD;
      patient were recruited according to selection criteria in each group. All patients were&#xD;
      assessed a day before surgery for anaesthesia fitness. Patient were prepared by fasting (8 h&#xD;
      for solid foods, 4 hours for clear fluids).Patient were randomly divided into two equal&#xD;
      groups by computer-generated numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A received 1 ml of 2% lignocaine 2 min before induction with etomidate and Group B&#xD;
      received 1 ml (1mg) of midazolam 2 min before induction with etomidate. On reaching the&#xD;
      operating theater, standard monitoring were placed on all the participants, which included&#xD;
      pulse oximeter, ECG and non-invasive blood pressure. A 20 G cannula with an intravenous line&#xD;
      was maintained with 0.9% saline. Vitals such as pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation were recorded and taken as baseline readings. All patients were then&#xD;
      preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Patients were divided randomly into two groups of&#xD;
      112 using computer generated random numbers. Group I received 1 ml of 2% lignocaine, and&#xD;
      group II received 1 ml of midazolam (1 mg). The test solutions were prepared in coded&#xD;
      syringes and were administered 2 min before etomidate induction (0.3 mg/kg) by an observer&#xD;
      who was blinded to the allocation of the groups as well as the drug given to him. The time to&#xD;
      the loss of eyelash reflex was recorded as the onset of induction, and an additional dose of&#xD;
      etomidate was administered if necessary. The patients were observed continuously for&#xD;
      myoclonic movements. The time of onset and the duration of myoclonus was observed. One minute&#xD;
      post IV injection of etomidate and the observation of myoclonus, 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine&#xD;
      was administered to allow endotracheal tube placement. The vitals were observed after&#xD;
      administration of test solution, after induction, and after endotracheal intubation every&#xD;
      minute for five minutes, then every five minutes for fifteen minutes, and then every fifteen&#xD;
      minutes till the surgery ends. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (0.5-1%) and&#xD;
      atracurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected on a standardized Proforma and analyze using SPSS-17 version (Statistical&#xD;
      package for the social sciences). Mean Â± SD (standard deviation) was calculated for&#xD;
      quantitative variables lik age, weight and BMI. Qualitative variables like gender, myoclonus&#xD;
      wer expressed as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square was used to compare th frequency of&#xD;
      myoclonus in two groups. A P value less than 0.05 was consider statistically significant.&#xD;
      Effect modifiers like age and gender were controlled b stratification. Post-stratification&#xD;
      Chi-square test was applied.&#xD;
