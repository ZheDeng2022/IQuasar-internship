  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work by a number of scientific teams has revealed that the types of bacteria that&#xD;
      colonize the mouth differ between health and pre-cancerous or cancerous oral lesions. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the extent of these changes and to correlate the&#xD;
      changes with alterations in the activities of the host's own oral tissues. In doing so, we&#xD;
      believe we can gain a better understanding of how particular bacterial species, or consortia&#xD;
      of species, can result in an individual having an increased risk of the most common type of&#xD;
      oral cancer -- oral squamous cell carcinoma. This knowledge may also lead to the&#xD;
      identification of salivary biomarkers that can be used for clinical evaluation or screening.&#xD;
      In addition, we seek to determine the extent to which a probiotic regimen can help prevent or&#xD;
      rectify the disease-related changes in the types of bacterial colonizing the mouth. The&#xD;
      microbiome in health, pre-cancerous lesions, and cancerous lesions will be determined from&#xD;
      remnant microbial DNA in banked tissue samples. The effects of probiotics on the oral&#xD;
      microbiome will be determined from DNA collected from swabs of oral tissue at baseline and&#xD;
      then after 3 to 6 months of probiotic usage.&#xD;
