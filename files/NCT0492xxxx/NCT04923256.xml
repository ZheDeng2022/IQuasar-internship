  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a&#xD;
      smart phone delivered form of cognitive training intervention (Approach Bias Modification&#xD;
      (ABM)) in a non-clinical community sample of middle to older adults (&gt;55 years) reporting&#xD;
      hazardous alcohol use in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). This app is called&#xD;
      AAT-APP+&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use in older adults is of particular concern, with the 55-74 year old cohort most&#xD;
      likely to exceed lifetime alcohol risk. Approach Bias Modification (ABM) is a form of&#xD;
      computerised cognitive training that is an efficacious intervention for alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
      Previous studies are limited in that the stimuli are not personalised, nor are interventions&#xD;
      readily accessible to non-treatment seeking problem drinkers. This has led to the development&#xD;
      of a world-first, smart phone version of ABM called AAT-APP+&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of AAT-APP+ in reducing alcohol consumption and cravings in a pilot RCT with a&#xD;
      non-clinical community sample of 100 older adults (aged 55+ years) reporting hazardous&#xD;
      alcohol use (i.e. a score of 8+ on the AUDIT), recruited via targeted advertising.&#xD;
      Participants in active training will upload (or select pre-selected) photos of beverages and&#xD;
      meaningful activities, which will form the 'avoid' and 'approach' stimuli, respectively, then&#xD;
      complete two training sessions per week for four weeks, with results compared to controls.&#xD;
      AAT-APP+ holds promise as an innovate, cost-effective, and remotely accessible adjunctive&#xD;
      support tool.&#xD;
