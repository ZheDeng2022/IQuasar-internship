  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan-hziy in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (cyclophosphamide, N-803, and PD-L1&#xD;
      t-haNK) in subjects with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) after at least 2 prior&#xD;
      treatments for metastatic disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In part 1 of phase 1b, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at dose level 1&#xD;
      and will be assessed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Dose level cohorts for sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan-hziy are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (7.5 mg/kg IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 2: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (10 mg/kg IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1 (if needed): Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (5.0 mg/kg IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 2 of phase 1b, dose expansion will occur when the RP2D has been determined. An&#xD;
      additional 4 subjects may be enrolled, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the RP2D.&#xD;
      Following part 2 of the phase 1b portion of the study, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will&#xD;
      meet to determine if enrollment into phase 2 should proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 portion of the study, 22 subjects will be enrolled at the RP2D in the first&#xD;
      stage of Simon's two stage optimal design. If ≥ 9 of 22 subjects exhibit a confirmed&#xD;
      response, the study will proceed to the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study proceeds to the second stage, an additional 41 subjects will be enrolled for a&#xD;
      total of 63 subjects in the phase 2. If ≥ 27 of the 63 subjects exhibit a confirmed response,&#xD;
      the combination therapy will be considered for further development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects may receive up to 17 cycles (ie, 51 weeks) of treatment administered in 3-week&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

             human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression and/or amplification&#xD;
             (IHC 0 or 1+, or IHC 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]-), according to&#xD;
             American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP)&#xD;
             guideline criteria, as evaluated by local institutions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion of ≥ 1.0 cm and/or non-measurable disease evaluable&#xD;
             in accordance with RECIST V1.1.&#xD;

             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 5 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of study treatment. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom while on&#xD;
             study and for up to 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Effective&#xD;
             contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation), two&#xD;
             forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide, intrauterine&#xD;
             devices (IUDs), oral contraceptives, and abstinence.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Have previously received or are currently receiving treatment with sacituzumab&#xD;
             govitecan-hziy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the&#xD;
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for&#xD;
             treatment-related complications.&#xD;
