      This is a multicenter study, which is aimed to investigate the efficacy of the Ivermectin&#xD;
      drug in high risk COVID-19 patients. This study will compare Ivermectin treatment efficacy&#xD;
      with standard of care alone. Target cohort is mild to moderate symptomatic Covid-19 (Stage&#xD;
      2-3), high risk patients aged 50 years and above with comorbidity, who presented to hospitals&#xD;
      within first 7 days of illness.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of Ivermectin in preventing progression of Covid-19 to severe&#xD;
      disease (clinical stage 4 or 5), which is defined as severe pneumonia requiring oxygen&#xD;
      supplement or critically ill requiring intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of Ivermectin in reducing mortality rate among high risk COVID-19&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare difference in resolution of symptoms, chest radiograph, laboratory&#xD;
           investigations, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study Type and Design This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial involving COVID-19 designated hospitals in Malaysia. Patients are randomized&#xD;
      at ratio of 1:1 to groups receiving ivermectin for 5 days plus standard-of-care versus&#xD;
      standard-of-care only. Patients will be assigned to stratified randomized treatments based on&#xD;
      a central, computer-generated randomization scheme coordinated by an independent third party.&#xD;
      Based on national guidelines, all high risk COVID-19 patients will be admitted to hospitals,&#xD;
      and allow discharge once criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of ivermectin dose and duration in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose regimens used in various randomized control trials with positive results range from&#xD;
      0.2mg/kg single dose to 0.6mg/kg/day for 5 days 10-15. PK/PD studies have shown that the&#xD;
      antiviral effect of Ivermectin is dose dependent 9,15. As SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks during&#xD;
      the first week of illness and may prolong in severe disease 18, we believe a high dose of&#xD;
      ivermectin 0.4mg/kg/day for 5 days would be reasonable and safe to achieve our study&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current Malaysian guidelines, standard of care for mild to moderate Covid-19&#xD;
      patients includes isolation, infection control, close monitoring (clinical findings,&#xD;
      laboratory tests, chest imaging) and symptomatic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The population for this clinical trial will be comprised of adults with a&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to any of the&#xD;
      participating hospitals. Participants who&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment group: Ivermectin 0.4mg/kg/day for 5 days + standard-of-care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: Standard-of-care only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Identification of eligible participants will be done prospectively at each study&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sample size calculation was performed using ScalexProp Version 1.0.2 (Naing,&#xD;
      2016). The calculation is based on superiority trial design and the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      of the need to have supplemental oxygen therapy during the hospital admission. We regard a 9%&#xD;
      difference between intervention arm and control arm as a clinically important outcome. Based&#xD;
      on local data, 17.5% of COVID-19 aged 50 years and above, with stage 2 and 3 disease and&#xD;
      comorbidity, progressed to severe disease 3. The need of supplemental oxygen therapy is&#xD;
      expected to be about 8.8% in intervention arm and 17.5% in control arm. With a margin of&#xD;
      superiority set to be 1%, the study requires 231 patients for each arm or in total 462&#xD;
      patients. Considering potential dropouts during the trial, we would require up to 500&#xD;
      patients or 250 patients each arm. The sample size provides a level of significance at 5%&#xD;
      with 80% power (2-sided test).&#xD;
