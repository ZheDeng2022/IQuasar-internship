    <textblock>
      The American Diabetes Association recommends implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      (DPP) in subjects with prediabetes. In the DPP, weight reduction was the main predictor of a&#xD;
      lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), each kilogram lost was related with 16% lower&#xD;
      incidence. However, the effectiveness of the DPP in primary care settings is lower than the&#xD;
      original study. A meta-analysis of 36 pragmatic clinical trials of DPP in primary care&#xD;
      settings showed a reduction in T2D incidence by 26%, less than half than the original study&#xD;
      (58%), with a pooled mean weight loss 1.57 kg higher than standard care, demonstrating the&#xD;
      large difficulties to reduce weight of participants at community levels. Total diet&#xD;
      replacement (TDR) with low-energy liquid-diet or solid diet (825-853 kcal/day) is an&#xD;
      effective strategy to reduce weight. The effectiveness of an intervention including initial&#xD;
      rapid weight loss before starting the DPP is ignored in primary care levels in Venezuela. We&#xD;
      aim: 1- To compare the weight loss achieved of two lifestyle intervention programs in a&#xD;
      community health center of Venezuela: a) A hybrid lifestyle including rapid weight loss with&#xD;
      total diet replacement (TDR), then medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and the DPP, VS b) only&#xD;
      the DPP; 2- To evaluate the change of cardiometabolic risk factors between groups; 3- To&#xD;
      evaluate the implementation process. Our hypothesis is: after six months of intervention,&#xD;
      subjects receiving a hybridized lifestyle (TDR+MNT+DPP) will double the weight loss of those&#xD;
      that only receive DPP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Venezuela, mortality for cardiovascular disease (CVD) was responsible for 30.5% of all&#xD;
      deaths, increasing by 8.3% since 2007 to 2017. The prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors&#xD;
      in the country is also increasing. The investigators led two cross-sectional surveys in&#xD;
      Venezuela, the VEMSOLS, evaluating 1320 adults between 2006 to 2010, and the EVESCAM, a&#xD;
      national representative sample of 3420 adults, from 2014 to 20178, and the change of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors prevalence was hypertension from 30.0% to 34.1%, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome from 35.7% to 42.2%, diabetes from 8.0% to 12.3%, and prediabetes from 14.4% to&#xD;
      34.9%. Prediabetes increased 242% in a decade, from 2.4 to 7 million of adults, estimating&#xD;
      that 1.7 million of adults could advance to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the next 3 to 5 years&#xD;
      The American Diabetes Association recommends implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      (DPP) in subjects with prediabetes. This program aims weight reduction increasing physical&#xD;
      activity and healthy eating. In controlled settings, DPP has consistently proved to reduce&#xD;
      T2D incidence by 58%, with long term benefits. However, to translate this effectiveness to&#xD;
      primary care settings is a major challenge. In Latin America, two studies on T2D prevention&#xD;
      were done at the same time, funded by an International Diabetes Federation (IDF) initiative,&#xD;
      with contradictory results. In Venezuela, Florez et al. implemented a Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) using the US-DPP version, with a multidisciplinary team, on 140 adults with&#xD;
      prediabetes and overweight, to receive standard care vs. lifestyle intervention (LSI), during&#xD;
      two-years. LSI group lost more than 10% of basal weight compared with 2.3% in the standard&#xD;
      care group (p&lt; 0.001), none developed T2D compared with 6% of the crude cumulative incidence&#xD;
      of T2D in the standard care group (p&lt;0.05)15, and lipid profile and cardiovascular health&#xD;
      score also improved. Contrarily, in Colombia, Barengo et al implemented the Finnish Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Study (DPS) in primary health care centers, provided by specialists in physical&#xD;
      activity and nutritionists on 772 adults with prediabetes, randomly assigned to LSI vs.&#xD;
      standard care during two-years. Metabolic components, reversion to normoglycemia and T2D&#xD;
      incidence were similar between groups. A meta-analysis of 36 pragmatic clinical trials of&#xD;
      diabetes prevention programs in primary care settings showed a reduction in T2D incidence by&#xD;
      26%, less than half than the original studies (58%). In these studies LSI only showed a&#xD;
      pooled mean weight loss 1.57 kg higher than standard care, demonstrating the large&#xD;
      difficulties to reduce the weight of participants at community levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team is leading in Venezuela a transculturalization process incorporating multiple&#xD;
      validated components to significantly improve the effectiveness of preventive medicine&#xD;
      initiatives for T2D, and by extension, positively impact T2D incidence, prevalence, quality&#xD;
      of life, and health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent T2D effectively, LSI programs need to induce weight loss. In the DPP, weight&#xD;
      reduction was the main predictor of a lower incidence of T2D, each kilogram lost was related&#xD;
      with 16% lower incidence. Total diet replacement (TDR) with low-energy liquid-diet or solid&#xD;
      diet (825-853 kcal/day) is an effective strategy to reduce weight. In the PREVIEW study, 2224&#xD;
      participants with prediabetes and obesity received a low energy diet during 8-week and&#xD;
      presented a mean weight loss of 10.7 ± 0.4 kg, and 83.5% achieved the target of ≥8% weight&#xD;
      reduction, and expected incidence of T2D at three-year was only 4%, independent on the&#xD;
      intervention used post-weight-loss. However, the effectiveness of intervention including an&#xD;
      initial rapid weight loss in primary care levels in Venezuela is ignored. In order to improve&#xD;
      the effectiveness of T2D prevention programs the following objectives are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the weight loss achieved with two LSI programs in a community health center&#xD;
           of Venezuela: a) A hybrid LSI including rapid weight loss with total diet replacement&#xD;
           (TDR), followed by medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and the DPP protocol, vs b) only the&#xD;
           DPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the change of cardiometabolic risk factors between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the implementation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is: after six months of intervention, subjects receiving a hybridized LSI&#xD;
      (TDR+MNT+DPP) will double the weight loss of those that only receive DPP (This is based on&#xD;
      the pilot study - see below). If this outcome is achieved, it will have an enormous impact in&#xD;
      the way that the DPP should be provided in the primary health care systems in developing&#xD;
      countries, increasing the effectiveness of weight reduction, and in consequence, improving&#xD;
      cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach Design: A pragmatic mix trial was designed with two groups a) subjects receiving a&#xD;
      hybridized LSI (TDR-MNT-DPP) and b) only DPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: Community members will be invited to a medical screening at the community health&#xD;
      care center. Those with high risk will be identified using the Latin America Finish Diabetes&#xD;
      Risk Score (LA-FINRISC). The LA-FINDRISC is a non-invasive tool that includes age, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), waist circumference, physical activity, daily consumption of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, history of hyperglycemia, history of antihypertensive drug treatment, and family&#xD;
      history of diabetes, assigning a score ranging from 0 to 26 points. In Venezuelan adults, 9&#xD;
      points are the best score (sensitivity 71.4% + specificity 65.4%) to detect subjects with&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance. Those with an LA-FINDRISC ≥ 10 points and having the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to laboratory test and medical evaluation and those with laboratory&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The formula to compare two mean was used. Based on preliminary results of the&#xD;
      pilot study, the aim was to detect a two-fold reduction of weight loss in the intensive group&#xD;
      (mean = 5.0 kg, standard deviation = 4.9) compared with only DPP (mean = 2.4 kg, standard&#xD;
      deviation = 1.9). Using a Beta error of 0.2 and an Alpha error of 0.01, the sample size&#xD;
      required for each group is 50, and assuming a 20% of the loss to follow up (based on the&#xD;
      pilot study), and a 30% additional to ensure representativeness of the sample and power, the&#xD;
      sample size will be incremented to 78 participants in each group, total sample size of 156&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to hybridized LSI or only DPP&#xD;
      with 1:1 allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Prevention Program: The DPP Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) core curriculum content&#xD;
      modified from the original DPP is available online, in both English and Spanish. Despite the&#xD;
      intent of facilitating T2D care for the U.S. Hispanic population, the advantage of the&#xD;
      Spanish language version, and the robust and general recommendations in which the DPP GLB&#xD;
      program is based, this effort was not a true transculturalization process. Important&#xD;
      differences among various ethnocultural co-populations and environments were not addressed.&#xD;
      For example, in Venezuela, there are unique culinary customs: units of measure during food&#xD;
      preparation, types of whole foods in their natural form, and recipes with foods that are not&#xD;
      easily available. In addition, recommendations of physical activities must be feasible for a&#xD;
      certain population based on religious customs, social norms, the built environment, climate&#xD;
      and terrain, and socioeconomic constraints; even, there are food patterns and behaviors&#xD;
      regionally different in the same country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tDNA process was implemented in the following steps to undertake the transcultural&#xD;
      adaptation of the DPP content: 1) Identification target population: adult's population in&#xD;
      Venezuela. 2) Identification of the topic or research/clinical question: One out three adults&#xD;
      in Venezuela has prediabetes. Evidence-based solutions are required to reduce diabetes burden&#xD;
      in Venezuela. 3) Team of experts in the source (DPP) and target population (Venezuelan&#xD;
      culture): A group of Venezuelan experts composed by four diabetologists, one primary care&#xD;
      physician, and two community members trained and certificate by this team to provide T2D&#xD;
      prevention programs implemented the adaptive content of the DPP GLB program. 4)&#xD;
      Identification and resolution of cultural nodes using a framework: The DPP content was&#xD;
      organized with the Ecological Validity Model (EVM). Using an interactive process each&#xD;
      discrepancy between the content and cultural or local costumes were identified and modified&#xD;
      in base to the EVM framework (e.g. recipes were adapted to the current socio-economic moment&#xD;
      of the country). Finally, T2D prevention curriculum content was culturally adapted to&#xD;
      Venezuelan adults avoiding any incongruence with the original version. Healthy options, goal&#xD;
      settings, and problem-solving were consistent attributes of the culturally adapted program.&#xD;
      Details of this transcultural adaptation will be published soon. This content was used in the&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-Energy Liquid-Diet (LELD): LELD, structured food reintroduction, and then a weight-loss&#xD;
      maintenance program have demonstrated being a feasible and acceptable strategy to lose and&#xD;
      maintain weight during 12 months. A &quot;home-made&quot; milk- and fruit-juice-based diet (811&#xD;
      kcal/day, 64 g protein, 132 g carbohydrate, 6 g fat) will be recommended. Recipes and&#xD;
      preparation techniques were transculturally adapted to the population using local available&#xD;
      low-cost foods in Venezuela. A pilot study assessing acceptability, appropriateness, and&#xD;
      feasibility of this LELD strategy in Venezuelan adults with obesity is ongoing.&#xD;
