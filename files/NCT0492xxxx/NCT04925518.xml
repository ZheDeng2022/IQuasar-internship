    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation and ECMO are both technologies interacting on gas exchange.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, besides a consensus paper, no evidence-based guidelines regarding protective&#xD;
      lung ventilation on ECMO exist to date. Mechanical Ventilation with Intellivent-ASV, an&#xD;
      algorithm driven, closed loop system, provides an opportunity to standardize ventilation on&#xD;
      ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose and validate lung protective ventilation with a closed loop ventilation mode in&#xD;
      patients with ECMO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit due to either acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure or circulatory collapse, mechanical ventilation in combination with&#xD;
      either extra-corporal lung assist (VV ECMO) or cardiac assist (VA ECMO) is increasingly used.&#xD;
      Both mechanical ventilation and ECMO contribute to the control of gas exchange hence need to&#xD;
      be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an assist device like a VV ECMO or a VA ECMO the control the gas exchange needs to be&#xD;
      adjusted via sweep gas flow (ventilation), fraction of oxygen in the sweep gas (oxygenation,&#xD;
      FsO2) and blood flow over the extracorporeal device. The combination of adaptive ventilation&#xD;
      with ECMO is a novel concept allowing the control of oxygenation and ventilation by the&#xD;
      adjustment of the ECMO device only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive lung ventilation is a category of ventilation modes, which allow the control of&#xD;
      oxygenation and ventilation with a closed loop. Using this type of ventilation modes one can&#xD;
      control the gas exchange automatically. In terms of CO2-management they use a target minute&#xD;
      volume to control end-tidal CO2 and adjust depending on the amount of spontaneously triggered&#xD;
      breaths the respiratory rate and the inspiratory pressure support or solely the pressure&#xD;
      support. In terms of O2-management according to the peripheral O2 saturation target the PEEP&#xD;
      (lung recruitment) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be set. Both of these&#xD;
      controllers depend on an accurate measurement of either end-tidal CO2 and peripheral O2&#xD;
      saturation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exist two recommendations how to ventilate patients with ARDS on an ECMO. First and&#xD;
      foremost, the general guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO)&#xD;
      suggest for adults to target a FiO2 of less than 0.3 with a PEEP of 5 to 15 cmH2O and a&#xD;
      plateau pressure of less than 25 cm H2O with a respiratory rate of 5 per minute. Whereas&#xD;
      Richard et al. in their consensus conference report from 2014 suggest to minimize plateau&#xD;
      pressure and PEEP not being specific in terms of numbers. Both guidelines have the goal of&#xD;
      keeping the lung at rest concerning patients with ARDS. There are no specific suggestions on&#xD;
      ventilation management in patients with heart failure on ECMO. Whether the lung has to be&#xD;
      kept open (recruited and less prone to atelectrauma) or kept at rest (less prone to&#xD;
      overdistension, either volu- or barotrauma) is at the moment unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning mechanical ventilation settings in patients with ARDS Serpa Neto and colleagues&#xD;
      published in 2016 a meta-analysis of nine studies, which included around 550 patients&#xD;
      receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia. They showed that in these patients driving pressure&#xD;
      was associated with in-hospital survival (survivors had a driving pressure of 16.9 cmH2O and&#xD;
      non-survivors of 19.4, p 0.004, adjusted HR 1.06 with a 95% CI of 1.03 - 1.10). This is&#xD;
      consistent with the study of Amato et al where they showed a reduction of the multivariate&#xD;
      relative risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with ARDS - without ECMO - with a driving&#xD;
      pressure of less than 15 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive lung ventilation mode Intellivent-ASV+® has been shown to ventilate normal&#xD;
      lungs, lungs with ARDS and COPD within the limits of safe ventilation recommended by the&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients on Intellivent-ASV+® had tidal volumes (Vt) ≤ 8 ml/kg/BW, plateau&#xD;
      pressure (Pplat) &lt; 30 cmH2O and a driving pressure &lt; 15 cmH2O. Compared to conventional&#xD;
      ventilation, patients on Intellivent-ASV+® mode had higher PEEP and lower FiO2, suggesting&#xD;
      better recruitment of the dependent part of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining mechanical ventilation using the Intellivent-ASV+® mode and ECMO offers a unique&#xD;
      opportunity of having a mechanical ventilator which automatically adapts to lung mechanics&#xD;
      and the contribution of ECMO supporting gas exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research project is to propose and verify whether the ventilation&#xD;
      mode Intellivent-ASV+® is capable to execute lung protective ventilation despite the presence&#xD;
      of an ECMO altering gas exchange.&#xD;
