  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to find out whether codrituzumab is a safe treatment that causes&#xD;
      few or mild side effects in children and young adults who have solid tumors that express the&#xD;
      protein GPC3. The researchers also want to study the way codrituzumab is absorbed,&#xD;
      distributed, and cleared from the body.&#xD;

    <description>For Phase A of the study, we will use the 3+3 study design, with 2 planned dose levels, starting at 50% of the adult RP2D to confirm the pediatric RP2D/MTD. 6-9,43 Phase B will include an expansion cohort for patients with hepatoblastoma.</description>

    <description>For Phase A (Dose Escalation), the starting dose (dose level 1) will be 10 mg/kg with 1 planned dose escalation to 20 mg/kg (dose level 2) if dose level 1 is determined to be safe and tolerable. Once a RP2D/MTD is identified in Phase A, then Phase B (hepatoblastoma expansion cohort) will open and allow for enrollment of up to 10 additional patients.For both phases, patients will receive codrituzumab IV once per week for a period of 21 days per cycle. Patients will be eligible for up to 25 cycles.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent/Assent: All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized&#xD;
             representatives must sign written informed consent; assent, when appropriate, will be&#xD;
             obtained according to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: Patients must be aged 12 months up to but not including 22 years at the time of&#xD;
             study registration. A patient who is 21 at the time of enrollment but turns 22&#xD;
             thereafter will still be considered eligible for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part A: Patients must have a diagnosis of a primary extra-cranial solid tumor that is&#xD;
             recurrent or refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the purposes of this study, the following definitions will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Refractory is defined as any tumor which progresses despite maximal standard&#xD;
                  therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent (relapsed) is defined as a completion of planned therapy after which&#xD;
                  point the tumor recurs within 5 years of treatment. Additionally, any tumor which&#xD;
                  recurs twice is considered relapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part B: Patients must have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory hepatoblastoma. Given&#xD;
             the limited salvage options, hepatoblastoma patients in first relapse are eligible for&#xD;
             this cohort. Any subtype of hepatoblastoma will be considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor GPC3 Expression: Patients must have demonstrated a minimum of 1+ GPC3 expression&#xD;
             via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on any prior tumor sample. Confirmation of GPC3&#xD;
             expression may include a diagnostic or relapsed sample, at a primary or metastatic&#xD;
             site. There is no limit to how long ago this sample was collected. This GPC3&#xD;
             expression via IHC will be centrally confirmed by Ventana as in prior studies of&#xD;
             codrituzumab and described in the treatment. Patients may choose to enroll on the&#xD;
             prescreening portion, which allows for assessment of GPC3 expression only, prior to&#xD;
             enrollment on the full clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor GPC3 Expression: Patients must have demonstrated a minimum of 1+ GPC3 expression&#xD;
             via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on any prior tumor sample. Confirmation of GPC3&#xD;
             expression may include a diagnostic or relapsed sample, at a primary or metastatic&#xD;
             site. There is no limit to how long ago this sample was collected. This GPC3&#xD;
             expression via IHC will be centrally confirmed by Ventana as in prior studies of&#xD;
             codrituzumab and described in the treatment plan section. Patients may choose to&#xD;
             enroll on the prescreening portion, which allows for assessment of GPC3 expression&#xD;
             only, prior to enrollment on the full clinical trial.&#xD;

             assessed within 2 weeks of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological Deficits: Patients with neurologic deficits must have been stable and off&#xD;
             of steroids for a minimum of 1 week prior to study entry; patients who are unable to&#xD;
             walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered&#xD;
             ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.&#xD;

             excluding pre-menstrual, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment; males or females of reproductive potential may not&#xD;
             participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method, which&#xD;
             includes abstinence, for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study;&#xD;
             recovery is defined as all AEs, attributable to prior therapy, having improved to&#xD;
             grade 2 or better or as outlined below. For agents that have known adverse events&#xD;
             occurring beyond 28 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the&#xD;
