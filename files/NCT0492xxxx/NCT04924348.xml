  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The possible benefits expected from the use of the WALANT procedure are a decrease in&#xD;
      intraoperative pain at the surgical site, a decrease in hospitalization time, and a decrease&#xD;
      in the time required to lift the anesthesia postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks identified are those inherent to each type of anesthesia (WALANT or traditional&#xD;
      ALR), as encountered in current practice, and are therefore not specific to the study: risks&#xD;
      related to the local anesthetic agent or risks related to the puncture procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to determine whether the patient's intraoperative pain at the surgical&#xD;
      site is less after a WALANT procedure compared to a traditional ALR procedure (axillary or&#xD;
      trunk).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Median nerve neurolysis at the carpal tunnel is one of the most performed procedures in the&#xD;
      world. The use of loco-regional anesthesia (LRA) is common practice for this surgery,&#xD;
      especially since the use of ultrasound guidance, which allows visualization of the nerves and&#xD;
      control of the injection of anesthetic products, makes it a safe technique. The nerve blocks&#xD;
      most commonly used in hand surgery are axillary blocks and truncal blocks. The choice between&#xD;
      these two techniques, which are equivalent in terms of effectiveness and duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia, depends in practice on the habits of each practitioner. As the use of a pneumatic&#xD;
      tourniquet during the operation is systematic, the axillary block, by anaesthetizing the&#xD;
      whole arm, avoids the discomfort described by some patients when using a tourniquet. For&#xD;
      others, the discomfort is related to the sensation of a &quot;dead arm&quot; with a duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia of several hours, which the truncular block makes it possible to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an alternative to traditional LRA by local anesthesia without tourniquet and&#xD;
      without sedation (WALANT procedure: Wide Awake Local Anesthesia with No Tourniquet) has been&#xD;
      described. Several studies show the efficacy and safety of this procedure, which is already&#xD;
      used in current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date, there is no comparative study evaluating the effectiveness of the WALANT&#xD;
      procedure compared to traditional hand surgery techniques for carpal tunnel, neither&#xD;
      published nor in progress. This is the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WALANT technique, performed under ultrasound, includes two punctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first is a puncture through a medial approach above the wrist and includes two&#xD;
           injections. A first subcutaneous injection reproducing a bar above the wrist flexion&#xD;
           line, and a second injection above the median nerve. The volumes injected vary from 8 to&#xD;
           10 milliliters (ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second puncture is performed at the base of the palmar surface of the hand and&#xD;
           consists of a 10 ml subcutaneous injection of the local anesthetic in order to take&#xD;
           advantage of the vasoconstrictive effects of adrenaline, thus allowing the surgical&#xD;
           procedure to be performed without a pneumatic tourniquet.&#xD;

    <description>The anesthetic protocol in the axillary block consists of performing a puncture, using a needle (50 mm 22G with a short bevel), under the armpit at the level of the axillary hollow after skin disinfection. This puncture, performed under ultrasound, allows the injection of the local anesthetic around the median, radial, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves. The volume injected per nerve can vary from 5 to 8 ml depending on the visual appreciation during the injection.</description>

    <description>The anesthetic protocol in truncal block consists in injecting the local anesthetic around the median and ulnar nerves by a puncture performed at the elbow or forearm (depending on the practitioner's experience). The volumes injected remain the same and the puncture is also performed under ultrasound guidance. Additional local anesthesia is administered by injecting an additional 5 ml above the wrist flexion line to block the sensory territory of the musculocutaneous nerve.</description>
