  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee injuries, especially those to the ACL, are common among physically active people. These&#xD;
      injuries are frequently treated with surgical reconstruction (ACL reconstruction; ACLR).&#xD;
      While ACLR restores stability it does not protect against future injury, long-term pain,&#xD;
      disability, and arthritis associated with these injuries. Our study is going to examine new&#xD;
      ways to provide feedback about the way people move to determine if these are better at&#xD;
      modifying movement patterns that are known risk factors of posttraumatic osteoarthritis&#xD;
      development than current standard treatments. If you participate, you will be asked to&#xD;
      undergo a movement analysis in a research laboratory while you perform tasks such as walking&#xD;
      and hopping. After this initial assessment, you will be randomly allocated to one of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups. Each treatment group will perform 4 weeks (3x/week) of exercises to change&#xD;
      the way people walk. Participants will then report for follow-up movement analysis testing 1-&#xD;
      and 4-weeks after completing the intervention.&#xD;
