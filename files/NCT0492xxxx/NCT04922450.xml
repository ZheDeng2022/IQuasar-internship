  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the patient received neoadjuvant therapy once every three weeks for a total of three&#xD;
      cycles（Camrelizumab in combination With albumin paclitaxel and cisplatin）.After the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment, the patient undergoes surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.According&#xD;
      to the surgical margin and postoperative pathological conditions, combined with cisplatin&#xD;
