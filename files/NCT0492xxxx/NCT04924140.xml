  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of a single,&#xD;
      fixed subcutaneous (SC) dose of aducanumab compared with a single weight-based intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) dose of aducanumab in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      aducanumab administered SC in healthy volunteers and to characterize additional&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a single, fixed SC dose of aducanumab and a weight-based&#xD;
      IV dose of aducanumab in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
