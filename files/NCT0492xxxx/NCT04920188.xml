      Purpose: The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether a digital array assay can detect&#xD;
      trace amounts of residual leukemia and predict relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      patients in remission who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the&#xD;
      North Carolina Cancer Hospital (NCCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adult patients (18 years of age or older) with diagnosed AML who are going to&#xD;
      undergo stem cell transplant (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): A total of 10 eligible subjects will be treated per standard of care&#xD;
      with SCT. Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate (10 mL each) for digital array assay&#xD;
      analysis will be collected along with routine lab draws and bone marrow biopsy procedures&#xD;
      prior to SCT. Beginning 1 month after SCT peripheral blood (10 ml) will be collected to&#xD;
      assess MRD by digital array assay analysis on a monthly basis for up to 6 months. In&#xD;
      addition, bone marrow aspirate will be collected at approximately Month 3 and 6 following SCT&#xD;
      for assay analysis. Patient medical records will be reviewed 6 and 12 months after completing&#xD;
      their last MRD follow up assessment to confirm survival status, remission status, and gather&#xD;
      information related to relapse.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Minimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of cancer cells that are present after&#xD;
      therapy and not otherwise detectable by clinical findings, including standard clinical assays&#xD;
      and radiographic imaging. Detection of MRD before it becomes clinically detectable provides&#xD;
      an opportunity to intervene and optimize treatment, with the possibility of curing more&#xD;
      patients. For the above reasons, detection of MRD through evaluation of blood-based&#xD;
      biomarkers represents a promising area to improve clinical outcomes in patients with a&#xD;
      variety of solid and liquid tumors. In liquid tumors such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL), MRD assessment is already part of routine clinical practice. MRD is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with risk for relapse in ALL, and MRD assessment during and after induction&#xD;
      therapy is one of the most informative prognostic markers available. For these reasons the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Version 2.2020, indicate that MRD&#xD;
      assessment is an &quot;essential component of patient evaluation over the course of sequential&#xD;
      therapy&quot; for ALL, and there are &gt;250 references to MRD in the pediatric and adult ALL NCCN&#xD;
      Guidelines. In AML, MRD assessment is routinely used in academic medical centers. MRD is also&#xD;
      strongly associated with risk of relapse in AML, and MRD status is a strong independent&#xD;
      predictor of overall survival after completion of therapy. The AML NCCN Guidelines Version&#xD;
      3.2020, indicate the &quot;undeniable need for monitoring,&quot; but further refinements are needed to&#xD;
      make MRD monitoring in patients with AML more reliable. In this study we will apply a new&#xD;
      highly multiplexed digital PCR technology, digital array PCR (daPCR), for evaluation of MRD&#xD;
      in AML that will improve MRD assay reliability while reducing costs and time-to-results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, methods for MRD assessment in AML include flow cytometry for the detection of&#xD;
      aberrant immunophenotypes as well as molecular PCR- and next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS)-based assays for detecting recurrent AML-associated genetic abnormalities. Both flow&#xD;
      and molecular MRD assessment have much higher sensitivity than morphologic assessment alone,&#xD;
      with flow cytometry having a lower limit of detection between 10-4 to 10-5 and molecular&#xD;
      methods between 10-3 for NGS methods to 10-5 for PCR-based methods. Each of the current&#xD;
      methods have major limitations that prevent broader adoption in AML. Standard NGS-based&#xD;
      methods have insufficient sensitivity and high costs. Flow cytometry is a technically&#xD;
      difficult method that is challenging to standardize, and a subset of AML cases do not have&#xD;
      sufficient evaluable surface markers to allow detection. PCR-based methods can be very&#xD;
      sensitive, but each assay currently targets a single recurrent genetic abnormality (e.g.,&#xD;
      PML/RARA fusion in acute promyelocytic leukemia), and many AML cases do not have genetic&#xD;
      abnormalities that are targeted by current clinical assays. In contrast, the daPCR technology&#xD;
      we propose to apply in this study provides a high throughput, multiplexed platform (24-96&#xD;
      variants) with unprecedented dynamic range (&gt;108), high ease of use, low cost and rapid&#xD;
      turnaround time. Because the daPCR can simultaneously probe for multiple variants, we&#xD;
      estimate that our initial assay will have the potential to detect and quantify the abundance&#xD;
      of at least one AML associated mutation in ~80% of AML samples. This technological advance&#xD;
      would provide a real-world solution to enable frequent, deep monitoring of therapeutic&#xD;
      response in patients with AML.&#xD;
