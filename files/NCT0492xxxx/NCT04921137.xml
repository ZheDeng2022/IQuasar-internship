  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for stage 1 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer&#xD;
      consists of breast-conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy (ET) for at least 5 years. The benefit of adjuvant ET for older patients is mitigated&#xD;
      because of their increase risk of death from other causes and shorter time horizon to live.&#xD;
      Clinical and pathological factors such as low-intermediate grade, tumor size ≤2 cm, and older&#xD;
      age have been used in a few studies to identify patients with a lower risk of recurrence that&#xD;
      might benefit from adjuvant therapy de-escalation, i.e. omission of RT or ET. Since there is&#xD;
      no dedicated randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted to evaluate the omission of ET, there&#xD;
      is clinical equipoise as to whether we can omit adjuvant ET in older patients with lower-risk&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer. Therefore, we propose a randomised, multicentre trial evaluating&#xD;
      harms and benefits of endocrine therapy in patients ≥70 years of age with lower risk breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      The current standard of care for stage 1 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer&#xD;
      consists of breast-conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy (ET) for at least 5 years. The benefit of adjuvant ET for older patients is mitigated&#xD;
      because of their increase risk of death from other causes and shorter time horizon to live.&#xD;
      This population is also more likely to have additional comorbidities which can lead to higher&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events impacting quality of life and precipitating functional&#xD;
      decline. Clinical and pathological factors such as low-intermediate grade, tumor size ≤2 cm,&#xD;
      and older age have been used in a few studies to identify patients with a lower risk of&#xD;
      recurrence that might benefit from adjuvant therapy de-escalation, i.e. omission of RT or ET.&#xD;
      The body of evidence from small prospective studies, mathematical modelling study and&#xD;
      retrospective analyses would suggest that the omission of ET in older patients with&#xD;
      favourable HR+ breast cancer who had optimal local therapy (i.e. breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      followed by adjuvant radiotherapy) does not compromise locoregional and survival outcomes.&#xD;
      Since there is no dedicated randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      omission of ET, there is clinical equipoise as to whether we can omit adjuvant ET in older&#xD;
      patients with lower-risk early-stage breast cancer. Therefore, we propose a randomised,&#xD;
      multicentre trial evaluating harms and benefits of endocrine therapy in patients ≥70 years of&#xD;
      age with lower risk breast cancer.&#xD;
