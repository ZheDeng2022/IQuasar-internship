    <textblock>
      This study assesses the health literacy and understanding of radiation therapy information&#xD;
      during consultation in patients with prostate or breast cancer undergoing definitive&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Health literacy is defined as &quot;the capacity to obtain, process, and&#xD;
      understand health information and services to enable sound health decisions.&quot; Information&#xD;
      gained from this study, may help researchers develop appropriate modalities to enhance&#xD;
      comprehension of radiation therapy, and therefore allow for improved patient decision making&#xD;
      with medical treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess patient health literacy and understanding of critical radiation information&#xD;
      during consultation in Spanish and English speaking patient in the department of radiation&#xD;
      oncology at Los Angeles County (LAC) + University of Southern California (USC) utilizing a&#xD;
      patient survey administered after consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate findings of radiation comprehension and satisfaction with validated measures of&#xD;
      health literacy, acculturation, and socioeconomic status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess patient satisfaction of interpreter service in Spanish-speaking patients among&#xD;
      breast and prostate cancer patients receiving definitive radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a survey over 5-10 minutes about their understanding of radiation therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be given an internally developed questionnaire of 11 questions intended to ascertain understanding of basic radiotherapy information that is needed to make an informed decision. The questions with one answer will be given a +1 for correct and -1 for incorrect. The questions with multiple answers (toxicity) will be given a +1 for a correctly chosen side effect, and a -1 for an incorrect response. The total will be the patient's summary score.</description>

    <measure>Radiation comprehension and satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Findings will be correlated with validated measures of health literacy, acculturation, and socioeconomic status of patients. Will assess variables associated with post-consult knowledge, with independent variables (IVs) comprising of ethnicity, cultural factors (nativity, acculturation), level of health literacy, sex, and socioeconomic status in linear regression models. Bivariate analyses will initially be conducted between IVs and the outcome; variables that are significant at p &lt; 0.10 will be included in the multivariable model. Interaction terms will also be examined to test for differences by Hispanic/non-Hispanic ethnicity (the outcome regressed on Hispanic*IVs). The alpha level for the multivariable model will be p &lt; 0.05.</description>
