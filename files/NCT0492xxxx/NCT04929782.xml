  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research was to evaluate the clinical success of giomer and resin-based&#xD;
      sealants applied in the first permanent molars (FPMs) affected by MIH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-hundred FPMs with MIH which were indicated for non-invasive fissure sealant were selected&#xD;
      in 39 children (between 6-12 years). Using a split mouth design, the FPMs were randomized&#xD;
      into two groups; Group 1: resin sealant (Conceal F); Group 2: giomer sealant (BeautiSealant)&#xD;
      and dental isolation device was used during the procedure (Mr. Thursty). Clinical evaluation&#xD;
      was performed by two blinded examiners using the United States Public Health Service (USPHS)&#xD;
      criteria to assess anatomical form, marginal adaptation, surface texture, marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, retention and secondary caries at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      was performed using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA) and the level of&#xD;
      significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The association between independent variable (groups) and&#xD;
      dependent variable (USPHS scores) was evaluated with Fisher's exact test. The crosstabulation&#xD;
      of the categorical data regarding the groups were analyzed with chi-square test or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. The Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to calculate and compare&#xD;
      the cumulative survival rates of the sealants.&#xD;
