  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims at providing a better understanding of motor skill acquisition and learning&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to determine how practice conditions, i.e., variable&#xD;
      and constant practice conditions, in motor learning affect Central Nervous System. There are&#xD;
      three objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine functional changes following constant and variable practice conditions in&#xD;
           motor learning (resting-state fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) differences in constant and variable practice&#xD;
           conditions in motor learning and as a function of practice time (EEG);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine the EEG coherence between cognitive, sensory, and motor cerebral cortex&#xD;
           areas (central, temporal, parietal, occipital) in constant and variable practice&#xD;
           conditions and as a function of practice time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variable practice involving the practice of several variations of motor skill benefits&#xD;
      learning differently than practice in constant conditions, i.e., practice that involves only&#xD;
      one variation of a skill. The variable practice results in better retention and transfer. The&#xD;
      performance of a skill practiced in variable conditions is more accurate and stable. In&#xD;
      contrast, practicing only one variation of a skill better refines the recall schema. It means&#xD;
      that the motor program (which serves as an &quot;example&quot; while executing a movement) is developed&#xD;
      better. The trained variation of a skill (in constant practice), produces an advantage in&#xD;
      performance compared to the same variation of the skill that was practiced in variable&#xD;
      conditions (assuming that variable and constant practice had similar capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding has an important implication for those who want to master their skills and it&#xD;
      does not matter whether this skill refers to sport, driving, piloting, or rehabilitation. If&#xD;
      one wants to be good at performing only one variation of a skill, one should practice in&#xD;
      constant conditions, whereas if one wants to be good in more than one variation of skill and&#xD;
      wants to generalize the experience to novel situations an individual should practice in&#xD;
      variable conditions. As one can see, this implication is practical, although the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying this distinction and differences are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, it is unquestioned today that learning new motor skills dynamically&#xD;
      changes brain, i.e., brain is neuroplastic. The neuroplasticity of the brain is specifically&#xD;
      conspicuous in the progression of motor learning. As it was reported in previous research,&#xD;
      cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar systems play an important role in motor skill&#xD;
      acquisition. However, both of these systems differ in terms of the role they play as learning&#xD;
      progresses. Cortico-striatal system (associative/premotor brain regions) is primarily engaged&#xD;
      in the initial phase of learning, i.e., in cognitive functioning and sensory processing.&#xD;
      Cortico-cerebellar system (sensorimotor network) is becoming more active in the later phase&#xD;
      of motor learning. However, none of the previous research focused on what role these systems&#xD;
      play in learning under different conditions and how the different roles the systems may play&#xD;
      affect structural neuroplasticity, including grey and white matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be also interesting to look at the functional neuroplasticity. A lesser degree of&#xD;
      cognitive involvement during the execution of movements may be associated with lower&#xD;
      activation in the sensorimotor cortex. On the other hand, increased cognitive involvement may&#xD;
      be expected in variable conditions due to, e.g., stimulus identification or decision making.&#xD;
      Therefore, the assumption that decreased cognitive involvement and, as a result, decreased&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex activation in constant practice conditions sounds reasonable. Moreover, it&#xD;
      may be hypothesized that practicing and learning in constant conditions will be characterized&#xD;
      by lower sensorimotor cortex activation since there will be decreased control during the&#xD;
      motor performance, which leads to more adaptive motor performance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Fifty participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: constant and variable practice condition group (CG and VG). The pretest-posttest design will be applied.&#xD;
All participants will go through MRI scanning and EEG measurements. All participants will perform a pretest (baseline) consisting of 30 trials of SPSIC (1-3). The testing will start with SPSIC 1, then SPSIC 2, and will finish with SPSIC 3. The testing will be scheduled in blocked order. After completing the whole training program, each participant will perform a posttest analogically to the pretest.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional scans will be acquired both prior to and after the three weeks of practicing the unimanual index finger abduction motor task. High-resolution T1-weighted (MPRAGE) and FLAIR images will be exploited to assess grey matter changes. Diffusion-weighted (DWI) data will be used for probabilistic tractography to obtain specific tracts that will be analyzed in terms of alterations in fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and parallel diffusivity. In addition, whole-brain white matter microstructural changes will be assessed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).&#xD;
Regarding resting-state fMRI data, BOLD multi-echo echo-planar imaging fMRI sequence will be applied.</description>
