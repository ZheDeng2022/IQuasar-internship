  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify clinical and biological determinants and factors that predict&#xD;
      outcome including primary outcome (percentage of changes in clinical scales pre- and after 3&#xD;
      months ) and secondary outcome depending on neurophysiologiacal studies and prognostic&#xD;
      factors in individual patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome i individuals managed by&#xD;
      plasmapheresis and IVIG immunoglobulin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be used to understand the diversity in clinical presentation and&#xD;
      response to treatment of GBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute onset, monophasic, immune-mediated peripheral nerve&#xD;
      and root disorder (termed polyradiculoneuropathy), GBS has become the most common cause of&#xD;
      acute flaccid paralysis worldwide and is a neurological emergency .Guillain-Barré syndrome&#xD;
      (GBS) encompasses group of acute immune-mediated disordes restricted to peripheral nerves and&#xD;
      roots. Good circumstantial evidence exists for a pathogenic role for molecular mimicry in GBS&#xD;
      pathogenesis,especially with its axonal forms, providing insights that could guide future&#xD;
      immunotherapy :Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation is a sudden onset of rapidly progressive and symmetrical weakness of&#xD;
      the limbs, with or without peripheral sensory disturbance, reduction in or loss of tendon&#xD;
      reflexes , and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing elevated protein concentrations&#xD;
      with a normal white cell count, termed albuminocytologic dissociation, to distinguish it from&#xD;
      infections that typically demonstrate elevated protein and white cell counts. The symptoms&#xD;
      typically reach maximal severity within four weeks from symptom onset. Most patients&#xD;
      generally require hospitalization for treatment, with close cardiopulmonary monitoring&#xD;
      performed. Many patients also develop symptoms or signs of autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      dysfunction, termed dysautonomia. These commonly consist of sinus tachycardia, arrhythmias,,&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension, increased sweating and bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antecedent infections, typically within 4 weeks of neurological symptom onset, commonly occur&#xD;
      in GBS patients, resulting in the commonly cited molecular mimicry hypothesis, in which the&#xD;
      immune system becomes activated in response to infectious antigen with structural similarity&#xD;
      to peripheral nerve myelin or axonal components, with resultant tissue-specific peripheral&#xD;
      nerve and nerve root injury in susceptible individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data implies that about two-thirds of GBS adult patients had a prior&#xD;
      respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.Pathophysiology and immunopathology of the&#xD;
      preceding infections are pathogenically associated with GBS, and may play an essential role&#xD;
      in triggering the initial peripheral nerve/ nerve root-specific systemic immune system&#xD;
      activation that causes cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses with resultant&#xD;
      demyelination, axonal injury or both involving peripheral nerves and roots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal treatment of individual patients may depend on the pathogenesis and clinical&#xD;
      severity. Patients with severe forms of GBS may possibly need more intensive treatment to&#xD;
      recover. Patients with a milder course that fully recover after standard therapy could suffer&#xD;
      from possibly more side effects of more aggressive forms of treatment. This could only be&#xD;
      possible if there are prognostic models that accurately predict the clinical course in&#xD;
      individual patients. Ideally such models should be based on clinical and biological&#xD;
      predictors that are strongly associated with disease course and known as early as possible in&#xD;
      the acute phase of illness, when treatment with immunomodulatory therapy is most effective.&#xD;
      Prognostic models could help to guide selective trials in specific GBS subtypes. Because of&#xD;
      this it will be possible to treat GBS with more effective and more individual therapy&#xD;
