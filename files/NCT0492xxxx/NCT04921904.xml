  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CDK4/6 and Cyclin D1 are significantly expressed in approximately 80% of esophageal and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction tumors suggesting that CDK4/6 inhibition may be a successful&#xD;
      strategy in these chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistant diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, phase I/II safety study that will enroll 30 subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas post first line systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Subjects will be treated with oral Abemaciclib 150 mg PO daily bid given with&#xD;
      ramucirumab 8mg/kg every 2 weeks iv until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled. The primary goal is to describe the safety profile&#xD;
      of Abemaciclib in combination with Ramucirumab among all enrolled subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occur in 20 subjects, the upper bound&#xD;
      of 95% Wilson confidence interval for the adverse event rate would be below 81% (16.7% -&#xD;
      47.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety analysis will be performed in all treated subjects. Adverse event data will be&#xD;
      listed individually and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria, version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics will include counts and proportions as well as rates with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals. Toxicities will be reported as a tabulated table by type and grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve an objective&#xD;
      response by RECIST1.1 criteria (i.e. Complete response or Partial Response) to Abemaciclib in&#xD;
      combination with Ramucirumab. We will estimate the objective response rate, along with the&#xD;
      Wilson 95% confidence interval, for the population of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival will be defined as the time from study enrollment to death. This will be&#xD;
      summarized using a Kaplan-Meier curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of subjects with grade 4 or higher treatment-related adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously throughout the trial using a Bayesian stopping guideline. A Beta (1,&#xD;
      19) prior, representing a toxicity rate of 5%, slightly lower than the expected rate of 6%,&#xD;
      was used in the development of our guidelines. The therapy will be re-evaluated if the&#xD;
      posterior probability that the toxicity rate exceeds 10% is greater than 75%. Table 3&#xD;
      summarizes the stopping boundaries starting with the initial cohort of 3 subjects through the&#xD;
      maximum sample size of 30 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probability of triggering the stopping guidelines was assessed for a range of possible&#xD;
      toxicity rates using simulations with 5000 replicates. The probability of stopping to&#xD;
      re-evaluate was 1% if the true proportion with an unacceptable toxicity was 5%. In&#xD;
      comparison, the probability of stopping early was 99.6% if the true proportion with an&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity was 40%&#xD;
