      Cognitive decline is a common symptom of aging, and age-related cognitive impairments are&#xD;
      considered normal or inevitable, especially in people over 60, whose memory is more likely to&#xD;
      be affected by age. As life expectancy has increased, the number of people with age-related&#xD;
      cognitive impairment has also increased. The improvement or slowing of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      has received more attention. Phosphatide is a naturally occurring Phosphatide, but it is the&#xD;
      main acidic phospholipid in the brain. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid that&#xD;
      regulates the function of key proteins in cell membranes and can improve brain function and&#xD;
      repair brain damage. PS is thought to enhance neuronal membrane function, which in turn&#xD;
      enhances cognitive function. However, there are few studies on the effect of PS on human&#xD;
      cognitive function, especially on the elderly, and the results are inconsistent. In this&#xD;
      study, people aged 60-70 were given PS intervention for 6 months. Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MOCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination.MMSE) and head MRI are used to evaluate&#xD;
      the cognitive function of the subjects before and after the intervention to observe the&#xD;
      influence of PS on the cognitive function of the elderly, which is of certain significance&#xD;
      for the accurate assessment of the cognitive function of the elderly population and the&#xD;
      improvement of the cognitive function of the elderly.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial, in which 100 subjects were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group 1:1 by computer generated&#xD;
      random numbers. Before start of the study, all the subjects underwent the first magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MR) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data collection. The working memory capacity of&#xD;
      subjects in the N-back paradigm was measured (collected during the N-back task in the EEG&#xD;
      test), and the cognition was measured by MOCA and MMSE. After the first data collection was&#xD;
      completed, subjects in the treatment group oral the PS (600mg/d, q.d.) for 6 months. Subjects&#xD;
      in the control group were given a placebo, which was the same shape of bean powder(600mg/d,&#xD;
      q.d.). Under the supervision of nurses, all subjects took the additive at regular times&#xD;
      daily. At the end of the 6-month additive trial, all subjects underwent a second MR and EEG&#xD;
      data acquisition, as well as measurements of working memory capacity and cognition.&#xD;
