  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Lomecel-B™ works in treating patients with&#xD;
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and to gather additional information about the safety&#xD;
      of Lomecel-B. Lomecel-B contains human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as the active&#xD;
      ingredient. MSCs are special cells in the body that are able to change into other types of&#xD;
      cells, such as heart, blood, and muscle cells. MSCs are found in various tissues of the body,&#xD;
      such as the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside of your bones. Lomecel-B uses MSCs&#xD;
      from bone marrow of unrelated young healthy donors. These are called &quot;allogeneic&quot;, and do not&#xD;
      require donor matching to the patient.&#xD;
