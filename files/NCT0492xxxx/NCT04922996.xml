  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium dobesilate (CaD) has been shown to have potential antiviral effects, mediated via its&#xD;
      interaction with the heparansulfate (HS) binding site of the viral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein&#xD;
      (direct action), necessary for interation with the ACE-2 receptor on human cells. Preliminary&#xD;
      pre-clinical results using viral pseudotyped particles demonstrated that CaD reduces the&#xD;
      uptake of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in cultured endothelial cells by more than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, CaD is a well-established vasoactive and angioprotective drug improving endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction with a good tolerability profile. CaD strengthens vessels integrity and improves&#xD;
      blood flow by acting on multiple parameters, like cytokines levels and signaling by FGF and&#xD;
      VEGF. All these parameters may be dysregulated at some stage of Covid-19 pathological&#xD;
      evolution, and acting on these could potentially reduce the progression toward severe&#xD;
      disease. Based on these data, we hypothesize that CaD could be used as an early treatment for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 positive outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, bioavailability data and pharmacokinetics of CaD are not well known, outside of old&#xD;
      data on animal models. Being able to show that the drug is present in nasal mucosae and&#xD;
      saliva, where the virus is likely to start the infection of the host, would be a first step&#xD;
      before studying a possible effect on the disease course on infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this project plans to include between 6 and 10 patients, treated with CaD, for whom&#xD;
      different nasal, saliva and blood sample will be taken at different timepoints before and&#xD;
      after the daily dose of the treatment. Samples will be then analysed to detect and quantify&#xD;
      the presence of CaD.&#xD;
