  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease remains the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), rising&#xD;
      in frequency in parallel with the epidemic of diabetes worldwide. The estimated lifetime risk&#xD;
      of kidney disease in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been reported to be as high as&#xD;
      50-70%, although risk may be lower in excellent care environments. Two previous studies have&#xD;
      suggested that a generic drug used to lower fats in blood (fenofibrate) may protect the&#xD;
      kidney from damage due to diabetes. These data, however, were obtained among people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes with clinical characteristics optimized for cardiovascular studies. Thus, a&#xD;
      clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate the effects on the kidney is required to&#xD;
      firmly show that this drug can prevent kidney damage in T1D. The goals of the present pilot&#xD;
      study are to demonstrate the feasibility of such trial, gather essential information for&#xD;
      designing and planning this study, and generate preliminary data. To this end, 40&#xD;
      participants with T1D and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease (DKD), at high risk of&#xD;
      ESKD, will be enrolled at two clinical sites and assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with&#xD;
      fenofibrate or placebo for 18 months. Kidney function will be measured at the beginning and&#xD;
      at the end of the study to evaluate the effect of fenofibrate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in the past 20 years in glycemic and blood pressure control, and the&#xD;
      introduction of &quot;reno-protective&quot; drugs such as renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB), the&#xD;
      overall incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains high.&#xD;
      To seek new treatments to prevent diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and/or slow its progression&#xD;
      to ESKD in T1D, the investigators have established a unique consortium of high-quality&#xD;
      academic centers, which has been named PERL (Preventing Early Renal Function Loss in&#xD;
      Diabetes) to emphasize the focus on intervening relatively early in the course of DKD in T1D,&#xD;
      when renal damage can more likely be slowed or stopped. Findings from the FIELD and ACCORD&#xD;
      trials suggest a reno-protective effect of the PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibrate, raising the&#xD;
      exciting possibility of using this inexpensive generic drug to prevent GFR decline in persons&#xD;
      with T1D. These data, however, were obtained through post-hoc analyses of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D) populations with clinical characteristics optimized for CVD studies. Thus, a clinical&#xD;
      trial specifically designed to evaluate effects on GFR decline is required to firmly&#xD;
      establish a DKD indication for fenofibrate in T1D. As a first step, the investigators are&#xD;
      conducting a pilot study including 40 participants with T1D and early-to-moderate DKD, at&#xD;
      high risk of ESKD, who will be enrolled at two of the PERL sites and randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to treatment with fenofibrate or placebo for 18 months, followed by a two-month&#xD;
      washout. The goal of this pilot study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define the nature of the acute effect of fenofibrate on kidney function. It remains&#xD;
           unclear whether the eGFR reduction observed at the beginning of fenofibrate treatment is&#xD;
           an artifact of fenofibrate-induced changes in creatinine production and/or renal tubular&#xD;
           handling, or corresponds to an actual reduction in GFR. This controversy, which has&#xD;
           crucial implications for the pivotal trial design, will be resolved by directly&#xD;
           measuring GFR by plasma iohexol disappearance - a methodology in which PERL sites are&#xD;
           experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Generate further data on the long-term effects of fenofibrate on GFR decline in persons&#xD;
           with T1D and DKD who are at high risk of rapid GFR decline and ESKD. The positive&#xD;
           effects of fenofibrate in FIELD and ACCORD were observed in individuals who were not&#xD;
           selected for having DKD and who, if untreated, had a mean GFR decline barely above the&#xD;
           physiological decline due to aging. To make a compelling case for a pivotal trial for&#xD;
           kidney outcomes, it is crucial to generate preliminary data on the effectiveness and&#xD;
           safety of this drug in persons selected for having DKD and being rapidly progressing&#xD;
           towards ESKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effects of fenofibrate on biomarkers of increased risk of fast GFR&#xD;
           decline. A salutary effect of fenofibrate on one or more of these biomarkers will&#xD;
           corroborate any trend of a fenofibrate benefit identified in Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot will allow the investigators to seek support for a pivotal trial to&#xD;
      establish a kidney indication for fenofibrate in T1D.&#xD;
