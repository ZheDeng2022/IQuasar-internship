  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a plant-based diet is practical (feasible) for overweight people&#xD;
      with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (SMM). The researchers will decide how practical the diet is by looking at how much weight&#xD;
      participants lose and how well they are able to stick to the diet. The researchers will also&#xD;
      determine whether the diet is effective in preventing multiple myeloma in participants. In&#xD;
      addition, they will look at how safe the plant-based diet is for participants, and see if the&#xD;
      diet affects participants' quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>For 12 weeks, patients will receive two premade meals per day, for lunch and dinner, prepared and shipped weekly by U.S.-based WFPBD company Plantable. The meals will have a low glycemic index and contain vegetables, whole grains, and plant-based fats that have undergone minimal processing. Instructions will be provided for food storage and reheating. Detailed recommendations for snacks and breakfasts meeting the standard of a WFPBD will also be given to supplement their daily calorie needs with access to an online portal from Plantable which contains education materials and access to a coach daily for 24 weeks.</description>
