  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have attempted to find the predictors of adverse neonatal outcome in women with&#xD;
      Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy(ICP).Serum total bile acid level exceeding 40 µmol/L&#xD;
      has been associated with increased risk of meconium staining, low Apgar scores, preterm&#xD;
      delivery, and stillbirth.Other predictors such as level of transaminases, history of&#xD;
      cholelithiasis, and hepatitis virus infection have been studied but the results are&#xD;
      inconclusive.A more comprehensive investigation involving multiple neonatal outcomes and a&#xD;
      wide variety of outcome predictors is needed in order to establish guidelines for optimal&#xD;
      timing of delivery in pregnancies complicated by ICP. The aim of our study was to evaluate&#xD;
      wide variety of predictors of adverse neonatal outcomes in a large cohort of women with ICP .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a retrospective cohort study of all women diagnosed with ICP. Pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      including delivery gestational age, spontaneous preterm delivery, iatrogenic preterm&#xD;
      delivery, birth weight, mode of delivery, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction&#xD;
      (IUGR), placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membrane (PPROM), concerning fetal&#xD;
      heart tracing, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion,&#xD;
      stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, hyperbilirubinemia, meconium&#xD;
      stained amniotic fluid, respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) or transient tachypnea of&#xD;
      newborn(TTN) (transient tachypnea of the newborn), and composite neonatal outcome were&#xD;
      ascertained. A composite adverse neonatal outcome was created and defined as any of the&#xD;
      following: NICU admission, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, RDS, TTN, mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      use, oxygen by nasal cannula, pneumonia, and stillbirth. PPROM was defined by rupture of&#xD;
      membrane before 37 weeks gestation. Concerning fetal heart tracing was defined as recurrent&#xD;
      variable or late decelerations with moderate variability, prolonged decelerations, or&#xD;
      category 3 tracing. Providers who were caring for the women reviewed and independently&#xD;
      characterized fetal heart tracings. Since fetal heart tracings were not accessible to&#xD;
      authors, authors accepted the providers' interpretation. For analysis of concerning fetal&#xD;
      heart tracing, women with non-labor cesarean section were excluded. Hyperbilirubinemia was&#xD;
      defined by neonatal hyperbilirubinemia that required phototherapy. Hypoglycemia was defined&#xD;
      by neonatal hypoglycemia that required intravenous infusion. Diagnosis of RDS and TTN were&#xD;
      made by the managing neonatologist and based on standard clinical guidelines.&#xD;
