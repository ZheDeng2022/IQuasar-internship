  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying how healthcare worker recipients react after receiving&#xD;
      vaccinations for COVID-19. The objective of the study is to evaluate the immune response to&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination. The immunity will be evaluated over time by measuring serum&#xD;
      semi-quantitative SARS-Co-V2 IgG from blood specimens and analyzing vaccine reaction data.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is the name for the virus responsible for COVID-19 infections. IgG, immunoglobulin&#xD;
      G, is an antibody found in the blood that protects against bacterial and viral infections.&#xD;
      Study subjects will also be asked to report physical reactions they may have experienced&#xD;
      related to vaccinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As some of the first recipients of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under emergency authorization use,&#xD;
      healthcare workers represent a diverse subpopulation, that are now moving through the immune&#xD;
      response to the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. As individual responses may vary, this&#xD;
      provides an opportunity to evaluate levels of IgG response in relation to age, gender,&#xD;
      comorbidities and other factors that may influence immunity. We recognize that, though this&#xD;
      is only part of the immune response that may be protective for severe COVID-19 disease, it is&#xD;
      a first step in understanding the level and durability of post vaccination SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This small, pilot study will evaluate the immune response over time by measuring serum&#xD;
      semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG from healthcare vaccinees at various timepoints. A&#xD;
      high-level review of reactions related to the vaccinations will be performed with the same&#xD;
      population of healthcare workers.&#xD;
