  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients will receive IFx-Hu2.0 on an outpatient basis at a single time point in&#xD;
      a single lesion. These patients will be assessed for any immediate adverse reactions and at&#xD;
      Week 4 (Day 28+/-5 days) for any delayed adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, open-label, interventional, prospective, phase 1 trial to assess safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of IFx-Hu2.0 in patients with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      or cutaneous melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately one hundred (100) male and/or female adult patients (greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 18 years old), of any ethnicity and race, with at least one cutaneous melanoma,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, or basal cell carcinoma lesion accessible for direct injection, who&#xD;
      meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, will be eligible for enrollment and treatment&#xD;
      with IFx-Hu2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollees will receive IFx-Hu2.0 as a single intralesional injection at a single time point.&#xD;
      The target dose will be 100 μg of plasmid DNA per lesion injected at a final dose volume of&#xD;
      200 μL per lesion. The injected lesion will be completely excised at the follow-up visit four&#xD;
      weeks later and will be biopsied for confirmation of diagnosis and for the establishment of a&#xD;
      pathological response baseline peripheral blood will be collected from these patients prior&#xD;
      to treatment administration and at the follow-up visit four weeks later. These samples will&#xD;
      be used to perform complete blood counts (CBC) and clinical chemistry tests. A urine sample&#xD;
      will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood at the same frequency. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn for immune response evaluation as well.&#xD;

    <description>The investigational drug product IFx-Hu2.0 is composed of the drug substance pAc/emm55 (pDNA) complexed with the two excipients in vivo-jetPEI® (linear polyethylenimine), a transfection reagent, and dextrose, a pDNA/polyethylenimine complex stabilizer.&#xD;
Therapeutic Classification:&#xD;
Immunomodulatory Agent&#xD;
Route of Administration:&#xD;
Intralesional (i.e. injection of cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph nodal lesions)&#xD;
Mechanism of Action:&#xD;
Injection of IFx-Hu2.0 into the lesion facilitates the expression of the immunogenic Emm55 protein by the tumor cells.&#xD;
Physiological Effect:&#xD;
Expression of the emm55 gene by the tumor cells triggers immune recognition of tumor-specific and -associated antigens which leads to innate and adaptive immune responses.</description>
