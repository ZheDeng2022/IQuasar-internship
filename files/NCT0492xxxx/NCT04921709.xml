      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting inflammatory condition&#xD;
      predominantly affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that results from complex interplay&#xD;
      of the individual's genetic makeup, the environment, the gut microbiota and the host immune&#xD;
      response .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD is an umbrella disorder that covers Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD&#xD;
      unclassified . Crohn's disease is characterised by transmural inflammation that can affect&#xD;
      any part of the GIT with characteristic skip lesions of healthy tissues, while ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis is a continuous mucosal inflammation largely confined to the colon. 'IBD&#xD;
      unclassified' is a term used when the endoscopic and histological features are not sufficient&#xD;
      to favour one of the other diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) in inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)&#xD;
      varies from 6%-46%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms that have been suggested include contributions of genetic factors, infectious&#xD;
      agents, circulating bacterial endotoxins and immune-complex deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIMs can involve almost every organ system. It is not always possible to identify the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism underlying an organ's involvement in IBD; it may originate from&#xD;
      the same pathophysiological mechanism as intestinal disease, or as a secondary complication&#xD;
      of IBDs, Renal involvement has been considered as an EIM and has been described both in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD) and in ulcerative colitis (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal EIMs and IBD-related therapy are potential risk factors for the development of renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (both acute and chronic) in patients with CD and UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of kidney disease in which there is gradual loss of&#xD;
      kidney function over a period of months to years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml /min/1.73 m2 for 3&#xD;
      months or more .&#xD;
&#xD;
      GFR can be estimated from calibrated serum creatinine and estimating equations ,such as the&#xD;
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation or the Cockcroft -Gault formula .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney disease severity is classified into five stages according to the level of GFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage 1: Slightly diminished function; kidney damage with normal or relatively high GFR&#xD;
           (≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) with kidney damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stage 5: Established kidney failure (GFR &lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent renal diseases in patients with IBD are: nephrolithiasis,&#xD;
      tubulointerstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in other EIMs, renal manifestations can be considered as dependent on the same&#xD;
      immunological mechanism that determines intestinal inﬂammatory diseases, directly related to&#xD;
      intestinal activity. Another hypothesis to be considered is that renal involvement is an&#xD;
      independent of bowel disease, due to its autoimmune mechanism of action; otherwise, it could&#xD;
      be related to metabolic disorders that develop in IBD. Finally, kidney pathologies in IBD&#xD;
      have been associated with side e!ects of drugs Aminosalicylates, azathioprine, cyclosporin&#xD;
      and TNFα inhibitors may be involved in renal impairment. However, it is not always possible&#xD;
      to clarify the mechanism of these drugs in kidney damage. In many cases it remains unclear&#xD;
      whether renal impairment is an EIM or a drug adverse effect&#xD;
