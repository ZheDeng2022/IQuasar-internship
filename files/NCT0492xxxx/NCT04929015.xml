      This clinical trial collects biospecimen samples to create a personalized ctDNA test to guide&#xD;
      treatment for patients with gastrointestinal cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis.&#xD;
      Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the material that carries all the information about how a&#xD;
      living thing will work and function. Everyone is born with the same DNA in all our cells&#xD;
      throughout our body. Sometimes, some of the cells in the body develop abnormalities in the&#xD;
      DNA that cause those cells to grow abnormally and uncontrollably. Cancer occurs when there is&#xD;
      abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells. The DNA in cancer cells is therefore different&#xD;
      from the DNA someone is born with. The Signatera ctDNA assay is a laboratory test that takes&#xD;
      tumor (cancer) tissue and evaluates it for unique tumor DNA. This evaluation is used to&#xD;
      create a report (otherwise known as an assay) personalized to each person's cancer. The&#xD;
      personalized assay creates a personalized blood test to detect the level of abnormal DNA from&#xD;
      the cancer that may be circulating in the body. Once this personalized blood assay is&#xD;
      designed, it may be used to monitor a person's blood for the presence of ctDNA, which will&#xD;
      indicate the presence or absence of cancer over time, even after treatment.&#xD;

      This study is an exploratory analysis of the utility of ctDNA as a sensitive biomarker in&#xD;
      patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis treated with chemotherapy, CRS and/or hyperthermic&#xD;
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) in patients with&#xD;
      peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from gastrointestinal (GI) cancers who are candidates for&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy&#xD;
      (HIPEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the percentage of patients on protocol with undetectable ctDNA (clearance&#xD;
      rate) after complete CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify any associations between clinical staging of CRS and measurable ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess changes in ctDNA levels in response to chemotherapy in patients with PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To guide treatment based on ctDNA response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive induction chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician for&#xD;
      up to 6 months. Patients undergo blood sample collection for ctDNA analysis at baseline, post&#xD;
      chemotherapy/pre-surgery, 3-4 weeks post CRS/HIPEC, then every 3 months over 2 years.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo tissue collection before or during surgery and their medical records&#xD;
      are reviewed.&#xD;
