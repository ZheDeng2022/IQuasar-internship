  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to expand the availability of emotional supports in order to promote&#xD;
      successful transitions and longer-term outcomes for autistic students in PSE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify mental health needs of autistic students to inform supports. Focus groups&#xD;
      engaging key stakeholders will be used to understand the mental health needs of autistic&#xD;
      college students and inform adaptation of two individualized mental health supports: 1) the&#xD;
      ESP intervention and 2) protocols for monitoring mood and psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop resources to inform and guide mental health care of autistic students. Focus&#xD;
      group information will inform 1) adaptation of clinician (ESP-C) and self-guided (ESP-S)&#xD;
      emotional support plans and monitoring protocols and 2) develop a &quot;College Student Mental&#xD;
      Health Guide&quot; to aide autistic college students, their families and mental health&#xD;
      professionals in proactive planning for mental health supports during PSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of the ESP-C and ESP-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will yield preliminary data to apply for additional funding to conduct a&#xD;
      large-scale trial to validate these methods to monitor and support mental health of autistic&#xD;
      adults. Information gathered from the study will also be used to inform development of a&#xD;
      mental health guide for autistic students.&#xD;

    <time_frame>15 week monitoring period</time_frame>
