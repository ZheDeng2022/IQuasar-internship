      In recent years, applications designed specifically to encourage physical activity in the&#xD;
      field of mobile technology have gained momentum. As a result of the literature research, no&#xD;
      examples of mobile health applications developed with educational content on fistula care,&#xD;
      which hemodialysis-dependent patients can reach at any time and place, have not been found.&#xD;
      Based on this, it was planned to increase the knowledge level of arteriovenous fistula care&#xD;
      and examine their self-care behaviors and their adaptation to the disease with the mobile&#xD;
      application developed with a focus on education on fistula care, which can be used&#xD;
      independently by machine-dependent hemodialysis patients. In this context, it is aimed that&#xD;
      dialysis patients will benefit especially in arteriovenous fistula care applications, thanks&#xD;
      to the ever-increasing mobile applications in daily use with the developing technology. It is&#xD;
      thought that the use of these technology-based trainings will be more comfortable, useful and&#xD;
      encouraging for their own self-care. It is planned to be a guide for healthcare&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;

      Chronic renal failure is a clinical picture characterized by chronic, progressive&#xD;
      deterioration in metabolic and endocrine functions, in adjusting the fluid-electrolyte&#xD;
      balance of the kidney as a result of a decrease in glomerular filtration value. When the&#xD;
      glomerular filtration value decreases to 5-10 ml/minute, end-stage renal failure develops.&#xD;
      Renal replacement therapies such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney&#xD;
      transplantation are applied in patients diagnosed with end-stage renal disease. Renal&#xD;
      replacement therapies are life-sparing treatments and the most common method applied is&#xD;
      hemodialysis. The success of dialysis, which is a highly effective medical technology, in&#xD;
      saving lives is indisputable. Arteriovenous fistula opened for hemodialysis is the lifeline&#xD;
      of sick individuals, and hemodialysis is a critical treatment method based on the vascular&#xD;
      access pathway. In this context, compliance with treatment is of vital importance in&#xD;
      individuals with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease, and lack of vascular access can&#xD;
      reduce its efficiency in a short time. Studies show that only 25% of hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      can take care of themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inadequacy of the individual's knowledge and behaviors of arteriovenous fistula care&#xD;
      impairs adherence to treatment, reduces the effectiveness of the treatment and increases the&#xD;
      cost. Interventions that encourage changes in health behavior and encourage individuals to&#xD;
      change their lifestyle should be integrated into daily life, and there should be support for&#xD;
      when and where individuals can make decisions that may affect their health. Mobile&#xD;
      technologies, such as smart mobile phones, that individuals regularly carry, can be an&#xD;
      effective platform for encouraging health behavior change, especially since they are likely&#xD;
      to be with the individual when they need it.&#xD;

    <description>Patients were informed about the Self-Care Behaviors Assessment Scale for Arteriovenous Fistula in Hemodialysis Patients. (The scale consisting of 16 items in total; Each item is scored according to the statements opposite. A minimum of 1 point indicates that the specified self-care behavior never develops, and the highest 5 points indicate that the specified self-care behavior always exists. The minimum score that can be obtained from the scale is 16, and the maximum score is 80.As the score increases, it is evaluated that the person's self-care behaviors are positive.)</description>

        to Private Hope Dialysis Center and Private Almet Dialysis Center for hemodialysis between&#xD;
        June 2020 and October 2020. In the study, the experimental and control groups were selected&#xD;
