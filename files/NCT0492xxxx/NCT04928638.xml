    <textblock>
      Despite its importance, there are few studies that implement the use of new technologies in&#xD;
      the approach to patients with asthma and allergy. Therefore, the objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a telematic educational intervention in patients with&#xD;
      allergies and / or asthma&#xD;

    <measure>Asthma knowledge questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to evaluate the knowledge about asthma. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, some of them with several items. In total, there are 54 possible true / false / don't know answers. Each correct answer is given the value of one point and each incorrect or unknown answer a score of 0. Thus, the score that can be obtained in total is 0-54.</description>

    <measure>Asthma control questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A simple questionnaire to measure the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. 7 items; 1 week recall (for items on symptoms and rescue inhaler use). 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment for symptoms and rescue use; and 7 categories for FEV1%).

    <measure>Test of Adherence to Inhalers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>12-item questionnaire designed to assess the adherence to inhalers. The final version of the questionnaire included 12 items with two main domains, the patient (items #1 to #10) and the health professional (items #11 and #12) domain. In fact, the TAI consists of two complementary questionnaires: the 10-items TAI was designed to identify non-adherent patients and to establish the non-adherence level, whereas the 12-items TAI was designed to guide clinically the non-adherence patterns.An erratic and deliberate non-adherent behavioral pattern was defined in the presence of scores ≤24 for items #1 to #5 and items #6 to #10, respectively. The unwitting pattern was defined in the presence of a score 1 in at least one of the #11 or #12 items of the questionnaire.</description>
