      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a laser called the SR-1&#xD;
      Skin Treatment System, or SR-1 Laser, for the treatment of wrinkles and pigmented spots.&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with the SR-1 Laser 3 or 4 times with each treatment spaced 4-6&#xD;
      weeks apart. The improvement in wrinkles and pigmented spots will be evaluated 1 and 3 months&#xD;
      after the final treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 1 point or greater reduction in facial wrinkle severity using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWS), as assessed, and agreed upon by at least two of three blinded independent reviewers in at least 70% of subjects as determined with a side-by-side evaluation of baseline and post-treatment photographs. The FWS scores range from 1 to 9 with lower numbers representing less severe wrinkles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject satisfaction with the improvement in wrinkles</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of subjects satisfied with the improvement in fine lines and wrinkles in the treated areas will be assessed using a Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Subject satisfaction with the improvement in BPL</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance of procedure</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of overall improvement in facial wrinkles and BPL in the treated area(s) as assessed by the investigator using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). Wrinkles and BPL will be considered together and one overall score will be created. Scores on the GAIS range from 0 to 4 which correspond to &quot;worsening of conditions&quot;, &quot;no improvement in conditions&quot;, &quot;mild improvement in conditions&quot;, &quot;moderate improvement in conditions&quot;, and &quot;significant improvement in conditions&quot;.</description>
