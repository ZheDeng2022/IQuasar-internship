      Aim: It was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of three-dimensional scoliosis exercises&#xD;
      and balance-coordination exercises in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;

      Method: Thirty patients who were diagnosed with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were randomly&#xD;
      divided into three groups. The first group was treated with 3-dimensional scoliosis exercise&#xD;
      program according to Schroth method, second group was treated with Schroth exercises and&#xD;
      balance-coordination exercises in addition to brace. Exercises were performed for a total of&#xD;
      6 weeks (18 sessions). The third group was treated only with brace and the control group&#xD;
      consisted of healthy individuals. Patients were assessed for their curve angle (Cobb method),&#xD;
      rotation angle (scoliometer), spinal flexibility (anterior and lateral bending tests),&#xD;
      quality of life (Scoliosis Research Society-22), cosmetic effects (Walter Reed Visual Rating&#xD;
      Scale), balance parameters (Balance Master System NeuroCom International Inc. Clackamas, OR,&#xD;
      USA ver 8.1), vertical perception (Subjective Vertical Detection test) and brain responses&#xD;
      (electroencephalography) were assessed before and after treatment. SPSS 20.0 statistical&#xD;
      program was used for data analysis of the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline subjective visual vertical perception at 6 weeks, Change from baseline subjective visual vertical perception at 1 year, Change from 6th weeks subjective visual vertical perception at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of subjective visual vertical perception (degree): Subjects were asked to manually verticalize the deviated laser line projected on a wall 1 m away in a room that is dark enough to prevent them from taking visual references while standing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline EEG at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In EEG recordings, epochs of 1000 ms before and 1000 ms after the stimulus were created. In these sweeps, those with amplitudes greater than ±50 μV in the EOG electrode channels and those with noise were removed. The files obtained for each individual were baseline corrected and filtered with a digital bandpass filter with 0.5 - 48 Hz limit values (12 dB/oct and zero phase shift, Neuroscan 4.5 ). After the filtering process, the mean (average) file was created for each individual.&#xD;
In measuring the amplitudes of the electrophysiological responses, the responses with the largest amplitudes between 0-1000 ms were measured and evaluated in µV. EEG recordings were taken from 64 channels. However, PO3, POZ and PO4 electrodes in the parieto-occipital region were investigated as these are the primary areas for visual stimuli.</description>

Three rounds, with an average session duration of 7.5 minutes, and a total of approximately 25-30 minutes of test with intervals. In the dichotic application, the participants were first asked to respond without paying attention to any of their ears (non-forced/NF). In the following session, the participants were told to direct their attention to their right ear (forced right ear attention/FR) and to direct their attention to their left ear (forced left ear attention/FL).</description>

    <description>The Scoliosis Research Society - 22 questionnaire (SRS-22) is a health-related quality of life questionnaire designed specifically for patients with spinal deformities. SRS-22 consists of the sub-headings of function, pain, body image, mental health and satisfaction with treatment and includes 22 questions in total.</description>
