  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multicentre randomised geko™ Foot and Ankle Trial will prospectively and systematically&#xD;
      collect clinical data on patients randomised, on a 1:1 basis, to either standard care or&#xD;
      standard care plus geko™ therapy to assess oedema management and patient outcomes during a&#xD;
      follow-up period of up to three months post-surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The geko™ device has a wide range of clinical applications including the post-operative&#xD;
      management of oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many short-term acute studies have been completed using the device, little clinical&#xD;
      data has been collected on the effect of geko™ use in current standard care pathways for&#xD;
      oedema management on patient outcomes during long term follow-up after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, multi-centre prospective randomised study. The study patient&#xD;
      population will be randomised on a 1:1 basis into two groups of 61 patients each. These&#xD;
      groups are defined as Group A patients who receive geko™ therapy and SC i.e. the intervention&#xD;
      group and Group B patients who receive Standard Care (SC) only i.e. no intervention. The&#xD;
      participants will be assessed pre-surgery and up to 90 days post-surgery.&#xD;
