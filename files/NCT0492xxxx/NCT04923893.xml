  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and&#xD;
      Dexamethasone (VRd) induction followed by a single administration of ciltacabtagene&#xD;
      autoleucel (cilta-cel) versus VRd induction followed by Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (Rd)&#xD;
      maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma participants for whom ASCT is not planned as&#xD;
      initial therapy in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the production of&#xD;
      monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins or protein fragments (M proteins) that have lost&#xD;
      their function. JNJ-68284528 (ciltacabtagene autoleucel [cilta-cel]) is an autologous&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell maturation antigen&#xD;
      (BCMA), a molecule expressed on the surface of mature B lymphocytes and malignant plasma&#xD;
      cells. The primary hypothesis of this study is that in participants with newly diagnosed MM,&#xD;
      treatment with VRd induction followed by a single administration of cilta-cel will&#xD;
      significantly improve progression free survival compared to Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and&#xD;
      Dexamethasone (VRd) induction followed by Rd maintenance. The study will screen participants&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed MM who are not planned to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)&#xD;
      as initial therapy. This study will be conducted in 4 phases: Screening (up to 28 days),&#xD;
      Pre-randomization Treatment, Treatment, and Follow-up. Assessments like patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome(s) (PROs), electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs and pharmacokinetics will be&#xD;
      performed during the study. Safety evaluations will include review of adverse events,&#xD;
      laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, assessment&#xD;
      of cardiac function, Immune-Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE) and handwriting&#xD;
      assessments (only for Arm B) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance&#xD;
      status. Safety data will be periodically reviewed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (IDMC). The duration of the study is approximately 12 years 5 months.&#xD;
