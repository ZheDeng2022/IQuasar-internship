  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find objective biomarkers of vaso-occlusion (blood vessel&#xD;
      blockage) in people with SCD. Using information from earlier studies and work being done,&#xD;
      researchers have developed a strategy to image VOC, using positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to see and measure VOC in SCD patients can help patient care, by showing when and&#xD;
      how a VOC is occurring or going to occur. Studying this method will also help in future drug&#xD;
      research, as it will allow researchers to deliver promising new medications that target&#xD;
      hyper-adhesion and sickling in people with SCD.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to find objective biomarkers of vaso-occlusion (blood vessel&#xD;
      blockage) in people with Sickle Cell Disease(SCD). Using information from earlier studies,&#xD;
      and work being done at Washington University, a strategy to image vaso-occulusive crisis&#xD;
      (VOC) has been developed, using positron emission tomography (PET) for anatomical&#xD;
      localization only. 64Cu-LLP2A is the radio tracer used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To develop quantitative PET imaging of VOC in patients with SCD. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that the radio tracer 64Cu-LLP2A uptake increases proportionally to the intensity&#xD;
      of pain in patients with VOC, compared to baseline values. This increase in uptake will be&#xD;
      assessed focally in areas of pain as well as globally to reflect heightened systemic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary study endpoint: The overarching hypothesis of this study is that PET&#xD;
      tracer uptake of intensity of 64Cu-LLP2A is a real time, quantitative measure of hyper&#xD;
      adhesion in VOC.&#xD;
