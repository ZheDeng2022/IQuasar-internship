  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment in the UK.&#xD;
      The condition is characterised by damage to the region of the retina (macula) responsible for&#xD;
      detailed central vision, this leading to problems with tasks such as reading and&#xD;
      face-recognition. The ability to accurately measure vision is central to the detection and&#xD;
      management of AMD. The most common test (visual acuity) typically requires patients to&#xD;
      identify black letters of varying size on a white background, with the smallest letter read&#xD;
      representing the limit of vision. Conventional tests are however known to be variable, making&#xD;
      it difficult to determine if a true change in vision has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work has found the Moorfields Acuity Chart, which contains specially constructed&#xD;
      letters composed of a black core and white border, to be more sensitive to early AMD compared&#xD;
      to standard charts. Despite this advantage, it is unclear if there is an associated increase&#xD;
      in measurement variability with the Moorfields Acuity Chart and if this changes with the&#xD;
      severity of disease. In this study, the relationship between vision test sensitivity and&#xD;
      measurement variability will be quantified with both conventional visual acuity tests and the&#xD;
      new Moorfields Acuity Chart to identify the optimal vision test to detect and monitor AMD in&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;

    <description>Those subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo the study tests. These measurements will be performed on one eye only. Visual acuity will be quantified using two forms of the MAC chart (MAC 1 and 2) and two forms of a conventional letter design chart (C1 and 2). Contrast sensitivity will be measured using the two forms of the Pelli-Robson chart (CS1 and CS2). The order with which the test charts will be presented, in addition to the charts used (i.e. MAC 1 or 2, C1 or 2, and CS1 or 2), will be selected at random. Finally, a measurement of eye length will be collected using an IOL Master (Carl-Zeiss Meditec, USA).</description>
