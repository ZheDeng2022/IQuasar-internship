      This measurement validation study will use qualitative and quantitative methodology to&#xD;
      evaluate the Observer-Reported Communication Ability Measure (ORCA), to appropriately capture&#xD;
      communication abilities in individuals with Rett syndrome. The ORCA Measure is a&#xD;
      caregiver-reported questionnaire that collects caregiver observations of their child's&#xD;
      communication abilities including expressive, receptive and pragmatic communication types.&#xD;
      Caregivers will participate via phone interviews and online surveys. Approximately 270&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled.&#xD;

      This study will develop the Observer-Reported Communication Ability Measure (ORCA),&#xD;
      originally validated for Angelman syndrome, to appropriately capture communication abilities&#xD;
      in individuals with Rett syndrome. The ORCA Measure is a caregiver-reported questionnaire&#xD;
      that collects caregiver observations of their child's communication abilities including&#xD;
      expressive, receptive and pragmatic communication. The goal of the study is to generate a&#xD;
      validated tool to comprehensively assess communication in Rett syndrome and create an&#xD;
      important endpoint for use in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1, a hybrid approach to concept elicitation and cognitive testing will occur with&#xD;
      caregivers to assess the existing ORCA measure and evaluate ORCA content validity.&#xD;
      Approximately 20 parents/caregivers of individuals with Rett syndrome will participate in&#xD;
      qualitative in-depth interviews. The ORCA measure, instructions, recall period, and response&#xD;
      choices will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2, psychometric properties including reliability, floor/ceiling effects, construct&#xD;
      validity, and test-retest will be evaluated with approximately 250 caregiver-parents of&#xD;
      individuals with Rett syndrome. Caregivers will also complete additional questionnaires to&#xD;
      allow comparison between the ORCA measure and existing measures. Analysts will use a variety&#xD;
      of statistical methods to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ORCA measure in Rett&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

    <description>Using qualitative and quantitative methodology the existing ORCA measure will be evaluated for use in Rett syndrome and modified if needed. The ORCA measure produces a single score that is an estimate of an individual's overall level of communication ability. Higher ORCA scores reflect greater communication ability; the mastery of expressive, receptive, and pragmatic types of communication and higher vocabularies for verbal words and symbols on assistive devices. The ORCA T-score range is from 26.82 to 83.24.</description>
