      To estimate the pulmonary response microvascular thrombosis in critical patients due to&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2., at the Hospital General de México &quot;Dr. Eduardo Liceaga&quot;, a 15 patients&#xD;
      compassionate treatment study was authorized and approved by the ethics and research&#xD;
      committee DI-222-2020. Because of the severity of the illness the legal representative sign&#xD;
      informed consent in all the patients for performing in-situ thrombolysis with alteplase&#xD;
      selectively by catheter in each main pulmonary artery, under fluoroscopic guidance and&#xD;
      acquiring images with the iFlow software to assess immediate and post-procedure response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main clinical characteristic of patients with severe SARS-Cov-2 infection is hypoxemic&#xD;
      respiratory failure that requires Mechanical Ventilation. The Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      model has been proposed as the cause of this significant deterioration in lung function and&#xD;
      all management has focused on ventilatory support management. As for ventilatory failure, it&#xD;
      has been attributed to the presence of severe pulmonary inflammation evolving to fibrosis,&#xD;
      which is the clinical characteristic of patients with Primary Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
      (which would be the case of this as it is considered a respiratory virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several autopsy studies demonstrated microthrombi in pulmonary circulation. The major&#xD;
      limitation of these investigations is that the autopsy provided static information. Some of&#xD;
      these alterations could be secondary to the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)&#xD;
      observed as the standard route to the multisystem organ failure exhibited in critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this comes the contradictory results of high doses of anticoagulants in the survival of&#xD;
      these patients. This intermediate to high doses can reduce organ support treatments in&#xD;
      moderate cases, however, in critically ill patients the benefit of high dose of&#xD;
      anticoagulants, once again failed to produce benefit on survival. Different publication on&#xD;
      biopsies made in these patients have report the presence of thrombosis in the&#xD;
      microcirculation and finally recently has been published the demonstration by direct&#xD;
      examination with Citoscam, the presence of this thrombosis of the microcirculation in vivo in&#xD;
      11 of 13 test (85% of the sample). Studies performed with viscoelastic coagulation tests&#xD;
      present evidence of three key alterations in coagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EXTEM and INTEM Hypercoagulable states represented by a maximum amplitude (A5, A10 and&#xD;
           MCF) greater than 70mm, short clot formation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hyperfibrinogenemia A5 A10 MCF in FIBTEM greater than 30mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Absence of fibrinolytic activity (ML% Lys 30 and Lys 60) 100% Taking this into account&#xD;
           plus the large number of publications regarding the thrombotic phenomenon of the patient&#xD;
           with COVID-19, this could be explained by the presence of a phenomenon of ventilation&#xD;
           perfusion (V / Q) that is observed in patients with Massive Pulmonary Thromboembolism&#xD;
           (PE) which is known as the infinite relationship, that is, the lung is with normal&#xD;
           aeration, but no perfusion, there is no adequate gas exchange, with presence of hypoxia,&#xD;
           increment of death space and ultimately obstructive shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with COVID-19, this phenomenon is observed in patients with absence of massive or&#xD;
      submassive PE that explains this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, the presence of&#xD;
      thrombosis of the microcirculation and the lack of efficacy of anticoagulation in some cases&#xD;
      suggests that this phenomenon could be the cause of the behavior between perfusion&#xD;
      ventilation observed in SARS-Cov-2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, a probe of concept research was developed to find out if pulmonary&#xD;
      perfusion alteration by microthrombosis and secondary V / Q abnormalities could be linked to&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of the patient with severe SARS-Cov-2 infection.&#xD;
