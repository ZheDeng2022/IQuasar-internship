  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the previous studies, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) with fanning technique in&#xD;
      solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) with avascular areas had a negative impact on diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of FNA. Because of the retrospective basis of previous studies, a prospective study&#xD;
      is warranted to answer whether contrast-enhanced harmonic(CEH) EUS-guided FNA/B is superior&#xD;
      to conventional EUS-guided FNA/B with fanning technique in SPLs. The main objective of this&#xD;
      randomized trial therefore was to determine whether CEH-EUS-guided sampling to avoid&#xD;
      non-enhanced areas within a mass lesion result in more rapid diagnosis requiring fewer FNB&#xD;
      passes than the conventional EUS-guided FNB with fanning needle throughout the mass is&#xD;
      targeted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken of patients with solid pancreatic&#xD;
      mass lesions who were referred for EUS. Total 120 patients were randomized with 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      into undergo CEH-EUS-guided FNB or conventional EUS-guided FNB with fanning technique. At the&#xD;
      time of the procedure, the endoscopy nurse opened an envelope containing computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization assignments for the study patients. All procedures were performed by a linear&#xD;
      array echoendoscope (Olympus UCT260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Procedures were performed under&#xD;
      conscious sedation with patients in the left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CEH-EUS-guided FNB group, needle puncture directly to the enhancing area 15-20 times&#xD;
      without passing to the non-enhancing area was performed. In conventional-EUS-guided FNB with&#xD;
      fanning technique group, the needle was positioned at four different areas within the mass&#xD;
      and then moved back and forth four times in each area to procure tissue (4 × 4). After each&#xD;
      pass, the needle is removed and the stylet will be introduced into the needle to extrude any&#xD;
      aspirated material on a glass slide for inspection of the presence of a macroscopic visible&#xD;
      core (MVC). The total length of the MVC will be measured before placement into a formalin&#xD;
      bottle. EUS-FNB is completed if the obtained MVC is longer than 4mm and deemed adequate by&#xD;
      endoscopist. If the obtained MVC is &lt; 4mm, the procedure is repeated until a MVC of ≥ 4mm is&#xD;
      obtained and deemed adequate by endoscopist. A maximum of 7 passes is allowed.&#xD;
