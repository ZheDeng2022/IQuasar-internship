  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an &quot;inclisiran first&quot;&#xD;
      implementation strategy (addition of inclisiran to maximally tolerated statin therapy&#xD;
      immediately upon failure to achieve acceptable LDL-C with maximally tolerated statin therapy&#xD;
      alone) compared to usual care in an ASCVD population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be a randomized, two-arm, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter,&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing an &quot;inclisiran first&quot; implementation strategy to usual care in&#xD;
      approximately 444 participants (1:1 randomization) with established ASCVD and elevated LDL-C&#xD;
      (or non-HDL-C) despite treatment with maximally tolerated statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include male and female participants ≥18 years of age with a history of ASCVD&#xD;
      (coronary heart disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease) who&#xD;
      have elevated LDL-C (≥70 mg/dL) or non-HDL-C (≥100 mg/dL) despite being treated with&#xD;
      maximally tolerated statin therapy. A total of approximately 444 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to the &quot;inclisiran first&quot; implementation strategy or usual care in a 1:1 ratio at&#xD;
      approximately 40 US sites.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Any uncontrolled or serious disease, or any medical or surgical condition, that may&#xD;
             either interfere with participation in the clinical study, and/or put the participant&#xD;

             becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic methods of contraception during dosing&#xD;
             of investigational drug. Basic contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;

                  assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male sterilization (at least 6 m prior to screening). For female participants in&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
                  intrauterine system (IUS) In case of use of oral contraception, women should have&#xD;
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking&#xD;
                  investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known history of alcohol and/or drug abuse within the last 5 years (occasional casual&#xD;
             users of illicit drugs in the opinion of the investigators are not excluded)&#xD;

         11. Treatment with other investigational products or devices within 30 days or five&#xD;
             half-lives of the screening visit, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;

             drugs of similar chemical classes&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Planned use of other investigational products or devices during the course of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any condition that according to the investigator could interfere with the conduct of&#xD;
             the study, such as but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participants who are unable to communicate or to cooperate with the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related&#xD;
                  restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study&#xD;
                  (including participants whose cooperation is doubtful due to drug abuse or&#xD;
                  alcohol dependency)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and&#xD;
                  study-related restrictions (e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for&#xD;
                  follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study - including potential&#xD;
                  participants who indicate that their participation is contingent on receiving&#xD;
                  inclisiran)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Have any medical or surgical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Previous or current treatment (within 90 days of screening) with monoclonal antibodies&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Active liver disease defined as any known current infectious, neoplastic, or metabolic&#xD;
             pathology of the liver or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation &gt;3x ULN, aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) elevation &gt;3x ULN, or total bilirubin elevation &gt;2x ULN (except&#xD;
             patients with Gilbert's syndrome) at screening confirmed by a repeat measurement at&#xD;
