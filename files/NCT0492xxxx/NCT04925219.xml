  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supervised exercise for intermittent claudication is a first line therapy for peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#xD;
      and the European Society for Vascular Surgery. However 2/3 of British trusts cannot implement&#xD;
      this due to gym availability, costs, travel time and the requirement for social distancing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 lockdown the investigators successfully performed a feasibility study for&#xD;
      remotely supervised exercise using an electronic walking log and fortnightly video calls with&#xD;
      a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESET2 aims to compare the benefits of and adherence to remotely supervised exercise with&#xD;
      self-directed exercise to absolute walking distance.&#xD;

      Design A single centre, pilot, randomised controlled trial at Mid and South Essex Hospitals&#xD;
      Foundation Trust. The study is unfunded and sponsored by Mid and South Essex Hospitals&#xD;
      National Health Service Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size This is a pilot randomised controlled trial to generate a sample size calculation&#xD;
      for a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the feasibility data from RESET1 and the published results of supervised exercise,&#xD;
      the expected benefit of remotely supervised exercise is about 180 metres extra walking&#xD;
      distance, with a standard deviation of 150m in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With alpha=0.05 (5% false positive rate) and beta=0.1 (90% power), 16 patients in each arm&#xD;
      are required to demonstrate a mean difference in the primary endpoint of 180 metres, using a&#xD;
      2 sided t-test (MedCalc statistical software, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be 20+20 patients from Mid and South Essex Trust vascular outpatient&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up There will be 3 assessment visits: baseline, 3 months and 6 months performed with a&#xD;
      study clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be measured blind to treatment allocation by asking the patient to&#xD;
      walk along a flat, hospital corridor until they need to stop due to leg pain. This will be&#xD;
      measured at 0, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint will be through patient questionnaires and scored by an independent&#xD;
      observer at baseline, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle-brachial pressure index will be measured by an independent vascular scientist at the&#xD;
      start and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be measured at 3 months using a self-reported questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to exercise will be measured through submission of walking logs at 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
