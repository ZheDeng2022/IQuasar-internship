  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy develops due to brain damage before, during and after birth. Motor control is&#xD;
      impaired in individuals with cerebral palsy. Disturbances occur in muscle tone, mobility and&#xD;
      body posture. There is no definitive treatment for cerebral palsy, but improvement in&#xD;
      functions can be achieved with physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the covid-19 pandemic precautions, activity level has been decreasing in children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy, as in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children experience physical, social and psychological problems caused by physical&#xD;
      inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises and games that can be done comfortably in the house will positively affect the&#xD;
      physical development of children and enable them to spend productive time by getting away&#xD;
      from excessive technology, internet and smart phone usage, excessive screen time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project; To ensure that children with cerebral palsy who need intense&#xD;
      exercise and activity and who experience physical inactivity due to COVID-19 can exercise&#xD;
      with telerehabilitation and to determine the effect of telerehabilitation on the quality of&#xD;
      life, anxiety and depression levels of children with cerebral palsy and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be compared to a control group that did not accept telerehabilitation but was&#xD;
      recommended to exercise at home.&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy (SP); It is a group of permanent neuromotor disorders affecting movement,&#xD;
      muscle tone and posture development as a result of non-progressive damage to the brain in the&#xD;
      prenatal and neonatal period. In children with CP, it is observed that primitive reflexes&#xD;
      continue, correction reactions occur late, muscle weakness, spasticity, loss of coordination&#xD;
      and normal motor control cannot develop. Clinically SP; Spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic and mixed&#xD;
      types are divided into four groups as SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no definitive treatment for CP, physiotherapy applications are of great&#xD;
      importance in the treatment of problems. With physical therapy exercises, it is known that&#xD;
      children with CP progress in factors such as postural control, muscle strength, flexibility,&#xD;
      balance, physical activity capacity, mental well-being, participation in social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, which has recently surrounded the whole world, has&#xD;
      caused serious measures to be taken in all areas in our country. Serious warnings are made&#xD;
      that everyone should stay at home. During this period, physical activity levels of children&#xD;
      as well as adults decreased significantly. Children experience physical, social and&#xD;
      psychological problems caused by physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises and games that can be done easily in the house will positively affect the physical&#xD;
      development of children and enable them to spend productive time by getting away from&#xD;
      excessive technology, internet and smart phone usage, excessive screen time. (aerobic) and&#xD;
      stretching activities. Physical activity programs that are age-appropriate, fun and diverse&#xD;
      should be created for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, games for physical activity in the family; It is also thought that it will&#xD;
      increase socialization within the family, that individuals will listen to each other more,&#xD;
      understand, share more, and prevent some anxiety and stress caused by coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project; To ensure that children with cerebral palsy who need intense&#xD;
      exercise and activity and who experience physical inactivity due to COVID-19 can exercise&#xD;
      with telerehabilitation and to determine the effect of telerehabilitation on the quality of&#xD;
      life, anxiety and depression levels of children with cerebral palsy and their caregivers. It&#xD;
      will be compared to a control group that did not accept telerehabilitation but was&#xD;
      recommended to exercise at home.&#xD;
