      Recruiting patients with clinical stage II to III HER2-positive breast cancer for primary&#xD;
      treatment, eligible subjects will be enrolled as followsï¼š This study is a single-arm,&#xD;
      single-center exploratory clinical study. Twenty patients with early-stage HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer are planned to be included, and the primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of neoadjuvant regimen of Pyrotinib in combination with trastuzumab +&#xD;
      pertuzumab.Eligible subjects who met the enrollment criteria and signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form entered the trial period and received epirubicin 100 mg/m2, iv cyclophosphamide 600&#xD;
      mg/m2, iv + Pyrotinib 400 mg/d, po for 4 weeks, sequential docetaxel 80 mg/m2, iv +&#xD;
      trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (first dose 8 mg/kg), iv + pertuzumab 420 mg (first dose 840 mg), iv ,po&#xD;
      4 cycles of treatment. Surgery was performed at the end of the above treatment cycles, and&#xD;
      adjuvant targeted therapy was continued after surgery: trastuzumab + patuximab for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects (20) who met the nadir criteria and signed the informed consent form&#xD;
      entered the trial period and received the ECPy-THP regimen: i.e., epirubicin 100 mg/m2, iv +&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, iv + Pyrotinib 400 mg/d, po 4 cycles, sequential docetaxel 80&#xD;
      mg/m2, iv + trastuzumab 6 mg/kg (first dose 8 mg/kg), iv + patuximab 420 mg (first dose 840&#xD;
      mg), iv, po 4 cycles of treatment. If the efficacy of 4 cycles was evaluated as PD or SD, the&#xD;
      regimen was promptly adjusted for surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery was performed at the end of the above treatment cycles, and adjuvant targeted therapy&#xD;
      was continued after surgery: patients who reached pCR continued trastuzumab + pertuzumab for&#xD;
      1 year, and non-pCR patients were treated according to the guideline-recommended backline&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent surgery or radiotherapy continuation within 16-20 d after completion&#xD;
      of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle, and the efficacy was assessed 1 to 2 d before&#xD;
      continuation of treatment.&#xD;
