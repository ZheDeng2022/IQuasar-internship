      The purpose of this multicenter, open-label, dose-increasing, multiple-dose study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability,PK and preliminary efficacy of HEC53856 capsules in renal&#xD;
      anemia subjects on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis . Within each part&#xD;
      participants will be administrated for HEC53856.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period :up to 2weeks; Treatment period: 6 weeks（except that 7 weeks in the 100mg&#xD;
      cohort in the hemodialysis）; Follow-up period: 2weeks.&#xD;
