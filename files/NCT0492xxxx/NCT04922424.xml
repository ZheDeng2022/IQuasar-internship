  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gender-identity differences are becoming increasingly diagnosed in the US and treatment with&#xD;
      gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is associated with improved mental health outcomes.&#xD;
      However, GAHT has been associated with cardiovascular risk in adult transgender patients,&#xD;
      although mechanisms and treatments have not been explored. Understanding the cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects and exploring the potential of a lipid sensitive statin as a potential treatment is&#xD;
      important to optimizing safe treatment strategies for transgender men in mitigating this&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor, and designing and implementing effective interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the US approximately 1.4 million men identify as transgender, a number that is likely to&#xD;
      increase with greater recognition of this condition. Gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT),&#xD;
      which attempts to more align the physical appearance with the identified gender, is the&#xD;
      primary medical intervention for transgender people and is recognized as medically necessary.&#xD;
      GAHT has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk (increased blood pressure,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction) in transgender men receiving androgens, however&#xD;
      little is known about the mechanisms for these changes and few interventions have been&#xD;
      proposed. We hypothesize that the altered hormonal milieu is the major driver of increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in trans men, and the initiation of testosterone will have effects on&#xD;
      lipid profiles, blood pressure and endothelial function. In addition, androgen exposure&#xD;
      within the female vascular system is associated with sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      dysregulation. We propose this dysregulation is mediated through rapid dyslipidemia&#xD;
      associated with GAHT in trans men receiving androgens. The first aim of this proposal is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment in trans men increases sympathetic&#xD;
      activation, blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      vascular endothelial cells are crucial to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease. Thus, the&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering effects of certain statins appear to be mediated, in part, by their&#xD;
      action on the endothelium. Important to these studies, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e.&#xD;
      lipid dependent statins) not only lower LDL-C, but improve both central sympathetic and&#xD;
      peripheral microvascular function. Therefore, our second aim is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      lipid dependent statin therapy will decrease sympathetic activation and improve endothelial&#xD;
      function in trans men taking GAHT indicating that the increased sympathetic activity and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction are mediated by the increased LDL-C with androgens. Trans men&#xD;
      undergoing GAHT and cisgender female controls will be examined twice: at baseline, and again&#xD;
      following 30 days of treatment with the lipid dependent statin, atorvastatin, in a randomized&#xD;
      cross over design. Using microneurography, measures of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in&#xD;
      response to stressors will be quantified and analyzed within- and between groups and&#xD;
      cardiovascular metrics including beat to beat blood pressure and conduit-level endothelial&#xD;
      function will be assessed at baseline and with atorvastatin treatment. These novel and&#xD;
      innovative studies will illuminate the sympathetic and vascular changes that accompany GAHT,&#xD;
      and our atorvastatin intervention will provide insight into the mechanism for these changes&#xD;
      as well as provide a method to reduce these risks in trans men undergoing GAHT. This is a&#xD;
      critical gap in our knowledge; once these early changes can be identified and quantified,&#xD;
      subsequent studies can track these changes over longer trajectories of treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>FMD measures endothelial function, measured in % change from baseline arterial diameter after release following a short period of occlusion occlusion. The % change in diameter reflects the ability of the vessel to dilate in response to sheer stress induced by the flow following the release of occlusion. This reflects the function of the endothelium, or release of nitric oxide.</description>
