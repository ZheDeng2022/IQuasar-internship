      To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Revanesse Shape + with Lidocaine versus&#xD;
      Juvederm Voluma with Lidocaine for subcutaneous and/or supraperiosteal injection to improve&#xD;
      appearance through the correction of age-related mid-face volume deficit in patients 22 years&#xD;
      of age through 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midface volume deficit / lipoatrophy (loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue that is most&#xD;
      apparent in the face) may be associated with acquired conditions, the aging process, or based&#xD;
      on genetic causes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double blind, split-face study in subjects seeking to&#xD;
      correct mid-face volume deficit. Subjects will be treated with Revanesse Shape + with&#xD;
      Lidocaine on one side of the face and Juvederm Voluma with Lidocaine on the other side of the&#xD;
      face. The side of the face for each device will be randomly assigned. The Evaluating&#xD;
      Investigator performing the evaluations and the subject will be blinded to the treatment;&#xD;
      injections of the study device will be performed by an unblinded Treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the blinded Evaluating Investigator evaluations and subject evaluations of the&#xD;
      treated areas will be performed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment will be done at Visit 1 and a touch-up if necessary at Visit 3/Month 1.&#xD;
      One optimal correction touch-up can be administered for subjects who experience asymmetrical&#xD;
      cheeks after Visit 5/Month 3 and before Visit 7/Month 12 . The Blinded Evaluating&#xD;
      Investigator will confirm the asymmetry with at least a 1-grade difference between cheeks.&#xD;
      The touch up will be offered on the under-corrected side with the same product that was&#xD;
      initially implanted. In addition, subjects will have a safety follow-up telephone call 3 days&#xD;
      (± 2 days) after any optimal correction touch-up to correct asymmetry administered between&#xD;
      Visit 5/Month 3 and Visit 7/Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be retreated at the Month 12 Visit if a ≥ 1 grade change or return to baseline&#xD;
      of the MMVS scores on one or both sides of the face.&#xD;

      subject and Evaluating Investigator Nasolabial Folds Wrinkle Severity Rating Score (WSRS)&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) at all study visits. In addition,&#xD;
      other mid-face safety evaluations including firmness, function (movement), mass formation and&#xD;
      sensation will be performed at baseline and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other evaluations include subject overall satisfaction of facial appearance, subject&#xD;
      satisfaction with mid-facial region, subject look of mid-face, subject feel of mid-face,&#xD;
      subject self-perception of age, subject happiness with contour/shape of mid-face, subject&#xD;
