  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restricted range of shoulder motion following ORIF is a potential complication that severely&#xD;
      affects the patients' functional outcome and should be actively avoided by means of adequate&#xD;
      pain control in addition to early mobilization and physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve blocks, which can be given as a single injection or continuous infusion via&#xD;
      an indwelling catheter, are analgesic options to be considered. Interscalene Block (ISB) is&#xD;
      the regional analgesia of choice for the shoulder and proximal humerus region. While&#xD;
      continuous infusion (aka continuous nerve block) offers the advantage of a longer duration of&#xD;
      analgesia compared to a single injection of standard local anaesthetic, it is associated with&#xD;
      an inherent risk of catheter displacement, dislodgement, obstruction, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to Standard Bupivacaine (SB), Liposomal Bupivacaine (LB) is a formulation designed&#xD;
      to prolong the duration of action to up to 72 hours by slow release of bupivacaine from the&#xD;
      multi-vesicular liposomes. Although prolonged analgesic effects of LB over Normal Saline (NS)&#xD;
      have long been demonstrated in numerous studies, the effectiveness of LB infiltration&#xD;
      compared to SB cannot be consistently demonstrated in general surgery. Similar inferior&#xD;
      analgesia of infiltrated LB has been documented in RCTs involving knee and shoulder surgery&#xD;
      for both single-injection and continuous nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, adding LB to SB in ISB lowered the worst pain scores in the first postoperative&#xD;
      week with major shoulder surgery compared to using SB alone. To date, no studies have&#xD;
      examined the effectiveness of LB in ISB compared to continuous nerve block for shoulder&#xD;
      surgery or ORIF of proximal humeral fractures.&#xD;

      CONDUCT OF ISB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects and potential complications will be explained and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-out will be performed before the start of ISB in accordance with the WHO checklist,&#xD;
      confirming the side of surgery with the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring will be placed and an intravenous catheter will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ISB will be performed by anaesthetists experienced in ultrasound-guided ISB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aseptic technique will be applied. ISB will be performed under ultrasound guidance in an&#xD;
      in-plane manner. Catheter-over-needle set with a 50mm short-bevel insulated needle will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of needle will be confirmed with sonoanatomy, absence of persistent paraesthesia,&#xD;
      negative aspiration of air and blood, real-time visualisation of the spread of drug and low&#xD;
      resistance upon injection. The catheter will be left in-situ and sutured to the skin after&#xD;
      injection of the drug and withdrawal of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the supraclavicular nerve nor the suprascapular nerve will be blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a peripheral nerve stimulator and administration of sedation will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful ISB is defined as loss of cold sensation to ice in the C5 dermatome, which will&#xD;
      be tested by the attending anaesthetist in addition to assessing the presence of&#xD;
      aforementioned complications before induction of general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANAESTHESIA &amp; ANALGESIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) PRE-OPERATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative assessment will be taken at the pre-admission clinic or at the general&#xD;
      ward, followed by these orders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG and chest x-ray Standard fasting times (6 hours for solid food and 2 hours for clear&#xD;
      liquid) No analgesics or sedatives as premedication&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) INTRA-OPERATIVE: ISB will be performed as described above before induction of General&#xD;
      Anaesthesia (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Induction of GA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Fentanyl 2mcg/kg IV Propofol 2-4 mg/kg Choice of muscle relaxant at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anaesthetist&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Maintenance of GA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air/O2/desflurane, target MAC: 0.6 -1.0 IV Morphine 3mg before skin incision IV Remifentanil&#xD;
      0.1-0.2 mcg/kg/min, target SBP not more than 20% increase from baseline Choice of muscle&#xD;
      relaxant and IV fluid at the discretion of the attending anaesthetist Vasopressors,&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive medications, anti-arrhythmia medications may be given as necessary No&#xD;
      Paracetamol / NSAID / Ketamine / Dexmedetomidine / IV Lidocaine infusion / Magnesium No LA&#xD;
      infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Emergence from GA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Ondansetron 4mg Reversal agents may be given&#xD;
&#xD;
      (III) POST-OPERATIVE (PHASE I RECOVERY IN PACU): All subjects will be transferred to PACU for&#xD;
      further monitoring for at least 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indwelling catheter will be connected to a fixed-rate portable elastometric pump ( Easy&#xD;
      pump, Â®) upon arrival in the recovery room by the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain at rest will be evaluated every 5 mins using NRS. If the score is greater than 4/10, 2mg&#xD;
      morphine will be given intravenously every 5 mins provided the subject has a respiratory rate&#xD;
      of &gt; 12/min and a sedation score of &lt;1 until a NRS of &lt; 4/10 is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of complications will be assessed by the attending anaesthetist before discharge&#xD;
      from PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (IV) POST-OPERATIVE (PHASE II IN WARD): BP, heart rate, SpO2, and sedation score will be&#xD;
      monitored at 1-hour intervals while on PCA morphine; BP and heart rate will be monitored at&#xD;
      4-hour intervals once PCA morphine is terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet will be resumed on Post-Operative Day 0. All subjects will undergo standard&#xD;
      institutional rehabilitation program, which consists of supervised passive forward flexion&#xD;
      and external rotation exercise for 3 weeks, followed by assisted active movements till 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized analgesic regime will be prescribed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV PCA morphine for 2 days PO paracetamol 500mg QID for 1 week PO celecoxib 200mg daily for 1&#xD;
      week IMI morphine 0.1mg/kg Q4H prn as rescue analgesic for 5 days IV ondansetron 0.1mg/kg Q8H&#xD;
      prn for 5 days PO Dihydroxycodeine 30mg QID prn for 1 week upon discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms of complications will be assessed by the pain team daily until&#xD;
      postoperative day 2 when the pump and catheter will be removed. Pain assessment and side&#xD;
      effects related to analgesic will be assessed by the pain team daily until postoperative day&#xD;
      2, followed by phone follow-up until postoperative day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      For phone follow-up, patients will be received a phone call in the afternoon at around 3 pm&#xD;
      for both pain score and Overall Benefit of Analgesic Scale (OBAS)&#xD;
