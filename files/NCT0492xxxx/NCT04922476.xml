  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of supplementation with Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      longum 35624® Alflorex® on frequency and severity of symptoms of abdominal pain using the&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (IBS-GSRS) and validated&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS-II) in children with Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders&#xD;
      (FGIDs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the safety and effectiveness of Bifidobacterium longum&#xD;
      35624® Alflorex® when consumed once daily by children with Functional Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Disorders (FGIDs). The 12-week intervention study will be conducted in 100 non-coeliac&#xD;
      children aged 8 to 18 years old with an FGID who experience at least two episodes of&#xD;
      abdominal pain per week. The study will consist of 5 visits over a 14 week period commencing&#xD;
      with a screening visit. The second visit will be the baseline (start of intervention),&#xD;
      followed by third (mid-intervention), fourth (end of treatment) and fifth (follow up) visit.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered from the second to the fifth visit. A blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken before treatment to rule out coeliac disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline, assessed at 6 and 12 weeks of supplement intake</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS-IBS measures symptom severity and symptom frequency in IBS patients and is a reliable and validated questionnaire. Thirteen questions are evaluated and rated from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort) on a Likert scale. The total scores can range from 13 to 91 (sum of the domains). The GSRS-IBS evaluates 5 domains: abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and satiety. Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>
