  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial in which hospitalized patients with anemia are&#xD;
      randomized to receive transfusion at: a) Hb&lt;9g/dL (liberal transfusion strategy), or b)&#xD;
      Hb&lt;7g/dL (restrictive transfusion strategy). We are measuring self-reported fatigability,&#xD;
      fatigue, and activity levels at randomization and 7 days post hospital discharge in both&#xD;
      trial arms. In a subset of 75 patients in each trial arm (150 total), we will are&#xD;
      administering the 6 Minute Walk Test at randomization and 7 days post discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of hospitalized adult&#xD;
      general medicine patients with anemia at the University of Chicago (UC). Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive transfusion at either a hemoglobin (Hb)&lt;9g/dL (liberal arm) or a&#xD;
      Hb&lt;7g/dL (restrictive arm) throughout their hospitalization. Self-reported fatigability,&#xD;
      fatigue, and activity levels will be measured in consented patients at randomization and&#xD;
      through a follow-up phone call 7 days after hospital discharge. We will also enroll 150&#xD;
      patients to participate in the Six Minute Walk Test85,86 (6MWT) at randomization and in the&#xD;
      clinic 7 days after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will test whether a liberal transfusion strategy is superior to a restrictive&#xD;
      transfusion in hospitalized patients with anemia on fatigability levels after hospital&#xD;
      discharge. Our primary outcome is self-reported fatigability level 7 days after hospital&#xD;
      discharge measured using the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS)71. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include fatigue measured using the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS) Fatigue Aa instrument, and activity measured by the Physical Activity Scale for the&#xD;
      Elderly, and 6MWT distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for this trial will be recruited from the University of Chicago Medical&#xD;
      Center (UCMC) general medicine services using the University of Chicago Hospitalist Project&#xD;
      (UCHP) research infrastructure. The eligibility criteria is: 1) hospitalized adult &gt;18 years&#xD;
      of age, 2) admitted to the general medicine services at the University of Chicago, 3) any Hb&#xD;
      concentration of &lt;9g/dL during their hospitalization. We will exclude patients who: 1)&#xD;
      decline blood transfusion, 2) and/or who have a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, 3) and/or&#xD;
      are brain dead or receiving only palliative treatment, 4) and/or are unable to follow-up&#xD;
      after discharge. We will not exclude patients who received transfusion prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Eligible patients will be identified using the encrypted UCHP research&#xD;
      database, which is programmed to extract real time EHR data into the database in order to&#xD;
      identify patients potentially eligible for participation in research studies. The PI and&#xD;
      Study Coordinator (SC) will be responsible for patient recruitment and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be randomized to either receive transfusion when their Hb drops&#xD;
      below 7g/dL (restrictive arm) or 9g/dl (liberal arm) at any point during hospitalization, and&#xD;
      randomized assignment will be done using permuted block design with random blocks of 2, 4, or&#xD;
      6 patients per block. All red blood cell (RBC) transfusions will be administered in 1 unit&#xD;
      increments in order to maintain patients' Hb concentration above the trial arm threshold they&#xD;
      are randomized to. All transfusions will be followed by a Hb measure and an additional&#xD;
      unit(s) of RBC's will only be transfused if there is documentation of the patient's Hb&#xD;
      concentration below the trial arm threshold they are randomized to. However, In the case of&#xD;
      life-threatening bleeding clinicians will be free to transfuse patients without first&#xD;
      checking a patient's Hb concentration. Once randomized, patient's will be managed according&#xD;
      to protocol until hospital discharge independent of transfusion to another service and/or&#xD;
      specialized hospital ward. This trial will not control or dictate transfusion of other blood&#xD;
      products, which will be administered at the discretion of the attending physician caring for&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;

    <description>Patient's in the liberal transfusion arm will receive a 1 unit RBC transfusion following randomization and will re-ceive blood in additional 1 unit increments until their Hb is above 9g/dL. At any point during the patient's hospital-ization if their Hb subsequently falls below 9g/dL, they will again be transfused to maintain a Hb&gt;9g/dL, and this will be maintained throughout their hospitalization.</description>
