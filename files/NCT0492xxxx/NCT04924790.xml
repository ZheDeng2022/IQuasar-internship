  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the intervention preferences of patients&#xD;
      with obstructive urinary stones who are suitable for operation during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare and evaluate the preferences compared to the pre-pandemic&#xD;
      period and to gain a perspective on how the decision-making process has changed from the&#xD;
      patient's point of view. Thus, by trying to understand how the COVID-19 epidemic affects the&#xD;
      treatment choice decisions of patients, the investigators aim to determine how the state of&#xD;
      anxiety changes these preferences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transformative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare use remains an open&#xD;
      question. At the onset of the pandemic, policies to limit transmission were adopted,&#xD;
      including stay-at-home decisions, social distancing, and postponing elective surgery. Such&#xD;
      policies have contributed to reduced emergency room admissions, increased concern about&#xD;
      COVID-19, and hospital systems have had to prioritize emergency intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive urolithiasis is a clinical condition that usually causes severe flank pain and&#xD;
      causes emergency admission. It is still unclear how the epidemic impairs the treatment&#xD;
      pathways of the obstructive urolithiasis that contributes to the emergency room visit.&#xD;
      Treatment options range from observation and medical expulsive therapy to operative&#xD;
      interventions such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy and percutaneous&#xD;
      nephrolithotomy. Patient preference, stone characteristics and comorbidities are of great&#xD;
      importance in decision making. However, since obstructive ureteral stones that cannot be&#xD;
      resolved spontaneously can cause irreversible renal parenchymal damage and obstructive&#xD;
      pyelonephritis in a short time, the option of operation is always prioritized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient perspectives on how COVID-19 is changing healthcare use and decision-making still&#xD;
      remain unclear. In our study, the investigators plan to record patient treatment preferences&#xD;
      by explaining in detail how and where treatment options will be applied, success and&#xD;
      complication rates for patients diagnosed with obstructive urolithiasis and suitable for&#xD;
      intervention in the outpatient clinic. In addition, when evaluating patient preferences, the&#xD;
      investigators foresee to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic process has changed compared to&#xD;
      before. It is planned that our study will have a patient-centered approach with detailed oral&#xD;
      and written information in outpatient clinic conditions.&#xD;
