  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a brief task of playing the game Tetris to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol cravings and alcohol use. Women who are seen at primary care and recruited through&#xD;
      the community will be asked to rate alcohol craving and use, and play the Tetris game on&#xD;
      their phones daily for a 3-week period. Participants will also complete a cue-reactivity&#xD;
      task, that involves viewing pictures of alcohol and rating cravings.&#xD;
