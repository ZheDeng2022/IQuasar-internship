  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a multicenter pilot project to evaluate the therapeutic success in the long&#xD;
      term up to 3 months after a delirium in a recovery room. There is a Europe-wide&#xD;
      recommendation for the prevention of postoperative delirium in older patients and the&#xD;
      evidence and consensus-based guideline &quot;Management of delirium, analgesia and sedation in&#xD;
      intensiv care medicine&quot; of the AWMF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen&#xD;
      Fachgesellschaften) are regularly updated for the detection and treatment of delirium in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. The aim is to evaluate the effects of a systematic delirium screening&#xD;
      and the delirium treatment options in the long term in the same way as the current&#xD;
      recommendations for the patient cohort of the recovery room.&#xD;
