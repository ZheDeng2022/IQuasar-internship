  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 0, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study to assess&#xD;
      the changes in ERP Biomarkers in Healthy Volunteers before and after administration of a&#xD;
      sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine. Primary objectives are to quantify the effect size of&#xD;
      ketamine-induced changes on MMN from a duration-deviant auditory oddball ERP test and to&#xD;
      quantify the variability of ketamine-induced changes on MMN from a duration-deviant auditory&#xD;
      oddball ERP test.&#xD;
