  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant focal epilepsy (DRFE) is frequently associated with complications of varying&#xD;
      severity that impair patient's quality of life. Among these complications, cognitive&#xD;
      disturbances and especially episodic memory difficulties, play a determinant part. Episodic&#xD;
      memory can be defined as a function that allows the mental reconstruction of a past life&#xD;
      episode, through complex associative mechanisms that link the vivid experience to its context&#xD;
      of occurrence, called encoding context. It is a dynamic cognitive function, which calls on a&#xD;
      widely distributed cerebral network, mainly involving the medial temporal lobe, particularly&#xD;
      the hippocampus. Epilepsy could have a specific impact on this crucial network, disrupting&#xD;
      the binding mechanisms between the experienced events and their encoding context, which are&#xD;
      essential for efficient memory. Although patients with DRFE frequently demonstrate memory&#xD;
      impairment as assessed by standardised neuropsychological tests, it only imperfectly reflects&#xD;
      their difficulties. As a matter of fact, despite a subjective memory complaint, about 20%&#xD;
      have no memory impairment on these tests, resulting from a phenomenon called accelerated&#xD;
      long-term forgetting (ALF). ALF is indeed characterised by normal performance on standardised&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests involving retention delays of 20-30 minutes, but disabling memory&#xD;
      complaint and abnormally marked forgetting within hours or days that follow the learning&#xD;
      period. This phenomenon is widely described at the conceptual level, but remains difficult to&#xD;
      measure in daily practice, at least partly due to methodological limits. Thus, the validated&#xD;
      tools available in clinical routine are poorly adapted to the complexity and the associative&#xD;
      dimension of memory networks. There is therefore a clinical need for a specific assessment&#xD;
      tool that would be able to detect ALF, in order to better quantify it and to enable the&#xD;
      appropriate care of patients suffering from DRFE. The aim of the EPIMNESIE study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic capacity of a behavioural associative memory task, based on the&#xD;
      analysis of encoding and consolidation mechanisms, in order to measure ALF. In this&#xD;
      prospective study, 40 patients with DRFE and 40 healthy subjects will be proposed to complete&#xD;
      a new associative memory task involving a learning phase and two recall sessions which will&#xD;
      take place at 30 minutes and 72 hours after the learning phase.&#xD;

    <description>Two test sessions using the computerised associative memory task will be performed by the two groups (patients and control subjects). The first session will consist of the encoding of 56 associations between a word and a photograph and the recall of half of them (28) 30 minutes later by the mean of a matching task and a recognition task. The second session consists of the recall of the other half of the associations (28) 72 hours after the encoding phase, using the same procedure (matching task and recognition task). Performance obtained by patients and by healthy volunteers will then be compared.</description>
