  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD and MCI received either inspiratory muscle training or inspiratory plus&#xD;
      expiratory muscle training and compared the therapeutic effects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD and MCI were recruited, and were randomly assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      group and the control group. The experimental group consisted of EMT and IMT for a total of 8&#xD;
      weeks, while the control group received IMT only. Outcomes measured and compared in this&#xD;
      cohort were diaphragmatic thickness fraction and excursion examined by ultrasound, the&#xD;
      dyspnea score of modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), the cognitive score of Mini-Mental&#xD;
      State Examination (MMSE), and the score of COPD Assessment Test (CAT). In addition, the&#xD;
      pulmonary function test, the cardiopulmonary exercise test, and the physiology performance of&#xD;
      six minute walking test were also obtained. We also analyzed the difference of each&#xD;
      parameters before and after training in each patient.&#xD;
