  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Decreased taste and smell contribute to loss of appetite (anorexia), and the&#xD;
      resulting protein-energy malnutrition increases the frailty of the elderly. The risk of&#xD;
      falls, disability, infections and depression often requires them to be institutionalized.&#xD;
      Elderly, undernourished and toothless patients often complain about the monotony of a soft,&#xD;
      mixed-texture diet. In a previous study, some participants highlighted the pleasure of&#xD;
      crunching cookies that have a solid texture that can be eaten in any dental condition.&#xD;
      However, the age-related decrease in hearing (presbyacusis) is frequent and progressive from&#xD;
      the age of 60. The hypothesis of this work is that older patients may perceive a crunchy food&#xD;
      crunching in their mouth, despite presbycusis. If the hypothesis is verified, this would make&#xD;
      geriatric caregivers aware of the possibility of diversifying the texture of food, in order&#xD;
      to stimulate the pleasure of eating and increase the dietary intake in this population of&#xD;
      patients who are often undernourished, dysphagic, edentulous and hearing impaired. The&#xD;
      originality of this study is to share the expertise of geriatricians and specialists in&#xD;
      mastication/swallowing (dental surgeon, speech-language pathologist), hearing (ENT doctor,&#xD;
      hearing care professional) and nutrition (dietician).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study. Type of study MR-004 &quot;Research not involving the human person&quot;. Protocol.&#xD;
      Compare the noise and pleasure of crunching between two hyperprotein nutritional supplements:&#xD;
      a soft filled cookie (Nutra Cake™, Délical, France) and a crunchy cookie of the Breton type&#xD;
      (Protibis™, Solidages, France). Blind study impossible: each subject will eat a cookie then&#xD;
      the other in a random order and will be his own control. The tests will be performed without&#xD;
      the possible hearing aids, but with or without the dentures according to the patient's&#xD;
      preference. Indeed, some patients have dental prostheses that are no longer suitable for&#xD;
      chewing, and that they wear only for aesthetics. Objective. Validate the evaluation criteria&#xD;
      &quot;Do you hear the biscuit crunch?&quot; and &quot;Is it a pleasure?&quot; If so, encourage diversification&#xD;
      with crunchy foods with a suitable texture, as well as dental and prosthetic rehabilitation&#xD;
      of dependent elderly people.&#xD;
