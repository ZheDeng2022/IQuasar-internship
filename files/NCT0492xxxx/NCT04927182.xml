      As of 30th January 2020, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, later called&#xD;
      COVID-19, was declared a Public Health Emergency. Governments' immediate protective&#xD;
      measurements aim to slow down the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus had infected people exponentially. It has a typical symptom of influenza which&#xD;
      includes fever, cough, fatigue sore throat and additional symptoms like breathlessness and&#xD;
      diarrhea. There was no specific treatment to cure it and no vaccination to prevent it from&#xD;
      further progression. The solitary solution for prevent of this virus was isolation and no&#xD;
      gathering, which has caused people to sit in their houses and wash hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature shows that a significant larger reduction in Blood Pressure was observed in&#xD;
      participant performing aerobic exercise. A study shows comparison between African and Asian&#xD;
      population with hypertension indicates that Asian participant reduced more BP as compared to&#xD;
      African .&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, It is a subjective numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates &quot;no dyspnea&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;unbearable dyspnea.&quot; A number is chosen by the patient in order to decide the best score that matches his level of dyspnea during physical activity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, Systolic Blood pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) will be measured through sphygmomanometer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) quantifies musculoskeletal pain and activity prevention in 9 body regions. The Nordic general questionnaire is a standardized instrument used to analyse musculoskeletal symptoms in an ergonomic or occupational health context. The NMQ is comprised of just 3 questions regarding musculoskeletal pain including annual and 7-day prevalence of symptoms and annual prevention from normal work (at home or away from home). For each Question body region wise; Yes and No options are there to report. Patient can report more than 1 body region.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Min walk test (Distance in meters)</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 Min Walk Distance (6 MWD) was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak VO2 with formula</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>A generalized equation can be used to determined peak VO2 (Peak rate of oxygen consumption). The generalized equation can be used to accurately estimate mean peak VO2 from mean 6 MWD, among groups of patients with diverse diseases without the need for cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The equation is:&#xD;
Mean peak VO2(ml/kg/mins) = 4.948 + 0.023*Mean 6 MWD (meter) Changes From the Baseline will be measured</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate/Pulse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Pulse rate was measured per minute through pulse oximeter. Crossly it was measure by Chest belt (Polar HR monitors). Changes from the Baseline will be measure.</description>
