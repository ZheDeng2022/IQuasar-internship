  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of physical activity on fear of childbirth&#xD;
      (tokophobia) in pregnant women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of childbirth is defined as the fear felt and experienced before, during and after&#xD;
      birth. Fear of childbirth is an acceptable level of fear and motivates the woman to prepare&#xD;
      for the birth. However, if the fear developed before pregnancy and/or the severity of the&#xD;
      fear increased during pregnancy, this situation is called &quot;Tokophobia&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is defined as body movements that are performed by using the body's muscles&#xD;
      and joints, require energy expenditure above the basal level, can be performed at different&#xD;
      intensities, increase heart rate and respiration, and occur with the contraction of large&#xD;
      muscle groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in the literature that physical activity in pregnant women contributes to&#xD;
      the health of both the mother and the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported the benefits of physical activity and exercise in preventing&#xD;
      many risks of pregnancy, including lowering the risks of excess weight gain, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, prenatal depression and macrosomia, and&#xD;
      improving psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the reported benefits of regular physical activity in the literature, it has been&#xD;
      reported that the level of physical activity during pregnancy is lower compared to the&#xD;
      pre-pregnancy period.&#xD;

    <measure>Wijma Delivery Expectation/Experience Scale (W-DEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Wijma Delivery Expectation/Experience Scale (W-DEQ)&quot; was developed by Klaas and Barbro Wijma, using the clinical experiences of women regarding the fear of childbirth. The W-DEQ scale version A was developed to measure the experiences of pregnant women before childbirth. Responses are on a six-point Likert-type scale from 0 to 5. 0 means &quot;totally&quot; and 5 as &quot;not at all&quot;. While the minimum score on this scale is 0, the maximum score is 165. Higher scores indicate that women have a higher fear of childbirth.</description>

    <measure>The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pregnancy physical activity questionnaire was developed by Lisa Chasan-Taber et al. in 2004 to determine the physical activity levels of pregnant women only. This questionnaire determines the activity level of pregnant women based on the time they spend during 32 activities.</description>
