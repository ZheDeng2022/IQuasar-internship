  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that&#xD;
      incorporates obesity management guidelines and treatment options for use by physicians and,&#xD;
      potentially, patients based on a cardiometabolic disease staging system. This CDSS will be&#xD;
      designed using primary care provider input through a qualitative approach to explore&#xD;
      physician preferences for the appearance, electronic location, treatment options, referrals,&#xD;
      accessibility and other user requirements of the CDSS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To provide appropriate medical management of obesity and facilitate the diabetes risk&#xD;
      assessments of people with excess adiposity, a comprehensive staging system that establishes&#xD;
      five stages of cardiometabolic disease risk-the cardiometabolic disease staging system (CMDS)&#xD;
      has been developed. This staging is based on Adult Treatment Panel III metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      risk factors to guide decision making for selection of treatment modality and intensity in&#xD;
      the management of obesity. Hence, the study hypothesis is that providing CMDS to PCPs through&#xD;
      a CDSS for medical management of obesity can aid in reducing the barriers of obesity and&#xD;
      diabetes treatment at the PCP-level and improve the quality of obesity and diabetes care. In&#xD;
      this pilot and feasibility study, investigators will implement an early-phase CDSS in a&#xD;
      pragmatic PCP setting to assess the uptake and acceptability of CDSS delivered to PCPs&#xD;
      implementing CMDS at the point of care, and collect pilot data to assess change in patient&#xD;
      engagement and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct initial focus groups with PCPs and a series of iterative design&#xD;
      steps targeting PCP and patient needs. These qualitative interviews would be used to&#xD;
      determine the initial set of requirements and prototypes of the user interfaces and&#xD;
      notifications.&#xD;
