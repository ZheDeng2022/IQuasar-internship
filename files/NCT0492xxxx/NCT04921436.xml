  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An imbalance in the microbiota (most often intestinal) largely determines the onset of a&#xD;
      disease state, and often a critical state. Cardiac surgery accompanied by heart failure and&#xD;
      hypoperfusion is a proven risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders of the&#xD;
      intestinal flora and bacterial translocation. Previously, it was shown that the change in&#xD;
      serum concentrations of phenolic metabolites of the intestinal microbiota reflects the&#xD;
      dynamics of the severity of the patient's condition and can be used for objective monitoring&#xD;
      of treatment. Preoperative analysis of microbial metabolites makes it possible to reliably&#xD;
      identify the group of patients with the highest risk of developing postoperative organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions. In patients with a baseline level of the sum of phenolic acid concentrations&#xD;
      over 3.5 mmol / L, the likelihood of postoperative complications is 10 times higher (OR -&#xD;
      10.5; 95% CI 1.35-81.7, p = 0.026). Reducing the metabolic activity of opportunistic bacteria&#xD;
      and the level of aromatic microbial metabolites associated with sepsis through the&#xD;
      prophylactic use of antibiotics belonging to the group of protein synthesis inhibitors at the&#xD;
      level of bacterial cell ribosomes is of great interest.&#xD;

      MMMMODCS (Modulation of Microbiota Metabolism Multiple Organ Dysfunctions in Cardiac Surgery)&#xD;
      is a single-center clinical study, during which it is planned to study the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the perioperative use of antibiotic inhibitors of protein synthesis at the&#xD;
      ribosome level of bacterial cells (hereinafter: antibiotic inhibitors) in patients with high&#xD;
      the risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) of infectious genesis. The high-risk&#xD;
      group is represented by patients who are planned to have surgery on the thoracoabdominal&#xD;
      aorta; combined operations on coronary vessels and heart valves; patients with initially low&#xD;
      heart ejection fraction (less than 45%). The study was designed to find out if the&#xD;
      prophylactic use of a combination of antibiotic inhibitors prevents an increase in&#xD;
      concentration (or contributes to a decrease with an initial increase) of aromatic microbial&#xD;
      metabolites (AMM) above 3.5 mmol / L and the development of MOD, requiring a long stay in an&#xD;
      intensive care unit more than 6 days). After signing an informed consent prior to surgery,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into one of two cohorts: with or without a combination of&#xD;
      antibiotic inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cohort with prophylactic treatment, in addition to standard antibiotic prophylaxis (I,&#xD;
      II generation cephalosporins), combinations of the following antibiotic inhibitors&#xD;
      (Doxycycline or Rimfampicin + Gentamicin or Clarithromycin) will be used orally or&#xD;
      intravenously, depending on the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AMM level will be measured in blood serum samples on a gas chromatography-mass&#xD;
      spectrometer before the operation, on the 3rd and 6th days after the operation. The rest of&#xD;
      the indicators will be discussed at the same points.&#xD;
