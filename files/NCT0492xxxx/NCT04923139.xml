  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which data from the past is collected for a treatment which&#xD;
      is already available for doctors to prescribe for venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a&#xD;
      condition in which blood clots form in veins, which can lead to disability and death. This&#xD;
      study looks at the bleeding risk in Japanese patients who are already receiving long-term&#xD;
      rivaroxaban treatment for their VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some common causes of VTE are surgery, lack of movement, being bed-ridden and cancer. VTE&#xD;
      that is caused by cancer is called cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (Ca-VTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment, rivaroxaban, is a blood thinner prescribed by doctors to help treat&#xD;
      conditions like VTE. By thinning the blood, rivaroxaban can help keep blood flowing normally&#xD;
      and prevent blood clots. But, rivaroxaban can lead to increased bleeding in some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been studies done in which participants with VTE and Ca-VTE received treatment&#xD;
      with rivaroxaban for a long period of time. The overall results of those studies showed that&#xD;
      long-term treatment with rivaroxaban helped prevent blood clots in those participants. Some&#xD;
      of the participants had increased bleeding after this long-term treatment, while some did&#xD;
      not. Participants with certain types of cancers, such as Ca-VTE, also had an increased risk&#xD;
      of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies, however, did not include Japanese participants. So, the researchers in this&#xD;
      study want to learn more about the risk of bleeding in Japanese patients with VTE or Ca-VTE&#xD;
      who receive long-term treatment with rivaroxaban. To do this, the researchers plan to use a&#xD;
      medical database to find information for patients with VTE and Ca-VTE who have already been&#xD;
      taking rivaroxaban for their condition. This database will help the researchers collect&#xD;
      information about the bleeding risk of long-term rivaroxaban treatment in Japanese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will learn more about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the characteristics of patients with VTE who are treated with rivaroxaban for a period&#xD;
           of less than 3 months to more than 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the bleeding risk for all of the patients throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the bleeding risk for the patients with Ca-VTE throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the cause of any bleeding that happens&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will follow and record these results for Japanese patients from October 2015&#xD;
      to December 2020.&#xD;
