  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the difference in endotracheal intubation in patients with difficult airway&#xD;
      between under general anesthesia by Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory&#xD;
      Exchange and under traditional sedation by mask ventilation. We focus on the different&#xD;
      outcomes in oxygenation maintaince, carbon dioxide removal and the effectiveness of safety&#xD;
      apnea time, to evaluate the safety of receiving endotracheal intubation under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in patients with difficult airway.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in group T were given sequential intravenous infusion with THRIVE device: midazolam 0.05mg/kg, sufentanil 0.02-0.05ug/kg, propofol 2-3ug/ml, rocuronium 0.06mg/kg, to make BIS &lt; 60 .&#xD;
The nasal cavity was disinfected with Iodophor cotton swab, and the appropriate nasal cavity was selected for endotracheal intubation assisted by fiberoptic bronchoscope according to the experience of anesthesiologists.&#xD;
After the endotracheal intubation was fixed, the anesthesia machine was connected for mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia machine was set at 50% oxygen +50% air, and the tidal volume was set at 6-8ml/kg.</description>

    <description>The Control Group will receive sequential intravenous infusion of Sufentanil 5ug, midazolam 0.05mg/kg, and propofol 1-2ug/ml, to make the BIS between 70 and 80. 2ml tetracaine was injected with cyclothyroid membrane puncture, and the nasal cavity was disinfected with iodophor cotton swab. According to the experience of anesthesiologists, the appropriate nasal cavity was selected for intranasal endotracheal intubation assisted by fiberbronchoscope. After the endotracheal intubation was successful, the anesthesia machine was connected for mechanical ventilation, full narcotic inducer will be injected. The anesthesia machine was set at 50% oxygen +50% air, and the tidal volume was set at 6-8ml/kg.</description>
