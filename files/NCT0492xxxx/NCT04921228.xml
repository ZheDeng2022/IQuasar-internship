  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree of burnout and consequential negative&#xD;
      psychological effects experienced by healthcare providers has been substantially exacerbated.&#xD;
      Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback has long been used to assist with a wide variety of&#xD;
      stress-related concerns. Building on evidence that HRV biofeedback has the potential to&#xD;
      improve wellbeing, the purpose of this study is to pilot test and determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of implementing a digital HRV biofeedback tool to improve disordered eating, mindful&#xD;
      self-care (i.e., self-compassion, body appreciation, etc.), and perceived stress in&#xD;
      healthcare providers. In addition to assessing acceptability and feasibility of the HRV&#xD;
      biofeedback tool, the investigators will aim to establish 'proof-of-concept' for a conceptual&#xD;
      model consisting of potential psychological constructs underlying the mechanisms of change&#xD;
      for the intervention-namely mind-body awareness (i.e., interoception) and resilience. Our&#xD;
      primary recruitment pool will include healthcare providers who reported elevated eating&#xD;
      distress as a participant in an ongoing observational study of the health effects of&#xD;
      theCOVID-19 pandemic on essential workers (CHAMPS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests healthcare professionals may be a population at high-risk for&#xD;
      disordered eating. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree of burnout and&#xD;
      consequential negative psychological effects experienced by healthcare providers has been&#xD;
      substantially exacerbated. In fact, in an ongoing study of essential workers during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic, the investigators found over a third of nursing professionals endorsed&#xD;
      clinically significant disordered eating. With the clear evidence showing a psychological&#xD;
      toll of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers globally, addressing their wellbeing&#xD;
      with feasible at-home interventions is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback has long been used to assist with a wide variety of&#xD;
      stress-related concerns, including depression and anxiety (Lehrer et al., 2020), both&#xD;
      conditions that commonly co-occur with disordered eating. Research suggests interoception&#xD;
      (i.e., the capacity to detect and respond to signals from the body), is disrupted in those&#xD;
      with eating disorders (Martin et al., 2019). While there is relatively sparse evidence on the&#xD;
      relationship between HRV and interoception (Pinna &amp; Edwards, 2020), it is theoretically&#xD;
      plausible that superior interoception would predict improved vagal tone (i.e.,&#xD;
      parasympathetic activity) as measured by HRV. Moreover, data on HRV and disordered eating is&#xD;
      mixed, and poorly understood (Watford et al., 2020). The present research seeks to begin&#xD;
      addressing this gap in knowledge through a pilot feasibility study designed to initiate&#xD;
      proof-of-concept for the development of a conceptual model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess the feasibility of implementing a digitally based HRV biofeedback protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the acceptability and usability of HRV biofeedback in healthcare providers with&#xD;
           elevated disordered eating&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. examine signals of efficacy to begin building a conceptual model of the potential&#xD;
           mechanisms underlying change in outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. test whether there is a relationship between intervention engagement/adherence and&#xD;
           change in outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a registry of healthcare providers enrolled in an ongoing&#xD;
      study of the health effects of working during the COVID-19 pandemic (unless recruitment goals&#xD;
      are not met using this method). This single arm feasibility pilot will provide the data to&#xD;
      help determine the acceptability of using a smartphone based HRV biofeedback training tool as&#xD;
      an intervention for this population and guide the refinement of the conceptual model being&#xD;
      developed. By establishing feasibility and proof-of-concept, the study will build upon a&#xD;
      limited body of work and establish an important first step towards understanding intervention&#xD;
      dosing and signals of efficacy for aiding with disordered eating and related mind-body&#xD;
      factors in this population.&#xD;
