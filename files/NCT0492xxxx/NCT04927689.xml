      Assessment of asthmatic children and children with allergic rhinitis at day 0 and 6 months&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and allergic rhinitis are chronic diseases whose control is multifactorial (drug&#xD;
      treatment, therapeutic education of the family and the child, consideration of a possible&#xD;
      allergen...). When this control is not optimal, it leads to significant school absenteeism,&#xD;
      pediatric emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Environmental conditions at home play a&#xD;
      role in asthma exacerbations and poor control of allergic rhinitis in children. Mites, animal&#xD;
      allergens, passive smoking, molds, cockroaches, household products, etc., are the main&#xD;
      causes. The visit of a home environment advisor, who intervenes on medical prescription,&#xD;
      makes it possible to evaluate the source of allergens and pollutants in the home and then to&#xD;
      propose changes to the home. This position was created in France in 2009 by the Ministry of&#xD;
      the Environment and is funded by the Agence Régional de Santé (ARS - Regional Health Agency).&#xD;
      The few studies carried out to assess the effectiveness of a home visit by an environmental&#xD;
      advisor on exacerbations of these diseases are contradictory: some show an improvement in the&#xD;
      quality of life of asthmatic children after a home visit (via the average reduction in the&#xD;
      number of days with symptoms/year) as well as a reduction in asthma-related morbidity thanks&#xD;
      to a reduction in exposure to indoor allergens. Others have shown that it does not reduce the&#xD;
      number of emergency room visits for asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, it would appear that&#xD;
      targeted allergen avoidance measures do not reduce drug treatment in asthmatics who are&#xD;
      already on optimal pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no studies in France that use standardized medical questionnaires&#xD;
      to assess disease control and quality of life before and after the visit of a home&#xD;
      environmental consultant. For example, in Angers and Nantes, evaluation questionnaires are&#xD;
      carried out with patients at 6 months and 1 year after a home visit, but the answers are not&#xD;
      standardized and sometimes very subjective.&#xD;
