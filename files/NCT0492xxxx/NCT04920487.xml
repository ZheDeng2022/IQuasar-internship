  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of venous thrombosis (venous thromboembolic disease: VTE) in women of&#xD;
      childbearing age in France is in the order of 0.3 to 0.5 / 1000 women / year. It is a rare&#xD;
      disease, but the majority of events occurring in women of childbearing age are associated&#xD;
      with a particular hormonal context (mainly pregnancy and hormonal contraception). VTE is a&#xD;
      multifactorial disease and the risk depends on the simultaneous presence of several triggers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain frequent gynecological pathologies are emerging in the literature as new venous&#xD;
      thrombotic risk factors independently of hormonal treatment. Indeed, in endometriosis, the&#xD;
      prevalence of which is estimated to be around 10%, biological data are in favor of&#xD;
      hypercoagulability. Only one epidemiological study has analyzed this parameter. It is a&#xD;
      Japanese cohort study in 103,070 pregnant women including 77 VTE during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) were identified as risk factors for VTE (OR:&#xD;
      2.70 (95%CI, 1.21-6.00) for endometriosis and 6.13 (95% 2.48-15.16) for RPL. In polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome (PCOS), whose prevalence is estimated at 7-12%, the associated risk of VTE is&#xD;
      better known (OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.60-2.24) and was the subject of a recently published&#xD;
      meta-analysis in which the principal investigator collaborated. To the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge, no study describes the prevalence of gynecological pathologies in women with VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning hormonal contraception, estrogen-progestin contraception (EPC) is widely used in&#xD;
      France and is associated with an increase in the risk of VTE of a factor of 3 to 6. After a&#xD;
      venous thrombotic episode, EPC is contraindicated, and non-hormonal or progestin-only&#xD;
      contraception (POC) can be used. Nevertheless, to date, few studies have focused on the&#xD;
      management of hormonal contraceptive treatment at the time of a VTE episode. Moreover, the&#xD;
      contraceptive options presented to patients are often based on multiple actors (vascular&#xD;
      physicians, gynaecologists, midwives, general practitioners, etc.) and the experience of the&#xD;
      VTE episode, for both patients and prescribers, may influence the contraceptive options&#xD;
      proposed or chosen, as well as their compliance.&#xD;
