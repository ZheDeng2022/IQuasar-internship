  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a project that will determine whether the use of daily bright light therapy has an&#xD;
      effect on depressive symptoms experienced by adult inpatients with CF. The purpose of this&#xD;
      project is to apply a daily 30-minute BLT intervention to hospitalized adult CF patients in&#xD;
      order to decrease symptoms of depression as measured by depression inventory scoring.&#xD;

      This project will occur on a 29-bed pulmonary step-down unit at a 1,600-bed academic medical&#xD;
      center. This unit commonly treats patients with CF and other pulmonary complications. The&#xD;
      unit's patient care staff will be educated on the bright light lamps in order to prevent&#xD;
      interruptions and to encourage compliance.&#xD;

    <description>The RN will sign a daily log indicating what time therapy was initiated and if therapy was refused. These logs will be collected from patient doors at the end of each week by the principal investigator (PI) in order to measure compliance with completion of therapy on a daily basis.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of daily BLT sessions lasting 30 minutes at approximately 10AM (since many CF patients do not awaken until this time) starting on the day of admission through discharge for a goal of seven consecutive days. The intervention will use a 10,000-lux light box placed approximately 16-24 inches from the patient's face.</description>
