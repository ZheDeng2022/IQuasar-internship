    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of oral Epalrestat&#xD;
      therapy in pediatric subjects with PMM2-CDG. Study outcomes include safety, probable benefit&#xD;
      based on a composite score of the NPCRS and ICARS disease severity scores (normalized and&#xD;
      equally weighted, compared to baseline). as a metric for clinical improvement.&#xD;

      A Phase IIb, prospective, single-center study designed to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      metabolic improvement, and probable benefit of oral Epalrestat therapy in pediatric subjects&#xD;
      with PMM2-CDG. The treatment period is 12 months (52 weeks) with an optional 24 additional&#xD;
      months (104 weeks), for a total of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with PMM2-CDG will be screened for study eligibility after informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained. Subjects may be recruited from the FCDGC natural history study for subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with CDG.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be a composite score encompassing the NPCRS and ICARS scales. Each of the two scores (NPCRS and ICARS) is to be normalized, and equally weighted. Change from baseline of the composite will be assessed at 12 months. 0.5* (NPCRS) + 0.5 * (ICARS), change from baseline compared to a change of zero (0). NPCRS minimum and maximum values are 0 and 75 respectively, with lower scores meaning less affected.</description>

    <description>Change in Goal Attainment Scale score from baseline to twelve months. At baseline, patients/caregivers select a skill that is currently not possible for the patient and apply a rating of -2. As the patient is assessed over time, the skill is reevaluated to determine if the patient is making progress towards accomplishing the skill and a rating is given on a scale of -2 to 2, with 2 meaning the skill is able to be done at time of rating.</description>

    <description>Epalrestat is a noncompetitive and reversible aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy in Japan. The drug's ability to safely improve symptoms of neuropathy alone by reducing oxidative stress, increasing glutathione levels, and reducing intracellular sorbitol accumulation make it a desirable medication for PMM2-CDG patients who commonly suffer with various neuropathies. However, work recently conducted by Perlara, a public benefit company with the mandate to screen existing commercially available drugs for possible application in rare diseases, has demonstrated that Epalrestat can also elevate the level PMM2 produced endogenously. This may reduce the severity of the morbidities associated with PMM2-CDG.</description>
