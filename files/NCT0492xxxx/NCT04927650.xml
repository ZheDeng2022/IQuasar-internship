      This study examines prevention and early detection of cervical cancer through&#xD;
      self-administration screening of patients in Western Uganda. The cervix is the opening of the&#xD;
      uterus or womb, which is the organ that supports babies before they are born. There are&#xD;
      simple tests that let doctors know whether or not patients have cells that may become cancer.&#xD;
      Some of the tests determine whether patients have an increased risk for cervical disease, but&#xD;
      they do not actually confirm that they have it: these are called &quot;screening&quot; tests. This&#xD;
      study may help researchers determine how to best deliver cervical cancer prevention services&#xD;
      using the HPV test.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the acceptance and correlates of self-collected human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing among women in the rural Ugandan community as well as&#xD;
      the incidence and determinants of successful completion of the cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      cascade from self-collected HPV testing to receipt of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To ascertain the frequency and determinants of successful acquisition of treatment among&#xD;
      women who have HPV detected on self-collected swabs in rural Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To derive population-based estimates of the prevalence of high-risk HPV and cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) detected through community-based screening employing&#xD;
      self-collected HPV RNA testing in rural Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a specimen kit for collection of HPV samples. Patients complete&#xD;
      questionnaire before and after collection HPV samples. Patients may also participate in an&#xD;
      interview about general ideas in improving the screening and treatment process. Patients with&#xD;
      positive results, undergo treatment for cervical cancer.&#xD;
