  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of niraparib when&#xD;
      combined with dostarlimab and hypofractionated radiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
      Once this is determined, this dose will be tested to identify what impact it has on the tumor&#xD;
      as well as patient reported outcome measures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care therapy for resectable locally advanced rectal cancer includes pelvic&#xD;
      radiation (short or long course), chemotherapy, and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take niraparib by mouth once daily for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive radiation therapy once daily for five days (Monday through Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive intravenous (IV) dostarlimab once every three weeks for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide feedback about how they feel and their quality of life. This is done through&#xD;
           short surveys as well as discussing with the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo a sigmoidoscopy (i.e. scope of the tumor) and biopsy about halfway through&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide tumor tissue and blood samples for analysis&#xD;
