  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib cream in&#xD;
      children with Atopic Dermatitis. This is a randomized, double-blind, Vehicle Controlled&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to blinded treatment with ruxolitinib cream&#xD;
      0.75% ,1.5% , or vehicle cream, with stratification by baseline IGA score and age. At Week 8,&#xD;
      efficacy will be evaluated. Participants who complete Week 8 assessments with no additional&#xD;
      safety concerns will continue into the 44-week Long Term Safety (LTS) period with the same&#xD;
      treatment regimen, except those initially randomized to vehicle cream will be rerandomized&#xD;
      (1:1) in a blinded manner to 1 of the 2 active treatment groups (ruxolitinib cream 0.75% or&#xD;
      1.5%).&#xD;
