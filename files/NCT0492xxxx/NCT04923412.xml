  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Surgical resection is the main&#xD;
      treatment for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and lobectomy with systemic&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph node dissection is the standard surgical method. However, a significant&#xD;
      number of patients experience postoperative chronic cough; it is observed in about 60% of&#xD;
      patients during the first year of outpatient clinic follow-up, and persistently lasts in&#xD;
      about 24.7-50% during the 5 year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies showed the association between vagus nerve and chronic cough. The&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary vagal afferent C-fibers are responsible for cough, chest tightness and&#xD;
      reflex bronchoconstrictions. It is expected that during the mediastinal lymph node&#xD;
      dissection, the inevitable injuries to the pulmonary branch of vagus nerve is largely&#xD;
      responsible for development of chronic cough. In other words, preservation of pulmonary&#xD;
      branch of vagus nerve may reduce the incidence of chronic cough and relevant detrimental&#xD;
      effects on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this prospective, randomized and controlled clinical study, aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of vagus nerve preservation on postoperative chronic cough in patients undergoing&#xD;
      lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection. In addition, the feasibility and oncologic&#xD;
      safety of preserving pulmonary branch of vagus nerve during mediastinal lymph node dissection&#xD;
      with minimally invasive surgery compared with conventional mediastinal lymph node dissection&#xD;
      with minimally invasive surgery will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will provide a new basis for oncologically feasible, safe and effective new&#xD;
      surgical technique for mediastinal lymph node dissection in patients with early lung cancer&#xD;
      undergoing minimally invasive surgery. Furthermore, the preventive effect of vagus nerve&#xD;
      preservation on incidence of chronic cough will be objectively be proven and thus help to&#xD;
      broaden the current knowledge of the role of vagus nerve and postoperative chronic cough.&#xD;
