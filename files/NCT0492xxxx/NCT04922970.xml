  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today the overall survival of childhood cancers has increased to above 85%. This increase is&#xD;
      partially caused by treatment with bone marrow transplantation. A bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
      is an efficient treatment against high-risk leukemia, as well as other life-threatening&#xD;
      immunological and hematological diseases. However, it is unfortunately also related to the&#xD;
      risk of developing a long series of late effects during early adulthood, such as low muscle&#xD;
      mass, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Conditions known from the older generations of the&#xD;
      general population and also conditions highly related to lifestyle factors in the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group of survivors after bone marrow transplantation, the cause for these late effects&#xD;
      is not fully understood, as the same close association to lifestyle factors as seen in the&#xD;
      general population, is not present in this group. Multiple studies have examined the possible&#xD;
      causes, and it have been shown that certain elements of a bone marrow transplantation, ie.&#xD;
      total body irradiation, are associated with the risk of developing late effects. As the cause&#xD;
      is not fully understood, it is not known whether the treatment and preventive strategies,&#xD;
      that would be applied in the general population for these conditions, are effective in this&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study the investigators aim at examining the effect of a strength training&#xD;
      intervention on the development of the aforementioned late effects to treatment with bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation during childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will invite a group of persons, transplanted during childhood, as well as&#xD;
      an age- and sex-matched control group to participate in the study. Both groups will go&#xD;
      through a 16-week strength training intervention, and a thorough health examination before&#xD;
      and after the intervention, to assess metabolic status and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators find a positive effect of strength training on muscle mass and risk&#xD;
      factors for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes in persons, treated with bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation during childhood, it will support the implementation of structured&#xD;
      training programs in the follow-up of these patients. Thereby hopefully contributing to an&#xD;
      increased quality of life, as well as an increased life expectancy in the group of survivors&#xD;
      after bone marrow transplantation during childhood.&#xD;

    <description>The interventon consist of 3 weekly, supervised group sessions for 4 months (16 weeks). The sessions consist of progressive full body strength training with a primary focus on lower extremity muscle strength. The leg exercises are leg press, knee extension and leg curl. In addition, participants will perform two upper body exercises. Physical assessment will take place immediately and monthly until 4 months.</description>
