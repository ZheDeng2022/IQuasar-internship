  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New types of biologics have brought advantages in therapy strategies for Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      However, clinical data evaluating their efficacy and adverse in China is lacking. We aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the short-term and long-term therapeutic effect as well as drug adverse of&#xD;
      Ustekinumab (UST) and Vedolizumab (VED). Besides, we aim to figure out the independent&#xD;
      factors predicting the effectiveness of new biologics. Relations between drug exposure&#xD;
      (trough concentration and antibody concentration) and therapeutic efficacy are study in-depth&#xD;
      by this retrospective observational study.&#xD;
