  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a multidisciplinary team of researchers was established including credible&#xD;
      researchers from the UAE, Australia and the United Kingdom to launch the First United Arab&#xD;
      Emirates 3-year birth cohort study. The study aims to recruit 250 pregnant Emirati women&#xD;
      within their first trimester, which is defined by the study as from 8 to 12 weeks pregnant,&#xD;
      recruited from obstetric and gynaecology clinics in the UAE. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      via face to face interviews and will receive a total of 11 visits with 1 visit in each&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy and 8 visits after delivery. Maternal data collection includes,&#xD;
      socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, dietary intake, anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      physical activity, maternal psychological state, and blood samples for biochemical analysis.&#xD;
      Post-partum, visits will take place when the child is 0.5, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months&#xD;
      old, with data collection including infant anthropometric measurements, young child feeding&#xD;
      practices, dietary intake, supplement use and the eating environment at home, as well as all&#xD;
      maternal data collection described above, apart from blood samples. Additional data&#xD;
      collection for the child includes developmental assessments taking place at three timepoints,&#xD;
      1) within 2 weeks of birth, 2) at 10-14 months and 3) at 22 - 26 months of age. Developmental&#xD;
      assessments for the infant include vision, health, neurological examination,&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental and sleep assessments.&#xD;
