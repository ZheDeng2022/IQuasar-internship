  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the second study of a larger project and will begin the process of testing and&#xD;
      the development of an integrated intervention on a series of case studies. The combined&#xD;
      intervention provides psychological therapy and debt advice in tandem. The treatment pathway&#xD;
      is based on interviews and focus groups with service users and staff and the themes that&#xD;
      emerged. It will be trialled in the NHS' Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)&#xD;
      service. Participants routinely accessing this service who have debt issues affecting their&#xD;
      mental health will be asked if they'd like to also take up support for their money worries,&#xD;
      which will be provided by Citizen's Advice (CA). Researchers will take exit interviews with&#xD;
      both service users and staff at the end of the treatment to develop the protocol further.&#xD;
      Researchers will also assess measures of mental health and wellbeing that are routinely taken&#xD;
      by IAPT to review the intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7), from above clinical cut off pre intervention (&gt; 5) to below cut off post intervention (&lt;5). The seven items on the scale ask participants to rate on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly everyday) how often they were bothered by each symptom. Total scores can range from 0 - 21, with higher scores indicating more anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reliable recovery - depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), from above clinical cut off pre intervention (&gt; 5) to below cut off post intervention (&lt;5). The nine items on the scale ask participants to rate on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly everyday) how often they were bothered by each symptom. Total scores can range from 0 - 27, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Work and Social Adjustment Scale - 5 (WSAS-5), from above clinical cut off pre intervention (&gt; 10) to below cut off post intervention (&lt;10). The five items on the scale ask participants to rate on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 8 (very severely) how much they feel they are impaired for each task. Total scores can range from 0 - 40, with higher scores indicating more impairment across work and social tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Financial Outcomes and service satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey has been adapted for the purposes of this study. It uses questions taken from the audit measure of service satisfaction used by Citizen's Advice. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal) how much they experienced six possible effects from the combined intervention. Scores range from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes in relation to personal finances from the intervention.</description>
