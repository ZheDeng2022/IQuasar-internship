  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The observational study aims to investigate the extent to which a two-week stay in an&#xD;
      internal medicine clinic for integrative medicine and naturopathy results in an improvement&#xD;
      of complaints, impairments, quality of life, anxiety/depressiveness, stress perception and&#xD;
      well-being in chronic gastroenterological patients and chronic rheumatological/pain patients.&#xD;
      In addition, previous experiences with complementary naturopathic procedures, expectations of&#xD;
      treatment, perceived benefits and implementation of instructed techniques and procedures in&#xD;
      everyday life will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective uncontrolled observational study will include approx. 200 patients over six&#xD;
      months. Primary outcome is general quality of life (SF-12). Secondary outcomes are anxiety&#xD;
      and depression (HADS), well-being/flourishing (Flourishing), stress perception (PSS-10), and&#xD;
      disease activity and disease-specific quality of life. In chronic gastroenterological&#xD;
      patients, a distinction is made between patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS-SSS + IBS-QOL), ulcerative colitis (CAI + IBDQ) and Crohn's disease (HBI+ IBDQ). For&#xD;
      chronic rheumatologic/pain patients, a distinction is made between pain patients in general&#xD;
      (PDI), rheumatism (DAS-28, RAID), and fibromyalgia syndrome (Fibromyalgia Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire, PHQ-15, PHQ-4, FIQ). The German Pain Questionnaire/ Severity Grading according&#xD;
      to von Korff is applied to each of the three diseases. In addition, sociodemographics (age,&#xD;
      gender, educational level, employment status, family situation), previous course of the&#xD;
      disease, previous experience with/application of complementary medicine and naturopathic&#xD;
      procedures, expectations of complementary medicine and naturopathic procedures used in the&#xD;
      clinic, assessment and satisfaction with inpatient therapy program and planned and realized&#xD;
      application of learned procedures are considered.&#xD;

    <description>The Pain Disability Index (PDI) was developed specifically for patients with pain. The German-language translation (Dillmann et al., 1994), which is consistent with the original in terms of content and form, consists of seven items that assess the impact of pain on individual domains of life: family and domestic obligations, leisure activities, social activities, occupation, sexual life, self-care, and activities essential to life. For each area, the patient is asked to indicate on an eleven-point scale the extent to which he or she is impaired here by his or her pain.</description>

    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is an instrument that quantifies the general impact of fibromyalgia syndrome in many dimensions. For example, it assesses functional ability, pain levels, fatigue, and sleep disturbances in patients affected by FMS. The FIQ is presented on a scale of 0-100, with a lower number indicating better health. It is a sensitive tool for therapy evaluation in fibromyalgia.</description>

    <description>The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is an instrument that quantifies the general impact of fibromyalgia syndrome in many dimensions. For example, it assesses functional ability, pain levels, fatigue, and sleep disturbances in patients affected by FMS. The FIQ is presented on a scale of 0-100, with a lower number indicating better health. It is a sensitive tool for therapy evaluation in fibromyalgia.</description>
