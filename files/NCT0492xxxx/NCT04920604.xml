  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anesthesia safety decree made it compulsory in 1994 to carry out a pre-anesthesia&#xD;
      consultation before any operative or interventional act. With the inclusion of telemedicine&#xD;
      in the Public Health Code then the publication of Addendum 6 in 2018 and finally the&#xD;
      derogatory decree in March 2020, it is possible to perform and bill for pre-anesthesia&#xD;
      consultation via telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consultation is always followed by a pre-anesthetic visit upon admission of the patient&#xD;
      the day before or the day of the operation to verify the information recorded during the&#xD;
      consultation and the patient's state of health. This identifies elements omitted during the&#xD;
      pre-anesthesia consultation (face-to-face or remotely) and reduces the risks of potential&#xD;
      postponement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that there would be no difference in the quality of the&#xD;
      information given, the collection of medical, paramedical and medication elements and the&#xD;
      evaluation of the operative risk in anesthesia consultation via teleconsultation versus&#xD;
      face-to-face. The critical points are the medication reconciliation of the patient's&#xD;
      treatments, the overall assessment of the operative risk and anticipated difficulty of access&#xD;
      to the airways (mouth opening: ≥ or &lt;35 mmm).&#xD;
