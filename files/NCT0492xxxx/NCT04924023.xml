  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many medical interventions, including the dressing of central venous catheters, a common&#xD;
      procedure used for children with cancer, cause anxiety and pain in children. This can&#xD;
      adversely affect their care and recovery. This study aims to determine the effect of using a&#xD;
      kaleidoscope during central venous catheter dressing on anxiety and pain in children with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomised controlled trial with 60 children aged 6-12 diagnosed with cancer who&#xD;
      were placed either in a kaleidoscope group (n=30) or a control group (n=30). Each child's&#xD;
      anxiety was evaluated by the child using the Child Fear Scale before, during and after a&#xD;
      central venous catheter dressing procedure, and each child's pain during and after the&#xD;
      procedure was evaluated by the child using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WB-FACES).&#xD;
      Each child's heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured with a pulse oximeter device&#xD;
      before, during and after central venous catheter dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in kaleidoscope group looked into the kaleidoscope and slowly turned it. This&#xD;
      distraction procedure began immediately before the central venous catheter dressing and&#xD;
      continued until it was finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intervention was performed to reduce pain and anxiety for children in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents accompanied their children during the procedure in both groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization was done using the closed-envelope method. A total of 60 cards, equally divided between the kaleidoscope and control groups (30 of each), were placed in sealed envelopes. The children were asked to choose one of these envelopes, which determined their placement in the kaleidoscope group or the control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WB-FACES) is used to evaluate pain levels in children. This numeric rating scale ranges from 0 to 10 and is represented by faces that display emotions ranging from smiling (0 = very happy or no pain) to crying (10 = the worst pain).</description>

    <description>The Children's Fear Scale (CFS) is used to evaluate anxiety levels in children. It consists of five facial expressions representing a range from no anxiety (0) to severe anxiety (4).</description>

    <description>Children in this group were told what a kaleidoscope is and how to use it before their central venous catheter dressing. The children were then asked if they would like to look into the kaleidoscope. The children looked into the kaleidoscope and slowly turned it. The researcher asked the children about the colours and shapes seen inside the kaleidoscope. This distraction procedure began immediately before the central venous catheter dressing and continued until it was finished. The kaleidoscope was disinfected before each use. A kaleidoscope was provided for all children in this group by the same researcher. Parents accompanied their children during the catheter dressing.</description>
