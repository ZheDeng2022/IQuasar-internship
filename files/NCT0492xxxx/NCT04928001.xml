      This research study examines rural youth's experience of an internet based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy intervention, and their experience of symptoms of depression, anxiety and&#xD;
      co-occurring disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, and rural Montana, a substantial health disparity exists for rural&#xD;
      youths' mental health and mental health care access. In 2017, nearly a third of all Montana&#xD;
      high school students reported being impacted by depression; 21% considered suicide compared&#xD;
      to 17% nationally. Over 30% of Montana adolescents indicated drinking alcohol and 20%&#xD;
      indicated using marijuana. Rural Montanans face enormous barriers to behavioral health care&#xD;
      including low mental health care provider coverage, long distances to adequate care, and&#xD;
      stigma. We have developed a culturally and developmentally appropriate Internet-based&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (iCBT) program designed to teach skills that address mental and&#xD;
      behavioral health challenges common to adolescents. Building on previous development and&#xD;
      evaluation of an adult version of iCBT (Thrive), the investigators propose to pilot the newly&#xD;
      developed youth version of Thrive (Y-T), a fully automated stand-alone program. Y-T will&#xD;
      deliver CBT skills through educational, real life adolescent scenarios, and tailored feedback&#xD;
      videos to address symptoms of depression, anxiety and co-occurring (addiction) behaviors. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to conduct feasibility analyses of pilot study implementation in school&#xD;
      communities. The investigators will document and assess organization-level facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers that impact the study processes at each study site. Short-term goal for this&#xD;
      research are to understand how to effectively conduct trials within school community settings&#xD;
      and to obtain preliminary information on the acceptability and effectiveness of the Y-T&#xD;
      program to address depression and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviors. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct post-intervention focus groups to assess the program as&#xD;
      experienced by participants and insight on the extent of program engagement and learning. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that those using Y-T over an 8-week period will report markedly&#xD;
      decreased scores on anxiety, depression, and addictive behaviors. The long-term goal is to&#xD;
      conduct a larger trial of the program to determine the evidence of impact among youth.&#xD;
      Provided that this research demonstrates such programs to be evidence-based, the&#xD;
      investigators will work on a broader dissemination plan with the ultimate aim of decreasing&#xD;
      mental and behavioral health and respective health care disparities among rural youth.&#xD;
