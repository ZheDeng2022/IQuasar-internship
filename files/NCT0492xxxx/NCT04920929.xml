             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is eligible to receive a single lumen PICC&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is an adult who is prescribed a PICC line&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient's expected duration of treatment requiring a PICC for a minimum of 16 days&#xD;
             post device implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient understands and is willing to comply with all study requirements and has&#xD;
             voluntarily signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the time of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has been previously enrolled in this post market clinical evaluation, or is&#xD;
             participating in another clinical study that is contraindicative to the treatment or&#xD;
             outcomes of this investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Venous thrombosis in any portion of the vein to be catheterized&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Conditions that impede venous return from the extremity such as paralysis or&#xD;
             lymphedema after mastectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Orthopedic or neurological conditions affecting the extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Anticipation or presence of dialysis grafts or other intraluminal devices, including&#xD;
             pacemakers, within a month of patient enrollment start&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are on anticoagulation therapy prior to the study (10-14 days). Note: (If&#xD;
             patients are placed on anticoagulation (low dose) therapy while hospitalized, these&#xD;
             patients are allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has relinquished control of care to a guardian and/or facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has any significant medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             PI, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the post market clinical&#xD;
             evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inability to complete the protocol in the opinion of the clinical staff due to safety&#xD;
             or other reasons&#xD;
