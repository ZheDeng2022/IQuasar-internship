  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather early and mid- to long-term evidence to confirm the&#xD;
      clinical performance, safety and use of the Clavicle Plate and Clavicle Hook Plate System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 76 patients with clavicle fractures or dislocations of the AC joint surgically&#xD;
      treated with any plate from the DPS VA-LCP Clavicle System will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      observational post-market clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be collected until up to 2 years after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common problems with existing clavicular plates are poor plate 'fit,' unbalance fixation,&#xD;
      plate prominence, associated soft tissue irritation, subacromial pain, plate and/or fixation&#xD;
      failure (due to unbalanced fixation) and high reoperation rate (for plate removal) [1-3]. The&#xD;
      newly developed DePuy Synthes (DPS) variable angle locking compression plate (VA-LCP®)&#xD;
      Clavicle 2.7 System was designed to address these problems. The system consists of lateral,&#xD;
      shaft and medial plates and hook plates of different sizes to cover a wide variation in&#xD;
      clavicular morphology and diverse fracture, fracture-dislocation and dislocation indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to describe the short and long-term clinical performance and safety of both&#xD;
      systems, as well as the functional outcomes of this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months 1, and 2 years&#xD;
      after surgery. In addition, the surgeons' experience and utility of the devices will be&#xD;
      surveyed. For the short term evaluation, an interim analysis will be done as soon as 30&#xD;
      patients in each group have completed 6 months of follow-up (FU). The final evaluation of&#xD;
      long-term outcomes will be done after 2 years of FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatments and follow-up visits are according to standard of care.&#xD;

This score assesses the comorbidity level by considering both the number and severity of pre-defined comorbid conditions. It provides a weighted score of a patient's comorbidities which can be used to predict mortality risk. The minimum possible score is 0 (no comorbidities) and maximum 29. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality.</description>
