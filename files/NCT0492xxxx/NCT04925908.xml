      COVID-19 pandemic emerges an issue for breastfeeding.Earlier in pandemic mothers who had&#xD;
      COVID-19 were separated from their babies due to insufficient data but this approach was&#xD;
      abandoned due to the lack of transmission via breastmilk.However, where mothers with COVID-19&#xD;
      are cohorted in the same room, they still have to be isolated from their babies following the&#xD;
      birth.Investigators aimed to evaluate rate of exclusive breastfeeding(EB) within first 6&#xD;
      months among mothers who were isolated from their babies due to COVID-19.&#xD;
