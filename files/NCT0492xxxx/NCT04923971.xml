  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BHSAI is developing a computational system that provides early alerts of a rise and fall in&#xD;
      core body temperature to help reduce the risk of thermal injury in the field and during&#xD;
      training. The goal of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise&#xD;
      in the heat and cold. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a&#xD;
      body temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest and&#xD;
      exercise in different cold environments. Multiple cold ambient temperatures will be&#xD;
      validated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a randomized, cross-over design to assess the effect of three&#xD;
      different cold ambient temperatures on skin temperature at peripheral regions, core&#xD;
      temperature (rectal), metabolic heat production, hand dexterity measures at rest, and&#xD;
      athletic performance assessment after rest in cold ambient temperatures. The three different&#xD;
      trials for this study will include ambient temperatures at: A. 0°C (32°F), B. -10°C (14°F),&#xD;
      and C. Surrogate -20°C (-10°C + 3 m/s wind speed [14°F + 6 mph]). This will be accomplished&#xD;
      by use of a environmental chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned after medical clearance is granted. Visit specific information&#xD;
      is described below, however, specific data collection protocols for dependent variables and&#xD;
      procedures are included below the description of the study design. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to sign a photo/video release form to be used in research projects, scientific&#xD;
      publications/conferences and for educational purposes. Participants may be videoed or&#xD;
      photographed while exercising or resting in the environmental chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 0°C (32°F) and -10°C (14°F) trials, participants will wear cold weather gear as&#xD;
      described by BHSAI. All cold weather gear will be machine-washable, provided to the&#xD;
      participants and properly fitted to each individual. Clothing will be kept in the laboratory,&#xD;
      machine-washed by manufacturer recommendations. Participants will not be able to keep&#xD;
      clothing used upon completion of the study. These trials will also have a wind speed of 1&#xD;
      m/s. For the surrogate -20°C (-4°F) experiment, ambient temperature will be -10°C (14°F) with&#xD;
      wind speed approximately at 3 m/s (6 mph) to serve as an aggregate for -20°C (-4°F). Wind&#xD;
      will not be facing the participant. Participants will wear all cold weather gear listed above&#xD;
      with the exception of the microfleece cap and shell layer for hand (Figure 2). For all&#xD;
      trials, participants will rest upright on a chair with feet above the ground and hands on the&#xD;
      arms of the chair (exposed to air). The participant will remain seated for 120 minutes. For&#xD;
      additional safety of the participants, the experiment will be terminated if the core body&#xD;
      temperature falls below 35°C (95°F) and/or the skin temperature in any of the peripheral&#xD;
      regions falls below 8°C (46°F). During the three testing sessions, the participants will wear&#xD;
      a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch on their non-dominant arm and a Polar chest strap. These devices&#xD;
      would be paired with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone that runs the 2B-Cool algorithm for&#xD;
      core temperature estimation using data from the smartwatch. These devices will be used in&#xD;
      conjunction with data from the rectal and skin temperature sensors to validate the sponsors'&#xD;
      temperature prediction algorithm. All devices will be cleaned prior to and after participant&#xD;
      use per manufacturer instructions. These devices would be provided by BHSAI to the University&#xD;
      of Connecticut. During the three testing sessions, in addition to the BHSAI-provided devices,&#xD;
      participants will wear thermistors to record the skin temperature (finger-tip and base of&#xD;
      finger, hand dorsum, big toe, nose, cheek, ear tip, chin, and forehead and will privately&#xD;
      insert a rectal thermometer 15 cm (~4-6 ins) beyond the anal sphincter to record the&#xD;
      gold-standard core temperature.VO2 data will also be assessed to collect metabolic heat&#xD;
      production. Hand dexterity will be assessed using the validated Purdue pegboard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all three sessions, researchers will ensure that the smartwatch is placed&#xD;
      approximately 1-inch proximal to the wrist and fits snuggly to ensure accurate heart-rate&#xD;
      measurements. Researchers will also ensure that the devices are paired with the smartphone&#xD;
      and the physiological variables are being recorded on the phone before commencement of the&#xD;
      session. Since different devices will be used for measuring the physiological variables and&#xD;
      the associated gold standard, researchers will record the starting time-stamp from the&#xD;
      smartphone and the gold-standard recording computer to ensure time synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 120-minute seated rest period, a performance battery will be utilized to assess&#xD;
      athletic performance in 3 different cold environments. Agility/reaction time, power, muscular&#xD;
      strength, sprint performance on a cycle ergometer, and 1-mile time trial on a motorized&#xD;
      treadmill will be assessed. An environmental symptom questionnaire (ESQ) will be administered&#xD;
      at the end of the performance battery prior to exiting the chamber. All trials will be&#xD;
      approximately 3-4 hours each. Total participation in the study is approximately 12-14 hours&#xD;
      of time for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Testing (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for baseline anthropometrics&#xD;
      and VO2max testing visit. Prior to arrival to the lab, participants will be given&#xD;
      instructions (Appendix K) on proper hydration practices, avoidance of alcohol and caffeine&#xD;
      (24 and 12 hours, respectively). Participants will be allowed to consume their normal diet&#xD;
      during the study. Participants will be required to take the Korey Stringer Institute COVID-19&#xD;
      Pre-Screening Questionnaire (Appendix J) remotely through Qualtrics. Upon arrival to the lab,&#xD;
      participants will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Key study personnel will&#xD;
      determine participants urine color using a validated urine color chart by Armstrong et al.3&#xD;
      Urine specific gravity (USG) will also be assessed. Euhydration will be defined USG ≤1.020.&#xD;
      Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a USG ≤1.025 is met. If the&#xD;
      participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      drink 500mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Nude body mass will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking&#xD;
      measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and&#xD;
      the research reading the scale outside of the room (Defender R7000 Xtreme; OHAUS Corp.,&#xD;
      Parsippany, NJ, USA). Weight will be recorded in kilograms. Participants will fill out a&#xD;
      Karolinska Sleep Diary (Appendix I) prior to collecting anthropometrics. Height will be&#xD;
      measured with a tape measure. Percent body fat will be measured using Air displacement&#xD;
      plethysmography (BodPod®; Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+, Concord, CA, USA). This will take&#xD;
      less than ~5 minutes to complete. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a treadmill in a thermoneutral environment. This test will&#xD;
      provide aerobic fitness levels of the participants. A heart rate monitor and strap will be&#xD;
      given to the participants to wear during the VO2max test. A metabolic mask will be used in&#xD;
      order to determine RER. When the participant is ready, the test will begin. This test begins&#xD;
      at a speed equivalent to a jog at 2% grade and the speed incrementally rises every 2 minutes&#xD;
      until the participant reaches volitional fatigue. Maximal oxygen consumption, respiratory&#xD;
      exchange ratio (RER), heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be collected&#xD;
      throughout this test. This test will take approximately 20 minutes. After VO2max testing,&#xD;
      researchers will familiarize the participant with the hand dexterity test and the performance&#xD;
      battery. Agility/reaction time, power, muscular strength, sprint performance on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer, and 1-mile time trial. Additionally, participants will be familiarized with all&#xD;
      scales (RPE, thermal sensation scale, thirst scale, fatigue scale, and environmental symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire [ESQ]) during this session (Appendix C). Scheduling will be completed for each&#xD;
      participant prior to discharge from the Baseline familiarization visit. This visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Day Procedures (All 3 Cold Temperature Trials)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do&#xD;
      not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or&#xD;
      taking medications to determine whether they can complete the trial. The participant's visit&#xD;
      will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that&#xD;
      influence body temperature. If the participant indicates they have had a COVID-19 exposure&#xD;
      prior to any scheduled trial, they will be required to follow University protocols and&#xD;
      acquire a negative test result in order to remain eligible for the study. Trials will be on&#xD;
      separate days at least 3 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to consume their normal diets prior to all visits. Upon arrival&#xD;
      to the lab, participants will also be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol or&#xD;
      caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked to specify&#xD;
      exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their trial will&#xD;
      be rescheduled for another day. The participants will also be asked to complete a subjective&#xD;
      sleep questionnaire as the arrive to the lab. Next, participants will provide a urine sample&#xD;
      in a clean urine cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass&#xD;
      will be recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass&#xD;
      measures by taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid,&#xD;
      closed door, and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Hydration status of each&#xD;
      participant will also be addressed prior to entering and exiting the chamber. Participants&#xD;
      will only be permitted to continue to the trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine&#xD;
      specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and&#xD;
      1.025, the participant will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration&#xD;
      status. Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain&#xD;
      desired hydration status for the upcoming trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will privately insert a rectal thermometer 15 cm beyond the anal sphincter and&#xD;
      wear a heart rate monitor strap. Additionally, participants will wear 9-site skin temperature&#xD;
      sensors (Biopac, see diagram below skin temperature). Key personnel will apply the skin&#xD;
      temperature sensors with medical tape to the participants' finger-tip and base of finger,&#xD;
      hand dorsum, big toe, nose, cheek, ear tip, chin, and forehead. Participants will also have 4&#xD;
      iButton skin temperature sensors placed on four locations (shoulder, chest, calf, thigh) to&#xD;
      assess mean skin temperature. The participants will wear a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch on&#xD;
      their non-dominant arm and a heart-rate monitor chest strap. These devices would be paired&#xD;
      with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone that runs the 2B-Cool algorithm for core temperature&#xD;
      estimation using data from the smartwatch. These devices will be provided by BHSAI to the&#xD;
      University of Connecticut. Participants will then don the cold-environment clothing&#xD;
      (purchased from grant funding), described previously, before entering the chamber. VO2 data&#xD;
      will also be assessed to collect metabolic heat production. Participants will rest in a&#xD;
      lounge chair for 2 hours with hand-dexterity tests performed every 30 minutes. All&#xD;
      participants will drink ad libitum throughout all trials.. Following the 120-minute seated&#xD;
      rest period, a performance battery will be utilized to assess athletic performance in 3&#xD;
      different cold environments: Agility/reaction time, power, muscular strength, sprint&#xD;
      performance on a cycle ergometer and 1-mile time trial. USG and urine color and will be&#xD;
      assessed prior to the discharge of the participant from the laboratory. These visits will&#xD;
      take approximately 3-4 hours.&#xD;
