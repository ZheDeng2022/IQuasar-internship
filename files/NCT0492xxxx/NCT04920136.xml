      This study is to compare the two techniques to achieve change in the tissue quality at areas&#xD;
      of lack of Keratinized Tissue (KT) using soft tissue grafting with autogenous graft material&#xD;
      (Free Gingival Graft)(FGG) vs Strip gingival graft with acellular dermal matrix (ADM)&#xD;
      (SGG+ADM).&#xD;

      This investigation is a randomized controlled trial of two techniques to achieve change in&#xD;
      the tissue quality at areas of lack of Keratinized Tissue (KT) using soft tissue grafting&#xD;
      with autogenous graft material (Free Gingival Graft)(FGG) vs Strip gingival graft with&#xD;
      acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (SGG+ADM). To evaluate to determine if either grafting&#xD;
      technique (FGG vs SGG+ADM) demonstrates superiority in clinical (amount of KT increase,&#xD;
      tissue thickness increase, and practitioner-assessed esthetics) and patient-centered outcomes&#xD;
      (pain, swelling, change in daily activities, and patient-assessed esthetics) in a controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>A horizontal incision is then placed at the middle of residual KT. Two vertical releasing incisions are followed to allow for apical displacement of the flap. The recipient site should ideally retain intact periosteum that is firmly attached to bone with no loose fibers, no irregularities and no perforations.&#xD;
A strip of a free gingival graft is then harvested from the patient's palate. This strip is only 2 to 3 mm wide ,1 to 1.5 mm thick and has an appropriate length to cover the full apical extension of the recipient site. The strip is sutured immediately with 6-0 monocryl sutures. Coronal to the strip, the periosteal bed is covered with ADM, which is already rehydrated in sterile saline for 10 min, trimmed and customized to fit the available space. The ADM is then stabilized on the periosteal bed with the epithelium side facing upward. The ADM is fixed on the recipient bed by periosteal 6-0 monocryl sutures.</description>

    <description>Two vertical incisions are made, and a partial thickness flap are designed to provide a firm and immobile periosteal bed. The raised partial thickness flap will be excised. Muscle and unattached connective tissue fibers are thoroughly scraped with a scalpel to prevent graft mobility. Autogenous FGG was harvested with #15C scalpel blade from hard palate at the same side randomly selected to receive the FGG. Donor area will be sutured with 5-0 gut sutures. FGG, is placed and stabilized with simple interrupted 5-0 vicryl sutures at recipient site coronal border and horizontal or periosteal anchorage sutures over the graft.</description>

    <description>A horizontal incision is then placed at the middle of residual KT. Two vertical releasing incisions are followed to allow for apical displacement of the flap. The flap will be then elevated with a split-thickness flap beyond the mucogingival junction where it is sutured at this apical position using a mattress (5-0, monocryl) suture. The recipient site should ideally retain intact periosteum that is firmly attached to bone with no loose fibers, no irregularities and no perforations.</description>
