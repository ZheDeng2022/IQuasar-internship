      This is a multicohort phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab combined with&#xD;
      the investigational drug sitravatinib in the frontline treatment of advanced, non-squamous&#xD;
      PD-L1 positive NSCLC. For clinical analysis, there will be two patient cohorts defined by&#xD;
      PD-L1 status: Cohort 1 for patients with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) 1-49% and Cohort&#xD;
      2 for patients with TPS≥50%. The investigators will implement a Simon's two-stage design to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of sitravatinib in combination with pembrolizumab for each cohort&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups within each cohort of this study: the &quot;main study population&quot; (Group&#xD;
      A) in which patients will receive pembrolizumab plus sitravatinib beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
      (C1D1), and a &quot;pembrolizumab run-in population&quot; (Group B) in which patients will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone for 1 dose followed by pembrolizumab plus sitravatinib beginning C2D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the trial is the ORR for patients treated with pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      sitravatinib in the main study population. The purpose of the pembrolizumab run-in population&#xD;
      is to obtain tissue and blood samples from these patients to be used as controls for&#xD;
      correlative studies and to determine the preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab alone followed&#xD;
      by the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sitravatinib in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in the front-line treatment of patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-squamous PD-L1 positive NSCLC by measuring Objective Response Rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate other measures of efficacy including Overall Survival (OS), Progression Free&#xD;
           Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DOR) and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in the&#xD;
           first-line setting for patients with advanced, non-squamous, PD-L1 positive NSCLC&#xD;
           treated with the combination of sitravatinib and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the toxicity profile and tolerability of sitravatinib/pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           advanced, treatment naïve, non-squamous, PD-L1 positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate ORR, OS, PFS, DOR, and CBR in patients with advanced, non-squamous,&#xD;
           treatment naïve, PD-L1 positive NSCLC who receive pembrolizumab run-in followed by&#xD;
           pembrolizumab/sitravatinib combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the CNS activity of sitravatinib/pembrolizumab in patients with advanced,&#xD;
           treatment naïve, PD-L1 positive NSCLC by measuring Intracranial Objective Response Rate&#xD;
           (iORR) and Intracranial Duration of Response(iDOR) in patients with baseline CNS&#xD;
           disease, and Intercranial Progression-Free Survival (iPFS) in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study correlates of the adaptive and innate immune responses induced by sitravatinib&#xD;
           and pembrolizumab treatment in both tumor tissue and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the association between tumor immune contexture and clinical benefit to&#xD;
           sitravatinib and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
