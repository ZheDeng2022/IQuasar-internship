  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although prone position is widely used in awake patients with COVID-19 associated with&#xD;
      supplemental oxygenation, high flow nasal catheter, or noninvasive ventilation, few studies&#xD;
      are attesting to its real benefits on physiological variables or intubation rate. Awake&#xD;
      patients dependent on supplemental oxygen may have different responses to PP about peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Such responses may be permanent,&#xD;
      transient, or even absent. We believe that the response to PP can be a predictor of the need&#xD;
      for admission to the ICU. This study aimed to evaluate the acute effects of different types&#xD;
      of response to the prone position in patients awake with COVID-19.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Patients were followed up for up to 15 days of hospitalization.</time_frame>
    <description>The criteria defined for admission to the ICU included maintenance of SpO2 below 90% with oxygen flow at 15 L / min, RF greater than 30 incursions per minute, reduced level of consciousness, or clinical signs of persistent increase in respiratory work, such as paradoxical ventilatory pattern.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, through tests based on&#xD;
        PCR and chest tomography with suggestive findings, spontaneously ventilating, dependent on&#xD;
        supplemental oxygen. The study included patients with: (1) age ≥ 18 years, (2) peripheral&#xD;
        oxygen saturation less than 92% under supplemental oxygen administration equal to or&#xD;
        greater than 6 L / min through a nasal catheter or reservoir mask; (3) no use of NIV or&#xD;
        high-flow nasal catheter; (4) continuous monitoring with pulse oximeter; (5) mental status&#xD;
        that allowed to follow the instructions; and (6) able to tolerate PP with minimal&#xD;
        assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemodynamic instability, severe obesity, or who were unable to tolerate and cooperate&#xD;
             with the performance of PP&#xD;
