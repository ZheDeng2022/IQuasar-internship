  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of internet-based cognitive&#xD;
      therapy for severe health anxiety within regular psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal cohort study will be conducted investigating 400 patients who have received&#xD;
      ICBT for severe health anxiety between 2018-2020 in an outpatient psychiatric clinic&#xD;
      providing Internet-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, SHAI, and a&#xD;
      within-group design with repeated measures will be used for primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that ICBT will be associated with a significant reduction in health&#xD;
      anxiety as measured with SHAI, both after treatment and at six-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe health anxiety is a prevalent disorder, leading to considerable distress and is&#xD;
      associated with high societal costs. Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy is a method&#xD;
      to improve access to evidence-based psychological treatments and it has shown to be&#xD;
      efficacious in the treatment of severe health anxiety in several randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials. However, there is limited knowledge of its effectiveness and application in clinical&#xD;
      psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of internet-based cognitive&#xD;
      therapy for severe health anxiety within regular psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct at a cohort-study with a pretest-posttest design investigating&#xD;
      consecutively recruited patients from May 2018 to April 2021 in an outpatient psychiatric&#xD;
      clinic specialised in delivering ICBT. The treatment content has been successfully tested in&#xD;
      previous efficacy studies and will be delivered during 13 weeks. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be the gold standard SHAI and a within-group design with repeated measures will be used&#xD;
      in the primary analysis. It is estimated that 400 patients will receive treatment during this&#xD;
      period and thus be included in the study, if consenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that ICBT will be associated with a significant reduction in health&#xD;
      anxiety as measured with SHAI, both after treatment and at six-month follow-up. The effect&#xD;
      size is expected to be somewhat smaller than in research trials but still moderate to large&#xD;
      (d &gt; 0.5).&#xD;

    <description>The treatment program consists of 12 chapters or &quot;modules&quot; spread over 12 weeks and contains written information, different exercises and weekly homework assignment. Patients get access to the CBT program via an internet portal and they have weekly contact with a licenced psychologist via encrypted email. Focus of the therapist support is to review the content of the weekly module, reinforce progress and engagement in therapy and assist with treatment difficulties. If needed, therapist can contact patients via telephone. Patients receive weekly reminders via SMS to login to the portal and fill out self-report measures.</description>

        All patients will receive treatment at the Internet Psychiatry Clinic&#xD;
        (www.internetpsykiatri.se), Psychiatry Southwest, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge.&#xD;
        Patient can either apply for treatment through self-referral or through referral from&#xD;
        primary or psychiatric care. Self-referred patients will register for treatment through a&#xD;
        public e-service portal for health care (i.e.Vårdguiden; 1177.se).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior to treatment, patients will complete an online screening battery of self-report&#xD;
        questionnaires and undergo an assessment by psychiatrists, or resident physicians&#xD;
        supervised by psychiatrists.&#xD;
