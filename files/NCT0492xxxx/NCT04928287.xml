  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single center, phase 2 study to assess efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of multiple HB-adMSCs vs Placebo for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 32-week treatment period, and a&#xD;
      safety Follow-up period of 20 weeks after the last investigational product administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be open to enroll 24 eligible participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. Patients' recruitment will be conducted by the study team, if eligible&#xD;
      participants are identified based on eligibility criteria, a screening visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled. Informed consent form will be given to the study participants and signed before&#xD;
      any study procedures. Informed consent form will include information about the clinical trial&#xD;
      and some aspects should be considered during this process.&#xD;
