  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the impact of simple resistance exercise&#xD;
      breaks on physical activity and prolonged sedentary behavior as well as on ratings of&#xD;
      discomfort, fatigue, and sleepiness. Participants will be enrolled in a cross-over designed&#xD;
      study, where they will be assessed for normal activity patterns and ratings of discomfort,&#xD;
      fatigue, and sleepiness during a typical week and compared to a week where they engage in&#xD;
      hourly resistance exercise breaks. Subjects will also complete a feasibility questionnaire at&#xD;
      the end to determine if such programming could be implemented into daily living. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that engaging in these simple, hourly resistance breaks will result in&#xD;
      decreased ratings of discomfort, fatigue, and sleepiness as well as ratings of high&#xD;
      feasibility for implementation of similar resistance exercise programming into their normal,&#xD;
      everyday life. Total time spent enrolled in the study will be 4 weeks, however, the&#xD;
      participants will only need to report to the lab on 5 different occasions totaling 120&#xD;
      minutes split over those 5 days. Visit one will be roughly 60 minutes long, with the&#xD;
      following 4 visits taking roughly 15 minutes each with a visit at the beginning of the week&#xD;
      and end of the week for both the control and experimental week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will encounter 1 familiarization session and 4 other brief sessions&#xD;
      throughout the study. The study will consist of a 4 week protocol, with the first week having&#xD;
      one familiarization visit, the second week being a baseline assessment week of normal&#xD;
      activity, the third week being a washout period where no assessment is being done, and the&#xD;
      fourth week being another assessment week while also completing the hourly resistance&#xD;
      exercise breaks. Total time required for participants to report to the laboratory will be 120&#xD;
      minutes, but will be split over 5 visits (visit one: 60 minutes, visit two: 15 minutes, visit&#xD;
      three: 15 minutes, visit four: 15 minutes, visit 5: 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The familiarization day will consist of the subject going through an initial screening to&#xD;
      determine eligibility to participate in the study, as well as signing the informed consent.&#xD;
      Following this, the participants will complete questionnaires to assess characteristics of&#xD;
      interest (age, ethnicity, and activity level) and any other relevant characteristics deemed&#xD;
      to be important to describe the population. Individuals will then be shown the journals and&#xD;
      how to use them (journal attached). These journals will be used to track their ratings of&#xD;
      discomfort, fatigue, and sleepiness across each of the days for both assessment weeks. Next,&#xD;
      the individual will be shown each of the exercises that will be used during the resistance&#xD;
      exercise break week and will be asked by the PI to complete each one so that the PI can&#xD;
      provide any feedback to correct the movements to ensure safety. The subjects will also be&#xD;
      given typed handouts describing each exercise in detail for their own records. Lastly, the&#xD;
      subjects will be shown the activity monitors and how they will be applied to their body and&#xD;
      how to replace the adhesive tape if needed during the weeks they are wearing the device (See&#xD;
      attachment). This visit is expected to last roughly 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2 (week 2) will take place Monday morning at 8:00 am the week following the&#xD;
      familiarization visit and will last roughly 15 minutes. At this visit, the PI will secure the&#xD;
      activity monitor to the subject, and provide extra adhesive strips if needed. The subject&#xD;
      will also receive their journal for the week to assess discomfort, fatigue, and sleepiness.&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to track their ratings at three separate time points (morning:&#xD;
      between 8:00-9:00 am, mid-day: between 1:00-2:00 pm, and evening: between 6:00-7:00 pm)&#xD;
      across each of the next 7 days (Monday-Sunday). During the 7 days, the subject will be&#xD;
      wearing the activity monitor the entire time (awake and sleep) and will only be removed if&#xD;
      swimming/bathing (shower is ok: waterproof). The subject will be asked to go about their week&#xD;
      as they normally do, with no extra intervention, to track activity and ratings for a typical&#xD;
      week. This week will not have them completing any exercises and will serve as a control week&#xD;
      for assessing physical activity pattern. Total time spent filling out the journal will be&#xD;
      roughly 2-3 minutes per time, so roughly 9 minutes per day, and 63 minutes for the entire&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #3 (week 3) will take place on the Monday following the 7 days of assessment. The PI&#xD;
      will remove the activity monitor and collect any extra adhesive strips. The subject will also&#xD;
      turn in their journal that was used to track their ratings for the previous week. This visit&#xD;
      will take roughly 15 minutes. At this point the subject will be allowed to leave and begin&#xD;
      the washout week with no assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #4 (Week 4) will take place Monday morning at 8:00 am the week following the washout&#xD;
      week and will last roughly 15 minutes. At this visit, the PI will secure the activity monitor&#xD;
      to the subject, and provide extra adhesive strips if needed. The subject will also receive&#xD;
      their journal for the week to assess discomfort, fatigue, and sleepiness. The subject will be&#xD;
      asked to track their ratings at three separate time points (morning: between 8:00-9:00 am,&#xD;
      mid-day: between 1:00-2:00 pm, and evening: between 6:00-7:00 pm) across each of the next 7&#xD;
      days (Monday-Sunday). During the 7 days, the subject will be wearing the activity monitor the&#xD;
      entire time (awake and sleep) and will only be removed if swimming/bathing (shower is ok:&#xD;
      waterproof). The subject will also now be asked to completely hourly resistance exercise&#xD;
      breaks each hour for a total of eight exercises per day. Subjects will be asked to complete 2&#xD;
      sets of 15 repetitions each for all eight exercises with a minute rest in between sets. Each&#xD;
      break should take less than 5 minutes. All exercises will be low intensity that utilize their&#xD;
      own body weight as resistance or use a light resistance band with handles. Exercises will be&#xD;
      split in groups of 4 with one group in the morning and one in the afternoon, with one&#xD;
      exercise taking place per time slot. Time slots will be as follows: between 9:00-10:00 am,&#xD;
      10-11:00 am, 11:00-12:00 pm, and 12:00-1:00 pm, as well as from 2:00-3:00 pm, 3:00-4:00 pm,&#xD;
      4:00-5:00pm, and 5:00-6:00pm. Each exercise in detail is described in the handout that will&#xD;
      be given to each participant (attached). This will require the participant to be engaged in&#xD;
      exercise roughly 24 minutes per day, for a total of 168 minutes of exercise for the week. The&#xD;
      participant will also be filling out the journals for the second assessment week similar to&#xD;
      the first assessment week, totaling roughly 63 minutes for the week completing the journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #5 (week 4) will take place on the Monday following the second week of 7 day&#xD;
      assessments. The PI will remove the activity monitor and collect any extra adhesive strips.&#xD;
      The subject will also turn in their journal that was used to track their ratings for the&#xD;
      previous week. Finally the subjects will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire about the&#xD;
      feasibility of such programming in their daily life. This visit will take roughly 15 minutes.&#xD;
      This will complete the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about participants and related to this study will be kept confidential to the&#xD;
      extent permitted or required by law. Hard copies of the data collection materials will kept&#xD;
      under lock and key for a period of no less than five years, then disposed of as sensitive&#xD;
      materials according to University policy/procedures. Data collections sheets and informed&#xD;
      consent documents will be stored separately. All data collection forms will not have any&#xD;
      identifiable information on them and will have an ID number to link the information to the&#xD;
      participant. Form linking participant name to ID will be kept electronically in a password&#xD;
      protected computer file along with the reduced and analyzed data that is collected.&#xD;
