  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effect of audio-guided&#xD;
      mental practice (MP) and video-guided MP on the impairment and functional abilities of upper&#xD;
      extremity (UE) hemiparesis following a stroke. Participants are recruited from Adventist&#xD;
      Healthcare Rehabilitation Hospital. All participants must be less than one-month post-stroke&#xD;
      with moderate UE hemiparesis. Eligible participants are randomly assigned to an experimental&#xD;
      group, (MP or repetitive-task practice (RTP)), or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MP groups will perform either audio-guided MP or video-guided MP, five days a week, with&#xD;
      20 repetitions of the following tasks: wiping a table, picking up a cup, brushing hair, and&#xD;
      turning the pages of a book. The RTP group physically performed the same tasks. The control&#xD;
      group received traditional stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that video MP will have greater improvements in UE impairments&#xD;
      and functional abilities than audio MP, RTP, and/or traditional therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Fugl Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity Portion (FMA-UE) (Measuring pre/post intervention change)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 days of admission and within 3 days prior to discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl Meyer Assessment-upper extremity(FMA-UE) portion will be administered to measure the impairment of the upper extremity. Upper extremity movements are rated on 3-point ordinal scale where 0= unable to perform, 1= performs partially, 2= performs fully. Cumulative scores range from 0-66 where a lower score indicates increased impairment.</description>

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) (Measuring pre/post intervention change)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 days of admission and within 3 days prior to discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is used to measure the functional abilities of the UE. 15 tasks are performed including six timed joint-segment movements and eight timed integrative functional movements. Tasks are rated on a 6-point ordinal scale where 0= does not attempt to 5=movement appears to be normal. Timed and functional ability scores are calculated to indicate the functional abilities of the UE.</description>

    <description>Participants of the audio mental practice (MP) group will complete MP via audio-guided multisensory cues of one of four tasks: (1) wiping a table (2) picking up a cup (3) brushing hair and/or (4) turning the page of a book. The assigned motor task is based upon the functional abilities of the patient. MP will be performed followed by physical practice of the same task with a research therapist 3x/week and independent MP 2 days/week. Each audio recording consists of 20 repetitions of the task.</description>
