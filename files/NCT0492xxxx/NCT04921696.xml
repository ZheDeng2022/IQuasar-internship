  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of mortality among preterm infants.The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of NEC remains unclear with conflicting data regarding the role of red blood&#xD;
      cell (RBC) transfusion and anemia. A meta-analysis of retrospective studies demonstrated an&#xD;
      association between exposure to RBC transfusion and NEC(adjusted odds ratio, 2.0 [95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, 1.6-2.5]). However, recent observational studies have found no&#xD;
      association between RBC transfusion and NEC or have found RBC transfusion to be protective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving understanding of the role of RBC transfusion and anemia in the development of NEC&#xD;
      is important. Several studies characterizing the associations between transfusion, anemia,&#xD;
      and NEC were potentially limited by small sample size, study design. As such, researchers&#xD;
      have underscored the need for prospective study in which each RBC exposure, episode of&#xD;
      anemia, and outcome of NEC can be systematically and consistently evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study examined whether RBC transfusion and anemia were associated with the&#xD;
      rate of NEC. The primary objective was to test whether NEC was increased in infants receiving&#xD;
      RBC transfusion compared with non transfused infants. Further, exposure to severe neonatal&#xD;
      anemia was examined as an independent risk factor for NEC.&#xD;
