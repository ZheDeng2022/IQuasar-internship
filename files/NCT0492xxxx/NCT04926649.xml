  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These robot-assisted cardiac surgeries usually require single-lung ventilation (SLV) to&#xD;
      facilitate surgical exposure. SLV creates ventilation/perfusion mismatch and shunt (Qs:Qt)&#xD;
      through the collapsed lung and leads to hypoxemia. Pulmonary gas exchange often deteriorates&#xD;
      after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because of ischemic tissue damage. In some cases, severe&#xD;
      hypoxemia may require the cessation of surgical procedures and the initiation of double-lung&#xD;
      ventilation to improve oxygenation. In this study, the investigator applied the continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) or the high-frequency low-volume ventilation (HFLVV) to the&#xD;
      non-dependent lung (differential ventilation) during the weaning from CPB. The investigator&#xD;
      hypothesized that the differential ventilation would produce the least interference with the&#xD;
      surgeon's exposure and better oxygenation. The investigators evaluate the airway pressure,&#xD;
      shunt fraction, PaO2/FiO2, cerebral oximetry, surgical field condition and the length of stay&#xD;
      in intensive care unit of patients underwent the robot-assisted cardiac surgery.&#xD;
