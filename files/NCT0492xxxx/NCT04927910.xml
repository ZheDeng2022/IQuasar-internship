  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of&#xD;
      self-applied acupressure on arthralgia-fatigue-sleep disturbance symptom cluster in breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitors. This is a preliminary randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, with a three-arm trial design including verum self-acupressure, sham self-acupressure,&#xD;
      and usual care. Subjects will include 52 breast cancer survivors who are receiving aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors and have experienced a moderate level of joint pain and at least one of the two&#xD;
      symptoms including fatigue and sleep disturbance. Subjects who are randomized to either the&#xD;
      verum self-acupressure group (group A) or the sham self-acupressure group (group B) will&#xD;
      receive up to 8 weeks of the intervention consisting of two components: (1) two&#xD;
      individual/group acupressure training sessions over 2 weeks and (2) self-acupressure for 6&#xD;
      weeks. The method and duration of self-acupressure in the sham group will be the same to&#xD;
      those in the verum intervention group. The control group will receive usual care. The outcome&#xD;
      measures of this study will be related to feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects&#xD;
      of self-acupressure. Individual in-depth interviews will be conducted with selected&#xD;
      participants in group A and B to understand their perceptions and perceived effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
