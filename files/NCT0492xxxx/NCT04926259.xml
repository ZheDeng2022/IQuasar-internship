  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are common&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, and aggregated tau&#xD;
      resulting from hyperphosphorylation is a pathological feature of a group of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases known as tauopathies. The 18F-T807 (AV1451) molecular probe is a novel molecularly&#xD;
      targeted imaging agent that exhibits high affinity and good selectivity for tau.&#xD;

      In this study, 18F-T807 (AV1451) molecular probe PET/CT was used to monitor the regional&#xD;
      distribution and the degree of deposition in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and&#xD;
      compared with clinical symptoms to evaluate its value in the early differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
