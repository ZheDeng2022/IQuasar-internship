  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants are more sensitive to the side effects of general anesthesia than older children.&#xD;
      This may be associated with the incomplete maturation of organ systems effective in&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics. Regional anesthesia applications provide safe and effective analgesia by&#xD;
      reducing the need for opioids. Regional anesthesia applications in infants require experience&#xD;
      and complication rates due to central blocks are high. However, in recent years, the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound (USG) has increased the use of safe and effective trunk blocks. There are studies&#xD;
      on the use of Transversus Abdominis Plan Block (TAPB) and Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB) in&#xD;
      children. However, there is no comparative study on its use in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we aimed to compare the effects of TAPB and QLB on postoperative pain score and&#xD;
      analgesic consumption in infants who underwent unilateral inguinal hernia surgery.&#xD;

    <description>In the group in which Transversus Abdominis Plan Block was applied, the patient was placed in the supine position. After skin antisepsis was achieved with 10% povidone iodine, the USG probe was placed transversely between the iliac crest and the anterolateral abdominal wall. After visualizing the external-internal obliq and transversus abdominis muscles, 0.5 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected after negative aspiration by advancing the needle into the fascia between the internal obliq muscle and the transversus abdominis muscle with the in-plane technique.</description>

    <description>In the Quadratus Lumborum Block (Lateral approach) group, the patient was placed in the lateral position with the side to be blocked on top. After skin antisepsis was achieved with 10% povidone iodine, the USG probe was placed transversely between the iliac crest and costa edge. After visualizing the extarnal-internal obliq and transversus abdominis muscles, the probe was advanced posteriorly. Quadratus lumborum muscle and thoracolumbar fascia were visualized. The needle was advanced to the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle with the in-plane technique and 0.5 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected after negative aspiration.</description>

    <description>The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block was first introduced by Rafi et al. in 2001 as a landmark-guided technique via the triangle of Petit to achieve a field block. It involves the injection of a local anesthetic solution into a plane between the internal oblique muscle and transversus abdominis muscle. Since the thoracolumbar nerves originating from the T6 to L1 spinal roots run into this plane and supply sensory nerves to the anterolateral abdominal wall , the local anesthetic spread in this plane can block the neural afferents and provide analgesia to the anterolateral abdominal wall.</description>
