      To reduce the burden of TB worldwide through more accurate, faster, simpler, and less&#xD;
      expensive diagnosis of TB Every year, more than 3 million people with TB remain undiagnosed&#xD;
      and 1 million die. Better diagnostics are essential to reducing the enormous burden of TB&#xD;
      worldwide. The Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB Network (R2D2 TB Network)&#xD;
      brings together experts in TB care, technology assessment, diagnostics development,&#xD;
      laboratory medicine, epidemiology, health economics and mathematical modeling with highly&#xD;
      experienced clinical study sites in 10 countries&#xD;

      The Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB Network (R2D2 TB Network) study seeks to&#xD;
      identify and rigorously assess promising early stage tuberculosis (TB) triage, diagnostic and&#xD;
      drug resistance tests (hereafter referred to as &quot;novel tests&quot;) in clinical studies conducted&#xD;
      in settings of intended use. Rapid diagnosis, identification of drug resistance and effective&#xD;
      treatment are critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing TB transmission. However,&#xD;
      analysis of care cascades and prevalence surveys indicate that 40-60% of patients with TB are&#xD;
      not initiated on effective treatment.1,2 The different types of tests required to reduce this&#xD;
      &quot;diagnostic gap&quot; have been described in the form of target product profiles (TPPs). The&#xD;
      highest- priority TPPs are for: 1) a point-of-care, non-sputum biomarker-based test to&#xD;
      facilitate rapid TB diagnosis using easily accessible samples (a biomarker-based diagnostic&#xD;
      test) and 2) a simple, low-cost test that can be used by front-line health workers to&#xD;
      rule-out TB (a triage test). The R2D2 TB Network study will evaluate the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of novel triage and diagnostic tests against a reference standard including&#xD;
      sputum/urine Gene Xpert® MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/Rifampin) Ultra and sputum&#xD;
      mycobacterial culture. The sensitivity and specificity of rapid drug susceptibility tests&#xD;
      (rDST) will be compared against a reference standard including culture-based phenotypic DST&#xD;
      and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of mycobacterial DNA. In addition, the usability of novel&#xD;
      tests will be assessed through direct observations and surveys of routine health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel TB triage, diagnostic and drug resistance tests that the investigators currently&#xD;
      plan to evaluate are shown in Table 1. The countries/study sites in which each novel test&#xD;
      will be evaluated are shown in Table 2. This master study protocol will be updated to include&#xD;
      additional novel tests as they are identified or to remove novel tests when their evaluation&#xD;
      is complete. Additional prototype TB triage, diagnostic and drug resistance tests, including&#xD;
      assays that address multiple pathogens in parallel with TB will be evaluated in subsequent&#xD;
      project years.&#xD;
