    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-69095897&#xD;
      versus placebo and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) of JNJ-69095897 in blood, plasma,&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine after single oral dose administration (ascending dose&#xD;
      levels) in healthy participants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise, healthy based on physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead Electrocardiography (ECG) (means of triplicate ECG, inclusive, QT corrected&#xD;
             according to Fridericia's formula [QTcF] less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 millisecond&#xD;
             [msec] for males and &lt;= 470 msec for females) performed at screening and admission to&#xD;
             the clinical unit. Minor abnormalities in ECG, which are not considered to be of&#xD;
             clinical significance by the investigator, are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise, healthy based on clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the&#xD;
             results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes, hematology, or&#xD;
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included at&#xD;
             the discretion of the investigator, provided the investigator judges the abnormalities&#xD;
             to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram/meter square&#xD;
             (kg/m^2) inclusive (BMI=weight/height^2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions&#xD;
             specified in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;

             understands the purpose of, and procedures required for the study and is willing to&#xD;
             participate in the study. Participation in the pharmacogenomic part of the study is&#xD;
             mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, liver or renal insufficiency,&#xD;
             significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances. or any other&#xD;
             illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis or suspicions of any sleep disorder in the last 6 months or current&#xD;
             complaints of sleep disturbance, irregular sleep schedule or shift work; habitual&#xD;
             daytime naps; travel across time zones in the last 4 weeks or daytime symptoms&#xD;
             attributable to unsatisfactory sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of or current major or clinically relevant psychiatric disorder as&#xD;
             classified according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th&#xD;
             edition) (DSM-5) (example, mood, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorder et cetra)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a clinically significant acute illness within 7 days prior to study&#xD;
             intervention administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous&#xD;
             and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or&#xD;
             malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the&#xD;
             sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
