  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple Sclerosis (MS), storage and voiding symptoms are well described. Urodynamic&#xD;
      patterns underlying storage symptoms are clearly defined, but the assessment of voiding phase&#xD;
      in neurological diseases is a sensitive topic. The international continence society (ICS)&#xD;
      recommended performing pressure flow studies to assess voiding phase. Assessments of&#xD;
      sphincter relaxation and detrusor contractility during voiding phase are tough aims to&#xD;
      achieve. Indeed, there is no consensus for the detrusor contractility assessment on women or&#xD;
      on patients with neurogenic bladder. Similarly, assessment of sphincter during bladder&#xD;
      filling and during the voiding phase is not included in ICS recommendations. In the end, it&#xD;
      is the physicians who conclude from the non-formalized urodynamic data if there is a DSD or&#xD;
      detrusor underactivity. In MS patients undergoing urodynamics, studies reported 43% DSD and&#xD;
      12% impaired contractility. These data should be interpreted with caution due to the&#xD;
      variability of the assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to describe the voiding phase of MS patients with standardized urodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation and parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study was conducted in a neuro-urology department of a French&#xD;
      university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the MS patients consulting for a first urodynamic evaluation without urinary treatment&#xD;
      were included. Standardized urodynamic evaluation included an uroflowmetry, urethral pressure&#xD;
      profile, two pressure-flow studies. If no detrusor contractility was observed during the&#xD;
      pressure flow studies, cystometries with 100ml/min filling rate and ice water test were&#xD;
      performed. Anal sphincter activity was recorded using surface electromyography electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data (age, sex), disease course of the MS, treatments, Expanded Disability Status&#xD;
      Scale, urinary symptoms using the Urinary Symptom Profile and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom&#xD;
      Score were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of detrusor contractility, the following parameters are reported: the bladder&#xD;
      voiding efficiency; the projected isovolumetric pressure (PIP) or bladder contractility index&#xD;
      (BCI); the Watts factor. For women, the investigators presented 3 more parameters the PIP1;&#xD;
      the Valentini-besson-Nelson parameter k and an urodynamic cut-off proposed by Gammie et al.&#xD;
      for DUA. Presence of Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was reported if there were a detrusor&#xD;
      contraction concurrent with an involuntary contraction of the periurethral striated muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunctions are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) with almost all&#xD;
      the patients reporting LUT symptoms at 10 years of duration of MS.LUT dysfunctions affect one&#xD;
      patient out of ten at the time of the first neurological symptoms and negatively impact&#xD;
      patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MS, storage and voiding symptoms are well described. Urodynamic patterns underlying&#xD;
      storage symptoms are clearly defined, but the assessment of voiding phase in neurological&#xD;
      diseases is a sensitive topic. The international continence society (ICS) recommended to&#xD;
      perform pressure flow studies to assess voiding phase. In 2018, the ICS defined altered&#xD;
      sphincter function and detrusor function during pressure flow studies in neurogenic LUT&#xD;
      dysfunction. Three types of sphincter dysfunctions are reported: detrusor-sphincter&#xD;
      dyssynergia (DSD) defined as &quot;a detrusor contraction concurrent with an involuntary&#xD;
      contraction of the urethral and/or periurethral striated muscle. Occasionally flow may be&#xD;
      prevented altogether.&quot; , non-relaxing urethral sphincter as &quot;a non-relaxing, obstructing&#xD;
      urethral sphincter resulting in reduced urine flow&quot; and delayed relaxation of the urethral&#xD;
      sphincter as &quot;an impaired and hindered relaxation of the sphincter during voiding attempt&#xD;
      resulting in delay of urine flow&quot;. Regarding detrusor dysfunction during voiding phase, two&#xD;
      types are reported: Neurogenic detrusor underactivity (DUA) defined as &quot;a contraction of&#xD;
      reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or a failure to&#xD;
      achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span in the setting of a clinically&#xD;
      relevant neurologic disorder&quot;, neurogenic acontractile detrusor &quot;is one that cannot be&#xD;
      demonstrated to contract during urodynamic studies in the setting of a clinically relevant&#xD;
      neurologic lesion&quot;. In studies in MS patients undergoing urodynamic testing, this&#xD;
      classification was not used. First because these definitions are recent, secondly because&#xD;
      assessing sphincter relaxation and detrusor contractility during voiding phase are tough aims&#xD;
      to achieve. Indeed, there is no consensus for the detrusor contractility assessment on women&#xD;
      or on patients with neurogenic bladder. Similarly, assessment of sphincter during bladder&#xD;
      filling and during the voiding phase is not included in ICS recommendations. In the end, it&#xD;
      is the physicians who conclude from the non-formalized urodynamic data if there is a DSD or&#xD;
      detrusor underactivity. In MS patients undergoing urodynamics, studies reported 43% DSD and&#xD;
      12% impaired contractility. These data should be interpreted with caution due to the&#xD;
      variability of the assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to describe the voiding phase of MS patients with standardized urodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation and parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study was conducted in a neuro-urology department of a French&#xD;
      university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the MS patients consulting for a first urodynamic evaluation without urinary treatment&#xD;
      were included. Standardized urodynamic evaluation included an uroflowmetry, urethral pressure&#xD;
      profile, two pressure-flow studies. If no detrusor contractility was observed during the&#xD;
      pressure flow studies, cystometries with 100ml/min filling rate and ice water test were&#xD;
      performed in order to identify contractility of the detrusor. Anal sphincter activity was&#xD;
      recorded during the urodynamic testing using surface electromyography electrodes. Urodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation was realized in accordance with ICS recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data (age, sex), disease course of the MS, treatments, Expanded Disability Status&#xD;
      Scale (EDSS), urinary symptoms using the Urinary Symptom Profile (USP) and the Neurogenic&#xD;
      Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detrusor contractility assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of detrusor contractility on patients with neurological disease, the following&#xD;
      parameters are reported: (i) the bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) defined as a percentage&#xD;
      (BVE= (voided volume/total bladder capacity) x 100) ; (ii) the projected isovolumetric&#xD;
      pressure (PIP) or bladder contractility index (BCI) given by the formula BCI=PdetQmax + 5Qmax&#xD;
      with a strong contractility if BCI &gt;150, normal contractility if BCI of 100-150 and weak&#xD;
      contractility if BCI &lt;100 ; (iii) the Watts factor (WF) = [(Pdet + a)(vdet + b) - ab]/2Ï€&#xD;
      where Pdet is the detrusor pressure, vdet is the velocity of detrusor contraction, and a (25&#xD;
      cmH2O) and b (0.6 cm/s) are back-calculated muscle constants representing the heat of&#xD;
      shortening and the rate of energy liberation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women, the investigators presented 3 more parameters (i) the PIP1= PdetQmax + Qmax ; (ii)&#xD;
      the Valentini-besson-Nelson (VBN) parameter k (simulating detrusor force) and (iii) an&#xD;
      urodynamic cut-off proposed by Gammie et al. for DUA with PdetQmax &lt;20; Qmax &lt;15, and BVE&#xD;
      &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusions of the detrusor contractility assessment were reported. This conclusion was&#xD;
      made with a double reading of the urodynamic curves: the first assessment was made by the&#xD;
      physician who initially received the patient; a second reading of the pressure-flow studies&#xD;
      was made in blind by CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder outlet obstruction was assessed with the Bladder Obstruction outlet index (BOOI).&#xD;
      Presence of Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was reported if there were a detrusor contraction&#xD;
      concurrent with an involuntary contraction of the periurethral striated muscle.&#xD;
