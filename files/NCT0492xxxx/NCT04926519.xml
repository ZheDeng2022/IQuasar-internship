  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this project is to get a better understanding how periodontitis develop in&#xD;
      young individuals over time and identify factors that contribute to disease recurrence. The&#xD;
      investigators also want to see if Stage and Grade of the periodontal disease has a&#xD;
      significant impact on disease progression. In addition, another purpose is to identify&#xD;
      factors explaining why certain young patients with periodontitis interrupt the periodontal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the periodontal status and the degree of disease progression over 10 years for&#xD;
           young individuals with periodontitis at age &lt; 36 yrs at baseline (study 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors with a significant influence on periodontitis progression for young&#xD;
           individuals with periodontitis at baseline (study 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify explanatory factors to discontinuation of periodontal treatment (study 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify bio marker and microbiological profiles in young individuals in relation to&#xD;
           stage and grade of periodontitis (study 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high patient compliance rate and effective supportive treatment to prevent periodontitis&#xD;
      progression are crucial conditions for the long-term prognosis. The identification of factors&#xD;
      influencing the compliance rate can improve the frequency of individuals following a&#xD;
      supportive care program. In addition, long-time follow-up studies of individuals with the&#xD;
      diagnosis severe periodontitis at young age are lacking as well as deeper knowledge&#xD;
      concerning risk predictors for further disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of biomarkers or microorganisms that can differentiate between different&#xD;
      stage and grade of periodontitis could make it possible to identify individuals with a high&#xD;
      risk for disease progression at an early stage.&#xD;

      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients at age &lt;36 years who were examined by a periodontist at 2 specialist clinics in&#xD;
      Periodontology (Folktandvården Stockholm) during the years 2003-2009 with the diagnoses&#xD;
      aggressive or chronic periodontitis are included in the project. The material consists of 471&#xD;
      patients. All participants are invited by mail to a clinical and radiographic examination.&#xD;
      The clinical examination includes periodontal status and microbiological sampling and samples&#xD;
      of crevicular fluid from deepened periodontal pockets &gt;6. At time of examination the&#xD;
      participants also fill in an questionnaire regarding oral hygiene habits, socio-economic&#xD;
      factors and self-percieved oral health. Baseline information is collected from dental&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title study 1: Periodontal status and disease progression after 10 years in young individuals&#xD;
      with periodontitis. A follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title study 2: Risk predictors for periodontitis progression in young individuals with&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;

      at four sites/tooth, presence of furcation involvements, mobility (degree 0-3), periodontal&#xD;
      treatment after baseline investigation (non-surgical treatment, surgical treatment,&#xD;

      if minimum of one site bleeding on probing with periodontal pocket depth &gt;6mm, Samples of&#xD;
      crevicular fluid from deepened periodontal pockets &gt;6, saliva specimens, stimulated saliva&#xD;
      collected for two minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiografic examination: panorama x-rays and six IO x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis at baseline (chronic or aggressive periodontitis) will be transformed to the&#xD;
      new periodontal classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be registered from a questionnaire at the clinical&#xD;
      investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;

      the follow-up period, frequency of supportive care during the follow-up period, oral hygiene&#xD;
      habits, subjective symptoms from the mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
