  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is an algorithm study focused on nursing care in order to prevent Central&#xD;
      Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infections in intensive care units. The algorithm prepared&#xD;
      with infection control measures related to central catheter care will be applied with&#xD;
      intensive care nurses and the effect of the algorithm on central catheter-related bloodstream&#xD;
      infections will be examined. In practice, a 20-day preliminary assessment, a three-month&#xD;
      intervention period, and a three-month post-intervention planning were made.&#xD;

      In the light of literature review and guidelines, intensive care nurses will care for central&#xD;
      catheters through an algorithm created with infection control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse-focused algorithm content to prevent central catheter-related bloodstream infections&#xD;
      Hand hygiene practice Use of personal protective equipment according to infection control&#xD;
      measures Evaluation of the catheter insertion site in terms of redness, swelling, tenderness,&#xD;
      discharge, bleeding Use of &gt;0.5% chlorhexidine solution containing 70% alcohol for skin&#xD;
      antisepsis at the catheter insertion site (if there is no chlorhexidine, povidone iodine +&#xD;
      70% alcohol solution is used) Changing the transparent, semi-permeable dressings every 5-7&#xD;
      days and gauze dressings every 48 hours for catheter dressing Catheter dressing with aseptic&#xD;
      technique Use of sterile, preservative-free saline for flushing and locking in order to&#xD;
      ensure the lumen of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aseptic conditions should be observed if the junction of the catheter and the infusion set&#xD;
      (Hub) is to be touched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping the used triple taps closed Changing IV fluid sets and connection tools at&#xD;
      appropriate times Daily assessment of CVC requirement The research will be carried out in the&#xD;
      1st, 2nd and 3rd Level Intensive Care Units of Bilecik Training and Research Hospital in&#xD;
      Bilecik, Turkey. Infection rates will be compared in the study. In the study, the date of&#xD;
      June 2021 will be taken as a preliminary assessment and training time for nurses.&#xD;
      July-September 2021 will be the intervention period of the study, and October-December 2021&#xD;
      will be the post-intervention period.&#xD;
