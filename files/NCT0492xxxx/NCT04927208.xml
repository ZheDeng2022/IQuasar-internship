  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia can be easily observed in patients with hemodialysis. However, there were few&#xD;
      studies on the precise concept and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia in patients with&#xD;
      hemodialysis. The investigators have already recognized the sarcopenia-associated mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity in patients with hemodialysis. However, intervention studies on hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients with sarcopenia have not been conducted until now. Here, The investigators aim a&#xD;
      pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined exercise and nutrition intervention&#xD;
      for sarcopenia in patients with hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study with 60 patients with hemodialysis who were diagnosed as&#xD;
      sarcopenia or frailty in our previous cohort study. Combined intervention will consist of&#xD;
      resistance exercise and nutritional supplementation for 12 weeks. The primary outcome of this&#xD;
      study is muscle mass and handgrip strength after 12 weeks' intervention. All functional&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured at 0, 12, and 24 weeks after intervention. The data will be&#xD;
      analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While feasible, inexpensive, and non radiation-exposed tools such as bioimpedance analysis&#xD;
      have been used to measure appendicular skeletal muscle mass. In addition, isokinetic strength&#xD;
      will be measured by a dynamometer for hand grip strength to evaluate sarcopenia. The main two&#xD;
      axes of treatment of conventional sarcopenia are muscle resistance exercises and protein&#xD;
      supplementation including branched chain amino acids. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm&#xD;
      the clinical effect by intervention for resistance exercise and nutritional supplementation&#xD;
      in patients with hemodialysis.&#xD;
