    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients that are severely affected by the disease COVID-19 will either&#xD;
      receive infliximab, an anti-inflammatory drug, or standard therapy. Infliximab is a drug that&#xD;
      inhibits inflammation by blocking a molecule called TNFα. The patients receive the drug via&#xD;
      an infusion into a vein. The primary goal of this trial is to see whether the drug infliximab&#xD;
      affects how many people died from COVID-19 after 28 days by comparing patients receiving the&#xD;
      drug in addition to standard therapy with patients only receiving standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this trial will look at whether the drug is safe to use in these patients,&#xD;
      whether it has an effect on the inflammation and whether it can affect how ill patients are&#xD;
      after surviving the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is conducted in more than one hospital. As COVID-19 is responsible for a global&#xD;
      pandemic, positive results of this trial could affect patients, healthcare and economic&#xD;
      systems worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research project is to develop a new pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      strategy for patients with COVID-19. Its primary aim is the assessment of efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the TNFα antibody infliximab in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 in a&#xD;
      phase-2 trial. Infliximab is expected to attenuate the inflammatory reaction in patients and&#xD;
      thereby positively influence the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the difference in 28-day-mortality of patients with severe COVID-19&#xD;
      receiving one dose of 5mg per kg body weight infliximab intravenously in addition to the&#xD;
      standard of care (intervention group) compared with patients receiving standard of care&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this trial include the assessment of the safety of the TNFα antibody&#xD;
      infliximab in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, of its effect on an excessive&#xD;
      immune response and of its effect on the morbidity and prognosis as well as the&#xD;
      characterization of the analytical cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-centre design facilitates the transferability of study results to hospitals of&#xD;
      similar healthcare level. Should infliximab prove to be superior to standard therapy, this&#xD;
      could be reflected in a reduced disease severity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study could influence the therapy of patients with COVID-19 worldwide and&#xD;
      affect the course of the disease worldwide, as infliximab is approved by several&#xD;
      international drug agencies and globally available. Due to the high incidence of COVID-19&#xD;
      worldwide and the immense effects of the pandemic on societies, health care and economic&#xD;
      systems, any progress in the treatment of this new disease would constitute a great success.&#xD;
      This would not only impact individual patients but also have positive economic effects.&#xD;
