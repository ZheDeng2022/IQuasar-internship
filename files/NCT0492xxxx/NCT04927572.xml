             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive test results for active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or HIV-2),&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Evidence or history of active, latent or inadequately treated tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;

             Investigator, are unlikely to affect the course of the AD during the study period (for&#xD;
             example stable use of antihistamines for asthma or allergies. Antibiotics, if not&#xD;
             known to impact AD disease course, may also be allowed at the discretion of the PI in&#xD;

         15. Demonstrated clinically significant (required intervention, e.g., emergency room&#xD;
             visit, epinephrine administration) allergic reactions (e.g., food, drug, or atopic&#xD;
             reactions, asthmatic episodes) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (consumption is also not permitted throughout the duration of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Any other condition or prior therapy that in the opinion of the Investigator would&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for this study, including inability to cooperate fully&#xD;
             with the requirements of the study protocol or likelihood of noncompliance with any&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
