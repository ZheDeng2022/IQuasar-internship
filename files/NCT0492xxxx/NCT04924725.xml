  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration/biopsy (FNA/B) is used to&#xD;
      collect biopsy samples from many organs throughout the digestive tract and is useful in&#xD;
      diagnosing solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs). The reported diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA for&#xD;
      SPLs is 85-89.4%, the sensitivity is 82-94.7%, and the specificity is 100%. One randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial reported that the fanning technique of FNA was superior to the standard&#xD;
      approach because fewer passes were required to establish the diagnosis. However, in many&#xD;
      cases, like SPLs with the presence of fibrosis and necrosis background, four or more needle&#xD;
      passes are still needed to obtain sufficient biopsy samples. There is a potential risk of&#xD;
      tumor seeding associated with multiple needle punctures. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      minimize the number of needle passes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CEH-EUS) using sonazoid (Daiichi-Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) is&#xD;
      useful to visualize parenchymal perfusion in the pancreas and characterize of SPLs. Because&#xD;
      the necrotic or fibrotic area within the SPLs were appeared as non-enhanced area, CEH-EUS&#xD;
      could help us to avoid puncture the non-enhancing area hence increased the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy. Katana et al. reported that conventional EUS-FNA has lower sensitivity (72.9%) for&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma with non-enhanced areas compared to with enhanced areas (94.3%) on&#xD;
      CEH-EUS. Therefore, it would be difficult to obtain sufficient biopsy samples through&#xD;
      unenhanced areas of SPLs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the study result by Katana et al., fanning technique in SPLs with avascular&#xD;
      areas had a negative impact on diagnostic accuracy of FNA. Because of the retrospective basis&#xD;
      of their study, a prospective study is warranted to answer whether CEH-EUS-guided FNA/B is&#xD;
      superior to conventional EUS-guided FNA/B with fanning technique in SPLs. The main objective&#xD;
      of this randomized trial therefore was to determine whether CEH-EUS-guided sampling to avoid&#xD;
      non-enhanced areas within a mass lesion result in more rapid diagnosis requiring fewer FNA/B&#xD;
      passes than the conventional EUS-guided FNA/B with fanning needle throughout the mass is&#xD;
      targeted.&#xD;
