    <textblock>
      In this study, 10 subjects will be underwent total knee arthroplasty with PEEK knee&#xD;
      prosthesis and be followed up 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The safety of the knee&#xD;
      prosthesis for total knee arthroplasty will be investigated based on X-ray, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, thin-section CT, hematological indexes, knee function, complications and&#xD;
      the occurrence of serious adverse events at the 12-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the involved person's biomedical research ethics review method &quot;(national health&#xD;
      and family planning commission (11)) and the medical and health institutions to carry out the&#xD;
      researchers launched a clinical research management method&quot; (draft) on request, for national&#xD;
      key development plan required for research and development production of PEEK knee prosthesis&#xD;
      for clinical trials. In this study, 10 subjects will be underwent total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      with PEEK knee prosthesis and be followed up 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The safety of&#xD;
      the knee prosthesis for total knee arthroplasty will be investigated based on X-ray, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, thin-section CT, hematological indexes, knee function, complications and&#xD;
      the occurrence of serious adverse events at the 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study is an exploratory study, all subjects will be retrospectively studied one&#xD;
      year after the end of the study.&#xD;
