    <textblock>
      The TRIUMPH study was designed to build on the existing literature by studying the efficacy&#xD;
      of tofacitinib in hospitalized patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. This trial will&#xD;
      provide evidence for a possible new indication for the use of tofacitinib.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the effectiveness (combined and endoscopic response) and safety of tofacitinib in patients with acute severe UC who experience treatment failure to steroids or anti-TNFα/anti-integrin therapies/anti-interleukin therapies. The primary outcome of this study is to assess clinical response at day 7 among patients who receive tofacitinib.
