  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VIOLA Study is a Clinical Utility Study to explore and better understand the value,&#xD;
      usage, and benefits of Melody®, a tear-based screening test for breast cancer. Melody® was&#xD;
      developed and validated by Namida Lab, Inc., a high complexity Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VIOLA Study is primarily concerned with the use of Melody®, its impact on mammography&#xD;
      screening rates, and the overall participation in the breast health continuum of care.&#xD;
      Proving Melody's® clinical utility through effective clinical outcomes, economically&#xD;
      efficient implementation, and adoptability in a workflow is crucial for incorporating the&#xD;
      Standard of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most women recognize screening mammography as the current gold standard in breast cancer&#xD;
      screening. However, disparities are present, leaving groups of women without adequate access&#xD;
      to screening. Gaps in access to screening exist due to geographic location, socio-economic&#xD;
      status, race, and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Melody® is not intended to replace screening mammograms but an additional tool to&#xD;
      facilitate more discussions between providers and patients. The goal for early iterations of&#xD;
      Melody® is one more piece of clinical information gathered, leading to additional&#xD;
      conversations about breast health.&#xD;

    <description>Melody® is a tear-based screening assay for breast cancer developed and validated by Namida Lab, Inc., a high complexity CLIA certified lab. Melody® consists of two parts: tear sample collection and clinical lab test. Melody® is a high-complexity lab-developed test for breast cancer screening.</description>

        The VIOLA Study participants are all women due to the development and validation of&#xD;
        Melody®. The objectives and endpoints encourage minorities, employee volunteers,&#xD;
        economically disadvantaged, and/or a medically underserved population to participate in the&#xD;
        VIOLA Study. The justification for involving vulnerable populations is because they are&#xD;
        primarily affected by disparities in the healthcare system. Employee volunteers are&#xD;
        included because study sites provide current medical care and have a trusted relationship&#xD;
        with the employee volunteer as a current patient.&#xD;
