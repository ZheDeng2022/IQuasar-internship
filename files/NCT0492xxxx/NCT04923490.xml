  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the pre-procedure state and trait anxiety levels of&#xD;
      adolescents patients hospitalized for the purpose of gastrointestinal endoscopy performed&#xD;
      under sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anxiety is known to be a disorder that is much more relevant for adults, it is seen&#xD;
      at a frequency of approximately 6.5% in the childhood and adolescence. Anxiety is usually&#xD;
      examined in two different forms, state anxiety and trait anxiety. A total of 180 pediatric&#xD;
      patients who underwent GIS endoscopy in our hospital were included in our study. Demographic&#xD;
      data (age, gender, height, weight, educational status, school and grade), additional diseases&#xD;
      and diagnoses were recorded. Our aim was to evaluate the anxiety and trait anxiety levels of&#xD;
      adolescents scheduled for gastrointestinal system (GIS) endoscopy under sedation, after being&#xD;
      admitted as a single-day inpatient and before the procedure. A form evaluating state and&#xD;
      trait anxiety levels (Spielberger's state and trait anxiety scale) and another form&#xD;
      consisting of demographic data were given to the patients. We requested that the forms be&#xD;
      filled by the children themselves. After monitoring in the endoscopy unit, sedation was&#xD;
      applied with IV anesthetic drugs routinely.Oxygenation was provided with nasal O2 in all&#xD;
      patients. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were&#xD;
      monitored. Also complications (bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension,&#xD;
      hypertension, bronchospasm, decrease in SpO2, apnea) were recorded.&#xD;
