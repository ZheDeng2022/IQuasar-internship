&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in either Group 1 or 2 with Group 1 being enrolled first to&#xD;
      compensate for the longer duration of vaccination period. Within each group, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either Treatment or Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 (Treatment) will receive polyvalent env (A,B,C,A/E)/gag (C) DNA&#xD;
      vaccine in one arm and polyvalent gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein vaccine mixed with GLA-SE&#xD;
      adjuvant in the other arm on Day 0 and at Months 3, 6, and 12. Participants in Group 1&#xD;
      (Control) will receive placebo on Day 0 and at Months 3, 6, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 (Treatment) will receive a mixture of polyvalent env (A,B,C,A/E)/gag&#xD;
      (C) DNA vaccine and polyvalent gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein vaccine (without GLA-SE adjuvant)&#xD;
      divided into two doses and administered into each arm on Day 0 and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 8.&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 (Control) will receive placebo on Day 0 and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits for participants in Group 1 will occur on Day 0, Week 2, Months 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5,&#xD;
      12, 12 + 1 Week, 12.5, 18, and 24. Study visits for participants in Group 2 will occur on Day&#xD;
      0, Week 2, Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 8, 8 + 1 Week, 8.5, 14, and 20. Visits may include&#xD;
