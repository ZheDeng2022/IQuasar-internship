  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators will determine the feasibility of a future trial comparing&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea control in children with ALL receiving oral 6-mercaptopurine who&#xD;
      do and do not receive problem-solving skill training. This is a novel approach to controlling&#xD;
      an important and common treatment-related symptom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a novel approach to controlling a treatment-related symptom that&#xD;
      detracts significantly from the quality of life of many patients. It will preserve and&#xD;
      enhance the patient's and family's autonomy with respect to self-care. If found to be&#xD;
      effective, this approach may be generalizable to pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy&#xD;
      other than 6-mercaptopurine and thus has the potential to improve the quality of life of many&#xD;
      children receiving cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of Bright IDEAS-CIN, adapted from the validated Bright&#xD;
      IDEAS framework to improve CIN control in children with ALL who experience nausea while&#xD;
      receiving 6-mercaptopurine. Bright IDEAS is an 8-session face-to-face intervention with a&#xD;
      caregiver. In this first session, the caregiver is taught the problem-solving framework and&#xD;
      begins working on their first self-selected problem. Sessions 2-7 involve working through&#xD;
      relevant problems, with most caregivers working through 3-4 different problems. The final&#xD;
      session summarizes the skills and discusses how to continue to use these new skills for new&#xD;
      problems instead of lapsing into old ineffective strategies. Investigators adapted Bright&#xD;
      IDEAS to meet the specific problem of CINV by adapting it to 3 sessions focused specifically&#xD;
      on CINV, including the child in the conversation when developmentally appropriate and&#xD;
      allowing the latter sessions to be conducted by phone or video-chat.&#xD;

    <description>A future trial will be feasible if&#xD;
50% of patients deemed to be eligible to participate in Phase 1 consent/assent to participate&#xD;
the recruitment into Phase 2 of 20 evaluable patients across all participating centers within 24 months of study activation of whom 80% return a completed CINV diary for at least 5 days of each 7-day data collection period. A completed CINV diary contains at least one PeNAT score and a record of the time of each vomiting episode or noting the presence/absence of vomiting daily. Evaluable patients are defined as those who have completed at least one cycle of PSST.</description>

    <description>The PSST will be delivered by a &quot;trainer&quot; in a minimum of three 30-minute to 1-hour sessions with a parent and patient (if developmentally appropriate).&#xD;
During the first session, the study team member will build rapport by understanding relevant personal background and medical information; introduce PSST and the Bright IDEAS paradigm; review the patients experience with nausea as reported in Phase 1 and at other times during treatment; promote problem-solving strategies and skills; and develop an anti-nausea action plan. During the second session, the trainer will discuss how well the prior action plan worked and reinforce successful outcomes or, if unsuccessful, return to the problem-solving steps to generate a new action plan. The third session will review progress on CINV control, assist in problem-solving as needed, and discuss how to continue to use the Bright IDEAS framework to resolve future issues with CINV or symptom management more broadly.</description>
