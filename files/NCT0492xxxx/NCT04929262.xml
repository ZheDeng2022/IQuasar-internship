  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite research identifying effective treatments for youth anxiety, parents (and other&#xD;
      primary caregivers) are unaware that some treatments are more effective than others. This&#xD;
      study investigates whether having a local parent key opinion leader co-facilitate an&#xD;
      educational outreach presentation on effective treatment for youth anxiety will increase&#xD;
      parent demand for evidence-based practices (EBPs). It is hypothesized that participants who&#xD;
      receive a presentation co-presented by a key opinion leader will be more likely to have&#xD;
      sought cognitive behavioral therapy for their child at the three-month follow up, relative to&#xD;
      participants who receive a presentation presented by two researchers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are common among adults and youth and, when left untreated, are associated&#xD;
      with several long-term negative sequelae. Although research has identified a number of EBPs&#xD;
      for treating youth anxiety (in particular, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] with exposures)&#xD;
      and despite large-scale implementation efforts, few youth receive EBPs. Direct-to-consumer&#xD;
      marketing offers a different approach to increase provider uptake of EBPs by increasing&#xD;
      parent demand for EBPs. Direct-to-consumer initiatives are especially important given&#xD;
      patient-barriers that prevent youth from receiving treatment, including lack of parental&#xD;
      knowledge of EBPs and stigma associated with mental health treatment. Although parent&#xD;
      preferences for receiving information about EBPs vary based on demographic factors and&#xD;
      individual experiences, research has not investigated methods of tailoring direct-to-&#xD;
      consumer efforts to local contexts. Involving a local parent key opinion leader (KOL) to&#xD;
      tailor direct-to- consumer initiatives to local contexts may be an effective strategy to&#xD;
      increase parent demand for EBPs. KOLs are credible and trustworthy members of a local&#xD;
      community who can use their social influence to disseminate information and validate messages&#xD;
      about EBPs. Research indicates that KOLs improve health promotion campaigns, but KOLs have&#xD;
      not been studied in the context of increasing parent demand for EBPs. The project will&#xD;
      examine the role of KOL participation in conducting outreach presentations to increase parent&#xD;
      desire to seek CBT for their youth's anxiety. Parent attendees (or primary caregivers; N =&#xD;
      180) will be cluster-randomized by school to one of two different approaches for&#xD;
      presentations on EBPs for youth anxiety (90 parents per condition). Both approaches will&#xD;
      include community outreach presentations providing information about youth anxiety, effective&#xD;
      treatments for youth anxiety, and seeking CBT for youths. The researcher-only condition will&#xD;
      be co-facilitated by two researchers. In the KOL condition, a parent KOL from each local&#xD;
      community will be involved in tailoring the content of the presentation to the context of the&#xD;
      community, co-facilitating the presentation with a researcher, and endorsing strategies in&#xD;
      the presentation that they have found to be helpful. The parent-teacher association (or a&#xD;
      similar group of parents) from each school will nominate a parent who is well-known and&#xD;
      well-respected within their community as the KOL. Parent attendees for both conditions will&#xD;
      be recruited by contacting school mental health workers/other school administrators, who will&#xD;
      advertise the presentations via their school email list and fliers sent home with children.&#xD;
      Parent attendees will complete measures assessing their knowledge of, attitudes towards, and&#xD;
      intention to seek CBT pre- and post- presentation, and they will indicate whether they sought&#xD;
      CBT for their youth at a three-month follow-up. This study will use a mixed methods approach&#xD;
      (integrating quantitative and qualitative methods) to test the effect of KOLs on increasing&#xD;
      caregiver demand for CBT for youth anxiety. Primary aims test the relative effects of&#xD;
      researcher-only and KOL conditions on changing caregivers' intention to seek CBT for their&#xD;
      youth, and actual CBT seeking at three-month follow up. Secondary aims examine (1) the&#xD;
      relative effects of researcher-only and KOL conditions on changing caregivers' perceived&#xD;
      subjective norms about seeking CBT, attitudes about CBT, stigma about mental illness, and&#xD;
      knowledge of how to seek EBPs; and (2) how KOLs affect participants' impression of the&#xD;
      researcher presenter. This study will provide future direct-to-consumer efforts with evidence&#xD;
      about effective strategies to increase parent demand for EBPs, which in turn will enable&#xD;
      parents to seek the best care for their child.&#xD;
