      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of severe developmental&#xD;
      abnormalities of the nervous system characterized by deficits in social interaction and&#xD;
      verbal and nonverbal communication affecting approximately 1% of the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 5-40% of cases, genetic factors are identified as the cause of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this unique definition and the advancement of techniques, ASD is still a clinically&#xD;
      and genetically heterogeneous condition, as several hundred genes have been identified to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous and severe developmental abnormalities of&#xD;
      the nervous system characterized by deficits affecting social interactions and verbal and&#xD;
      nonverbal communication (DSM-5, 2013), affecting approximately 1% of the general population&#xD;
      (Brugha, 2012). In 5-40% of cases, genetic factors are identified as the cause of these&#xD;
      disorders, prevalence depending on the technique used (Exome and/or SNPs Array) and the&#xD;
      associated intellectual deficit. In the majority of cases, the etiology remains unknown. The&#xD;
      familial aggregation of ASDs and the significant excess of concordant monozygotic twins over&#xD;
      dizygotic twins demonstrate the strong involvement of genetic factors in autism. Studies of&#xD;
      microdeletions/microduplications (copy number variants) or by Whole Exome Sequencing and&#xD;
      Whole Genome Sequencing (Single Nucleotide Variants) show the involvement of many genes in&#xD;
      the predisposition to autism. However, ASD remains a clinically and genetically heterogeneous&#xD;
      disorder, since several hundred genes have been identified to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our project is to allow the retrospective and prospective collection of&#xD;
      data on the phenotypic and genetic characterization of ASD patients in a structured way in&#xD;
      order to allow the development of a new dynamic in terms of research. The identification of&#xD;
      genetic factors (Delorme et al, Nature Medicine, 2013) and biological pathways involved in&#xD;
      the emergence of autistic symptoms (Bourgeron, Nature Neuroscience 2015) is fundamental. The&#xD;
      identification of biological pathways is an indispensable step for the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. In addition, a major challenge of this study is to better understand&#xD;
      the phenotype/genotype relationships in ASD. This requires the constitution of a large cohort&#xD;
      of patients taking into account their multimodal, extensive and precise exploration of&#xD;
      clinical, neuroanatomical (MRI, EEG) and biological phenotypes and to correlate them with&#xD;
      genetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work carried out by our teams and collaborators has led to the identification of numerous&#xD;
      genes associated with ASD and involved in synaptic formation and regulation: NLGN3-4 (Jamain&#xD;
      et al, Nature Genetics 2003), SHANK1-3 (Durand el al Nature Genetics 2007, Sato et al Am J&#xD;
      Hum Genet 2013, Leblond et al Plos Genetics 2013, 2014), CNTN-6 (Mercati et al Mol Psychiatry&#xD;
      2016) and CNTNAP4 (Karayannis, Nature, 2014) (for review Toro et al, TIGS 2012; Delorme et&#xD;
      al, Nature Medicine ,2013; Bourgeron, Nature Neuroscience 2015). This work was combined with&#xD;
      extensive phenotypic explorations of patients and their relatives. It has allowed us to&#xD;
      specify the neuroanatomical characteristics of the patients (Lefebvre et al. Biol Psychiatry&#xD;
      2014) and their genetic substrate (Toro et al, Mol Psychiatry 2015), but also the underlying&#xD;
      cognitive processes (Dumas et al, PNAS, 2014; Zalla et al. Cortex 2014, 2015; Grezes et al&#xD;
      Hum Brain Mapp, 2014). More recently, we have shown the existence of abnormalities in the&#xD;
      regulation of the melatonin synthesis pathway (Pagan et al, TransPsychiatry 2014; Pagan et&#xD;
      al, J pineal Res 2015) or immunological abnormalities (in particular HLA anomalies (Bennabi&#xD;
      et al, 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the population to be studied and rationale for its choice&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to explore the heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorders in a population received in&#xD;
      routine care in our evaluation units. These are patients followed in the Child and Adolescent&#xD;
      Psychiatry Department at the Robert Debré Hospital in Paris, who meet the diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      of ASD according to DSM-5, aged 0 to 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the element(s) on which the research focuses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our project is to explore the phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD. The&#xD;
      collection of data from the routine clinical evaluation of a large number of subjects will&#xD;
      allow for a better phenotypic and genetic characterization of patients in a structured manner&#xD;
      to allow for the development of a new dynamic in terms of research. We wish to carry out a&#xD;
      non-interventional, mono-centric study based on data from the evaluation of patients in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow this work we must favour:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the collection of phenotypic data of the patients evaluated in our service, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical phenotypes: standardized evaluation of phenotypes in clinical practice,&#xD;
                according to current recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neuroanatomical phenotypes: brain imaging (MRI), electrophysiology EEG,&#xD;
                Eye-Tracking,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biological phenotypes: serological, genetic of patients hospitalized in our&#xD;
                department;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the linking of these data via a database regrouping this information (or allowing them&#xD;
           to be grouped);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the development of a new dynamic in terms of translational research concerning ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creation of this cohort, based on data from the evaluation done in clinical practice,&#xD;
      will help identify biological pathways involved in autism, the development of new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies for patients and a more personalized medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the duration of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the research will be 6 years (5 years of inclusion and a maximum of 12&#xD;
      months of patient observation), renewable by possible extension of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This duration will allow the collection of data from the evaluation of approximately 300&#xD;
      patients per year (i.e. 1500 patients over the next 5 years). This study duration is&#xD;
      essential to collect a sufficient number of patients to have enough statistical power for the&#xD;
      study. Also the extensive phenotypic and genetic exploration requires - in order to be able&#xD;
      to cross-reference the data and establish relevant subgroups - to have large samples of&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
