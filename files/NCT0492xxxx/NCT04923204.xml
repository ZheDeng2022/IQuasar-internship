      Evaluation of the impact of the genetic variation of individual genes on the therapeutic&#xD;
      response and side effects profile in a cohort of well-characterized patients with bipolar&#xD;
      depression, using NEUROPHARMAGEN.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric condition characterized by mood swings between&#xD;
      (hypo)mania and depression, with a total lifetime prevalence of 2.4%. An early and effective&#xD;
      therapeutic approach is key for the patient prognosis, being the pharmacotherapy the main&#xD;
      therapeutic tool for its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment guidelines for BD include a variety of psychotropic medications, including lithium,&#xD;
      anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and combinations of these&#xD;
      medications. However, treatment response is often inadequate and poor tolerability is&#xD;
      frequently observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variability in treatment efficacy and tolerability has been shown to be influenced by several&#xD;
      factors, including the inherited genetic variation. Several meta-analyses have shown that&#xD;
      some genetic variants influence the probability of response to selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with depression. Similarly, specific genetic polymorphisms&#xD;
      have been associated with the risk of certain antipsychotic-induced adverse effects in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia. However, the impact of many these variants has not been studied&#xD;
      in the context of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEUROPHARMAGEN is a pharmacogenomic-based decision support tool that helps clinicians in the&#xD;
      selection and dosing of psychoactive drugs based on the integration of pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      information, among other patient's characteristics that influence the medication success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical utility of NEUROPHARMAGEN has been evaluated in major depression disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      through randomized clinical trials with hundreds of patients. Two small pilot trials in&#xD;
      bipolar patients have suggested a potential clinical utility of this tool in this patient&#xD;
      population. However, the output of pharmacogenomic-based tools such as NEUROPHARMAGEN is&#xD;
      based in the analysis of several genes, which could differ in their individual clinical&#xD;
      utility in a disorder-related manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, retrospective, epidemiological study includes 76 patients who attended&#xD;
      the Bipolar Disorder Program of the Psychiatry Service of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona&#xD;
      (Spain) with the aim of objectively evaluate the impact of the genetic variation in&#xD;
      individual genes on the therapeutic response and side effects profile in this cohort, using&#xD;
      NEUROPHARMAGEN.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP-M)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of enrollment (current status after end of index episode)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-BP-M is a modified version of the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder for the assessment of manic, hypomanic, depressive or mixed symptoms, long-term outcome of bipolar disorder, and the assessment of the efficacy of several treatments. It consists of three subdomains (depression, mania, and overall), each of them with scoring from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill patients).</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of enrollment (current status after end of index episode)</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D rates the clinical severity of depression. It has 17 questions, each with three to five possible answers, with scores ranging from 0 to 2 or from 0 to 4, respectively. The total score ranges from 0 to 52 and cut-off scores can be used to classify the depressive disorder.</description>

    <measure>Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of enrollment (current status after end of index episode)</time_frame>
    <description>FAST is a brief instrument designed to assess the main functioning problems experienced by psychiatric patients, particularly bipolar patients. It comprises 24 items that assess impairment or disability in six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time. All of items are rated using a 4-point scale (0 = no difficulty, 1 = mild difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty and 3 = severe difficulty). The global score is obtained by adding up the scores of each item. The higher the score, the more serious the difficulties are.</description>

The adverse events recorded were as follows: weight gain, dyslipidemia (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides), glucose, sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, seizures, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, corrected QT interval prolongation, sexual dysfunction, and hyperprolactinemia.</description>
