  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the joints, causing&#xD;
      pain, edema, physical disability and poor quality of life. In addition, RA patients are at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death. The most&#xD;
      effective pharmacological treatment is the use of biological agents that inhibit the action&#xD;
      of specific substances, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF).&#xD;
      Physical exercise is considered a first-line non-pharmacological treatment in RA, improving&#xD;
      inflammatory and metabolic profile, functional capacity, fatigue and preventing the onset of&#xD;
      CVD. There is evidence that IL-6, when secreted as a result of exercise, brings several&#xD;
      benefits. However, there is no study investigating the interaction between biological IL-6&#xD;
      blocking agents and exercise on metabolic responses, such as insulin sensitivity and glucose&#xD;
      uptake, in patients with RA. To answer this question, adult women diagnosed with RA and&#xD;
      healthy controls will be recruited for an acute session of exercise. RA patients will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups, according to the pharmacological treatment (tocilizumab or anti-TNF).&#xD;
      The acute responses of insulin sensitivity after an acute session of exercise will be&#xD;
      assessed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and the molecular pathways will be&#xD;
      assessed by muscle biopsy and gene and protein expression analysis. Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) will be performed to quantify skeletal muscle&#xD;
      glucose uptake.&#xD;
