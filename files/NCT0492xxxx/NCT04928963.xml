  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Immunosenescence is an aging-dependent phenomenon underlying age dependent&#xD;
      deterioration in the function of the immune system, characterized by a decline in B and T&#xD;
      cells with a relative increase in natural killer (NK) cells. Aging also promotes chronic&#xD;
      inflammation accompanied by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Both&#xD;
      immunosenescence and inflammation contribute to frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by age-related deterioration in multiple physiological systems resulting in&#xD;
      greater vulnerability to stressors and increased risk of poor outcomes including longer&#xD;
      hospital stays, postoperative complications, poor responses to vaccination, functional&#xD;
      decline, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pharmacological interventions could be developed to address immunosenescence,&#xD;
      inflammation and frailty, a dietary intervention that does not cause weight or muscle loss&#xD;
      may be a preferable option, particularly if it is periodic in nature and it only needs to be&#xD;
      adopted for a few weeks per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We will test the hypothesis that a newly formulated and relatively high calorie&#xD;
      fasting mimicking diet (FMD) to be administered to subjects age 65-80 once a month for 5 days&#xD;
      for two to six cycles can partially reverse immunosenescence and inflammation, thus&#xD;
      contributing to the reduction of frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: This proposal is divided into 2 main tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: We will determine whether FMD cycles in mice: a) prevent frailty syndrome onset and&#xD;
      symptoms B) delay or reverse age-related immunosenescence and inflammaging, C) improve the&#xD;
      functionality of bone marrow cells, D) enhances the response to flu vaccination. Task 2: A&#xD;
      )We will develop a special relatively high calorie FMD medical food for testing in humans, B)&#xD;
      We will test the safety and efficacy of the FMD medical food in an aged and frail individuals&#xD;
      (65-80 yr) for 2-5 day cycles preceding their annual influenza vaccination. Expected results:&#xD;
      In mice, we expect that the FMD diet will reduce the clinical signs of frailty during aging,&#xD;
      and in particular increase immune system influenza vaccine response by preventing&#xD;
      immunesenescence. We expect that the FMD will reduce phosphorylation of mTOR and of its&#xD;
      downstream targets, and induce autophagy and apoptosis in WBCs. These effects are anticipated&#xD;
      to remove damaged cells and promote the activation of hematopoietic stem cells and the&#xD;
      generation of new WBCs. We also expect that the transient increase in corticosteroids and&#xD;
      removal of damage immune cells will be accompanied by a decrease in systemic inflammation.&#xD;
      Increased performance on rotarod and other measures of frailty is also anticipated. In&#xD;
      humans, we expect that the FMD will be well tolerated by the pre-frail elderly without major&#xD;
      adverse events and that it will be possible to achieve high compliance to this diet. We also&#xD;
      anticipate that elderly undergoing the FMD protocol followed by 30 days of a normal diet plus&#xD;
      supplements will exhibit better functional status and better response to the flu vaccine as&#xD;
      compared to patients from the control arm. An improvement in handgrip strength and in lean&#xD;
      body mass, as detected by BIA, is also expected, at least in a fraction of the patients from&#xD;
      the intervention arm. Impact: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by age-related&#xD;
      deterioration in multiple physiological systems and homeostatic mechanisms, resulting in&#xD;
      greater vulnerability to stressors and increased risk of poor outcomes including longer&#xD;
      hospital stays, postoperative complications, poor responses to vaccination, functional&#xD;
      decline, and death. Thus, the identification of a dietary strategy, potentially to be applied&#xD;
      for only 10 days a year but able to rejuvenate the immune profile and function while reducing&#xD;
      systemic inflammation could have a major impact on both healthspan and health-related&#xD;
      expenses. Because older individuals are often taking multiple drugs, the dietary intervention&#xD;
      being investigated here would also reduce the potential toxicity of an additional&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase I/II randomized clinical study will be performed to assess feasibility, safety, and&#xD;
      efficacy (improvement of the response to vaccination, but also functional status improvement&#xD;
      or maintenance) of two cycles of FMD (1 week) administered 30 days apart, preceding flu&#xD;
      vaccination in pre-frail elderly subjects. The study will enrol 40 pre-frail subjects aged&#xD;
      65-80 years. Subjects will be excluded if they have known immunosuppressive disorders or&#xD;
      medications or have not received influenza vaccination in the previous two years. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A (FMD) or Arm B (regular diet). Subjects in Arm A will receive&#xD;
      the 5 day FMD diet once a month for 2 months (2 cycles completed in 40 days: 5-30-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is based on the regimen adopted in our ongoing study with younger subjects but involves&#xD;
      one less cycle to minimize weight loss, and other potential side effects in elderly subjects.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be diet safety: the side effects of the diet will be assessed by&#xD;
      weight change, headaches, blood pressure, and by closely monitoring body composition, i.e.&#xD;
      lean body mass, by bio-impedance measurements, handgrip strength and DEXA scans. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will include: i) the compliance with the FMD; ii) the improvement of&#xD;
      frailty parameters and prevention of disability in patients 65-80 years of age; iii) the&#xD;
      improvement in immune parameters after 2 cycles of the diet and will be based on measures of&#xD;
      improved T cell response, reduced inflammation, improved lymphoid/myeloid ratios and&#xD;
      HSC/pre-HSC number, improved B cell numbers and CSR; iv) the efficacy of the influenza&#xD;
      vaccine assayed by higher antibody titer levels. In addition, we will also document the&#xD;
      number of flu episodes over the course of the trial. The trial will be carried out over a&#xD;
      period of 3 years and all subjects will be vaccinated in the fall of each year with the&#xD;
      current preparation of the inactivated virus influenza vaccine (FluzoneÂ® high dose, Sanofi&#xD;
      Pasteur Inc.) at the San Martino Hospital. During the flu season each participant will&#xD;
      receive weekly reminders to call in and report any influenza like symptoms. These will&#xD;
      include respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and nasal stuffiness)&#xD;
      and systemic symptoms (headache, malaise, fatigue, fever or feverishness and muscle aches).&#xD;
      Flu-like illnesses will be documented based on the report of two respiratory symptoms or one&#xD;
      respiratory and one systemic symptom when influenza is known to be circulating in the local&#xD;
      community. A laboratory diagnosis of influenza illness will be confirmed from the results of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs for virus culture, and/or a pre- to post-illness 4-fold or greater rise&#xD;
      in antibody titer. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, after 2 diet cycles prior to&#xD;
      vaccination and at 4 weeks after vaccination. The study period for this trial will be 2-5 day&#xD;
      diet cycles (5-30-5) followed by a single flu vaccination per year. Each diet cycle will&#xD;
      consist of 5 days of FMD followed by 30 days of the subjects' usual diet plus a plant-based&#xD;
      daily protein and fat supplement (20 grams of proteins + 30 grams of olive oil and 30 grams&#xD;
      (total) of walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds). This daily supplement serves at minimizing weight&#xD;
      loss caused by the 5 day FMD. At the first visit, subjects will undergo a physical evaluation&#xD;
      to assess health and frailty status, and medical history will be noted. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the FMD arm will be given a 2 cycle supply of the diet with instructions. Before&#xD;
      receiving the second FMD cycle, patients will undergo a second physical examination at the&#xD;
      geriatrics Clinic of the University of Genoa which will include the assessment of body&#xD;
      composition and the administration of the second FMD cycle will only be allowed in the&#xD;
      absence of a decrease in lean body mass (vs. baseline) as detected by BIA, handgrip strenght&#xD;
      and by DEXA. Two weeks after completion of second diet cycle, subjects will return for&#xD;
      physical evaluation, blood collection and vaccination. The third and final visit will be 4&#xD;
      weeks following vaccination, the subjects will undergo a physical evaluation and assessment&#xD;
      of body composition and blood samples will be collected. At this visit, subjects will also be&#xD;
      instructed to call the research coordinator to report malaise, discomfort, influenza or&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. Further follow-up will be over the phone to monitor onset of influenza.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swabs for virus culture and confirmation of influenza will be collected if&#xD;
      possible within 72 hours of a subject reporting symptoms of influenza. DIET: Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the restricted diet arm (A) will be provided with all food to be consumed&#xD;
      during each of the three cycles. The exact components of the diet will depend on results&#xD;
      obtained in Task&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 but the diet is anticipated to be approximately 30% calorie restricted and 50% protein&#xD;
      restricted but supplemented with 50% of the RDA in vitamins and minerals and also&#xD;
      supplemented with both nonessential and essential amino acids identified in animal studies to&#xD;
      be effective. Amino acid supplementation levels will depend on published clinical studies&#xD;
      demonstrating safety and will not exceed the recommended daily levels. Subjects in the&#xD;
      control arm will receive dietary advice per the standard practice of the treating physician.&#xD;
      This will include consultation with a registered dietitian. A major focus will be placed on&#xD;
      ensuring that subjects do not lose weight (unless obese at baseline) nor lose lean body mass.&#xD;
      They will also be asked to maintain a diary of the food consumed and approximate amounts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VACCINATION: Subjects will be vaccinated with the standard dose of the FluzoneÂ® high dose&#xD;
      vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur Inc. for each year. This vaccine has four times the normal&#xD;
      antigen contained in the regular flu vaccine and is specially designed for individuals 60 and&#xD;
      older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Removal from Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be removed from the study if they do not receive the vaccination Subjects will&#xD;
      be removed from study if they have unacceptable toxicity related to the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be removed from study is they are unable to regain at least 95% of their body&#xD;
      weight after the first and 92% after the second cycle. Subjects will be removed from study in&#xD;
      the presence of a decrease in bioimpedance phase angle exceeding 5% of the baseline value or&#xD;
      whenever the phase angle will drop below 5Â°; or, alternatively, in those patients in which&#xD;
      bioimpedance measurements were unreliable/unattainable, in the presence of a decrease in&#xD;
      handgrip strength or in lean body mass detected by DEXA &gt;5% of the baseline value. Subjects&#xD;
      may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. STUDY OBSERVATIONS Visit&#xD;
      1: A complete medical history will be documented at the first visit at the San Martino&#xD;
      Hospital (Prof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. Odetti, MD, Prof. A. Nencioni). This will include documentation of chronic diseases and&#xD;
      any diseases that could increase risk for influenza including congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, kidney failure, neoplastic disorders&#xD;
      and immune dysfunction weight and performance status. All medications will be recorded. A&#xD;
      physical will be performed, and Body Mass Index (BMI) and body composition will be determined&#xD;
      and must be within inclusion parameters. Pre-frailty will be diagnosed in participant whether&#xD;
      one or two of Fried modified criteria for frailty will be present. A blood draw will be&#xD;
      performed. Baseline laboratory measurements will include a CBC, glucose, ketone bodies,&#xD;
      insulin, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, cytokine panel, lymphoid/myeloid ratio, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, naÃ¯ve/&#xD;
      memory T cells ratio and CD8+CD28+ T cells. To assess humoral immunity, percentages and&#xD;
      absolute numbers of CD19+ B cells, naÃ¯ve, IgM memory and switch memory B cells will be&#xD;
      assessed. Briefly, PBMC's isolated from whole blood will be enriched for CD19+ B cells using&#xD;
      anti-CD19 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech). To isolate naÃ¯ve, memory and switch memory cells,&#xD;
      CD19 cells will be sorted using a flow cytometer after staining with PE-conjugated anti-CD27,&#xD;
      biotin-SP-conjugated ChromPure human IgG, and 20 Î¼l biotin-SPconjugated ChromPure human IgA.&#xD;
      To detect CSR in vitro, CD19 B cells will be cultured with anti CD40 and IL-4 for 6-7 days.&#xD;
      AID expression in the stimulated B cells will be measured by RT-PCR. E47 expression will be&#xD;
      measured by western blot. Visit 2: Subjects will return to the clinic upon completion of one&#xD;
      cycle of the diet. The participants will be subjected to a new medical examination to&#xD;
      evaluate their physical activity, neuropsychological and to determine the frailty index. In&#xD;
      addition, they will also undergo a body composition assessment by bioimpedance measurement,&#xD;
      by DEXA scan and by handgrip strength. A blood draw will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory values will include all measurements as above to assess post-diet changes in all&#xD;
      the parameters described above. Visit 3 (two weeks after the second FMD cycle): same as in&#xD;
      visit 2. In addition, all subjects will receive a single injection of influenza vaccination.&#xD;
      Visit 4: Subjects will return at 4 weeks post vaccination, when antibody titers are expected&#xD;
      to peak. We will perform the clinical examinations and the body composition assessments&#xD;
      performed on previous visits on the participants. Laboratory measurements will be as above.&#xD;
      In addition, antibody titers in serum will be measured by the haemagglutination inhibition&#xD;
      assay. Hemagglutinin for each virus strain will be obtained from the CDC stock. 2 fold&#xD;
      dilutions of serum from 1/10 to 1/1024 will be used. Chronic agerelated muscle loss affects&#xD;
      &gt;30% of individuals over 60 and &gt;50% of individuals over 80. Insufficient protein intake in&#xD;
      the elderly may promote loss in muscle mass by preventing muscle protein synthesis. Thus,&#xD;
      bioimpedance measurements and whole body DEXA scans will be conducted in order to ensure that&#xD;
      the diet does not cause loss in muscle mass. Follow-up: The subjects enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be called every three months after the fourth visit (see above) to undergo physical and&#xD;
      psychological examinations in order to evaluate the FMD efficacy in preventing frailty,&#xD;
      reinforcing the immune system and increasing efficacy of influenza vaccine. During the&#xD;
      predicted influenza season in the local area, subjects will receive weekly phone calls from&#xD;
      the trial coordinator to document any symptoms and to remind them to call in to report&#xD;
      symptoms. If possible NP swabs will be collected within 72 hours of reporting of symptoms by&#xD;
      having the RN travel to the subjects homes. The incentive for participants to report symptoms&#xD;
      early will be access to free diagnosis and referral to the primary physician for treatment of&#xD;
      influenza illness. Non-compliance will be defined as consumption of &lt;50% of the prescribed&#xD;
      diet and/or consumption of &gt;150 kcal non-prescribed food on any of the days of the FMD.&#xD;
      Results for subjects with less than a 50% reduction in IGF-I and 40% reduction in glucose&#xD;
      compared to baseline will be analyzed (intention-to-treat) but a secondary analysis excluding&#xD;
      these patients (suspected of being non-compliant) may be performed.&#xD;
