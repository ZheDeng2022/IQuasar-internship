  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the COVID-19 pandemic completely altering the landscape of higher education, students&#xD;
      have been experiencing more stress than ever. With Harvard University's plan for students to&#xD;
      return to campus for the 2021-2022 academic year, offering an online mental health program&#xD;
      such as StriveWeekly could provide students with stress management support as they transition&#xD;
      back after 1.5 years of remote learning. This study will use a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design to test the effectiveness of a waitlist versus StriveWeekly. This study will allow us&#xD;
      to test if a program that has previously demonstrated effectiveness with university students&#xD;
      in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms will still be effective after the unprecedented&#xD;
      amount of stressors during a global pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of StriveWeekly in preventing or reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression. The use of a waitlist condition will allow us to&#xD;
      experimentally assess if the online intervention is responsible for decreasing / preventing&#xD;
      worsened anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms over time. Given the previously established&#xD;
      effectiveness of StriveWeekly as an indicated prevention program, we expect students in the&#xD;
      intervention condition to experience significantly better symptoms compared to the waitlist&#xD;
      from baseline to posttest. Alternatively, if the transition back from remote learning and/or&#xD;
      the broad pandemic context interferes with the acceptability or effectiveness of&#xD;
      StriveWeekly, then we might expect to see little to no significant differences between the&#xD;
      online intervention condition and waitlist condition from baseline to posttest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include: (a) testing moderators of intervention effectiveness and (b)&#xD;
      evaluating the intervention in terms of acceptability (e.g., feedback on program name;&#xD;
      demographically representativeness of student user sample; satisfactory adherence and&#xD;
      satisfaction rates). Exploratory moderation analyses across groups will help determine&#xD;
      whether or not the intervention condition produces unique or additive effects for students&#xD;
      with certain characteristics over and above changes demonstrated by similar students in the&#xD;
      waitlist condition. Acceptability analyses will allow for more nuanced evaluation of&#xD;
      StriveWeekly's effectiveness as a program, beyond its ability to facilitate symptom&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recruitment. Recruitment materials will be distributed via a mass email to all enrolled&#xD;
      students, announcements over house emails lists (e.g., academic departments), and social&#xD;
      media announcements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-trial needs assessment and pilot. Prior to the full RCT, we will conduct a campus-wide&#xD;
      needs assessment survey to gather information about student needs and preferences related to&#xD;
      mental health programming. Student responses will inform the specifics of StriveWeekly&#xD;
      implementation during the academic year (e.g., preferred timing of programming,&#xD;
      appropriateness of content across a diverse student population). After the needs assessment,&#xD;
      we will invite a small group of students to participate in a small pilot of the revised&#xD;
      StriveWeekly platform. Students who participate in the pilot will be invited to provide their&#xD;
      program feedback via online surveys. Students who participate in the pilot data collection&#xD;
      will still be eligible for the full RCT study, but may be excluded from the final data&#xD;
      analysis sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pragmatic trial design. For a trial design using self-guided online intervention, it is&#xD;
      important that the design mimics intended intervention use (Fleming et al., 2018). As&#xD;
      examples, overly stringent inclusion criteria limit generalizability, or face-to-face&#xD;
      assessments may provide added benefit beyond the intervention itself (Fleming et al., 2018).&#xD;
      Therefore, as much as possible our methods simulate how a real-world campus might offer&#xD;
      online services as usual. First, we are employing cluster randomization, for reasons&#xD;
      elaborated below. Second, participants in either condition will be allowed to access other&#xD;
      on- or off-campus mental health services and resources; in our statistical analyses we will&#xD;
      control for service use rather than excluding such students. Third, all data collection and&#xD;
      participant communications will be electronic rather than in-person to: (a) include all&#xD;
      students remote or on-campus, (b) avoid unintentionally bolstering motivation (e.g., inducing&#xD;
      social desirability to please researchers), and (c) avoid adding barriers (e.g., time&#xD;
      demands, concerns about privacy). Finally, survey compensation amount will be modest enough&#xD;
      to increase participant response rates without artificially inflating adherence rates or&#xD;
      self-reported improvement due to financial incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment. Cluster randomization will be used to assign students according to their&#xD;
      residential affiliation to the immediate intervention condition or the waitlist condition&#xD;
      (i.e., delayed access). Although cluster randomization can introduce statistical confounds&#xD;
      for analyzing intervention outcomes at the individual participant level, they can be&#xD;
      preferred: (a) to avoid intervention &quot;contamination&quot; effects (e.g., if participants in both&#xD;
      conditions can regularly interact and thus might exchange health-related knowledge), and (b)&#xD;
      if it allows the intervention to be delivered as it would be in real practice (Cook, Delong,&#xD;
      Murray, Vollmer, &amp; Heagerty, 2016). Moreover, the benefits of cluster randomization by&#xD;
      residential house/dorm affiliation for this trial are crucial for the social aspects of the&#xD;
      StriveWeekly program. For example, students will know who else is concurrently participating&#xD;
      in the program (e.g., any of their friends in X, Y, Z house), allowing for peer-to-peer&#xD;
      engagement. Also, this will allow for easier coordination of any optional complementary&#xD;
      programming by residential staff at each house/dorm. A randomizer was already used to assign&#xD;
      half the freshmen and upperclassman residential buildings to each condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Prior to beginning any research procedures, students will provide their&#xD;
      informed consent online via Qualtrics. Participants will be required to login to Qualtrics&#xD;
      via HarvardKey Shibboleth, which will be configured to only allow currently active Harvard&#xD;
      accounts. Once consent has been obtained for an individual student, they will be directed to&#xD;
      an online survey for the study baseline assessment. The baseline survey will be open for two&#xD;
      weeks. Students assigned to the intervention group will receive an access code in the email,&#xD;
      allowing them to access the online platform and set-up their account. The intervention group&#xD;
      will then be active for seven weeks, after which the posttest survey will open to the&#xD;
      intervention group and waitlist group for one-two weeks. Thereafter, students who were&#xD;
      assigned to the waitlist group will gain access to the online intervention for seven weeks.&#xD;
      After this delayed access group completes the intervention, there will be a follow-up survey&#xD;
      for all participants from both conditions. See timeline table below.&#xD;
