  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, Phase I/IB, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      sequential SAD/MAD/FE study, with a patients arm. The study will be divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: SAD cohorts, with food-effect (FE) evaluation Part B: MAD cohorts with healthy&#xD;
      volunteers Part C: MAD cohorts including naïve patients with mild to moderate hypertension&#xD;
      The three parts will be completed sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - SAD Cohorts 1 to 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will consist of up to 5 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include 8&#xD;
      subjects (6 subjects receiving the active study drug and 2 subjects receiving matching&#xD;
      placebo), for a total of 40 subjects. ). Efforts will be made to have gender-balanced&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule will be used for dosing of each cohort (under fasting conditions)&#xD;
      and will include 2 sentinel subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) dosed initially, and the&#xD;
      remaining 6 subjects dosed at least 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FE study will be conducted with 2 cohorts of 8 healthy participants from the SAD study.&#xD;
      Subjects from FE Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 will receive the study drug under both fasting (in a&#xD;
      first period) and fed conditions (in a second period). Participants in the fasted and fed&#xD;
      cohort will be randomized to active or placebo in a ratio of 3:1. There will be a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 14 days between dosing of the fasting and the fed periods. All subjects&#xD;
      will be dosed on the same day in the fed period. After a supervised fast of at least 10&#xD;
      hours, subjects will be served a high-fat, high-calorie meal of approximately 800 to 1000&#xD;
      calories (approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal derived from fat). This meal&#xD;
      should derive approximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and&#xD;
      fat, respectively. The meal will consist of two eggs fried in butter, two slices of toast&#xD;
      with butter, two strips of bacon, approximately 120 g of hash brown potatoes, and 200 mL of&#xD;
      whole milk. Subjects will be required to start their meal as soon as it is served and to&#xD;
      complete it in 30 minutes or less. Drug administration will occur 30 ± 1 minutes after the&#xD;
      meal has been started. No food will be allowed until at least 4 hours after dosing. Except&#xD;
      for fluids provided with the breakfast and water given with the study drug, no fluids will be&#xD;
      allowed from 1 hour before until 1 hour after dosing. Water will be provided ad libitum at&#xD;
      all other times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned SAD dose range is anticipated to be from 2 mg to 300 mg. The mode of&#xD;
      administration is oral. The doses are specified for fasted cohorts. To monitor adherence to&#xD;
      the intervention, participants will remain at the unit for the duration of dosing and&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - MAD Cohorts 6 to 9 (Healthy Volunteers):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will consist of 4 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include 8&#xD;
      subjects (6 subjects receiving the study drug and 2 subjects receiving matching placebo daily&#xD;
      for 14 consecutive days), for a total of 32 subjects. Efforts will be made to have&#xD;
      gender-balanced cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B can be initiated only following review of the safety, tolerability, and PK data&#xD;
      following dosing of the last SAD Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule might be used for the first dose level, including 2 sentinel&#xD;
      subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) initiating dosing first and the remaining 6 subjects&#xD;
      initiating dosing at least 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned MAD dose range is anticipated to be from 2 mg to 100 mg administered q.d. for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C - MAD Cohorts 10 and 11 (Patients with mild to moderate hypertension):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C will consist of 2 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will include a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 patients with mild to moderate hypertension with low cardiovascular risk (6&#xD;
      subjects receiving the study drug and 2 subjects receiving matching placebo daily for 28&#xD;
      consecutive days), for a total of 16 patients. The doses of VB0004 administered will be&#xD;
      determined by the SAD and MAD PK data.&#xD;
