  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that approximately 15% of adults aged 60 and&#xD;
      above suffer from some form of mental disorder, with one of the most common neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      disorders being depression. Similar trends are seen in Singapore where 11.4% of the older&#xD;
      adults aged 65 and above had depressive symptoms. Another population survey conducted among&#xD;
      elderly in Singapore showed that elderly with subsyndromal depression (SSD) were similar to&#xD;
      or worse than elderly with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However being a multi-ethnic Asia&#xD;
      society the mental conditions such as depression and anxiety are seen as taboo topics to be&#xD;
      discussed more so to seek help or treatment for these conditions in Singapore. Additionally&#xD;
      scarcity of trained psychiatrists and work load of these trained professionals in the acute&#xD;
      care settings make it difficult to reach these needy older adults. Hence, it is imperative to&#xD;
      support the needs of this group of community dwelling older adults to ensure that their&#xD;
      emotional wellbeing, and their condition do not progress to MDD. As such, this is the first&#xD;
      of its kind study that will evaluate the effectiveness of solution focused brief therapy&#xD;
      delivered by the lay mindfulness practitioner and the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pilot intervention is found to be feasible and effective, the large scale community&#xD;
      trial will be planned to reach to more elderly in Singapore to help them age in a dignified&#xD;
      way. In addition, other countries that do not involve lay mindfulness practitioners and&#xD;
      nurses to provide integrated personal therapy in the community may benefit from this study as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
