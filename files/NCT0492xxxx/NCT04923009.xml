      Ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) by means of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)&#xD;
      is the principal method for the treatment of PAF. Usually, PVI is confirmed by recording PV&#xD;
      potentials (PVP) from the circular catheter placed at the ostium of PV. However, newer and&#xD;
      faster methods became avialable. The only currently available technique which can visualize&#xD;
      LA anatomy on-line, is intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). It seems that ICE could replace&#xD;
      all other techniques used for LA imaging. Also, there may be no need for introducing&#xD;
      diagnostic catheters and only ablation catheter and single transseptal puncture will do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Simplified ICE-based ablation is faster and with shorter fluoroscopy time than&#xD;
      standard ablation without compromising safety and efficacy and with no significant increase&#xD;
      in costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. To compare procedural data, costs, safety and efficacy of simplified ICE-based ablation&#xD;
      versus standard RF ablation for AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This is prospective, controlled trial. Three centers will be included: center 1&#xD;
      where simplified ICE-based procedure is performed and centers 2 and 3 where standard approach&#xD;
      is used. Patients with PAF will be allocated to two approaches: (1) standard (n=45) arm&#xD;
      undergoing multi-electrode RF ablation in centers 2 and 3 and (2) the simple-ICE group (n=45)&#xD;
      undergoing RF ablation in center 1 using ablation catheter and ICE catheter only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation procedure will be performed using electro-anatomical system according to the CLOSE&#xD;
      protocol. In the simple-ICE group PVI is confirmed by lack of LA capture during pacing from&#xD;
      or up to 5 mm inside the ablation line. In the standard group both pacing from ablation line&#xD;
      and signals from the circular diagnostic electrode will be used to confirm PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one year follow-up is planned including three visits in cardiology clinics with 4-7 day&#xD;
      Holter ECG 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessed outcomes include duration of procedure, duration and dose of radiation, one-year&#xD;
      procedural efficacy, peri- and post-procedural complications and cost-efficacy&#xD;

      I. Introduction. Ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) by means of pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) is the principal method for the treatment of PAF. In the majority of centers&#xD;
      PVI is confirmed by recording PV potentials (PVP) from the circular catheter placed at the&#xD;
      ostium of PV. However, this method of confirming PVI by demonstrating conduction block has&#xD;
      been developed several years ago when techniques and operator skills in creating continuous&#xD;
      and transmural radio-frequency (RF) lesions around PV was far from optimal. Nowadays,&#xD;
      technical progress led to significant improvement in the quality of RF lesions thanks to the&#xD;
      advent of ablation electrodes with contact force (CF) measurement and computation of ablation&#xD;
      index which includes stability of electrode, impedance, CF and temperature measurements. In&#xD;
      addition, implementation of so-called CLOSE protocol and paying attention to the contiguity&#xD;
      of RF lesions further improved the outcome of ablation. Therefore, it may be speculated that&#xD;
      the time has come to give up using circular electrode to confirm PVI, especially that another&#xD;
      technique to confirm PVI has been available for a long time. This technique consists of&#xD;
      pacing from ablation electrode from the line of RF applications or slightly inside this line&#xD;
      to confirm lack of impulse conduction from PV to the left atrium (LA). In addition, lack of&#xD;
      PV signals from the tip of ablation electrode further confirms PVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another progress in AF ablation consists of the expanding usage of electro-anatomical systems&#xD;
      (EAM) and reconstructing LA chamber which enables performing procedure with minimal&#xD;
      fluoroscopy. In recent years, the usual approach consisted of reconstructing LA chamber using&#xD;
      fast electro-anatomical (FAM) technique by means of dedicated circular diagnostic electrode&#xD;
      or, more time consuming, ablation electrode [6]. Another approach consisted of pre-procedural&#xD;
      LA imaging using computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance and merging this image&#xD;
      with the electro-anatomical map. In addition, rotational angiography for LA visualization has&#xD;
      been used. However, all these methods have several limitations and drawbacks such as&#xD;
      radiation exposure, additional cost and creation of LA anatomy before rather than during the&#xD;
      ablation procedure which may not be very accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only currently available technique which can visualize LA anatomy on-line, is&#xD;
      intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). The CartoSound software provides fast and adequate&#xD;
      delineation of the LA chamber. It has been shown that ICE-based LA reconstruction may&#xD;
      slightly underestimate chamber dimensions whereas FAM overestimates LA size. Also, ICE images&#xD;
      acquired directly from the LA may improve procedural accuracy. There is no doubt that&#xD;
      training and experience in using ICE for LA reconstruction are essential for achieving good&#xD;
      quality LA maps. Thus, it seems that ICE could replace all above mentioned techniques used&#xD;
      for LA imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, ICE has been used during AF ablation for (1) performing safe and adequately&#xD;
      directed transseptal puncture, (2) assessment of electrode contact with cardiac tissue, (3)&#xD;
      choosing right spot for RF applications and (4) early detection of complications. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is very tempting to use ICE also for creating LA anatomy as this tool has already been&#xD;
      used during ablation procedures in many centers. Such an approach might reduce costs&#xD;
      associated with the usage of other imaging tools and possibly shorten procedural duration. In&#xD;
      addition, ICE can be effectively used for the LA appendage (LAA) assessment for the presence&#xD;
      of clots and, therefore, the usage of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be&#xD;
      abandoned, further reducing costs. The reduction in fluoroscopy time when using ICE is&#xD;
      obvious and has been confirmed by numerous authors. Although ICE has so many advantages, it&#xD;
      has not been routinely used in many laboratories because of the need for long training and&#xD;
      high cost of a single-use ICE probe. However, with the reduction of costs of other equipment&#xD;
      and procedure duration the ICE-based AF ablation may occur cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During AF ablation procedure a diagnostic catheter is usually introduced to the coronary&#xD;
      sinus (CS). It serves for pacing and as an anatomical marker during transseptal puncture&#xD;
      performed under fluoroscopic guidance. In many centers second diagnostic electrode is&#xD;
      introduced to the His bundle area, also as an anatomical marker facilitating transseptal&#xD;
      puncture. However, when using ICE, the CS and His catheters are not needed because the&#xD;
      interatrial septum is elegantly visualized by ICE. Diagnostic catheters are also used for&#xD;
      exclusion of other arrhythmias and for urgent pacing if bradycardia or asystole occur during&#xD;
      ablation, however, this can be also accomplished by pacing from ablation catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last element of AF ablation which underwent changes during recent years, is the number of&#xD;
      transseptal punctures. Routinely, a double transseptal access has been used for many years in&#xD;
      the majority of centers which enables keeping both ablation and circular catheter in the LA&#xD;
      throughout the whole procedure and recording continuously progress in PVI. However, having in&#xD;
      mind the above described progress in the quality of RF lesions around PVI it may be&#xD;
      speculated that nowadays the use of diagnostic circular catheter may be not necessary and a&#xD;
      single transseptal puncture will do. Even if an operator prefers for some reasons to confirm&#xD;
      PVI using diagnostic circular catheter, second transseptal access is not mandatory because&#xD;
      ablation electrode may be exchanged by diagnostic catheter after completing PVI using the&#xD;
      same transseptal sheath. Single transseptal approach further decreases costs and safety of&#xD;
      the procedure in terms of avoiding second puncture of the interatrial septum and potential&#xD;
      thrombo-embolic risk associated with long lasting presence of the second electrode in the LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it may be speculated that after over 20 years of performing RF ablation for AF&#xD;
      operator's experience and technical progress allow for simplification of the procedure,&#xD;
      leading to further reduction in ablation duration, fluoroscopy time and costs without&#xD;
      compromising safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hypothesis. Simplified ICE-based ablation is faster and with shorter fluoroscopy time&#xD;
      than standard ablation without compromising safety and efficacy and with no significant&#xD;
      increase in costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Aim To compare procedural data, costs, safety and efficacy of simplified ICE-based&#xD;
      ablation versus standard RF ablation for AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Methods. This is prospective, controlled trial. Three centers will be included: center 1&#xD;
      where simplified ICE-based procedure is performed and centers 2 and 3 where standard approach&#xD;
      is used. In order to avoid inter-operator differences, all procedures are performed by the&#xD;
      same two skilled operators and using the same ablation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients - consecutive subjects undergoing first ablation for PAF will be included and&#xD;
           allocated into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The standard group consists of consecutive patients from centers 2 and 3 undergoing&#xD;
                first RF point-by-point ablation of PAF with the use of ablation electrode&#xD;
                (Navistar SmartTouch), diagnostic circular catheter (LASSO navigational catheter or&#xD;
                Pentaray catheter), diagnostic 10 pole CS catheter (Boston or Hagmed) and&#xD;
                diagnostic 4-pole His catheter (Boston or Hagmed). In this group one transseptal&#xD;
                puncture is performed using transseptal sheath (Abbott) and transseptal&#xD;
                Brockenbrough needle (Abbott) under fluoroscopic guidance. The LA chamber and PV&#xD;
                ostia will be reconstructed using the CARTO-3 electro-anatomical system and LASSO&#xD;
                or Pentaray catheters. The PV ostia will be marked based on anatomy reconstructed&#xD;
                by EAM, fluoroscopy and parameters derived from ablation electrode like impedance,&#xD;
                tactile and contact force feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The simple-ICE group consists of consecutive patients undergoing first&#xD;
                point-by-point RF ablation for PAF in center 1 using ablation catheter (Navistar&#xD;
                SmartTouch) and ICE catheter (Acunav, ). Access to LA is achieved using the same&#xD;
                equipment but only under ICE guidance. The LA chamber is reconstructed and PV ostia&#xD;
                are marked using the Cartosound System. The fragments of LA which are not clearly&#xD;
                visible in ICE will be reconstructed using the ablation catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ablation procedure. The RF point-by-point ablation is performed according to the CLOSE&#xD;
           protocol with modified size of ablation dots which are reduced from 3 mm to 2 mm in&#xD;
           order to enhance accuracy and contiguity of RF lesions. The PV are isolated in pairs&#xD;
           (first right PV and then left PV) without delivering applications between the&#xD;
           ipsilateral PV unless no PVI is achieved after completion the ablation line around PV.&#xD;
           The ablation index settings are &gt; 450 at anterior wall and &gt; 350 at posterior wall. In&#xD;
           the simple-ICE group PVI is confirmed by lack of LA capture during pacing from or up to&#xD;
           5 mm inside the ablation line. In the standard group both pacing from ablation line and&#xD;
           signals from the circular diagnostic electrode will be used to confirm PVI. The pacing&#xD;
           parameters are: contact force &gt; 4 gram, pacing rate faster &gt; 40% than sinus rate, pulse&#xD;
           width of 10 miliAmper and pulse duration of 2 miliseconds. If conduction from PV to LA&#xD;
           is present, additional RF applications along ablation line at these sites are performed&#xD;
           and line between ipsilateral PV is designed until complete PV is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up. A one year follow-up is planned. Three visits in cardiology clinics with 4-7&#xD;
           day Holter ECG are scheduled 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. If a patient was on&#xD;
           antiarrhythmic medication before ablation, it will be continued for three months and&#xD;
           stopped at the 3-month visit if possible. Two definitions of ablation efficacy will be&#xD;
           used: (i) clinical efficacy - no recurrence of symptomatic AF and (ii) ECG-based&#xD;
           efficacy - no symptomatic AF recurrence, no AF &gt; 30 sec during control Holter ECG&#xD;
           monitoring or need for higher than pre-ablation doses of antiarrhythmic drug or starting&#xD;
           new antiarrhythmic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcomes. The main outcomes of the study include duration of procedure, duration and&#xD;
           dose of radiation, one-year procedural efficacy assessed using two definitions, peri-&#xD;
           and post-procedural complications and cost-efficacy analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample calculation Based on the assumption that procedure duration in the standard group&#xD;
           is 220 minutes (mean time in centers 2 and 3 in 2020), in the ICE-based group is&#xD;
           predicted to be shortened to 180 minutes, and that these goals will be achieved in 50%&#xD;
           of standard group patients and 80% of the ICE-based group, the final calculated&#xD;
           population will consist of 90 patients (45 subjects in each group). With 45 control&#xD;
           patients and 45 ICE-group patients, there will be a 82% chance of detecting a&#xD;
           significant difference at a two-sided 0.05 significance level. The study will last three&#xD;
           years: two years up to recruitment of the last patient and third year to complete&#xD;
           follow-up of the last patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RF point-by-point PVI using ablation and ICE catheters only will be significantly&#xD;
      shorter, with less fluoroscopy time and less equipment usage than standard approach. This&#xD;
      will be achieved without compromising safety, efficacy and costs of the procedure.&#xD;
