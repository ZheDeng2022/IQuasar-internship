  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introducing restrictions on human contact has been effective in preventing the uncontrolled&#xD;
      spread of COVID-19, however, it appears to have negatively impacted mental health.&#xD;
      Psychological problems in different age groups occur with different intensity and duration of&#xD;
      the pandemic. This study was aimed to assess the impact of introducing distance learning&#xD;
      (e-Learning) on the stress levels and mental well-being among Slovak Students.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Socially isolated young people, condemned to constant contact with the Internet, find&#xD;
      themselves in sorrowful situations where their basic need were impossible. Previous studies&#xD;
      report that university students report high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, which&#xD;
      affects student motivation and attitudes toward learning; however, to date, no such studies&#xD;
      have been conducted on a population of Slovakian Students. This study considered 4 Slovak&#xD;
      universities. Using standardized questionnaires, students' mental status during e-Learning&#xD;
      was assessed at the beginning of the summer semester (February, March 2021).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS-10 is widely used for measuring psychological distress. It contains 10 questions on a five-point scale from 0 to 4. The higher the score, the greater the feeling of stress.</description>

    <measure>BDI</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a tool used to determine the degree of intensity of depressive symp-toms. The 21-item questionnaire consists of two parts: emotional and somatic. Depending on the number of points obtained, the severity of depression can be assessed. A range of 0-10 points indicates no depression, 11-27 indicates moderate mood disorder, and 28 indicates major depressive disorder. The cutoff for dividing patients into depressive and non-depressive subgroups was a score of 10, following the guidelines given by Beck et al.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Authors survey</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The survey contains five sections on the impact of e-learning on various aspects of life. The survey responses were structured on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 refers to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; statement and 5 to &quot;definitely agree&quot;. Questions were grouped into areas: Social life (3 questions), Education skills (4 questions), Eco-nomic field (2 questions), Nutrition habits and drugs (2 questions). The questionnaire showed satisfactory reliability with a Cronbach alpha of 0.82.</description>
