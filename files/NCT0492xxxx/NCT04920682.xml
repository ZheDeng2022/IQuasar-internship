      The administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibiting agents (such as neostigmine) has been&#xD;
      used to reverse the muscle paralysis induced by non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      agents. It is not well known whether there is a difference between the time required for&#xD;
      complete reversion of moderate neuromuscular blockade (NMB) after the administration of&#xD;
      neostigmine in usual doses when compared to the reversion of superficial NMB with the use of&#xD;
      a reduced dose of the same agent (excessive doses of neostigmine administered during&#xD;
      superficial blocks may cause paradoxical muscle weakness). The aim of the present study will&#xD;
      be to compare, by means of a prospective, randomized, controlled and double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial, the times necessary for the reversion of moderate block with neostigmine 60 mcg / kg&#xD;
      or for superficial block to reach values of T4 / T1&gt; 0.9 using neostigmine 30 mcg / kg.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION One of the most frequent events after performing general anesthesia is the&#xD;
      incomplete recovery from NMB. 1 Unfortunately, in addition to the unpleasant and unwanted&#xD;
      sensation, post-operative residual muscle weakness can generate potentially more serious&#xD;
      problems such as difficulty swallowing, airway obstruction, the occurrence of hypoxemia and&#xD;
      pulmonary aspiration. 2,3 Hence, the importance of ensuring a complete reversal of&#xD;
      non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents before extubation. Traditionally, the&#xD;
      administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibiting agents (such as neostigmine) has been used&#xD;
      to reverse the muscle paralysis induced by the use of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      agents, but there are limitations related to the antagonism of deep neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      4,5 or the occurrence of paradoxical effect, when excessive doses of neostigmine are&#xD;
      administered during superficial blocks, causing muscle weakness 6,7. In view of this&#xD;
      scenario, the need for quantitative assessment of neuromuscular monitoring through the&#xD;
      stimulation of peripheral nerves is widely recognized to evaluate NMB reversal.3 During deep&#xD;
      NMB [Train-of-Four (TOF) = 0 ; Post-Tetanic Count (PTC)&gt; 1], the administration of&#xD;
      neostigmine is likely to be inefficient and its administration is not indicated. In these&#xD;
      cases, it would be more prudent to wait for the spontaneous regression of the NMB to less&#xD;
      intense levels, when the action of neostigmine becomes more effective and safer.1 Even so,&#xD;
      when there is light neuromuscular block (TOF = 4; T4 / T1&gt; 0.4), the use of lower doses of&#xD;
      neostigmine should be considered, as there is a risk of inducing paradoxical muscle weakness.&#xD;
      9 It is not well known whether there is a difference between the time required for complete&#xD;
      reversion of moderate NMB after the administration of neostigmine in usual doses when&#xD;
      compared to the reversion of superficial NMB with the use of a reduced dose of the same&#xD;
      agent. The aim of the present study will be to compare, by means of a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled and double-blind clinical trial, the times necessary for the reversion&#xD;
      of TOF = 3 (moderate block) to T4 / T1 values&gt; 0.9 (with neostigmine 60 mcg / kg) or for T4 /&#xD;
      T1&gt; 0.4 (superficial block) to reach values of T4 / T1&gt; 0.9 (with neostigmine 30 mcg / kg).&#xD;
      In addition, the times required for the reversion of TOF = 3 to T4 / T1&gt; 0.4 and TOF = 3 to&#xD;
      T4 / T1 = 1 will be evaluated, in addition to the probability of reversing the NMB in less&#xD;
      than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by the Research Ethics Committee of School of Medical and Health Sciences,&#xD;
      Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (Sorocaba, São Paulo - Brazil), patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anesthesia for nose and ear surgery at Hospital Santa Lucina will be&#xD;
      enrolled to this prospective and randomized clinical trial. Patients aged between 18 and 65&#xD;
      years and physical status according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II&#xD;
      will be included. The exclusion criteria will be: (i) refusal to participate in the study;&#xD;
      (ii) presence of kidney, liver or neuromuscular disease; (iii) contraindication to the use of&#xD;
      any of the drugs used in the study or (iv) body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into four groups according to the moment of NMB reversal and the doses of&#xD;
      neostigmine and atropine that will be administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group M (reversion with moderate NMB): administration of neostigmine 60 mcg/kg and&#xD;
           atropine 30 mcg/kg when TOF (Train-of-Four) = 3 and saline when TOF (T4 / T1)&gt; 0.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group S (reversion with superficial NMB): administration of 0.9% saline solution (SF)&#xD;
           when TOF = 3 and neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15 mcg/kg when TOF (T4 / T1)&gt; 0.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group N (two-step reversal): neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15 mcg/kg when TOF = 3&#xD;
           and neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15 mcg/kg when TOF (T4 / T1)&gt; 0.4 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (control): administration of 0.9% saline solution (SF) when TOF = 3 and when TOF&#xD;
           (T4 / T1)&gt; 0.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, an opaque envelope will be prepared, sealed and numbered sequentially&#xD;
      containing the group to which the patient will be allocated. A list of random numbers&#xD;
      generated by computer (www.random.org), in blocks of 1: 1: 1: 1, will be used for this&#xD;
      purpose. No collaborator in the operating room, surgeon or anesthesiologist involved in the&#xD;
      control of anesthesia and data collection will be aware of the content of the solutions&#xD;
      (neostigmine with atropine or saline). An anesthesiologist not involved in the study will be&#xD;
      responsible for preparing the solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  solution 1 (administered when TOF = 3) - neostigmine 60 mcg/kg and atropine 30 mcg/kg&#xD;
           diluted with SF until 20 mL (group M); neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15 mcg/kg&#xD;
           diluted with SF to 20 mL (group N) or 0.9% SF 20 mL (group S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  solution 2 (administered when T4 / T1&gt; 0.4) - neostigmine 30 mcg/kg and atropine 15&#xD;
           mcg/kg diluted with SF until 20 mL (group M or N) or SF 0.9% 20 mL (group S)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sequence Anesthesia No patient will receive pre-anesthetic medication. After filling&#xD;
      out the consent form and arrival at into the operating room, standard American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists monitors will be applied. A venous access will be obtained in an upper limb&#xD;
      contralateral to the NMB monitoring. After pre-oxygenation, anesthesia induction will be&#xD;
      performed with 0.5 mcg/kg/min remifentanil for 3 minutes followed by propofol bolus (2.0&#xD;
      mg/kg) and cisatracurium 0.10 mg/kg. Maintenance will be performed with remifentanil (0.3&#xD;
      mcg/ kg/min) and propofol (4 to 6 mg/kg/h). Tracheal intubation will be performed when T1 was&#xD;
      less than 5%. The ideal weight will be used to calculate the dose of cisatracurium and&#xD;
      neostigmine. Ventilation will be controlled, with the tidal volume and respiratory rate&#xD;
      adjusted to maintain PETCO2 between 30 and 40 mmHg. When an inadequate anesthesia plan is&#xD;
      suspected (movement, sweating, tachycardia, increase in blood pressure&gt; 10% of pre-induction&#xD;
      values), the rate of propofol infusion will be increased and if the adequacy is not&#xD;
      sufficient, the rate of infusion of remifentanil. Patients who have a systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      decrease greater than 30% or heart rate less than 50 bpm will be treated with ephedrine (10&#xD;
      mg) and atropine (0.5 mg), respectively. Hydration will be performed with 0.9% saline (500 ml&#xD;
      in the first 30 minutes and 2 ml / kg / h in the following hours). The central temperature&#xD;
      will be maintained above 35 degrees Celsius and the peripheral temperature (tenar eminence of&#xD;
      the monitored palm) above 32 degrees Celsius. The reversal of the NMB will be performed when&#xD;
      TOF = 3 and / or T4 / T1&gt; 0.4 through the administration of the previously prepared solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of neuromuscular block The NMB will be monitored by the acceleromyography method&#xD;
      (TOF Watch; Schering-Plow) as recommended for use in clinical research. 10 The acceleration&#xD;
      transducer will be fixed on the volar side in the distal phalanx of the thumb. The venous&#xD;
      access and the BP cuff will be positioned on the arm opposite the limb used to monitor the&#xD;
      NMB. After cleaning the skin along the path of the ulnar nerve in the forearm, the electrodes&#xD;
      will be positioned at the height of the wrist with a distance between 3 to 6 cm between them.&#xD;
      Calibration will be performed after automatically after a 50 Hz tetanic stimulus for 5&#xD;
      seconds. The stimulation (TOF 2 Hz 1.5 seconds, supramaximal stimuli, square wave and&#xD;
      duration of 0.2 msec) will be applied every 15 seconds for 2 minutes before the&#xD;
      administration of cisatracurium. No additional doses of neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
      administered. As soon as the third response to TOF is obtained, solution number 1 will be&#xD;
      administered and the times between the administration of cisatracurium and TOF = 3 and until&#xD;
      this value reaches T4 / T1 = 0.4 will be recorded. At this point, the second solution will be&#xD;
      administered and the time until the value of the T4 / T1 ratio reaches a value equal to 0.9&#xD;
      will also be recorded. T1&gt; 0.9. Secondary outcomes will be considered, the probability of&#xD;
      reversing the NMB in less than 10 minutes and the time required for the reversion of the&#xD;
      moderate NMB (TOF = 3) to T4 / T1 = 1. The sample size will be based on a previous study that&#xD;
      determined the need for 12 patients per group to detect with a power of 90% and alpha error&#xD;
      of 5% a difference between groups equal to or greater than 1.3 standard deviations.11&#xD;
      Considering the possible losses, 60 patients will be randomized.&#xD;
