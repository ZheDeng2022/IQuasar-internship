  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders are the most common mental health disorders in&#xD;
      childhood and adolescence. A parenting intervention for youth with anxiety, called Supportive&#xD;
      Parenting of Anxious Childhood Emotions (&quot;SPACE&quot;), has been recently developed to help target&#xD;
      anxiety in children. In this intervention, therapists meet individually with parents to help&#xD;
      them reduce anxiety behaviors in their children and support adaptive behaviors in their&#xD;
      children. The purpose for the proposed study is to demonstrate the treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      SPACE compared to a low-contact, therapist-supported bibliotherapy version of this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders are the most common mental health disorders in&#xD;
      childhood and adolescence. Parental accommodation of their children's avoidance, escape,&#xD;
      safety behaviors are a set of parenting behaviors that have been most strongly associated&#xD;
      with child anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Developing and testing parent-led&#xD;
      interventions that target accommodation and parenting styles associated with anxiety has the&#xD;
      potential to improve treatment outcomes and reach families who may not otherwise access care&#xD;
      (for example, for youth who refuse to attend therapy). A parenting intervention for youth&#xD;
      with anxiety has been recently developed to address these goals called Supportive Parenting&#xD;
      of Anxious Childhood Emotions (&quot;SPACE&quot;). In this intervention, therapists meet individually&#xD;
      with parents to help them reduce accommodation and support adaptive behaviors in their&#xD;
      children. SPACE was recently shown to be non-inferior to individual cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy with 88% of youth being classified as responders to SPACE. The purpose for the&#xD;
      proposed study is to demonstrate the treatment efficacy of SPACE compared to a low-contact,&#xD;
      therapist-supported bibliotherapy version of this intervention, providing efficacy evidence&#xD;
      for SPACE as delivered by an independent investigatory group.&#xD;

             score of 12 or higher on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is appropriate for anxiety-focused treatment (e.g., anxiety is the primary&#xD;
             problem as diagnosed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS), and if&#xD;
             secondary psychopathology is present it will not interfere with treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One parent/guardian is able and willing to participate in assessment and treatment&#xD;
             (e.g., has sufficient English fluency, the decisional capacity to participate, and can&#xD;
             commit to treatment duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participating parent/guardian lives with their child at least 50% of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both parent and child are able to read and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is able to communicate verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must reside in Texas and parents must be in the state of Texas when&#xD;
             taking calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child has a diagnosis of child lifetime bipolar disorder, drug of alcohol abuse,&#xD;
             intellectual or developmental disability, psychotic disorder, or conduct disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child has severe, current suicidal/homicidal ideation and/or self-injury requiring&#xD;
             medical intervention (referrals will be made for appropriate clinical intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child is receiving concurrent evidence-based psychotherapy for anxiety, involving&#xD;
             exposure therapy in at least 50% of sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child has initiated or changed dosage of psychotropic medications within 4 weeks&#xD;
             before study enrollment OR stimulant or benzodiazepine medications within 2 weeks&#xD;
             before study enrollment. If appropriate, the child may be enrolled in the study once&#xD;
             medication dosage has stabilized (i.e., 4 weeks for psychotropic medication or 2 weeks&#xD;
             for stimulant/benzodiazepine medication).&#xD;
