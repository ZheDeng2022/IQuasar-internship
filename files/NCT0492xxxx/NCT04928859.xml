      A retrospective case-control study was conducted. Patients who admitted to the burn ward and&#xD;
      needed fluid resuscitation during the period of January 2011 to December 2018 in our unit&#xD;
      were identified. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of burns,&#xD;
      the patients with a 20%&lt;TBSA≤50% constituted the moderate and severe burn group, the patients&#xD;
      with a TBSA&gt;50% constituted the severest burn group, and then the patients who used albumin&#xD;
      for resuscitation constituted the albumin group, the patients who did not use albumin&#xD;
      constituted the control group. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      included hospital stay, ventilator supporting, fluid use, and complications.&#xD;
