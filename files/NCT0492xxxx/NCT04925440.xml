      A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of 8&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study, designed to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness &amp; safety of Bifidobacterium longum 1714® strain in people with low&#xD;
      mood. The 8-week intervention study will be conducted in 168 adults, aged ≥18 to ≤70 years,&#xD;
      who experience low mood, and experience mild or moderate depression, according to the Beck's&#xD;
      Depression Inventory II (Total score 14-28). The study will consist of 4 visits over a 10&#xD;
      week period commencing with a screening visit. The second visit will be the baseline (start&#xD;
      of intervention - either active or placebo), followed by third (mid-intervention), fourth&#xD;
      (end of treatment). Questionnaires will be administered from the first to the fifth visit and&#xD;
      safety and research bloods will be collected at each visit throughout the trial.&#xD;
