      Meningitis is one of the most common central nervous system (CNS) infections encountered in&#xD;
      infants and children. The source of infection in meningitis can be bacterial, viral, fungal,&#xD;
      or parasitic in origin . Bacterial meningitis is a paediatric emergency with high mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity rate. Hence it must be diagnosed and treated promptly. But the similar clinical&#xD;
      presentation often makes it difficult to differentiate bacterial and non-bacterial&#xD;
      aetiologies in children .&#xD;

      Meningitis is one of the most common central nervous system (CNS) infections encountered in&#xD;
      infants and children. The source of infection in meningitis can be bacterial, viral, fungal,&#xD;
      or parasitic in origin . Bacterial meningitis is a paediatric emergency with high mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity rate. Hence it must be diagnosed and treated promptly. But the similar clinical&#xD;
      presentation often makes it difficult to differentiate bacterial and non-bacterial&#xD;
      aetiologies in children .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has been considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      diagnosing bacterial meningitis, along with biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and&#xD;
      white blood cell count (WBC) . However, clinical criteria, gram staining, and bacterial&#xD;
      antigen testing of CSF as well as the classic biological markers in blood (CRP, WBC, and&#xD;
      neutrophil count) or CSF (protein level, glucose level, WBC, and neutrophil count) used alone&#xD;
      do not offer 100% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing bacterial and non-bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis .Moreover, two or more days of waiting is required to identify bacterial growth in&#xD;
      CSF cultures Procalcitonin, a 116-amino-acid peptide, which undergoes posttranslational&#xD;
      proteolysis into calcitonin, is synthesized in C cells of the thyroid gland and secreted from&#xD;
      leukocytes of the peripheral blood. The level of PCT increases (without an increase in&#xD;
      calcitonin level) in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and cytokines that are&#xD;
      associated with severe bacterial infections . In contrast to this, there is minimal rise of&#xD;
      PCT in patients infected with viruses . Moreover, there is dramatic and quick increase in&#xD;
      serum PCT levels after a single endotoxin injection . This type of response to a bacterial&#xD;
      stimulus makes PCT level a potentially sensitive marker of severe bacterial infections&#xD;
      including meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intensive research for new and rapid diagnostic methods for differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      meningitis, serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been demonstrated to be the best marker for&#xD;
      diagnosis of sepsis that also correlates with the extent and severity of microbial invasion .&#xD;
      Procalcitonin is now considered to be clinically most useful and superior to CRP due to its&#xD;
      high diagnostic accuracy in various infectious pathologies, including sepsis, acute&#xD;
      infectious endocarditis, and pancreatitis .Several studies have demonstrated the raised&#xD;
      values of serum PCT in bacterial infections including meningitis . Studies from adults have&#xD;
      shown PCT as a powerful diagnostic test for the assessment of suspected meningitis, allowing&#xD;
      rapid differentiation between bacterial and non-bacterial (mostly viral) aetiologies, and&#xD;
      earlier initiation of appropriate and necessary therapies. The evidence suggests that while&#xD;
      serum PCT offers a similar specificity to the traditionally used CSF markers of meningitis,&#xD;
      it also confers a higher sensitivity allowing for a more accurate overall diagnosis in&#xD;
      patients with suspected meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a little studies on the role of serum procalcitonin in the diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      of acute bacterial meningitis in children&#xD;
