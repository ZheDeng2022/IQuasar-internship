    <description>The primary outcome of this study was the mean postpartum maternal anxiety level (mean ± SD) of the mothers at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after delivery. Maternal anxiety level was assessed using the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale. The scale comprises 51 items and 4 sub-dimensions. It means that those who score 73 and below on the scale have low postpartum anxiety levels, those who score between 74 and 100 have a medium level, and those who score 101 and above have a high level of anxiety.</description>

    <description>The other main outcome of the study was the mean breastfeeding self-efficacy level (mean ± SD) measured with the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale Short Form. The scale is likert type and a total score between 14 and 70 is taken from the scale. The higher the score, the higher the breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The mothers in the video-conferencing group were counseled via video-conferencing a total of six times (three times a week, at equal intervals) during the first 2 weeks after birth. Each interview was approximately 15-20 minutes. In video-conferencing sessions, the breastfeeding position, the mother's grasping the breast, the baby's latch-on, and sucking duration were observed. Mothers' questions were answered and solutions were offered for breastfeeding problems (sore nipple, engorgement, etc.).</description>
