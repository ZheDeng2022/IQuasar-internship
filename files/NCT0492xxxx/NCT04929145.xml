    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Map and benchmark the gut microbiome of patients with RRMS, and PPMS versus matched&#xD;
           healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether RRMS or PPMS have a unique bias for a gut microbiome classification&#xD;
           recently characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Search for relationship with inflammation, amino acid plasma levels, heart rate&#xD;
           variability (vagus nerve tone) and hair cortisol as a biological marker of chronic&#xD;
           stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine whether the gut microbiome is different in MS patients during a relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine whether the gut microbiome remains stable after 3 months&#xD;

      This study is a prospective multi-center cohort study (University Hospital Brussels, National&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Center Melsbroek). This is an exploratory study and there is no specific&#xD;
      outcome on which a power calculation can be made. We will include different subgroups of&#xD;
      patients with MS: stable non-benign RRMS, PPMS, benign MS [Benign MS is defined as RRMS with&#xD;
      an EDSS â‰¤ 3, 15 years after disease onset], RRMS during a relapse (before the administration&#xD;
      of corticosteroids) [Relapses are defined as the development of new or recurrent neurologic&#xD;
      symptoms not associated with fever or infection or change in medication, lasting at least 24&#xD;
      hours, and accompanied by new, objective neurologic findings]. Age and sex matched healthy&#xD;
      controls will be included as well. All participants will provide a faecal, hair, and blood&#xD;
      sample twice (baseline and after 3 months). Patients will be assessed clinically at baseline,&#xD;
      3 months after baseline, and approximately 1, 2, 4.5 years after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study have the potential to identify novel simple strategies to&#xD;
      strengthen or alter the microbiome ecosystem and strengthen the overall treatment process. In&#xD;
      case of a positive result, this would form the basis for a follow-up study on medical&#xD;
      modulation of the microbiome with the aim of finding new treatment options for MS.&#xD;

    <description>Sustained disability worsening will be assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-Plus outcome. This is a composite measure that assesses disability worsening based on changes of the EDSS score (difference of at least 1.5;1.0;0.5 depending on baseline score), the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) score (&gt;=20%), and the 9-hole peg test (9-HPT) score (&gt;=20%). If worsening of any of these measures occurred, the patient has clinically deteriorated according to the EDSS-Plus outcome.</description>

    <description>No intervention will be administered. Stool, hair, and blood samples will be collected at baseline and three months post baseline. Clinical follow-up will occur at year 1, 2, and 4.5 (neurological consultation) and in-between visits (regular follow-up).</description>

      Fecal specimens from patients will be collected with standard kits and frozen for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample of 10 ml will be drawn from a peripheral vein for the analysis of IL-1beta and&#xD;
      Il-17 (proinflammatory cytokines) and and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine), and a range of&#xD;
      amino acids (released by the gut) through HPLC. A serum sample will be deep frozen for&#xD;
      further analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some hair will be cut at the vertex posterior, close to the skull. A number of 5-10 hairs,&#xD;
      corresponding to 5 mg, will be collected and stored in a cool place.&#xD;
