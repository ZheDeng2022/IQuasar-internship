  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. In Malaysia, NCDs&#xD;
      account for 67% of premature mortality, and over 70% of disease burden in 2014. In 2016, NCDs&#xD;
      were responsible for 71% of the 57 million deaths globally. An estimated 78% of all NCD&#xD;
      deaths and 85% of premature adult NCD deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. In&#xD;
      Malaysia, NCDs contribute to 71% of premature deaths. According to the Malaysian Burden of&#xD;
      Disease and Injury Study (2009-2014), cardiovascular and circulatory diseases contributed to&#xD;
      34.8% of deaths. Data from NHMS 2015 showed an increasing trend for diabetes and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia but a plateau trend for hypertension. The prevalence of diabetes was&#xD;
      from 11.2% (2011) to 13.4% (2015), hypertension from 32.7% (2011) to 30.3% (2015) and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia from 35.1% (2011) to 47.7% (2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of NCDs has increased substantially over the years. Information from the Global&#xD;
      Burden of Disease Study suggests that the biggest contributor amongst the modifiable&#xD;
      behavioural risk factors is unhealthy eating. The exposure to an unhealthy diet occurs&#xD;
      throughout the lifespan of an individual and accumulates over his/her lifetime. With the&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of diabetes and the high prevalence of hypertension and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia, it is unlikely that Malaysia will be able to achieve target 3.4 of the&#xD;
      United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (of reducing premature mortality due to NCDs).&#xD;
      At the current trajectory, it is also unlikely for Malaysia to reach the nine voluntary&#xD;
      global targets for the prevention and control of NCDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to reduce exposure to NCD risk factors amongst Malaysians. There are&#xD;
      evidences that medical nutrition therapy using nutritional supplements are recommended to&#xD;
      treat NCDs. Nutritional supplements contain biologically active ingredients associated with&#xD;
      physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus . Natural nutraceuticals were a&#xD;
      preferable treatment method that has been accepted by consumers and appeared to be generally&#xD;
      safe . Among the nutritional supplements used in controlling chronic diseases is the&#xD;
      utilisation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatty acids (FA) are hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group at one end and a methyl group&#xD;
      at the other. The carboxyl group is reactive and readily forms ester links with alcohol&#xD;
      groups, for example, those on glycerol or cholesterol, in turn, forming acylglycerols (e.g.:&#xD;
      triacylglycerols, phospholipids) and cholesterol esters. They have a variable-length carbon&#xD;
      chain and can be categorised based on the degree of saturation of their carbon chains.&#xD;
      Saturated fatty acids (SFA) possess the maximal number of hydrogen atoms, while&#xD;
      monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have one double bond. Fatty acids with double bonds in the&#xD;
      hydrocarbon chain are referred to as unsaturated fatty acids; a fatty acid with 2 or more&#xD;
      double bonds is called polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The number of carbon atoms in the&#xD;
      chain is denoted by a shorthand nomenclature and the position of the first double bond&#xD;
      relative to the methyl (called n) carbon. PUFA can be further subdivided based on the&#xD;
      location of the first double bond relative to the methyl terminus of the chain. For example,&#xD;
      omega-3 (Ω-3) and omega-6 (Ω-6) FAs are two of the most biologically significant PUFA classes&#xD;
      and have their first double bond on either the third or sixth carbon from the chain terminus,&#xD;
      respectively . Long-chain Ω-3 and Ω-6 PUFA are synthesised from the essential FAs (EFAs)&#xD;
      alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), respectively. EFAs cannot be made by the&#xD;
      human body and must be obtained through dietary sources. However, animals and humans have the&#xD;
      capacity to metabolise EFAs to long-chain derivatives through multiple elongation and&#xD;
      desaturation steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high amount of ALA can be found in many nuts . Some Peruvian species that contain this&#xD;
      compound in a high percentage is the Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia Volubilis L.). Sacha Inchi is a&#xD;
      plant of the Euphorbiaceous family, which grows in the Amazonian forest. The plant, widely&#xD;
      cultivated in Peru, has been a component of various native tribal groups of the region. The&#xD;
      seeds of Sacha Inchi are of great interest because they contain approximately, on average,&#xD;
      48% oil and 27% proteins. Sacha Inchi seeds have a unique fatty acid composition containing a&#xD;
      large amount of unsaturated fatty acids (about 85% polyunsaturation), comprised of&#xD;
      approximately 51% linolenic acid (Ω-3) and 34% linoleic acid (Ω-6) . This Peruvian species&#xD;
      has been classified as an edible oil with the highest proportion of unsaturated fatty acids7.&#xD;
      The oil from Sacha Inchi also contains a high content of gamma- &amp; ∂-tocopherols, it is,&#xD;
      despite its high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which in turns makes it comparably&#xD;
      stable against oxidation. Several in vivo studies have proven that Sacha Inchi can be&#xD;
      exquisitely digested. Traditionally, the oil has been used in the preparation of various&#xD;
      meals, the seeds are roasted and the leaves are cooked &amp; consumed. SI seeds are also used as&#xD;
      a traditional remedy in the Amazon region to treat rheumatic problems and aching muscles .&#xD;
      Sacha Inchi oil (SIO) has also been identified as an important source of the healthy Ω-3 and&#xD;
      Ω-6 linoleic acyl groups, which are beneficial in controlling cardiometabolic syndrome namely&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and hypertension, showing a hypocholesterolaemic effect when used as&#xD;
      food supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature suggests that Ω-3 and Ω-6 must co-exist or taken in the ratio of 1:1, which is the&#xD;
      closest during evolution of humans in order to be beneficial for human health. Common fish&#xD;
      oil and nuts have the Ω-3 to Ω-6 variation of 5-13:1 and 1:4-16 respectively. Ω-6 or linoleic&#xD;
      acid are not favourable to be ingested in such a tilted ratio as it increases low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein oxidation and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Clinical studies on high&#xD;
      Ω-6/Ω-3 ratio found that when the ratio decreases, the platelet aggregation; the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism of atherosclerosis also decreases. A lower Ω-6/Ω-3 ratio also has been found to&#xD;
      decrease vascular endothelial growth factor. Too high amount of Ω-6 also inhibits&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid incorporation from dietary Ω-3 supplements in human subjects.&#xD;
      Throughout a variety of nuts and fishes, Sacha Inchi oil has a 1:1.25 Ω-6 to Ω-3 ratio,&#xD;
      approaching the closest of ideal ratio of 1:1. The ideal ratio as demonstrated, could be of&#xD;
      relevance to both neurodevelopment and the prevention of neurodegeneration. A target of 1:1&#xD;
      to 2:1 has appeared to be consistent with studies on evolutionary aspects of diet,&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, and genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are the most common form of&#xD;
      NCDs in Malaysia. Prescription of standard and long term medical regimen has long been&#xD;
      implemented in managing the illnesses. There is a need to search for some potential&#xD;
      complementary medicine to combat 3Hs. The use of Sacha Inchi oil as part of the dietary&#xD;
      regimen, or alternative medicine to alleviate the disease progression is the novel research&#xD;
      focus among the scientific communities. With the aforementioned, this randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded human clinical trial is aimed to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      12 weeks supplementation of Sacha Inchi oil, a natural blend of polyunsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      among the 3Hs patients. Secondary outcomes include the assessment of vascular implication&#xD;
      biomarkers, inflammatory markers, nutritional status, quality of life, mental health, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability.&#xD;
