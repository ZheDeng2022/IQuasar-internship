  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 2000s, the incidence of bacterial STIs increases, mainly among men who have sex&#xD;
      with men but also among heterosexual men and women with multiple sexual partners. A partner&#xD;
      notification (PN) approach could break transmission chains and curb STI epidemics. PN brings&#xD;
      together a set of interventions to help people diagnosed with STIs to inform their partners,&#xD;
      encourage them to get tested, so that they can access treatment or prevention. A PN approach,&#xD;
      systematically offered at STI diagnosis, has not yet been implemented in France and needs to&#xD;
      be evaluated. In 2018, the Conseil National du Sida (French National AIDS Council) stated in&#xD;
      favor of a formalized PN approach, particularly in testing centers, which carry out a large&#xD;
      part of STI diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our research project is to build interventions facilitating information, testing&#xD;
      and treatment of partners of people diagnosed with STIs in testing centers and sexual health&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: A cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the PN practices of people diagnosed with an STI in testing centers and sexual&#xD;
      health clinics without any intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the profiles of people diagnosed with an STI in testing centers or sexual&#xD;
           health clinics and therefore likely to receive an intervention to help them notify their&#xD;
           partners;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the profiles of people notified by their partners and who attend testing&#xD;
           centers or sexual health clinics for STI testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the notification received by these notified partners and identify the&#xD;
           facilitators of testing use following notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: A qualitative study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the acceptability of testing center staff for an STI notification program in&#xD;
           general and discuss the feasibility of interventions pre-identified by a literature&#xD;
           review;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a collaborative (researchers and staffs) approach, to adapt these interventions to&#xD;
           (1) the testing centers working and (2) the needs of their users identified in the&#xD;
           cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first step in implementation of a PN program as part of a comprehensive&#xD;
      management of STI diagnoses in France.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: A cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional study conducted in testing centers and sexual health clinics (6 centers, 6&#xD;
      months of enrollment), targeting two populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People aged 18 years or more diagnosed for at least one STI: the index patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People aged 18 years or more attending the same centers for STI testing after being&#xD;
           notified by a sexual partner: the notified partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on 3 online self-administered questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire, the same for index patients and notified partners, collecting&#xD;
           socio-demographic profile, health care and testing use, STI history and sexual behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire for index patient on spontaneous PN practices of index patients one&#xD;
           month after STI diagnosis, including types of partners notified, methods used to notify,&#xD;
           and reasons for not notifying partners (this questionnaire will be sent one month after&#xD;
           STI diagnosis to give participants the time to inform their partners);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire for notified partner on their experience of PN, such as the type of&#xD;
           notifying partner, the methods and information transmitted during notification, their&#xD;
           feelings and what led them to get testing after being notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A notified partner diagnosed with an STI will receive also the questionnaire on spontaneous&#xD;
      practices of index patients at M1. This will allow us to observe whether people who had&#xD;
      already been notified for an STI are more likely to notify their partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: A qualitative study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus-groups of 6-8 volunteers involved in STI testing in testing centers and sexual health&#xD;
      clinics will be conducted based on an interview guide. Doctors and other staffs will be&#xD;
      interviewed separately.&#xD;
