    <textblock>
      There are few clinical trials of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      stage of locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The &quot;phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      of efficacy and safety of immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced HPV (-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&quot; carried out by our team&#xD;
      will be an active exploration of the application of immunodrugs in the neoadjuvant stage of&#xD;
      newly treated patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
