      We recruited 116 patients with idiopathic PD who were from the Neurology clinic of the Second&#xD;
      Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine from January 2014 to November&#xD;
      2014. Perform videofluroscopic swallowing study and psychiatric and neurological evaluations&#xD;
      and followed up after 6 years.&#xD;

      In baseline, 116 patients with idiopathic PD were recruited from the Neurology Clinic of the&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine according to the United&#xD;
      Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. They were admitted from January&#xD;
      2014 to November 2014, and were followed up after 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform psychiatric and neurological evaluations. And use Videofluoroscopic swallowing study&#xD;
      (VFSS) to assess the swallowing function of PD patients. Added 200mg of barium sulfate to&#xD;
      286ml water to achieve a concentration of 60%. Add a thickener (Ourdiet Swallow, Ourdiet&#xD;
      Biotech Co. Ltd, Guangzhou, China) to prepare juice and pudding viscosities, No thickener was&#xD;
      added to the liquid viscosity. The patients were advised to have boluses of 3, 5 and 10 ml of&#xD;
      the liquid, juice, pudding viscosities in sequence according to the clinician's instructions&#xD;
      under X-ray fluoroscopy. The patients ware sitting or standing, The lateral view of the&#xD;
      patients' swallow was recorded by a camera (30 frames per second). The radiologist, the&#xD;
      clinician, and the rehabilitation therapist completed this examination. Two person analyzed&#xD;
      the video in slow motion and frame - by - frame, and record abnormal results. The VFSS&#xD;
      inspection parameters are Penetration/aspiration score and Residue score. In order to reduce&#xD;
      the influence of drugs on dysphagia, all patients were in the off - period. The patients&#xD;
      stopped taking anti-Parkinson's disease drugs from 9 o'clock the night before the&#xD;
      examination, and were tested in the morning (free of medicine for more than 12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients had completed the above tests in 2014 and were asked to perform the above&#xD;
      assessments again.&#xD;
