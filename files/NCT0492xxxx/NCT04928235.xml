    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to determine how providing physicians with a quantitative&#xD;
      measure of skin surface temperature influences diagnoses and diagnostic confidence in&#xD;
      potential cellulitis cases when added to the standard evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous literature estimates the emergency department misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis&#xD;
      exceeds 30% due to conditions which can mimic cellulitis (termed pseudocellulitis). These&#xD;
      diagnostic errors are associated with an estimated $195 to $515 million dollars in avoidable&#xD;
      healthcare spending each year. Objective skin surface temperature measurement, obtained via&#xD;
      thermal imaging cameras, has been proposed as a diagnostic adjunct that may reduce diagnostic&#xD;
      error in cases of suspected cellulitis. One recent study, identified that the maximum&#xD;
      affected skin temperature in cellulitis is significantly higher than in pseudocellulitis, and&#xD;
      the temperature gradient between affected and unaffected sites in patients with cellulitis is&#xD;
      significantly higher than in patients with pseudocellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the study is to determine how providing physicians with a quantifiable&#xD;
      measure of skin surface temperature information influences diagnoses and diagnostic&#xD;
      confidence in potential cellulitis cases when added to standard physical exam techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aims of the study are to :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To characterize the temperature difference between affected and unaffected&#xD;
      limbs in patients with cellulitis in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To characterize the temperature difference between cases of cellulitis and&#xD;
      pseudocellulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine how quantifying temperature gradients changes diagnostic&#xD;
      confidence and accuracy when added to the standard diagnostic evaluation for potential&#xD;
      cellulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively enroll a maximum of 560 patients with non-traumatic&#xD;
      lower extremity dermatologic complaints with visible erythema (potential cellulitis) in the&#xD;
      University of Wisconsin Emergency Department. A thermal image and a photograph of the&#xD;
      affected and the unaffected limbs will be taken.&#xD;
