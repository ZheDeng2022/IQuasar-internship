  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RTXM83-AC-01-11 study evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes in relation to the use of&#xD;
      Vivaxxia during 6 treatment cycles (at the investigator's discretion, up to 8 treatment&#xD;
      cycles could be administered), followed by 9 months of follow-up. , this follow-up time being&#xD;
      sufficient for the analysis of non-inferiority in relation to the reference medicine.&#xD;
      However, data on late events of efficacy and safety are of great value to contribute to a&#xD;
      robust clinical response and to strengthen confidence in the use of biosimilar medicines. For&#xD;
      this reason, Libbs Farmacêutica proposes this retrospective observational study to collect&#xD;
      data on late outcomes of the pivotal study that directed the approval of the biosimilar&#xD;
      rituximab (Vivaxxia) from the research participants from Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present retrospective observational study LB2002 will sub-analyze selected results of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety from study RTXM83-AC-01-11 in participants over 18 years of age&#xD;
      randomized in Brazil, totaling 28 participants, in addition to evaluating late efficacy and&#xD;
      safety outcomes. Information on subsequent treatment / protocol should also be collected for&#xD;
      participants who have progressive or recurrent disease, instituted by research centers under&#xD;
      these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal is to compare descriptively the selected outcomes of efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      these participants with the same outcomes selected for the global population in the&#xD;
      RTXM83-AC-01-11 study, and also provide late safety and effective data important for&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic processes.&#xD;

      Evaluate research participants who were refractory to treatment, defined as not having&#xD;
      achieved: Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), after 6 treatment cycles in study&#xD;
      RTXM83-AC-01-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the participants who had a recurrence of the disease, defined as a change from:&#xD;
      Complete Response (CR), after 06 treatment cycles in study RTXM83-AC-01-11, to: Progressive&#xD;
      Disease (PD) until the date of consent (ICF) in the LB2002 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the subsequent treatment / protocol instituted by the research center for&#xD;
      progressive or recurrent disease will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIOD OF ANALYSIS OF THIS CLINICAL STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  01-JUL-2013 (beginning of the study) to 17-JUL-2017 (data in which the last participant&#xD;
           of the study RTXM83-AC-01-11 arrived at the last follow-up visit at 9 months after the&#xD;
           last dose of treatment): for sub-analysis of efficacy and safety proposed by study&#xD;
           RTXM83-AC-01-11: SLE, TRG and EA, and for exploratory evaluation of refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from randomization in study RTXM83-AC-01-11 to consent data (TCLE) in study LB2002:&#xD;
           for analysis of SLP, SG and for exploratory evaluation of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of the final visit of study RTXM83-AC-01-11, considered as FUP3, until the date of&#xD;
           consent (ICF) in study LB2002: for the evaluation of late AEs of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collect:For the subanalysis evaluations, the data that have already been collected will&#xD;
      be used and are part of the study database RTXM83-AC-01-11. This database will also be&#xD;
      considered for exploratory assessment of refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For late evaluations of safety and efficacy (late adverse events of interest, SLP, SG and&#xD;
      disease recurrence) and also data on the subsequent treatment / protocol instituted by the&#xD;
      research center for progressive disease or disease recurrence, data from medical records&#xD;
      available at research centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all the data necessary to evaluate the objectives established in this study will be&#xD;
      imputed in a single Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) developed exclusively for this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
