      This is an open-label, phase I-II dose-escalation and expansion study designed to define the&#xD;
      recommended dose of brigatinib as monotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+&#xD;
      ALCL, IMT or other solid tumors and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), (long-term)&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy of brigatinib in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 part will be a dose escalation part using a rolling-6 design, aiming to accrue a&#xD;
      minimum of 6 and a maximum of 18 evaluable patients in two dose-levels (and minus 1), at&#xD;
      least 2/3 of included patients will be ≤18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will be the tumor cohort expansion part of the study to further evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and clinical activity/efficacy of brigatinib as monotherapy in two&#xD;
      tumor-specific cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B1: ALK+ IMT Planned sample size for Phase 2 is 12 patients with IMT. Patients&#xD;
           who are included in the monotherapy Phase 1 IMT dose-escalation portion of the study&#xD;
           will be included in the expansion cohort analysis if they receive the RP2D, and will&#xD;
           count towards the total sample size of 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B2: ALK+ ALCL Planned sample size for Phase 2 is 22 patients with ALCL. Patients&#xD;
           who are included in the monotherapy Phase 1 ALCL dose-escalation portion of the study&#xD;
           will be included in the expansion cohort analysis if they receive the RP2D, and will&#xD;
           count towards the total sample size of 22 patients.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be 1 and &lt; 26 years of age at the time of enrollment, and able to&#xD;
             swallow brigatinib tablets at the time of enrollment, with a minimum weight of 10 kg.&#xD;
             Note: for phase 1 only patients ≤18 years old will be eligible, A liquid formulation&#xD;
             for children with a weight lower than 10 kg or for those that cannot swallow tablets&#xD;
             is in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of cancer histologically at baseline. In&#xD;
             patients where a repeat biopsy at relapse (or moment of refractory disease) is&#xD;

             needs to be available for central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients are required to provide prior results showing an activating ALK aberration in&#xD;
             the tumor per local laboratory results, and material needs to be available for central&#xD;
             laboratory confirmation of ALK status. For ALK+ ALCL, detection of ALK with&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) is sufficient for inclusion, all others require molecular&#xD;
             evidence of a ALK fusion gene or mutation by FISH, PCR or NGS. ALK detection will be&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with ALCL must be relapsed/refractory or intolerant to standard&#xD;
                  therapies. Refractory disease for ALCL is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  included, as well as metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with other solid tumors (excluding IMT) must have relapsed or refractory&#xD;
                  disease.&#xD;
