      HS-10296-306 is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Aumolertinib plus chemotherapy versus Aumolertinib alone as first-line&#xD;
      treatment in locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with&#xD;
      sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRm+). Eligible patients are&#xD;
      randomized to receive either Aumolertinib (110 mg orally, once daily) in combination with&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy (every 3 weeks for 4~6 cycles) or Aumolertinib (110 mg orally,&#xD;
      once daily) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

                  and requirements.&#xD;

                  12. Any severe and uncontrolled ocular disease that may, in the ophthalmologist's&#xD;
