    <textblock>
      This is an observational case-control study which enroll metastatic and non-metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel blood&#xD;
      multi-marker test for the detection of relapse in colorectal cancer patients. This test is&#xD;
      based on whole-blood transcriptomic signatures and circulating tumor methylated DNA markers.&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled into 4 study groups, two cross-sectional and two longitudinal&#xD;
      groups, to follow up patients up to 36 months from primary tumor resection.&#xD;
