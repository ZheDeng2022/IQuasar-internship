  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that THC alters the immunogenome in a cell&#xD;
      type-specific fashion and alters cytokine production via epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and&#xD;
      that these alterations differ between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected host genomes.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that THC alters the immunogenome in a cell&#xD;
      type-specific fashion and alters cytokine production via epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and&#xD;
      that these alterations differ between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected host genomes. To test&#xD;
      these hypotheses, the investigators propose defining the epigenomic and transcriptomic&#xD;
      alterations at single cell resolution in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by administering&#xD;
      THC to humans with and without HIV infection. The THC-associated epigenomic/transcriptomic&#xD;
      alterations will be linked to genomic variants to understand the causal effects of THC&#xD;
      response in immune cells.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Gene Expression Alteration</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected to measure changes in gene expression altered by THC before study drug infusion (THC or placebo) and at 70, 140, and 300 minutes after study drug infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Quantity of each gene is measured via sequence transcriptome, and significant differences of quantified gene pre- and post-THC infusion will be identified as THC-induced gene expression alteration.</description>

    <description>Cytokine profile will be measured using Luminex Performance Human Cytokine Discovery panel before and after study drug infusion. The 45 cytokines selected based on their established role in immune functioning are: CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1a, CCL4/MIP-1b, CCL5/RANTES, CCL11/Eotaxin, CCL19/MIP-3b, CCL20/MIP-3a, TNFSF5, CX3CL1/Fractalkine, CXCL1/GROa, CXCL2/GROb, CXCL10/IP-10, EGF, FGF2, FLT3L, G-CSF, GM-CSF, Granzyme B, IFN-a2, IFN-b, IFN-g, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-33, PD-L1, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, TGF-a, TNF-a, TNFSF10, VEGF.</description>

    <measure>Perceptual Alterations</measure>
    <time_frame>Perceptual alterations will be measured before study drug infusion (THC or placebo) and 70, 140, and 300 minutes after study drug infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptual alterations will be measured using scales such as the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS), a scale consisting of 19 self-report items and 8 clinician-rated items (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely) that we have shown to be sensitive to THC effects. The scale captures alterations in environmental/time/body perception, feelings of unreality, and memory impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cannabis Subjective Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Cannabis subjective effects will be measured before study drug infusion (THC or placebo) and 70, 140, and 300 minutes after study drug infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Various feeling states associated with cannabis intoxication will be measured using a self-reported visual analog scale of feeling states (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;calm and relaxed&quot;, and &quot;tired&quot;) associated with cannabis effects. Subjects will be asked to score the perceived intensity of these feeling states at that moment on a 100 mm line (0 = not at all, 100 = extremely). These data will be captured to validate that the experiment is relevant to cannabis effects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cannabinoid Relevant Molecules</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood will be collected before study drug (THC or placebo) infusion and at 70, 140, and 300 minutes after study drug infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be sampled for cannabinoid relevant molecules before and after study drug infusion. Cannabinoid relevant molecules will include THC and THC-COOH levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CogState Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>CogState will be administered prior to study drug administration (THC or placebo) at again 30-60 minutes after study drug administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Memory, attention, and executive function will be measured before and after study drug administration using the CogState Cognitive battery.</description>
