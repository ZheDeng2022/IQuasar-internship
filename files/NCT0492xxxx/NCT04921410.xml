    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive clinical and biomechanical screening&#xD;
      of high school, collegiate-level, recreational, and Olympic/professional-level athletes with&#xD;
      the goal of identifying individual functional and performance deficits that lead to future&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Landing force</measure>
    <time_frame>8-16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Non-contact injuries to the lower limb are dependent on ground reaction force. As ground reaction force is minimized during landing, so is the risk for injury as lower forces are transmitted through the limb.</description>

    <description>Biofeedback wearable sleeve will be utilized in at least 2 groups of athletes. This randomized group will receive an 'active' wearable device. The device will be worn during regular sport practice sessions for 8-16 weeks. The device will provide haptic feedback directly associated with potentially injurious events as determined by previously established cut-off values and artificially-intelligent algorithms.</description>

    <description>Biofeedback wearable sleeve will be utilized in at least 2 groups of athletes. This randomized group will receive a 'sham' wearable device. The device will be worn during regular sport practice sessions for 8-16 weeks. The device will provide random feedback at random intervals not directly associated with potentially injurious events.</description>

    <intervention_name>Biofeedback Knee Sleeve</intervention_name>
    <description>The biofeedback knee sleeve is a device that is artificially-intelligent and utilizes determined cut-off values of knee motion and forces to determine whether a motion is 'good' or 'bad'. A 'bad' knee motion will provide a haptic output to the wearer (biofeedback) so that they can take note of what the previous motion was that caused the device to signal a warning.</description>
