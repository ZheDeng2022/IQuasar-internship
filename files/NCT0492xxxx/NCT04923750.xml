      AKI is a rapid and usually reversible impairment of kidney function that is life-threatening&#xD;
      in the short term well described by the &quot;Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes - KDIGO&quot;&#xD;
      classification of 2012. Whatever etiology of acute renal failure, drug iatrogeny still has&#xD;
      its place. Hospital data from the information systems medicalization program (PMSI) can be&#xD;
      used for epidemiological research. No study has yet been performed on these data to assess&#xD;
      drug-related AKI. However, it should be remembered that these databases were not originally&#xD;
      designed for research purposes but for reimbursement of care. Therefore, before conducting a&#xD;
      large-scale study, it remains important to determine the validity and representativeness of&#xD;
      the codes used for coding the studied events. The objective of this project is therefore to&#xD;
      validate the use of hospital coding to identify AKI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rapid and usually reversible impairment of kidney function&#xD;
      that is life-threatening in the short term; the grades of which are defined by the KDIGO&#xD;
      classification of 2012. Whatever etiology of acute renal failure, drug iatrogeny still has&#xD;
      its place. Data literature indicate that AKI affects more than one in five adults worldwide&#xD;
      while hospitalized, with an associated mortality rate above 20%. It constitutes a&#xD;
      non-negligible part of hospitalizations when it is acquired in the community, and also causes&#xD;
      prolongations of hospitalizations, and therefore an increase in the cost for the hospital.&#xD;
      Hospital data from the information systems medicalization program (PMSI) is a device that is&#xD;
      part of the reform of the French health system with the aim of reducing inequalities in&#xD;
      resources between health establishments. Since 2007, it has been possible to link all&#xD;
      discharge summaries for one patient. The diagnoses identified during hospitalization are&#xD;
      coded according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).&#xD;
      The data from PMSI coding can be used for epidemiological research. The majority of studies&#xD;
      were related to patients with chronic kidney disease, especially dialysis patients. No study&#xD;
      has yet been performed on these data to assess drug-related AKI. However, it should be&#xD;
      remembered that these databases were not originally designed for research purposes but for&#xD;
      reimbursement of care. Therefore, before conducting a large-scale study, it remains important&#xD;
      to determine the validity and representativeness of the codes used for coding the events to&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
