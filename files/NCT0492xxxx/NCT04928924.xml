      The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of functional 3D biomechanical&#xD;
      assessment and EMG analysis of gait and a sit to stand tasks in the immediate post-operative&#xD;
      phase following total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery is often an important priority for patients undergoing total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA) and it is thought that abnormal biomechanics may be an obstacle to full&#xD;
      recovery of physical function. While there has been extensive research on the biomechanics of&#xD;
      gait and other activities of daily living following THA, the earliest reported post-operative&#xD;
      assessment of function using 3D motion analysis for kinematics and kinetics has been at 6&#xD;
      weeks post-surgery. There is a paucity of data from the immediate post-operative phase prior&#xD;
      to patient discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been an increase in initiatives such as fast-track or enhanced&#xD;
      post-operative recovery programs following joint arthroplasty, with the aim being an early&#xD;
      return to function and shorter hospital length of stay whilst maintaining the low morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality and high satisfaction rates typically associated with THA. There has also been&#xD;
      continued research and developments on improving the THA procedure and while initial focus on&#xD;
      improving THA surgery centred on implant design, materials and fixation to bone, there has&#xD;
      been increased attention to surgical approach. In the last 10 years the use of minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgical techniques has become more widespread due to the potential reported&#xD;
      benefits. These include a shorter incision length, reduced muscle damage, reduced pain and&#xD;
      less bleeding. When combined, these benefits may lead to reduced length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      earlier return to function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With so much focus centred on early return to function, there is a need to objectively&#xD;
      measure function in the immediate post-operative phase. This would allow us to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of minimally invasive surgical approaches and enhanced recovery programs, which are&#xD;
      primarily centred on early recovery from surgery. The use of 3D motion capture technology&#xD;
      allows for accurate assessment of joint movement in three planes during dynamic movements and&#xD;
      has been used extensively in the evaluation of function in patients with significant hip&#xD;
      pathology before and after total hip arthroplasty. As aforementioned, to date the earliest&#xD;
      post-operative motion analysis has been at 6 weeks after THA. Similarly, the earliest&#xD;
      reported time point for muscle activation analysis using EMG is 6 weeks post THA. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is assess the feasibility of 3D motion analysis including EMG in the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative phase following THA in a hospital which incorporates an Enhanced Recovery&#xD;
      After Surgery (ERAS) program as part of routine clinical care. This pilot project will guide&#xD;
      development of future protocols which require early post-operative 3D biomechanical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study the investigators define the immediate post-operative time&#xD;
      point as the day the patient is discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation team and&#xD;
      therefore deemed &quot;safe&quot; to mobilise independently by the ward physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment and retention will be closely monitored throughout the trial, allowing us&#xD;
      to measure recruitment and dropout rates. Where possible, reasons for declining participation&#xD;
      in the study and reasons for dropout will be documented. The ability of the patients to&#xD;
      perform study related assessments will be recorded in addition to the reason for them being&#xD;
      unable to perform the task, this will be done via a questionnaire that patients will complete&#xD;
      at the end of each 3D biomechanical assessment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to attend a biomechanical testing session before their surgery. After&#xD;
      surgery they will follow standard aftercare, and on the day of discharge from the inpatient&#xD;
      physiotherapy team they will be asked to attend the second biomechanical testing session. The&#xD;
      third and fourth sessions will be on day three and day seven post-surgery, and the final&#xD;
      session will take place when they return to the hospital for their standard three month&#xD;
      follow up with the arthroplasty team. At the end of the three month visit, their involvement&#xD;
      in the study will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical movement analysis will be carried out in an on-site movement analysis&#xD;
      laboratory. Study participants will be required to wear suitable clothing (e.g. tee shirt and&#xD;
      shorts) and be barefoot. A number of reflective markers and surface electrodes will be&#xD;
      attached to specific locations on the body using suitable double sided tape which can be&#xD;
      tracked by a number of infrared cameras. participants will be asked to perform the following&#xD;
      tasks; walking, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Each task will be performed at least three&#xD;
      times to enable the collection of three good sets of data. A motion capture system will&#xD;
      collect limb and torso movements during the task performances while force plates will collect&#xD;
      ground reaction forces.&#xD;
