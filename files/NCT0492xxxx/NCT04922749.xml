  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with mental illness (MI) have a reduced life expectancy compared to the general&#xD;
      population, mostly attributable to somatic diseases caused by poor physical health.&#xD;
      Modifiable &quot;lifestyle factors&quot; have been increasingly associated with the onset of somatic&#xD;
      diseases in people with MI and refer to health behaviours such as physical activity (PA),&#xD;
      diet, sleep and smoking behaviour. Despite the evidence demonstrating the efficacy of&#xD;
      interventions aimed at improving lifestyle factors, there have not been many structural&#xD;
      changes in routine clinical care for people with MI. Using a multidisciplinary,&#xD;
      multicomponent approach, Deenik and colleagues (2019) were the first to find long-term&#xD;
      positive effects in both mental and somatic health in a real-world inpatient setting for&#xD;
      people with severe mental illness (SMI). They found improvements in metabolic health,&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and quality of life, and a reduction in the use of psychotropic&#xD;
      medication. The authors urged to confirm and complement findings in scaled-up studies, and&#xD;
      made several suggestions for improvement of the treatment and pragmatic research of&#xD;
      implementation. In line with these previous recommendations the MULTI is being scaled-up into&#xD;
      the MULTI+. This study investigates the implementation and effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary lifestyle treatment for inpatients with mental illness (MULTI+).&#xD;

      Study design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective open cohort stepped wedge cluster randomized trial with&#xD;
      continuous recruitment. This study is being conducted at the inpatient psychiatric wards,&#xD;
      covering approximately 750 places of residency in which approximately 2000 patients are&#xD;
      treated annually, from the specialist mental healthcare organisation GGz Centraal (the&#xD;
      Netherlands). The study uses a stepped-wedge clustered design. The psychiatric wards are&#xD;
      divided into three clusters, based on their geographical locations. These clusters gradually&#xD;
      implement MULTI+ in semi-annual steps, such that all clusters are exposed to the MULTI+ at&#xD;
      the end of the study. The repeated measurements are conducted on ward-level, rather than&#xD;
      individual patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      MULTI+ is a multidisciplinary, multicomponent treatment which aims to improve lifestyle&#xD;
      factors through a holistic lifestyle approach, by focusing on 10 core components. Core&#xD;
      components refer to essential elements and activities that are necessary to achieve desired&#xD;
      outcomes. The core components of MULTI+ are based on previous recommendations and existing&#xD;
      literature. The core components of MULTI+ are routine daily structure and sleep, physical&#xD;
      activity, attention to nutrition and eating habits, smoking cessation, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      treatment, skills training, psychoeducation, critical review of obesogenic environment and&#xD;
      existing policies, active participation of health care professionals (HCPs), and training of&#xD;
      HCPs. The core components are co-designed and tailored to the ward and patient population,&#xD;
      because of the large heterogeneity in patient characteristics and varying access to&#xD;
      facilities and staffing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the intervention effect, linear mixed models will be used for continuous outcome&#xD;
      measures and logistic mixed models for dichotomous outcome measures. In each model, the&#xD;
      intervention effect will be estimated as the difference between the postintervention and&#xD;
      preintervention levels of the outcome after adjusting for time as a categorical variable. All&#xD;
      models will be corrected for group differences at baseline and the baseline differences of&#xD;
      the outcome measures concerned (to account for regression to the mean).&#xD;

The four WHOQoL-BREF domains are measured through 24 domain-specific items: Physical health (7 items), Psychological (6 items), Social relations (3 items) and Environment (8 items) and two general health items. Item scores have various options but always range from 1 to 5, such as very poor to very good or not at all to extremely, and will be converted to domain scores (range from 4 to 20) based on the WHO guidelines. Higher score reflect a better quality of life.</description>

The MHC-SF measures positive mental health and consists of 14 items, representing feelings of well-being: Emotional well-being (three items), Psychological well-being (six items), and Social well-being (five items). Participants rate the frequency of these feelings in the past month on a 6-point Likert scale (never, once or twice a month, about once a week, two or three times a week, almost every day, every day).</description>

The MIDI is comprised of 28 items, divided into 4 scales measuring determinants associated with innovations (7 items), the user (11 items) and the organization (10 items). All items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). Items which ≥20% responds negatively (disagree/totally disagree) are considered barriers. Items which ≥80% respond positively (agree/totally agree) are considered facilitators.</description>
