  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD) is a rare, heterogeneous histiocytic disorder. Because of the&#xD;
      rarity of RDD and a lack of prospective randomized trials, the treatment strategy for RDD is&#xD;
      mostly based on retrospective study. Steroid was suggested as frontline treatment as RDD with&#xD;
      only lymph nodes involvement. Studies showed thalidomide or lenalidomide showed some effect&#xD;
      in recurrent/refractory skin RDD. The investigators want to analyze the efficacy and toxicity&#xD;
      of lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone regimens in the treatment of RDD among adult&#xD;
      patients at our hospital.&#xD;
