  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though erector spinae plane (ESP) block is shown to be efficient in cardiac surgery, it&#xD;
      is still controversial how much volume is necessary for efficient analgesic effect for&#xD;
      sternotomy and drain tube pain relief. This study aims to investigate the optimal local&#xD;
      anesthetic volume (20 mL versus 30 mL) with ESP block for open-heart cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In cardiac surgery, the most common cause of pain during the first two days postoperatively&#xD;
      is median sternotomy. In a study in which 705 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were&#xD;
      followed up prospectively, postoperative 24 hours pain scores ranging from 5.3 to 6.5 out of&#xD;
      10 with deep breathing and coughing were shown. In these patients, it may increase the&#xD;
      frequency of atelectasis due to reasons such as failure in pain control, weak coughing, and&#xD;
      limitation of movement, and these may lead increase in morbidity and hospital stay. Although&#xD;
      nonsteroidal analgesics and opioids are used successfully in the control of this severe pain,&#xD;
      they are far from being ideal analgesics alone due to their side effects such as kidney&#xD;
      damage, bleeding risk, sedation, respiratory depression, itching, nausea, and vomiting. The&#xD;
      complications of neuraxial techniques seem to be the disadvantages of these methods. Erector&#xD;
      spinae plane (ESP) block is one of the regional anesthesia techniques that has been shown to&#xD;
      be effective in reducing sternotomy pain in sternotomy-guided cardiac surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Erector spinae plane (ESP) block was first described by Forero in 2016. In this block&#xD;
      technique, a local anesthetic is given to the plane between the erector spinae muscle and the&#xD;
      vertebral transverse process. The dorsal and ventral branches of the spinal nerves are&#xD;
      blocked in this plane. However, due to individual regional anatomical differences, there is&#xD;
      not enough data to determine the optimum volume at which the appropriate spread of local&#xD;
      anesthetic will occur. Volume-based cadaver studies have some handicaps since they do not&#xD;
      have the characteristics of living tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of ESP block applied at the&#xD;
      same dose but with different local anesthetic volumes in cardiac surgeries to be performed&#xD;
      with sternotomy.&#xD;
