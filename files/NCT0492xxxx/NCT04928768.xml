  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously, patient satisfaction with orthodontic treatment has been reported at a broad&#xD;
      range of 34% to 95% but these values mostly represent satisfaction for tooth alignment or&#xD;
      simple satisfaction with treatment results. In keeping with the increased focus on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, many other factors were put into consideration in our study which contributes&#xD;
      to the level of total satisfaction as host factors, concerns regarding the treatment,&#xD;
      treatment motivation and discomfort during or after treatment. There are also a lack of&#xD;
      studies conducted for orthodontic treatment satisfaction using previously validated&#xD;
      questionnaires as well as correlation between patient's treatment satisfaction and ABO&#xD;
      grading hasn't been sufficiently discussed in the literature, this study aims to address that&#xD;
      gap. It would be also beneficial to investigate the frequency of different malocclusions&#xD;
      presented in a sample of postorthodontic patients as it will give an insight about the&#xD;
      distribution of the different malocclusion treated within the clinic and the degree of&#xD;
      success in treating such malocclusions.&#xD;

      Research Procedure in brief:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be done for each participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of patients telephone numbers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the orthodontic department patient's database ensuring complete confidentiality.&#xD;
      Telephoning the patients for follow ups after orthodontic treatment and asking them to fill&#xD;
      in a questionnaire during their visit for explaining our aim for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data chart:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including name, age, date of birth, mobile number and address. Examination of pretreatment&#xD;
      records of the patients included in the sample to detect the type of malocclusion presented&#xD;
      initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic treatment satisfaction questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire is reviewed by faculty experts to determine whether the items in the&#xD;
      questionnaire truly represent the items to be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translated questionnaire's face validation is led by the expert faculty members who are&#xD;
      specialists in both English and Arabic guaranteeing clarity, intelligibility and&#xD;
      comprehensiveness of items. This is significant in light of the fact that while performing&#xD;
      any questionnaire in another setting, not all of the items may be compatible to Egyptian&#xD;
      culture and lifestyles. In addition, a portion of items may not be applicable to specific age&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABO Grading System Study models will be selected from the orthodontic department database.&#xD;
      The post-treatment models will be assessed using the MGS of the American Board of&#xD;
      Orthodontics.&#xD;

    <description>A validated questionnaire (five-point Likert scale) through 10 items developed by Lee et al 2018 is employed to measure the level of orthodontic treatment satisfaction in 10 items; overall satisfaction, tooth alignment, facial appearance, eating and chewing, confident smile and self-image, retention state, treatment duration, treatment costs, intention to recommend, and relief of previous concerns. Total satisfaction is calculated by averaging the Likert scores from the 10 items</description>
