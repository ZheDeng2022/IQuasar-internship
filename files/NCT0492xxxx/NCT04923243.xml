    <textblock>
      Introduction: Postoperative delirium (POD), an acute, transient, fluctuating disturbance in&#xD;
      attention, cognition, and level of consciousness, is a common (15-53%) postoperative&#xD;
      complication, and it is associated with longer hospital stays, worse functional outcomes,&#xD;
      higher healthcare costs, and increased mortality. However, at the current time, effective&#xD;
      prevention and treatment are not only hampered by lack of knowledge about the&#xD;
      neuropathogenesis of POD but also by a lack of biomarkers that could predict individual risk&#xD;
      and assess diagnosis and severity of POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have focused on inflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CRP),&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease-related factors (Tau, Aβ40/42), and nerve injury factors (S100β, NSE),&#xD;
      but failed to establishing causality between these markers and POD. Furthermore, these&#xD;
      results were contradictory. Our previous study found that the dysregulation of preoperative&#xD;
      microRNA (miR)-146a and miR-181c in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum was associated with&#xD;
      the development and severity of POD. Therefore, we hypothesized these neurimmiRs and other&#xD;
      neuro-epigenetics biomarkers might participate in the neuropathogenesis of POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Aims to search for neuro-epigenetics biomarkers to predict and diagnose POD.&#xD;

        4. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score [a global score that assesses the&#xD;
           physical status of patients before surgery, ranging from 1 (normal health) to 5&#xD;
           (moribund)] greater than 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. a history of alcohol abuse and drug dependence;&#xD;
