      The LIFT project aims to thoroughly investigate the current status of health care in Germany&#xD;
      regarding fatigue from the institutional, professionals', and patients' perspective. With a&#xD;
      multimodal approach including a comprehensive assessment of fatigue management and support&#xD;
      offered by different institutions (uncertified hospitals, uncertified oncological practices,&#xD;
      counselling units, certified cancer centers; n=350), a survey and qualitative interviews&#xD;
      among practicing physicians (&quot;Niedergelassene Ärzte&quot;), hospital physicians, practicing&#xD;
      psychotherapists with psycho-oncological focus, psycho-oncologists at hospitals, nurses at&#xD;
      certified cancer centers and nurses at other hospitals (n=420), and a longitudinal clinical&#xD;
      study among cancer patients (n=1400) as well as two focus groups with patient representatives&#xD;
      (each n=6), the characteristics, patterns, and potential effects or shortcomings of the&#xD;
      current fatigue management will be investigated. Furthermore, factors associated with&#xD;
      patients' and health care professionals' knowledge about fatigue will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the longitudinal clinical study assessing the patients' perspective, online or&#xD;
      paper-based questionnaires on socio-demographic, clinical and patient reported outcomes will&#xD;
      be sent to the patients 6,9,12 and 24 months after diagnosis. Moreover, detailed data on&#xD;
      screening, diagnosis and counseling as well as therapies offered and administered to reduce&#xD;
      fatigue will be surveyed, as well as the patients' state of knowledge, perception and&#xD;
      prevailing needs regarding fatigue. Tumor and cancer therapy data will be extracted from the&#xD;
      Epidemiological Cancer Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the LIFT project shall provide a basis to identify and overcome shortcomings&#xD;
      in the actual fatigue management in Germany, and, to eventually ameliorate this severe burden&#xD;
      in cancer patients and survivors.&#xD;
