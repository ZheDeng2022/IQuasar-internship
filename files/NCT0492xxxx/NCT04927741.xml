  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the effects of topical application of sweet marjoram essential oil +&#xD;
      grapeseed oil with massage on uterine cramping/pain post-IUD insertion/placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is to conduct a pilot study that could give a first look at the data to&#xD;
      determine whether this line of research is worth pursuing with more time, effort, and&#xD;
      resources. The results of this pilot study will provide adequate data (e.g., variance&#xD;
      estimates) needed for obtaining reasonably reliable sample size estimates if larger studies&#xD;
      are warranted in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be consented and randomized to one of three methods by a member of the study&#xD;
      team on the day of their IUD insertion. Several variables of interest will be collected via&#xD;
      the electronic medical record and via questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive a dilution of sweet marjoram essential oil (15 cc of grapeseed oil with 10 drops of sweet marjoram essential oil).&#xD;
Oil will be applied topically by the study medical providers. Providers will wear exam gloves, dip three fingers into the oil solution and apply it topically to the subject's lower abdomen. This will be applied by going left to right for 20 seconds while applying gentle pressure - counter pressure may be applied on the uterus to help relieve cramping.</description>
