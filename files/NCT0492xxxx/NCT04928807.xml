    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical study, and the purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to compare the pathological complete response rate (PCR) of patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer treated with short-term radiotherapy, sequential Camrelizumab&#xD;
      and CAPOX (group A) to long-term concurrent chemoradiotherapy, sequential CAPOX (group B) in&#xD;
      patients with LARC. A total of 230 patients were included in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-4/N+) were randomly assigned to experimental&#xD;
      group A or control group B according to the ratio of 1:1,who will receive preoperative&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy, and the Primary endpoint of the study is Pathological complete response&#xD;
      rate(PCR ) assessed by the blind independent review committee (BIRC), defined as the absence&#xD;
      of viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph&#xD;
      nodes (ypT0N0)&#xD;

The patients were operated within 10 weeks after the last radiotherapy. Adjuvant therapy should begin within 4-6 weeks after surgery, and the adjuvant regimen was the same as that before operation (CAPOX) for 6 cycles</description>
