  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial compares the addition of radiation therapy to the usual treatment&#xD;
      (immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy) vs. usual treatment alone in treating patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (advanced) or&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) whose tumor is also negative for a&#xD;
      molecular marker called PD-L1. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of&#xD;
      radiation therapy that uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This&#xD;
      method uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors&#xD;
      with fewer doses over a shorter period and may cause less damage to normal tissue than&#xD;
      conventional radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab,&#xD;
      ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin, pemetrexed, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. The addition of radiation therapy to usual treatment may stop&#xD;
      the cancer from growing and increase the life of patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer who are PD-L1 negative.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS, phase II portion) and overall survival (OS, phase III portion) of advanced&#xD;
      stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) &lt;&#xD;
      1% who receive immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate and compare the rates of &gt;= grade 3-4 and all grade adverse events by Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0 between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To summarize and compare progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine and compare the objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST between the arms&#xD;
      (including at both irradiated and un-irradiated sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the peripheral immune microenvironment between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the health-related QOL in both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive 1 of 6 treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients receive immunotherapy alone whether they have squamous or non-squamous&#xD;
      histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 1: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and&#xD;
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks for 24&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non-squamous histology receive 1 of 2 options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 2: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, carboplatin IV on days&#xD;
      1 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, and pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 6 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 3: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 days on day 1. Patients also receive carboplatin IV and pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1 and 22 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks for 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with squamous histology receive 1 of 3 options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 4: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive&#xD;
      carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 1-96 hours on days 1 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 6 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 5: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive&#xD;
      carboplatin IV on days 1 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 of cycles 1 and 2. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks for 24 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTION 6: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22 and ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1. Patients also receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 1-96&#xD;
      hours on days 1 and 22 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks for 24 months in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients receive 1 of 6 treatment options as in Arm A. Patients also undergo 3&#xD;
      fractions of SBRT every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be performed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. The comparison of the distributions of OS between treatment arms will be done with a one-sided stratified log-rank test). The rates at various time points (e.g., every 6 months after randomization) and medians of OS for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The associated 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using Greenwood's formula and based on a log-log transformation applied on the survival function. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. The final phase III analysis of OS will be considered as &quot;positive&quot; if the stratified log-rank test statistics Z-value greater than the critical value adjusted for type 1 error using group sequential methods. Multivariable Cox models will be used to evaluate the treatment effect on survival time and its interaction with baseline covariates, including stage, systemic therapy, histology and performance status.</description>

&#xD;
          -  No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current pneumonitis or history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids&#xD;
