    <textblock>
      Though exacerbations in the COPD (Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease) and specially the&#xD;
      most severe cases (hospitalizations) are currently a fundamental outcome in the COPD due to&#xD;
      its clinical and economic significance, there are many unanswered questions still today such&#xD;
      as the very definition of exacerbation itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research parameters like the CPD (Cell Population Data) are added to the basic blood count.&#xD;
      The CPD of the XN analyzers (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) provide quantitative&#xD;
      information of the morphological and functional characteristics of the leukocytes: their&#xD;
      volume, content of nucleic acids and structure of the cytoplasm. The CPD are numerical data&#xD;
      which represent the morphology which characterizes the neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes,&#xD;
      eosinophils and platelets classifying them as per their volume and shape, granularity and&#xD;
      their content of nucleic acids. The approach is that such cheap and accessible technique can&#xD;
      provide relevant information in the area of COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study proposes several objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish the CPD values for each phenotype of COPD (both for those already established&#xD;
           in the Spanish guide of COPD and in the potential phenotypes which may be established in&#xD;
           this study based on the CPDs themselves).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify which, among the CPDs, are more relevant in relation to cellular activation&#xD;
           (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets) both in the stage of clinical&#xD;
           stability and during the severe exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish different phenotypes of COPD (in stable phase) according to the CPD values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the existence of an association between the level of activation of these cells&#xD;
           in stability phase of the COPD and the risk of exacerbation; establish the optimum&#xD;
           cutoff points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 500 patients with different levels of COPD in the OSI-Barrualde and&#xD;
      OSI-Bilbao. Several clinical measurements will be carried out for their characterization. CPD&#xD;
      measurements will be made both in clinical stability phase or during exacerbations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One of the most analyzed outcomes in COPD (Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease) are the&#xD;
      exacerbations, specially the severe ones. There are two challenges in relation to severe&#xD;
      exacerbations: one related to the high use of sanitary resources and costs; and the second&#xD;
      one, related to the worsening of the pulmonary function and the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays in the Spanish COPD guideline called GESEPOC (Guía Española de la Enfermedad&#xD;
      Pulmonar Obstructiva Crónica), there is a COPD &quot;exacerbator&quot; phenotype. However, there are&#xD;
      some limitations round the COPD exacerbation, like its definition or its predictors. In other&#xD;
      words, there are no indicators that can help the investigators to define more precisely an&#xD;
      exacerbation or the COPD exacerbator profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is a chronic disease with low intensity, systemic and chronic inflammation. The matter&#xD;
      is that it is not established which indicators the investigators have to use to determinate&#xD;
      it. There are some indicators like C reactive protein, TNF-alpha, IL-6 (Interleukin 6),&#xD;
      microalbumins and adiponectin; and there are also prognostic scores based on them. However,&#xD;
      they cannot help the investigators to establish COPD phenotypes of patients that can suffer&#xD;
      an exacerbation. The investigators neither have indicators in stable phase that say them the&#xD;
      risk of an exacerbation. Moreover, it is said that there are different types of exacerbations&#xD;
      and even it has been established indicators of these exacerbation phenotypes. However,&#xD;
      nowadays it cannot be translated into daily clinical practice. If investigators would be able&#xD;
      to do it, they could advance in the knowledge of the exacerbations and they could establish&#xD;
      precision treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood count is one of the most required laboratory test in clinical practice. It is&#xD;
      cost-effective because of its low price and the huge quantity of information it brings. After&#xD;
      adapting the flow cytometry in hematologic modern analyzers, a more detailed study of cells&#xD;
      can be done. Moreover, morphological changes can be detected in response to different&#xD;
      stimulus, like infections or the ones that are caused by inflammatory reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, CPD (&quot;Cellular Popular Data&quot;) is added to the basis blood count. They are&#xD;
      parameters that are under investigation nowadays. The CPD of the XN analyzers (Sysmex&#xD;
      Corporation, Kobe, Japan) give quantitative information about morphological and functional&#xD;
      characteristics of leukocytes: their volume, the quantity of nucleic acid they contain and&#xD;
      the structure of the cytoplasm. The CPD are numeric data that represent the morphology of the&#xD;
      neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils, and they classify them by their volume,&#xD;
      form, granularity and nucleic acid content. The same technology allows to the analyzer to&#xD;
      classify the platelets by their morphology, what is related to its thrombogenic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the membrane of the activated cells is different from the one of cells&#xD;
      that are at rest, because of the expression of the receptors and the surface signaling&#xD;
      molecules, in response to the activation. This membrane is more sensitive to the reagents of&#xD;
      the analyzer, and more quantity of fluorescent colorant can enter in the activated cell and&#xD;
      link to the cytoplasmic organelles and nucleic acids. The optic signals are different, what&#xD;
      allows to distinguish morphological changes, and they are directly related to the cell&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activated neutrophils and monocytes have more &quot;deformability&quot;, mobility and more capacity&#xD;
      to adhesion, granulation and liberation of cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPD values reflect morphological and functional transformation of these activated cells, and&#xD;
      they give us very important information of the state of the cell and the state of the patient&#xD;
      at the moment the sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, CPD support the differentiation between viral and bacterial infections or&#xD;
      between acute and chronic infections, but also they say if there is an inflammatory condition&#xD;
      without infection, with better diagnostic performance than conventional parameters, like&#xD;
      total leukocytes, neutrophiles percentage and C reactive protein, that traditionally are used&#xD;
      like acute infection markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently available literature speaks about the utility of CPD in the diagnosis, but there is&#xD;
      no data about their possible prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respect from blood cells, previous COPD studies showed the relation between&#xD;
      neutrophils/lymphocytes and platelets/lymphocytes as prognostic factors during severe&#xD;
      exacerbations in COPD. Nowadays, it is emphasized the importance of eosinophils in COPD like&#xD;
      predictor of exacerbation, like exacerbation severity marker and like response marker to the&#xD;
      treatment in stable and in the exacerbation phase. It is thought that in this study the&#xD;
      prognostic capacity of these new approaches can be better, becauseit is included the grade of&#xD;
      activation of these cells like key parameter. This is a novel approach in the COPD field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, other inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha, IL-6…) are expensive and less&#xD;
      accessible in the daily clinical practice, while the evaluation of these new biomarkers of&#xD;
      leukocytes are cheaper and more available in routine clinical practice by the blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new biomarkers could help the investigators confirming the inflammatory response and&#xD;
      recognizing patients that could exacerbate. They also could determine the kind of their&#xD;
      exacerbation and their prognosis.&#xD;
