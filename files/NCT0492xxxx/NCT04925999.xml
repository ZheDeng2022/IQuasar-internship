    <textblock>
      For people who use computers a lot, Work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck are a&#xD;
      common problem . It is generally agreed that the etiology of work-related neck disorders is&#xD;
      multidimensional which is associated with, and influenced by, a complex array of individual,&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Academic staff work involves diverse activities, both in and out of lecture-rooms, designing&#xD;
      course curricula, developing lecture and tutorial plans and materials, providing students&#xD;
      with information in an interesting and understandable manner, setting questions, and marking&#xD;
      examinations .These activities usually involve long periods of sitting and standing, placing&#xD;
      a physical demand on the lower back, cervical spine and the vertebral column in general, thus&#xD;
      contributing to neck and shoulder discomfort .Lecturers use computers extensively and are&#xD;
      thus exposed to many of the same risk factors to which 'office workers' are exposed. Using a&#xD;
      computer is associated with poor neck posture most often in a forward head position, which is&#xD;
      thought to be one of the most common causes of neck, head and shoulder tension and pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neck pain is costly in terms of treatment, individual suffering, and time lost due to work&#xD;
      absenteeism . Effective performance of academic staff of the university is very important as&#xD;
      the key factors to a successful day to day running of any university system .&#xD;
