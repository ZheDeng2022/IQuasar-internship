      The key objective of the study is to measure the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after&#xD;
      different vaccinations in Health Care Workers (HCW) from 18 to 65 years old vaccinated once&#xD;
      with Janssen vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Janssen vaccine/- vs. Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: A novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan, China in December&#xD;
      2019 (1). In January 2021 the first vaccines protecting against this virus are available in&#xD;
      the Netherlands. Most current available vaccines in the Netherlands (e.g., AstraZeneca&#xD;
      vaccine (2), Moderna vaccine (3), and Pfizer vaccine (4) require a second boost (2nd&#xD;
      vaccination) after the prime (1st vaccination), to obtain an optimal immune response. The&#xD;
      booster (2nd vaccination) has up to present always been given with the same vaccine as the&#xD;
      primary vaccine. Unfortunately, the availability of the vaccines is limited and a speedy&#xD;
      vaccination is also hampered by logistic reasons. The ability to combine different vaccines&#xD;
      could make vaccination programs in the future more flexible. It would facilitate a fast-track&#xD;
      process and reduce the impact of any supply-chain disruptions (5). In addition, several&#xD;
      studies in mice have already shown that combining different vaccines (two-dose heterologous&#xD;
      vaccination regimen) can elicit a broader immune response (in field of neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies and T-cell responses)(6, 7). These results endorse the need for clinical trials to&#xD;
      investigate the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens. Trails to combine different vaccines&#xD;
      have meanwhile been set up in Great Britain and Spain where they combine Pfizer vaccine and&#xD;
      AstraZeneca vaccine (Com-COV 1(8) and CombiVacS(9)). Recently, it became known that the&#xD;
      CoM-COV1 was expanded with Moderna vaccine and Novavax vaccine (CoM-COV2(10)). Therefore this&#xD;
      protocol has a focus to adeno priming with Janssen vaccine, which is not studied in the other&#xD;
      ongoing studies. As the vaccination rate in The Netherlands is increasing rapidly, it was&#xD;
      decided to include Healthcare Workers (HCW) vaccinated once with Janssen vaccine. Objective:&#xD;
      The key objective of the study is to measure the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after&#xD;
      different vaccinations in Health Care Workers (HCW) from 18 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of antibodies by a quantitative IgG assay (LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG&#xD;
      essay) 28 days after second vaccination (booster) comparing, per protocol, the following&#xD;
      three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Janssen vaccine/- vs. Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine vs. Janssen vaccine/Pfizer vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine vs. Janssen vaccine/Moderna vaccine Study design: A&#xD;
           multicenter, randomised, single-blind, controlled trial to determine reactogenicity and&#xD;
           immunogenicity of different prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: multicenter study conducted at 4 academic University Medical Centers (UMC) hospitals&#xD;
      (Amsterdam UMC, Erasmus UMC, Leiden UMC, and UMC Groningen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Immunogenicity in participants who have already received one dose of Janssen&#xD;
      vaccine will be higher when it is followed by a heterologous booster containing Pfizer&#xD;
      vaccine or Moderna vaccine as opposed to a homologous booster containing Janssen vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question that will be addressed: Measuring the humoral immune response against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 after inoculation with a single-dose Janssen vaccine compared to a homologous&#xD;
      vaccination regimen with Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine and the comparison of a homologous&#xD;
      vaccination regimen (Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine) with a heterologous vaccination regimen&#xD;
      (Janssen vaccine/Pfizer vaccine + Janssen vaccine/Moderna vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized for Standard of Care (1 vaccination with Janssen vaccine), a&#xD;
      homologue vaccination strategy (two vaccines from the same manufacturer, i.e., Janssen&#xD;
      vaccine) or a heterologous vaccination strategy (two different vaccines, e.g., Janssen&#xD;
      vaccine followed by Pfizer vaccine or Moderna vaccine). The study starts approximately 84&#xD;
      days (+/- 10) after the first vaccination Janssen vaccine. The day of the 2nd vaccination is&#xD;
      seen as day 0. Blood will be drawn at 4 different time points, i.e. day 0 - baseline (before&#xD;
      2nd vaccination), day 28 (after 2nd vaccination - primary endpoint), day 180 +/- 14 days&#xD;
      (after 2nd vaccination), and day 365 +/- 14 days (after 2nd vaccination). Questionnaires will&#xD;
      be used to monitor for adverse reactions after 2nd vaccination and to evaluate COVID-19&#xD;
      infection during the study and outcome despite vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthcare Workers (HCW) from 18 to 65 years old vaccinated once with&#xD;
      Janssen vaccine. Individuals of all ethnicities will be recruited. Given the speed of the&#xD;
      Dutch vaccination campaign, it is not feasible to collect baseline immunological data before&#xD;
      first vaccination. For this reason, the baseline in this study is at the day of the booster&#xD;
      (2nd vaccination). If not enough HCW can be found within the recruiting hospitals, the&#xD;
      population will be expanded to HCW in surrounding peripheral hospitals and primary care&#xD;
      (e.g., local pharmacies, dental practices, and physiotherapists).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): All adult people in the Dutch population are vaccinated on a&#xD;
      voluntary basis. The only difference is that they might be vaccinated with a different&#xD;
      vaccine for the boost (second vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: to determine whether the immune response 28 days after boost is higher to&#xD;
      that observed following only one vaccination (Janssen vaccine solo vs. Janssen&#xD;
      vaccine/Janssen vaccine) and the comparison of a heterologous boost of a COVID-19 vaccine (84&#xD;
      days post prime (1st vaccination) - Janssen vaccine/Pfizer vaccine and Janssen&#xD;
      vaccine/Moderna vaccine) with a homologous boost (84 days post prime (1st vaccination) -&#xD;
      Janssen vaccine/Janssen vaccine), in participants vaccinated once with Janssen vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: to assess safety &amp; reactogenicity of different prime-boost schedules of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines and characterization of immunogenicity of different prime-boost schedules&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The consequence of participating in this study has two sides; on the one hand, a&#xD;
      higher burden for the participant, given 4 study visits in one year including blood samples&#xD;
      and questionnaires. With the fact that slightly more side effects may be seen in the first 48&#xD;
      hours after the second vaccination (11). In contrast, in a prospective study from Germany&#xD;
      with the same vaccination strategy, they identified a comparable reactogenicity between&#xD;
      heterologous (Astra Zeneca vaccine/Pfizer vaccine) and homologous (Pfizer vaccine/Pfizer&#xD;
      vaccine) booster vaccination after a 12-week dose interval (12). On the other hand,&#xD;
      participants receive an overview of their own immune response after vaccination at several&#xD;
      time points and their participation contributes to answering a very relevant research&#xD;
      question. The burden of the study visits is expected to be minimal.&#xD;
