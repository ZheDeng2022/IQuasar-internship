  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that people who are more physically fit prior to surgery do better after&#xD;
      surgery. For this reason, it may be helpful for people who are going to have abdominal&#xD;
      surgery for cancer to exercise before surgery to increase fitness. In this study, patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to either maintain their current activity, or increase activity to 5 days a&#xD;
      week, 40 minutes per day, of either continuous moderate activity or intervals of moderate and&#xD;
      vigorous activity (three groups). All participants will wear an Apple watch, and participants&#xD;
      in the exercise groups will use a smartphone application to get feedback on activity and&#xD;
      encouragement to reach activity goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research indicates that people who have better physical fitness at the time of surgery have a&#xD;
      better chance of surviving the surgery and returning to normal function. An exercise&#xD;
      intervention in the 3+ weeks before surgery (after the decision that surgery is necessary)&#xD;
      may help people who are going to have abdominal surgery for cancer increase fitness prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Devices that track physical activity, like smartwatches or Fitbits, allow the wearer&#xD;
      to get feedback on physical activity information like steps taken, distance traveled, time in&#xD;
      light, moderate or vigorous activity and on heart rate. Having this information and using a&#xD;
      smartphone application designed to increase physical activity may help patients increase&#xD;
      physical activity and thereby fitness, prior to abdominal surgery for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this project is to test two physical activity interventions and also a&#xD;
      &quot;control group&quot; to make sure that participants can do the interventions and to see whether&#xD;
      there are changes in activity and fitness in each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group - maintain current activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate continuous activity group - increase activity to 5 days a week, 40 minutes per&#xD;
           day, of continuous moderate activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High Intensity Interval Training group - increase activity to 5 days a week, 40 minutes&#xD;
           per day, of intervals of moderate and vigorous activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will wear an Apple watch, and participants in the exercise groups will use a&#xD;
      smartphone application to get feedback on activity and encouragement to reach activity goals.&#xD;
