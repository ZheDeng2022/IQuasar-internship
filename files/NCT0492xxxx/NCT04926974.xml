  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of novel mobile application&#xD;
      technologies (including Seeing AI, Aira, and Supervision+) to improve quality of life in&#xD;
      older adults with low vision by expanding community access and providing assistance with&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Aira provides real-time remote personal assistance through a&#xD;
      sighted Aira agent supplying direct feedback to assist with visual tasks. Seeing AI provides&#xD;
      optical character recognition allowing any text to be read aloud, color identification, bar&#xD;
      code reading, scene description, and facial recognition based on stored photos. Supervision +&#xD;
      allows one to use the phone as a magnifier, providing magnification and contrast enhancement&#xD;
      using the camera of the mobile phone. This study seeks to understand the potential of these&#xD;
      technologies to improve daily activities, community participation, independence, and&#xD;
      self-sufficiency in this group by examining a technological approach, which has not yet&#xD;
      undergone rigorous investigation in a diverse population of older adults with visual&#xD;
      impairment. Project objectives are to evaluate mobile applications in a wide range of visual&#xD;
      disability, categorized into three groups: (1) mild to moderate visual acuity loss, (2)&#xD;
      severe to profound visual acuity loss, and (3) legal blindness secondary to visual field&#xD;
      loss. Participants are randomized to one of three intervention groups: (1) Supervision+&#xD;
      application, (2) Aira application, or (3) Seeing AI application for a period of 6 months. For&#xD;
      the Aira intervention group, participants will be assigned either with 'restricted' access&#xD;
      (current open access areas plus 30 minutes/month anywhere), or 'unrestricted' access (700&#xD;
      minutes), for a period of 3 months with a 3 month cross-over period. Outcome measures include&#xD;
      assessment of changes at three- and six-months post-intervention for: visual ability, health&#xD;
      state (including depression), self-efficacy, loneliness, life space, distances travelled from&#xD;
      the home, and types of services obtained.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the person change score (before and after intervention), from the adaptive Massof Activity Inventory (AI) Questionnaire. The AI has an item bank of 510 items organized into 50 goals and 460 related visually-based tasks. Subscales range from 0 (not important) to 3 (very important). For those goals rated as important, subjects are asked to rate the task difficulty on subscales of 0 (impossible to do without help) to 5 (not difficult). Rasch analysis is employed to estimate visual ability from these difficulty ratings, on an interval scale. With Rasch analysis person measures are estimated, whereby a more positive person measure reflects greater visual ability.&#xD;
In this study, we will explore the the difference in person measures (i.e. change score) after the intervention at 3 and 6 months. A larger, more positive change score indicates greater visual ability since intervention.</description>
