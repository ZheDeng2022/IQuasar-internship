  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether radiation treatment directed at liver&#xD;
      metastases can be safely added to standard of care treatment for extensive stage small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The current standard treatment for people who have ES-SCLC is&#xD;
      chemotherapy including drugs called carboplatin and etoposide, that is combined with a type&#xD;
      of immunotherapy called atezolizumab. However, patients with liver involvement of their&#xD;
      ES-SCLC don't respond as well to this treatment. The study aims to answer whether adding&#xD;
      radiation directed at liver metastases can improve responses to standard chemo-immunotherapy&#xD;
      in this patient population. All study participants will get the same study intervention,&#xD;
      which will be chemo-immunotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical evidence for the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy is&#xD;
      more limited, numerous case reports, retrospective studies, early stage trials, and ongoing&#xD;
      prospective trials highlight the potential for combining radiation with immunotherapy in&#xD;
      augmenting the anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of liver lesions with&#xD;
      immunotherapy has been less well studied. Given the findings that patients with ES-SCLC and&#xD;
      liver involvement have a poor prognosis and a limited response to chemo-immunotherapy, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to augment the systemic anti-tumor immune response with RT targeted to&#xD;
      liver metastases administered in addition to standard of care treatment. Preclinical data and&#xD;
      prior clinical studies support the reasoning for these treatment approaches, and the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that combination RT with chemo-immunotherapy will lead to improved&#xD;
      local control and progression free survival in ES-SCLC patients with liver involvement.&#xD;

                  at the screening scan must receive radiation therapy and/or surgery for CNS&#xD;

         10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;&#xD;
                  1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of&#xD;
                  carboplatin and etoposide&#xD;
&#xD;

                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;

                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men&#xD;
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during treatment with chemotherapy (i.e.,&#xD;
                  carboplatin and etoposide) and for at least 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
                  chemotherapy to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Negative HIV test at screening, with the following exception: patients with a positive&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment.&#xD;
