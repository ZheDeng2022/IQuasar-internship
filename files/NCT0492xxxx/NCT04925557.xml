  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of Mayzent on microglia pathology in patients with active SPMS, as&#xD;
      compared to the active control group of MS patients treated with the Ocrevus, as measured by&#xD;
      changes in microglial activation in the lesional and non-lesional NAWM and NAGM and in the&#xD;
      peri-plaque area of chronic lesions in the brain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS), but many patients also undergo progressive atrophy, especially in the gray matter&#xD;
      (GM). GM atrophy plays a particularly prominent role in development of cognitive and physical&#xD;
      disability in MS. Evidence is mounting that there is a profound infiltration of activated&#xD;
      microglia and blood-borne macrophages throughout the lesions, whereas in slowly expanding&#xD;
      (smoldering) or chronic active expanding lesions, the microglia and macrophages are&#xD;
      concentrated as a dense rim around the lesions. Microglia is also activated, in a more&#xD;
      diffuse way, in the white matter (WM) and GM with concomitant axonal degeneration and&#xD;
      meningeal inflammation. Thus, chronic activation of microglia has been linked to&#xD;
      neurodegeneration in the progressive phase of the disease and development of brain atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No longitudinal studies in MS examined the association between development of&#xD;
      microglia-related pathology in patients treated with siponimod (Mayzent®). This will be the&#xD;
      first study to examine the treatment effect of Mayzent on microglia in MS.&#xD;
