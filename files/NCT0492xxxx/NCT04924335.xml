  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery-induced pain reveals its own metabolic and inflammatory responses, resulting in a&#xD;
      further increase in noxious pathways that are already occurring. Even though it is difficult&#xD;
      to distinguish whether the metabolic and inflammatory responses are pain-induced or&#xD;
      surgical-induced, it is clear that pain can cause a response. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of erector spinae plane block on surgery-related stress response with enhanced&#xD;
      recovery after cardiac surgery protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERAS Cardiac) program includes a perioperative&#xD;
      multimodal, opioid-sparing pain management plan as an essential component of any&#xD;
      comprehensive program. A multimodal pain management plan is nonopioid systemic analgesic&#xD;
      agents, regional and local anesthetic techniques, and judicious use of opioids. This study&#xD;
      aims to examine inflammatory and hematological parameters in patients who underwent cardiac&#xD;
      surgery with ERAS, with and without preoperative bilateral erector spinae plane block (ESP).&#xD;
      For this purpose, the presence of an obstacle ESP block application in the preoperative&#xD;
      period will be investigated in patients who are prepared for cardiac surgery according to&#xD;
      ERAS principles, and the patient's group will be determined accordingly. An analgesia&#xD;
      protocol that does not include a regional technique will be applied to the patient in cases&#xD;
      such as the patient's refusal to allow preoperative block and the presence of a situation&#xD;
      that does not allow blockage in the block area. The perioperative characteristics of ERAS&#xD;
      patients with and without ESP block will be examined, intraoperative lactate, and&#xD;
      preop-postoperative hemogram-albumin-C reactive protein parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS patients with ESP block: After preparation in accordance with the ERAS protocol,&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided bilateral ESP block will be performed with 20 ml of 0.025% bupivacaine at&#xD;
      T5-7 levels in patients taken to the operating room in the preoperative period, and will be&#xD;
      administered intraoperative low-dose remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS patients without ESP block: After preparation according to the ERAS protocol, patients&#xD;
      will be administered lidocaine, ketamine, paracetamol, and intraoperative low-dose&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane anesthesia.&#xD;
