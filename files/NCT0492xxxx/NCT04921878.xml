      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion study aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of mitoxantrone&#xD;
      hydrochloride liposome injection. This study consists of two phases: dose-escalation phase&#xD;
      and dose expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase will be conducted to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors based on a 3+3 design. Patients enrolled in this phase will&#xD;
      receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection followed by a 3-week DLT observation&#xD;
      period. After DLT observation, two to four dose cohorts will be selected for dose-expansion&#xD;
      to further explore the safety and efficacy of study drug according to the dose-escalation&#xD;
      results. In the dose-expansion phase, patients will receive the study drug every 3 weeks&#xD;
      (q3w, a cycle) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or withdrawal by&#xD;
      investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 6 cycles).&#xD;
