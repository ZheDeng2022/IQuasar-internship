  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to understand how insomnia contributes to chronic pain in&#xD;
      youth. Specifically, the investigators are interested in how insomnia and the treatment of&#xD;
      insomnia impact emotional states and the body's ability to efficiently modulate pain, either&#xD;
      to increase or decrease pain perception. It is hypothesized that insomnia is associated with&#xD;
      increased negative emotional states and impaired pain modulation, which will improve after&#xD;
      treatment of insomnia. In this project, the objectives are to 1) evaluate the role of pain&#xD;
      modulation as a potential mechanism through which insomnia impacts pain symptoms, and 2)&#xD;
      evaluate the role of negative affect as mediators of the impact of insomnia on pain&#xD;
      modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will consist of a baseline assessment, a 5 session (once per week)&#xD;
      virtual group cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention, and a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. Investigators will also ask teen participants to complete the consensus sleep&#xD;
      diary daily for 7 days prior to the baseline and follow up study visits. Assessment visits&#xD;
      will consist of two types of assessments, questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      (QST). Participating parents and teens will complete questionnaires (both child and parent&#xD;
      report) assessing the child's pain, sleep, and psycho-social variables. QST will assess pain&#xD;
      inhibition via conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and pain facilitation via temporal summation&#xD;
      (TS).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Heat pain threshold (test stimulus) will be assessed on the volar surface of the dominant forearm twice before before, during, and after immersion (for 1 minute) of the non-dominant hand in a circulated cold-water bath (conditioning stimulus) maintained at 5˚C ±1˚C. Heat pain threshold will be assessed via the method of limits. Subjects will be instructed to push a button as soon as the heat feels painful, which will stop the trial. Immediately before and after the CPM assessment, the subjects' non-dominant hand will be placed in a room-temperature water bath (20-25˚C) for 2 minutes. The CPM effect will be calculated as a difference score: heat pain threshold during conditioning stimulus minus baseline. A negative score indicates pain inhibition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Temporal Summation of Pain (TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation will be assessed via a series of 10 brief (~0.5s duration for peak, total time for heating, peak, and cooling &lt;1.5s) heat pulses (48˚C) delivered via a Medoc Thermal Sensory Analyzer-2 thermode positioned on the volar surface of the forearm. Time between each peak will be 3 seconds. Subjects will provide a verbal pain rating immediately after the first and last heat pulse is delivered. Pain ratings will be made on a 0-100 numerical rating scale (0=no pain, 100=most pain imaginable), which will be displayed during the assessment. Temporal summation will be calculated as a difference score (i.e., pain during final stimulus minus pain during initial stimulus), with a positive score indicating pain facilitation due to temporal summation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score on Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a 7 item screener for anxiety focused on symptoms of anxiety over the past week. Each item is scores on a 0-3 scale and summed to create a total score that ranges from 0-21.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score on Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 Adolescent Form (PHQ9-A).</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ9-A is a validated 9 item self-report scale (4-point Likert scale) assessing symptoms of depression. Scores range from 0-27 with 0-4 indicating no or minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20-27 severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>he PANAS is a 20-item self- and parent-report measure assessing positive and negative affect. Responses are made on a 5-point Likert scale. A separate score is calculated for negative (10 items) and positive (10 items) affect and higher scores reflect higher levels of experienced affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score on Pediatric Insomnia Severity Index (PISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PISI is a 6-item parent- and child-report scale measuring insomnia severity. Total scores range from 0-30 with higher scores reflecting greater insomnia severity.</description>

    <description>CBT-I will be delivered via 5 weekly virtual group therapy sessions. Session content is manualized and adapted from existing CBT-I protocols to be relevant to a virtual adolescent group and will include: Session 1 - Introduction of group members, group rules, psychoeducation regarding sleep, and instructions on completion of sleep log. Session 2 - Review sleep log, sleep hygiene, relaxation training, and stimulus control. Session 3 - Review sleep log, sleep restriction, and cognitive strategies (positive self-statements, worry management). Session 4 - Review sleep log and sleep restriction, and problem-solving barriers. Session 5 - Maintenance and relapse prevention.</description>
