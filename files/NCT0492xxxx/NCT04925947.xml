  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the study drug KN046 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced thymic carcinoma who progressed after prior treatment with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive KN046 intravenously at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression or&#xD;
      excessive toxicity for up to to two years, with the goal of this trial to contribute to the&#xD;
      development of active and well tolerated treatments for patients who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      treatment therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, molecules that combine PD-1 and CTLA-4 have been developed for patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer, with the hope that targeted therapy will be more effective than standard of care&#xD;
      therapies. KN046 is believed to be less toxic than other targeted therapies with an&#xD;
      assumption that the whole molecule can actively target tumor tissue for a much higher&#xD;
      affinity of the anti-PD-L1 portion and a weaker affinity for anti-CTLA-4, leading to less&#xD;
      autoimmune disorders and toxicities for patients than seen with other targeted therapies.&#xD;
