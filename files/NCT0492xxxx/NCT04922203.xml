  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1988, simulation has been proposed as a teaching tool in Anesthesia. The simulation&#xD;
      environment allows to teach learners non-technical skills which are a combination of&#xD;
      cognitive, social, and personal resources complementary to procedural skills that contribute&#xD;
      to an efficient and safe performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-technical skills traditionally used in Anesthesia are task management, situational&#xD;
      awareness, teamwork and decision making. They can be indirectly measured with validated&#xD;
      scales (e.g. Anesthesia Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) system). In addition to these basic&#xD;
      skills, specific skills such as Anesthesia Crisis Resource Management (ACRM) are required&#xD;
      when the patient presents a critical clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation, as proposed by Gaba, was initially practiced in centers specifically designed for&#xD;
      this purpose. More recently, we have proposed the model of in situ simulation, i.e. in the&#xD;
      usual workplace with the usual work team, as another option for the practice of simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many theories about the transfer of learning. Transfer can be defined as what&#xD;
      remains of the completed training that the learner actually uses, i.e. the final real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, almost 30 years after the introduction of simulation in the training of&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, data demonstrating the interest of this teaching in terms of transfer of&#xD;
      learning of non-technical skills to clinical practice or benefits for patients are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the transfer of non-technical skills taught&#xD;
      in a training program including in situ simulation to clinical practice by anesthesiology&#xD;
      residents.&#xD;
