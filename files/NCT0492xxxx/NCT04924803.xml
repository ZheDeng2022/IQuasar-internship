  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) experience disproportionate risk of being infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, yet due to stigma, fear of mistreatment, and&#xD;
      other factors, PWID are far less likely to be vaccinated compared to other populations. In&#xD;
      response, we propose to continue our collaboration with a prominent community based&#xD;
      organization serving African American and Latino PWID. Our project will explore baseline&#xD;
      hesitancy to vaccinate among PWID, identify barriers to vaccination, and then develop and&#xD;
      evaluate messaging designed to increase COVID-19 vaccination among our target population of&#xD;
      PWID through a clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) experience disproportionate risk of being infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Unfortunately, due to stigma, fear of&#xD;
      mistreatment, and other factors, PWID are far less likely to be vaccinated compared to other&#xD;
      populations. African American and Latino populations also face disproportionate risk of&#xD;
      infection and far greater COVID-19 death rates compared to White populations, yet due to&#xD;
      issues including longstanding medical mistrust are also far less likely to vaccinate. For&#xD;
      African American and Latino PWID, COVID-related risks increase even further and vaccination&#xD;
      becomes even more unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, we propose to continue our collaboration with New York Harm Reduction Educators&#xD;
      (NYHRE) a prominent New York City community based organization serving African American and&#xD;
      Latino PWID. To increase SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among our target population, we will first&#xD;
      assemble a community advisory board (CAB) that we will consult at all phases of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, we will recruit a separate sample of PWID (n=500) via respondent driven sampling to&#xD;
      evaluate intervention materials as part of a clinical trial. Upon enrollment, participants&#xD;
      will be offered a free vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Those who do not initially vaccinate&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of two intervention groups: a no video group, and a video text&#xD;
      group. The no video group will receive weekly text messages designed to address barriers to&#xD;
      vaccination identified in formative research. The video text group will receive the same&#xD;
      texts, along with links to videos we develop with NYHRE staff and clients to address barriers&#xD;
      to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our intervention will track response rates in both groups. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be vaccination within the initial weeks following enrollment and the&#xD;
      subsequent intervention period by treatment group. Additional outcomes will include&#xD;
      vaccination rates by demographic, including race/ethnicity and primary language (i.e. do&#xD;
      English speaking participants respond differently to specific intervention components&#xD;
      compared to monolingual Spanish speakers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If shown successful this approach can be replicated with additional populations that&#xD;
      experience health disparities, and in different languages across the United States.&#xD;
