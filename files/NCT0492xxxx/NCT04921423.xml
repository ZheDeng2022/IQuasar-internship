    <textblock>
      The effect of situational simulation teaching intervention on the attitude and empathy of&#xD;
      nursing students towards the elderly can be divided into two stages. The first stage is a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study on the aging knowledge, attitude and empathy of nursing students. The&#xD;
      second stage was the change of nursing students' attitude and empathy towards the elderly&#xD;
      after the intervention of situational simulation teaching. The intervention measures included&#xD;
      communication theory and skills, aging trend and knowledge, teaching plans for elderly&#xD;
      nursing, activities for the elderly and visual experience, application and debriefing of&#xD;
      empathy. This study collected and analyzed the data of aging knowledge, attitude and empathy&#xD;
      towards the elderly at the end of the term and one month later, in order to explore the&#xD;
      changes of attitude and empathy towards the elderly of nursing students after the&#xD;
      intervention of situational simulation teaching.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan has entered an aging society and will enter a super aging society in 2026. With the&#xD;
      increase of chronic diseases and aging of the elderly, they are gradually weakened. When they&#xD;
      are unable to take care of themselves in the future, the demand for institutional care is&#xD;
      increasing, and the future labor force is gradually decreasing. The training of care manpower&#xD;
      is facing a test. The purpose of this study is to explore the aging knowledge, attitude&#xD;
      towards the elderly and empathy of nursing students, and then to explore the change of&#xD;
      students' aging knowledge, attitude towards the elderly and empathy after the intervention of&#xD;
      simulated situational teaching course, and to explore the change of their willingness to join&#xD;
      the elderly career in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, a cross-sectional study was conducted to extract 139 nursing science&#xD;
      students from an Eastern college. In order to explore the aging knowledge, attitude and&#xD;
      empathy towards the elderly, and future career involvement willingness of nursing students,&#xD;
      Pearson product difference correlation analysis and Spearman grade correlation coefficient&#xD;
      analysis were used to predict the relationship between variables, and multiple linear&#xD;
      regression model was used to analyze the data. In the second stage of the study, the subjects&#xD;
      were the same as those in the first stage. The experimental group and the control group were&#xD;
      randomly assigned by drawing lots, with at least 51 participants. At the beginning, the end&#xD;
      and one month after the course, we explored the change of students' ability to take care of&#xD;
      the elderly and their willingness to devote to the elderly related career in the future. For&#xD;
      inferential analysis, independent sample t-test and chi square test were used to analyze&#xD;
      whether there were statistically significant differences in basic information, aging&#xD;
      knowledge and attitude towards the elderly between the intervention group and the control&#xD;
      group, and then generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to check the effectiveness of&#xD;
      situational simulation course after controlling relevant interference factors. It is expected&#xD;
      that nursing students can experience the inconvenience of daily life of the elderly in the&#xD;
      way of situational simulation, use empathy skills, carry out role play of teaching plan, and&#xD;
      simulate the care behavior and empathy of the elderly in the clinical situation, so as to&#xD;
      improve their willingness to choose jobs related to the elderly after graduation.&#xD;
