  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year with new cases costing an&#xD;
      estimated $111 million for acute inpatient, $75 million for post-acute inpatient, and $88&#xD;
      million for follow-up care over 6 months post-stroke. The investigators have previously&#xD;
      established the effectiveness of a backward walking training program to improve gait and&#xD;
      balance in post-stroke Veterans. To best serve Veterans in this era of personalized medicine,&#xD;
      there is a current need to determine the appropriate training dose as well as which&#xD;
      post-stroke Veterans would most benefit. This study addresses both needs as it will 1) test&#xD;
      responses to two different doses (18 vs. 27 sessions) of backward walking training and 2)&#xD;
      assess brain activity, measured by magnetic resonance imaging, before and after training&#xD;
      intervention to determine its ability to predict rehabilitation response as well as brain&#xD;
      mechanisms of behavioral change.&#xD;

      This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will enroll individuals between&#xD;
      2- and 4-months post-stroke and is designed to address the study's three Specific Aims (See&#xD;
      Figure below). The study will be approved by an ethics review board and all participants will&#xD;
      provide written informed consent. Baseline pre-intervention assessment (Assessment A) will&#xD;
      consist of clinical gait and balance assessments and resting state Functional Connectivity&#xD;
      MRI and functional MRI. Brain imaging at Assessment A will test the hypotheses that rs-FC and&#xD;
      fMRI can predict BWTraining intervention response (Specific Aim 2). Following Assessment A,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive 1) 18 sessions or 2) 27-sessions of BWTraining&#xD;
      3x/week for six or nine weeks respectively. Participants in the 18-session group will wait 3&#xD;
      weeks following randomization to begin training such that Assessment B will take place at&#xD;
      approximately the same time post-stroke for all participants. This will assure that all&#xD;
      participants have had the same duration of time post-stroke after study enrollment to&#xD;
      experience spontaneous recovery. Gait and balance measures at Assessment B will be compared&#xD;
      to Assessment A to test Specific Aim #1. MRI brain measurements at Assessment B will be&#xD;
      compared to those at Assessment A to test the hypotheses of exploratory Aim #3. Assessment C,&#xD;
      at six weeks post-intervention will evaluate short-term and Assessment D, at 6-months&#xD;
      post-intervention will evaluate long-term retention gains in gait and balance. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 54 individuals post-stroke to allow up to a 10% attrition rate and&#xD;
      still provide a sufficient participant pool (n=48) to address the Specific Aims.&#xD;
