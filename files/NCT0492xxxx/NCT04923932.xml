      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, open-label, phase II clinical study. The&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Savolitinib in the treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic Gastric Cancer and Esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma Patients&#xD;
      with MET gene amplifications. The study involves a Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a&#xD;
      Follow-up Period. It is planned that about 30 study sites will enroll 75 patients&#xD;
