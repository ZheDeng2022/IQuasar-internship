  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of chronic inflammatory rheumatism, including spondyloarthritis (SpA), has&#xD;
      been revolutionized in recent decades with the arrival of biological therapy. The success of&#xD;
      the current therapeutic strategy is also based on therapeutic compliance. If therapeutic&#xD;
      adherence in rheumatoid arthritis patient (RA) is only 66%, it seems even worse in SpA. Few&#xD;
      studies report quantitatively the adherence of SpA patients, as well as the predictive or&#xD;
      associated factors. The objective of this study is to assess the patient adherence to&#xD;
      biologics in patients with axial SpA (SpAax), and to investigate factors influencing this&#xD;
      adherence, in particular the association with vaccination coverage, dietary behavior, and&#xD;
      digital health tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicentric cross-sectional survey of patients seen in the context of a rheumatology&#xD;
      consultation or hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the occasion of a single visit in consultation or hospitalization, an anonymous&#xD;
      self-questionnaire will be distributed to patients undergoing SpAax follow-up to assess their&#xD;
      compliance with biologic drugs, their vaccination coverage, their diet, the presence of a&#xD;
      fibromyalgia syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal disorders, regular physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary lifestyle, the frequency and mode of use of mobile applications and/or&#xD;
      connected objects related to health, the presence of catastrophic thoughts and the presence&#xD;
      of anxiety and depressive disorders. Medical data relevant to routine care will be&#xD;
      collected.(Age, sex, weight, height, tobacco and alcohol use, disease characteristics, SpA&#xD;
      treatment, comorbidities)&#xD;

    <description>the Patient Catastrophing Scale (PCS) is a broad self report measure of pain catastrophizing and consists of 13 items scored using a 5-point Likert scales from 0 (never) to 4 (always) points. The total score for the PCS equals 52. Responses are summed to create a total score, with higher scores indicating greater pain catastrophizing levels. A score of more than 24 indicates a high level of catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>Proportions of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with good adherence to biologic treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression disorders were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS questionnaire is composed of two parts: one part includes 7 items for screening for depression; and a second one also includes 7 items for the screening for anxiety disorders. A score between 0 and 3 is assigned to each item. The score total per party varies between 0 and 21. Score ≥ 11 = Anxiety or depression confirmed.&#xD;
Proportion of patient who has HADS-anxiety and/or HADS-depression ≥ 11 and a GIRERD score = 0.</description>
