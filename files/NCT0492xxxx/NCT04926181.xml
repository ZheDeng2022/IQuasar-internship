  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the low androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity of treatment-emergent small&#xD;
      cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, there is persistent AR expression observed in the&#xD;
      majority of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) biopsies.&#xD;
      This indicates that epigenetic dysregulation leads to reprogramming away from an AR-driven&#xD;
      transcriptional program. Therefore, continuation of AR blockade in the form of apalutamide&#xD;
      may provide additive benefit compared to immune checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab will achieve a clinically&#xD;
      significant composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients&#xD;
      with evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single arm, Simon's two-stage evaluation of the combination of apalutamide&#xD;
      plus cetrelimab in patients with mCRPC and histologic and/or genomic evidence of&#xD;
      treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer who have previously progressed&#xD;
      on at least one prior androgen signaling inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue study treatment from the time of treatment initiation until&#xD;
      confirmed radiographic progressive disease (PD) per PCWG3 and RECIST 1.1 criteria,&#xD;
      unequivocal clinical progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first, for a maximum of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the composite response rate as defined by achieving one or more of the&#xD;
      following at any time point during study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decline from baseline in serum PSA of &gt;= 50% (PSA50), confirmed by repeat measurement &gt;=&#xD;
           4 weeks later and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine safety of the combination as determined by CTCAE version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the median radiographic progression-free survival by PCWG3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the PSA50 and decline from baseline in serum PSA of &gt;= 90% (PSA90) response&#xD;
      proportion achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the median PSA progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the median overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for safety evaluations 30 days and 100 days after treatment&#xD;
      completion. Patients will be followed for overall survival every 90 days (+/- 30 days) from&#xD;
      last dose of study treatment, until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
