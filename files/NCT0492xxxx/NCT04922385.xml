  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high rates and associated impairment of sexual concerns during the menopausal&#xD;
      transition, and specifically during perimenopause, our team has developed a CBT protocol&#xD;
      specifically designed to target these prevalent and distressing sexual concerns. The broad&#xD;
      aim of the proposed study is to validate this new protocol in a clinic that provides&#xD;
      empirically-supported assessment and intervention services for women with menopause-related&#xD;
      symptoms. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a four-week&#xD;
      individual CBT protocol in improving sexual satisfaction and reducing distress during&#xD;
      perimenopause. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of this CBT&#xD;
      protocol to improve sexual functioning (e.g., desire, arousal), relationship satisfaction,&#xD;
      and body image. Exploratory analyses will examine the impact on this CBT protocol on&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms, depression, and anxiety.&#xD;
