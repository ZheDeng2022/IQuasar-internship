      RATIONALE (STUDY PURPOSE) Recent publications report the experience with temporary placement&#xD;
      of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) in benign biliary strictures, which could offer&#xD;
      several advantages over conventional plastic biliary stents. Removability can be complicated&#xD;
      when there is tissue ingrowth through uncovered portions of the biliary SEMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a biodegradable stent would eliminate procedural risk and expense associated with&#xD;
      stent removal. In addition, a stent made of highly biocompatible material may be less prone&#xD;
      to induce hyperproliferative damage to the ductal system than would plastic or metal stents.&#xD;
      For biliary applications, biodegradable stents have been evaluated in several in-vitro and&#xD;
      animal studies that proved the stents for being safe and well tolerated. They provided an&#xD;
      adequate radial force and resulted in complete stricture resolution within several months.&#xD;
      The stents did not show any signs of biliary hyperplasia or integration in the epithelium.&#xD;
      Moreover, they seem to have a self-clearing effect on attached biofilm as the outer layer&#xD;
      sloughs during the degradation process similarly to the exfoliation of human skin. Also, the&#xD;
      stent could be removed from the bile duct, thus offering the possibility of extraction if&#xD;
      necessary, at various times after implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the&#xD;
      UNITY-B Biodegradable Balloon Expandable Biliary Stent System for draining obstructed biliary&#xD;
      ducts to improve bile flow in patients suffering under biliary strictures accompanied by&#xD;
      jaundice and pruritus or to maintain good clinical status for patients already drained by&#xD;
      PTBD or primary stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DEVICE The UNITY Balloon-expandable Biodegradable Biliary Stent System is comprised of&#xD;
      two main components: a balloon-expandable, biodegradable hybrid stent and an over-the-wire&#xD;
      balloon catheter delivery system. The UNITY-B System provides a means of safely advancing the&#xD;
      stent to the desired location within the common bile duct and, once in position, the stent is&#xD;
      deployed by inflating the balloon. The balloon expands to the nominal diameter under nominal&#xD;
      pressure. The process in which the UNITY- B stent degrades is through hydrolysis.&#xD;
      Implantation is endoscopally guided (ERCP) and stent advancement and deployment by virtue of&#xD;
      a guide wire and balloon catheter. In cases of altered anatomy this device can be used for&#xD;
      percutaneous transhepatic access as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION Patients with biliary strictures and suffer under jaundice associated with tea&#xD;
      color urine, pale stool and pruritus. Biliary drainage relieves both and improves related&#xD;
      symptoms like anorexia, diarrhea, and disturbed sleep pattern and leads to improved quality&#xD;
      of life. Patient with previous PTBD or stenting who need secondary stenting for prolonged&#xD;
      good clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT (Safety) The primary safety endoint is the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      experiencing biliary and procedural complications (post-ERCP pancreatitis, bleeding,&#xD;
      perforation (bile/duodenum), misplacement, migration, bile occlusion, duct abrasion, duodenal&#xD;
      abrasion, cholangitis, severe pain) and all-death within 30 days of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINT (Efficacy) Clinical success; normal serum bilirubin level within 14 days&#xD;
      after onset of drainage. Relief of jaundice and pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success; completion of initial ERCP and stent deployment. Procedural success;&#xD;
      rating of stent criteria. Each criteria will be evaluated and rated as 1 for exellent, 2 for&#xD;
      good, 3 for fair and 4 for poor.A procedure will be considered as successful if the combined&#xD;
      rate is &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life improvement by Self Assessment score at 1, 7, 14, 30, 90, 183, 274 and 365&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodegradation rate at 7, 14, 30, 90, 183, 274 and 365 days assesd by visual assessment at&#xD;
      each follow-up visits when adequate examinations (X-ray, Endoscopy, MRI, CT, …) are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compiled Complication Rate at 7, 14, 90, 183, 274 and 365 days.&#xD;
