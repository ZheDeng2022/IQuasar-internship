    <textblock>
      This study investigates parents' financial distress (worry or anxiety about money) during&#xD;
      their child's/adolescent's treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and whether it changes&#xD;
      over time; and also investigates what factors are associated with changes in financial&#xD;
      distress. Information gathered from this study may inform future intervention studies to&#xD;
      mitigate financial distress for parents of children/adolescents being treated for acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the trajectory of financial distress over time, as reported by parents of&#xD;
      children and adolescents ages 1 to 14.9 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), from&#xD;
      start to completion of ALL therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify factors associated with financial distress over time for families of children and&#xD;
      adolescents ages 1 to 14.9 years with newly diagnosed ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe domains of financial toxicity, informed by the conceptual framework guiding this&#xD;
      study, specifically treatment-related material hardship during treatment for pediatric ALL,&#xD;
      potential financial coping behaviors during treatment for pediatric ALL, and institutional&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In a sub-cohort of participants, qualitatively explore parental experiences of financial&#xD;
      distress and material hardship, and perceptions about financial screening/assessments during&#xD;
      their child's/adolescent's treatment for ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents complete surveys over 15-30 minutes at the beginning of index child's induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy, at the beginning of index child's maintenance chemotherapy, and after index&#xD;
      child's last chemotherapy. Parents may also complete interview over 30-45 minutes. Index&#xD;
      children's medical records are reviewed.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in financial distress</measure>
    <time_frame>From start through completion of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy, an average of 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Financial distress will be measured serially using the Personal Finance Wellbeing (PFW) scale (previously InCharge Financial Distress/Financial Well-Being scale). Scores on the PFW scale will be computed by adding numerical responses for each of the 8 questions, then dividing the total by 8. These cores can range from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating overwhelming financial distress and 10 indicating no financial distress.</description>
