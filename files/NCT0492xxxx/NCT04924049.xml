  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is the most effective treatment modality for the correction of&#xD;
      knee deformities, increasing the knee functions (KF), relieving pain, and improving quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) of patients. According to the health statistics of the Organisation for&#xD;
      Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), TKR is most commonly used in Sweden&#xD;
      (240/100,000), United States (226/100,000), and Austria (215/100,000), while this rate is&#xD;
      estimated as 67/100,000 in Turkey (OECD, 2017). Although it has been increasingly applied in&#xD;
      Turkey and worldwide, it is associated with postoperative pain, restricted range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), and reduced muscle strength, leading to prolonged recovery process and return to&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADLs) with impaired QoL . In addition, inadequate patient&#xD;
      education on knee care and ADLs following TKR may result in repetitive and uncontrollable&#xD;
      movements and complications such as severe pain and dislocation. Postoperative complications&#xD;
      have been shown to be associated with rehospitalization and redo surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive nursing care and patient education are essential to gain independence and&#xD;
      return ADLs for patients undergoing TKR. Patient education after TKR increases the success of&#xD;
      the operation, improving the healing period, and preventing or minimizing postoperative&#xD;
      complications after discharge. All these improve the KF and QoL of the patients. Patients are&#xD;
      usually discharged on the first postoperative day, if no complication occurs. Thus, the&#xD;
      patient education can be instructed within a very limited period of time, mostly without&#xD;
      repetition. Furthermore, patients and/or their relatives may be anxious after TKR and before&#xD;
      discharge, leading to difficulties in understanding the education fully or remembering the&#xD;
      education given in the hospital. As a result, the use of new technological education tools is&#xD;
      inevitable to use the time effectively for nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, disease-specific video-assisted education (VE) has been increasingly used&#xD;
      for patient education. This tool has certain advantages that patients can watch the video&#xD;
      repeatedly in every setting, until they understand its content and can remember the content&#xD;
      than verbal instructions without limitations of recall memory with decreased anxiety and&#xD;
      improved self-care abilities and, eventually, improved patient outcomes . In the present&#xD;
      study, we hypothesized that VE could improve the KF and QoL following TKR. Using a holistic&#xD;
      approach, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effect of VE on KF and QoL in patients&#xD;
      undergoing TKR.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function will evaluate using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation, after, 1st month and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of a total of 24 items including pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme). The highest possible scores which can be obtained are 20 for pain, 8 for stiffness, and 68 for physical function (difficulties experienced when engaging in ADLs). The total score ranges from 0 (the best) to 96 (the worst). Higher scores indicate worse KF, while lower scores indicate better KF.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life will evaluate using Short Form 36 Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation, after, 1st month and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures eight subscales using 36 self-rating questions including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. While making the evaluation, a total score is obtained for each subscale separately and these scores are ranges from minimum=0 and maximum=100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life, while lower scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>

    <description>The video-assisted education group also received routine treatment and care per protocol. Additionally, this patient group watched patient education through video in the patient room before TKR. The contents of the VE were developed by the researchers and included early postoperative care for TKR (knee positioning, early mobilization, pain control, and cold application), ADLs at home (bathing and toileting, eating, sleeping, vehicle driving, housekeeping, sexual life, praying, and maintaining home safety), and gradual exercise at home (for the first 90 days after discharge).</description>

    <description>Prior the study, the content and comprehensibility of the VE were evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon, two orthopedic nurses, and a physiotherapist who were not involved in the study and relevant amendments were made based on their suggestions. The preview of the final version of the VE was shown to four patients (10% of the sample) and these patients were excluded from the study. The patients were interviewed by phone calls on a weekly basis and watching VE at home, the frequency of watching VE, and doing home-based exercises were questioned.</description>
