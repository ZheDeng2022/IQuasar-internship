      MITOMICS aims to determine which RNA-Seq results (from muscle or fibroblasts) are the most&#xD;
      informative for the interpretation of VUS identified by WES for patients suspected of&#xD;
      mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of RNA-Seq and WES results will performed with a&#xD;
      computational approach using an autoencoder-based method&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are rare, clinically and genetically extremely heterogeneous,&#xD;
      caused by a deficit of energy production via the mitochondria. Mitochondria are dependent on&#xD;
      2 genomes mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA, and many pathogenic variants carried by these 2&#xD;
      genomes are responsible for mitochondrial diseases. The diagnostic strategies for MD patients&#xD;
      have evolved significantly with the emergence of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) also&#xD;
      accelerating the identification of the responsible gene. However, the diagnostic yield&#xD;
      remains limited and requires the development of new approaches. Previous studies showed that&#xD;
      WES and RNA-Seq combination improves the diagnosis of MD, essentially by helping in the&#xD;
      interpretation of identified VUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With MITOMICS project, we will included 66 patients suspected of a mitochondrial myopathy&#xD;
      (clinical, histological or biochemical), with a negative mtDNA and WES NGS in trio. For each&#xD;
      patient we will sequenced RNA from muscle and fibroblasts. Using a new innovative methology&#xD;
      of multi-OMICS integration we will determined which RNA-Seq data (from muscle or fibroblasts)&#xD;
      are the most informative for the interpretation of VUS identified by WES for patients&#xD;
      suspected of mitochondrial myopathy. The results obtained will allow the interpretation of&#xD;
      VUS and the identification of specific molecular signatures.&#xD;
