    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment&#xD;
      (OMT) procedures as an addition to current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in terms of enhancing the&#xD;
      immune response of participants as assessed by looking for increased levels and duration of&#xD;
      antibody titers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has taken many lives, caused millions to become ill, many hospitalized,&#xD;
      it has wreaked havoc on our economy, our mental states, and many other aspects of our lives.&#xD;
      Vaccines have provided the world with much needed relief against the pandemic but concerns of&#xD;
      vaccine escape and naturally waning antibody titers remain in place. The emergence of new&#xD;
      strains are a cause of concern. Standard vaccine protocol does not currently utilize the&#xD;
      osteopathic medical approach. It has yet to be seen if OMT improves the immune system's&#xD;
      response to the COVID-19 spike protein provided by vaccines. Prior research using OMT with&#xD;
      lymphatic treatments has shown improved outcomes for hospitalized patients, patients with&#xD;
      various diseases, and improved vaccine delivery for Hepatitis B vaccines. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will assess the effectiveness of the addition of OMT to COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      procedures. Individuals will be recruited from those who present at the WesternU vaccine&#xD;
      clinic for their first COVID-19 vaccination and from the incoming classes, current classes,&#xD;
      faculty, and staff of the 9 colleges at the university. Volunteers will be consented to the&#xD;
      study if they qualify and will be randomly assigned to either the control group who will only&#xD;
      receive their vaccinations or into the OMT intervention group who will receive OMT provided&#xD;
      by an osteopathic physician or an osteopathic OMM Teaching Fellow the day of each of their&#xD;
      two vaccinations and the day following the two vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline blood samples will be taken for all subjects enrolled in the study. These baseline&#xD;
      blood samples will be analyzed for IgG against nucleocapsid as a control to see if there was&#xD;
      any previous infection since this would not be present in vaccinated individuals who had&#xD;
      never been exposed and contracted COVID-19 and IgG against the spike protein which would help&#xD;
      to track the immunity built up in response to the vaccine. Both groups will then receive&#xD;
      their first vaccination and only the OMT intervention group will then undergo OMT after&#xD;
      receiving their vaccine. The OMT group will return the next day to receive treatments for a&#xD;
      second time. Both groups will have blood drawn for IgG vaccine titers against spike protein&#xD;
      at 7 days, 21 days, 28 days, 35 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Both groups will be&#xD;
      asked to report any side effects and any medications used to combat these side effects&#xD;
      throughout the entirety of the study. If a subject were to feel symptoms of COVID-19 during&#xD;
      the study they would be asked to take a RT-PCR test so that the infection could be verified&#xD;
      and tested for the strain type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OMT modalities that will be used include myofascial release of the thoracic inlet, pectoral&#xD;
      traction, diaphragm release with myofascial release, splenic pump, and thoracic pump. All&#xD;
      techniques will be performed on the individuals with each technique lasting a total of 1&#xD;
      minute and the entire treatment lasting a total of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary comparison will be the titer of antibodies at each point of each volunteer as&#xD;
      expressed as a percentage of the base line pre-vaccination titer between the intervention&#xD;
      group (receiving OMT) compared to the control group (not receiving OMT).&#xD;

    <description>OMT will include:&#xD;
Myofascial release of the thoracic inlet: gentle pressure applied to shoulders and neck to move the tissue in different directions with a gentle motion.&#xD;
Pectoral traction: The armpit will be contacted with the finger pads of the doctor and each side will be gently grasped and have a slow pulling force applied towards the shoulders.&#xD;
Diaphragm release with MFR: The doctor will touch below the ribs on each side and will apply gentle pressure and move the tissue from side to side.&#xD;
Splenic pump: below the ribs on the left hand-side, the doctor will apply pressure and release pressure several times to create a vibration over the area just below the ribs.&#xD;
Thoracic pump: The doctor will place their hands over the chest wall on each side and will apply pressure and release pressure several times to generate a pumping action of about 100 times in one minute.&#xD;
Treatment will last 5 minutes with each technique lasting 1 minute.</description>
