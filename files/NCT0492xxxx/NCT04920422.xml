  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are collecting more information to improve treatment of metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) with regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a cancer that starts in the large bowel and involves&#xD;
      the rectum (the lowest part of the gut) and has spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
      Regorafenib is available to treat patients with mCRC that have previously been treated with,&#xD;
      or are not considered candidates for, available therapies. It is an anti-cancer drug that&#xD;
      blocks several proteins called enzymes which are involved in the growth of cancer. It is&#xD;
      known that doctors may change the amount (the dose) of regorafenib they give, so that the&#xD;
      patients better tolerate the treatment. Little information is however available on the doses&#xD;
      of regorafenib given in Spain in usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers want to learn how and in which amount regorafenib is usually given&#xD;
      to patients with mCRC in Spain. They aim to identify the starting dose of regorafenib and to&#xD;
      describe dosing patterns during the first two four-week treatment periods (cycles) according&#xD;
      to usual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, the researchers will look back at cases that have already happened&#xD;
      when the study begins. Medical history data from the day of diagnosis of the mCRC until the&#xD;
      day prior to the inclusion in the study is collected from the medical records of adult&#xD;
      patients with mCRC. All patients must have started their treatment with regorafenib since&#xD;
      January 2017 and have taken regorafenib for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect the information between around June 2021 until around November&#xD;
      2021. The final report is planned to be available in July 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational products will be administered in this study. Moreover, no additional&#xD;
      visits or laboratory tests will be performed apart from the usual tests/treatments done in&#xD;
      usual practice.&#xD;
