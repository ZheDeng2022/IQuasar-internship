  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study was to compare the bone height changes around three implant telescopic, locator,&#xD;
      and ball retained mandibular overdentures. radiographic changes in peri-implant tissue in&#xD;
      three groups were evaluated&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four completely edentulous patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      Removable Prosthodontics Cairo University. All patients recruited were seeking to install&#xD;
      implants in their lower jaw, and have to meet the following inclusion criteria: age ranging&#xD;
      from 50 to 69 years old, patients should have no contra-indication for implant installation,&#xD;
      all patients should perform a glycosylated hemoglobin analysis and only up to 8 were included&#xD;
      in the study. All patients had to sign an informed consent before the start of the study, and&#xD;
      have to comply with the assigned follow-ups. Patients with any contraindications for implant&#xD;
      placement or those who didn't comply with the follow ups were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included had maxillary and mandibular complete dentures fabricated following the&#xD;
      conventional steps, after a period of 6 weeks adaptation, all patients were ready for implant&#xD;
      installation. The lower denture was duplicated into a radiographic stent, having radio-opaque&#xD;
      markers in the areas of implant installation. All patients had a CBCT x ray wearing the&#xD;
      radiographic stent, to allow for proper implant planning and to visualize the height and&#xD;
      width of the osteotomy site. The radiographic stent was then modified to a surgical stent by&#xD;
      making a tunnel corresponding to the site of implant installation. All Patients in this study&#xD;
      received three implants in the lower jaw at the premolar-canine area bilaterally and one&#xD;
      implant in the midline at the central incisor area.&#xD;

    <description>The Digora software was then used to measure bone height changes on the mesial and distal surface of each implant. The Digora software was then used to measure bone height changes on the mesial and distal surface of each implant. The implant in the peri-apical x ray was calibrated by drawing a line from the junction of the implant and abutment to the apical end of the implant, this line was the calibration line corresponding to the implant real length which was 11.5mm. After the implant was calibrated, a line was drawn on each implant surface; at the mesial and distal surface starting from the first implant thread to bone contact to the apical implant thread to bone contact. The line drawn would correspond to the bone height on each surface . Two blinded operators have carried out the assessment of bone height changes in order to have accurate results.</description>
