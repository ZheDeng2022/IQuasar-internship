  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malformations of the heart are common; 1.35 million infants are born each year with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease. Many of these defects carry a considerable threat to the&#xD;
      individual's quality of life as well as survival. Along with focused medical management,&#xD;
      surgical repair remains a standard of care for more than 25,000 infants and children each&#xD;
      year in the United States and Canada. The care of individuals with congenital heart disease&#xD;
      is highly complex and has significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Most cardiac&#xD;
      operations require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, also known as the heart-lung&#xD;
      machine) to safely access the inner chambers of the heart. CPB itself has been well&#xD;
      documented to cause significant inflammation and hemodilution as the individual's blood is&#xD;
      passed through a foreign circuit. This inflammatory response can lead to fluid overload,&#xD;
      distributive shock and potential end-organ dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain,&#xD;
      liver or bowels. These organ dysfunctions may culminate in post-operative low cardiac output&#xD;
      syndrome (LCOS), prolonged ventilation time, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay and can&#xD;
      contribute to mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dampening the inflammatory response from CPB has been a focus of research interest for years.&#xD;
      Intra-operative ultrafiltration has been used to remove excess fluids and filter off&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines during cardiac operations. Over 90% of children's heart centers in the&#xD;
      world utilize some form of ultrafiltration (mostly some form of modified ultrafiltration),&#xD;
      but there are wide variations in published ultrafiltration protocols (none of which are&#xD;
      combination SBUF-SMUF in children). Ultimately, this project seeks to provide high-quality&#xD;
      evidence that the immunologic and clinical effects of combination SBUF-SMUF are rate&#xD;
      dependent. Therefore, a randomized study directly comparing a high-exchange SBUF-SMUF&#xD;
      (60ml/kg/hr) and a low-exchange SBUF-SMUF (6ml/kg/hr) can identify which is the optimal&#xD;
      ultrafiltration protocol to enhance post-operative clinical outcomes for this patient&#xD;
      population. The expected data and results could be immediately applicable to improve recovery&#xD;
      after heart surgery for infants and children across Canada and the rest of the world at&#xD;
      large.&#xD;
