      This is a randomized, multiple-dose, open-label, parallel-group study. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to study drug&#xD;
      administration. Approximately 280 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1&#xD;
      of 2 treatment groups. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facilities the day before&#xD;
      dosing (Day 0), and will be randomized and receive the first dosing on Day 1. Subjects will&#xD;
      stay at site till Day 2 after PK collection. All subjects will return to the clinical sites&#xD;
      at designated study days for dosing, PK sample collections and assigned clinical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects randomized to LY03010 treatment group will receive the first dose of 351 mg&#xD;
      LY03010 by IM injection on Day 1 in the deltoid muscle, followed by five (5) monthly dosing&#xD;
      of 156 mg LY03010 in the gluteal muscle with the last dose on Day 141. All subjects&#xD;
      randomized to SUSTENNA treatment group will receive the first dose of 234 mg SUSTENNA by IM&#xD;
      injection on Day 1 in the deltoid muscle, and a second IM dose of 156 mg SUSTENNA on Day 8 in&#xD;
      the deltoid muscle, followed by five (5) monthly IM dosing of 156 mg of SUSTENNA in the&#xD;
      gluteal muscle with the last dose on Day 148.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study (EOS) visit for LY03010 treatment group will be on Day 169, 28 days after last&#xD;
      dosing day; End of Study for SUSTENNA treatment group will be on Day 176, 28 days after last&#xD;
      dosing. At EOS visit, subjects will complete the study after a series of assigned clinical&#xD;
      assessments. A 30-day follow up call will be conducted by the clinical research staff to&#xD;
      ensure participant's well-being.&#xD;
