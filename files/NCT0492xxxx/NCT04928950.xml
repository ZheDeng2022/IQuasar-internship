  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study serves as the preliminary step to prove safety of oral activated&#xD;
      charcoal (OAC) in patients with solid tumors before moving to a hematologic malignancy&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TEMLA (Transcervical Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy) is a procedure for mediastinal&#xD;
      lymph node sampling to stage patients with lung cancer. All patients receive a dose of IV&#xD;
      antibiotic pre-procedure to prevent infection. The concept of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      protect the gut microbiome against detrimental effects of the antibiotic using oral activated&#xD;
      charcoal as a potent adsorbent with no absorption. Oral activated charcoal (OAC) binds to the&#xD;
      fraction of IV antibiotic that reaches the lumen of the gut without interfering with its&#xD;
      desired systemic effects. The conceptual goal is to prevent dysbiosis by protecting the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. Dysbiosis is the leading cause of C. difficile infection and a number of other&#xD;
      adverse clinical outcomes such as antibiotic resistance.&#xD;

    <description>Activated Charcoal, Powder, USP is carbon that has been treated to create low-volume pores that increase the area available for chemical reactions and adsorption. The most common pharmaceutical uses of activated charcoal is as a purification agent and antitoxin.
