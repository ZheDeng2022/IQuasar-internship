      The purpose of this study is to access the clinical characteristics and risk factors for&#xD;
      neurological sequelae after acute carbon monoxide poisoning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, patients meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria would be given informed consent and entry the study. The data will be collected&#xD;
      according to self-designed questionnaire, including :1) The baseline characteristics: would&#xD;
      be recorded 6 hours after patients presentation;2) Patients' self evaluation for discomfort&#xD;
      symptoms: would be recorded at day 0, week 1, 3 and 6, month 6 and 12；3) Neurological&#xD;
      function: would be recorded at day 0, week 6, month 6 and 12.&#xD;
