  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, alcohol consumption is the second most common cause of so-called preventable&#xD;
      cancers after tobacco. Since 2014, in the &quot;Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur&quot; (PACA) region, the&#xD;
      association Santé! has been developing an innovative intervention to support people suffering&#xD;
      from alcohol-related addiction. This intervention, called IACA! must therefore be evaluated&#xD;
      on a larger scale before conclusions about its effectiveness can be drawn from a comparative&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation requires significant human and material resources. It is therefore&#xD;
      recommended to first assess the transferability of IACA! in other care centers in a pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, 11% of cancers in men and 4.5% of cancers in women are attributed to alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. It is the second leading cause of so-called preventable cancers, accounting for&#xD;
      28,000 alcohol-related cancers out of 352,000 new cases of cancer affecting annually adults&#xD;
      (over 30 years of age). Overall, alcohol is among the top 3 factors contributing to&#xD;
      Disability-Adjusted life year (DALYs) in France in 2017. Some cancer risks can be quantified&#xD;
      as early as one drink a day (oesophagus, oral cavity, pharynx and breast in women). However,&#xD;
      the risks associated with alcohol consumption remain influenced by the quantities consumed.&#xD;
      There is therefore an interest, particularly for consumers of the largest quantities, in&#xD;
      reducing the quantities consumed. In Europe, while people who drink more than 60 g/d of&#xD;
      alcohol for men and 40 g/d for women are estimated to represent only 16.1% of the population&#xD;
      for men and 9.3% for women, they represent 87% and 82% of alcohol-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality respectively. Subjects with addiction (or substance use disorders) have an&#xD;
      increased risk of social harm (1.5 to 3 times that of alcohol users without addiction), a&#xD;
      higher mortality (1.4 to 6.5 compared to the general population) with a life expectancy of 9&#xD;
      to 20 years shorter than that of the general population. Moreover, even if the quantities&#xD;
      consumed are not a valid individual diagnostic criterion, studies show a strong association&#xD;
      between the quantity consumed and the diagnosis of addiction. Finally, some studies suggest&#xD;
      that the prevalence of secondary harm from alcohol use follows an exponential curve as a&#xD;
      function of alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2014, in the PACA region, the association Santé! has been developing an intervention to&#xD;
      support people suffering from alcohol-related addiction. This intervention, called IACA!&#xD;
      (Integrating and supporting alcohol consumption), differs from the support provided during&#xD;
      rehabilitation cures and aims to: fight against discrimination and exclusion of people who&#xD;
      drink alcohol, re-engage these individuals in the care process (because they have generally&#xD;
      left it) by using the appropriate levers, promote well-being, improve quality of life and&#xD;
      recovery and support the recovery in control of consumption. Thus, IACA!, through its&#xD;
      philosophy and implementation, is based both on the risk reduction approach historically&#xD;
      deployed with drug users and on the recovery approach, developed in the field of mental&#xD;
      health. The first one-year results of this program were promising since, of 17 people who&#xD;
      received the intervention, all had a social or health benefit, 13 of whom were associated&#xD;
      with stabilization (n=4), reduction (n=7) or cessation (n=2) of alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These promising results must therefore be evaluated on a larger scale before conclusions&#xD;
      about its effectiveness can be drawn from a comparative trial. This type of evaluation&#xD;
      requires significant human and material resources. It is therefore recommended to first&#xD;
      assess in the field: 1) the conditions under which such an intervention is deployed in other&#xD;
      centres (adaptations implemented by other centres to deploy IACA! for example, without&#xD;
      distorting the intervention), 2) the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention in&#xD;
      other centres (are the human and material resources on site sufficient for the successful&#xD;
      deployment of the intervention?), 3) the acceptability and feasibility of the large-scale&#xD;
      evaluation envisaged.&#xD;

        This research will investigate three types of populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals receiving support from the IACA! Intervention (called beneficiaries),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Professionals implementing the IACA! Intervention i.e. the pairs in charge of&#xD;
             accompanying the beneficiaries in the centers as well as the persons in charge of&#xD;
             these centers,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Professionals from Santé! supporting the deployment of the IACA! intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The beneficiaries are all persons integrating the program in the project's partner sites&#xD;
        and consuming alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The professionals will be specialized educators, social workers, nurses, social and&#xD;
        solidarity economy advisors, etc.&#xD;

        participated in the implementation of IACA!&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The beneficiaries will be excluded if they have a severe somatic or psychiatric pathology&#xD;
        that is incompatible with understanding the assessment tools; difficulty understanding&#xD;
        and/or writing French; if they are unreachable by telephone, if they are participating in&#xD;
