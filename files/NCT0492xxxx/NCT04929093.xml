  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen specific immunotherapy is currently the only curative intervention for allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis (AR). Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) need to be reinstituted with an interruption&#xD;
      of more than 16 weeks in maintenance period, leading to increased time and economic cost&#xD;
      burden and difficulties for continuing further treatment for patients. The aim of present&#xD;
      study was to develop a novel dose adjustment schedule for such situation and to compare the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and adverse reactions between novel and conventional schedules for dust&#xD;
      mite (DM) SCIT of AR subjects.&#xD;

    <measure>The change of Combined Symptom and Medication Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3, week 6, week 26.</time_frame>
    <description>CSMS which was calculated as follows: (total nasal symptom scores (TNSS))/4+ MS as recommended by European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Position Paper. The CSMS score was 0-6, 0 for good therapeutic effect and 6 for poor therapeutic effect.</description>

    <measure>The change of total nasal symptom scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3, week 6, week 26.</time_frame>
    <description>last 7 days' overall symptom scores of major nasal symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea: 0, no symptoms; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, serious). TNSS scores was 0 to 12 (0 = no symptoms;12 = most severe symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of medication score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 26.</time_frame>
    <description>MS was calculated as follows: 1, oral Clarityne tablet; 2, intranasal Budesonide nasal spray.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>week 26.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were instructed to immediately report to the physician if any symptom appeared or adverse reactions occurred during the observation period. The time and severity of onset, estimation of a possible reason, resolution, and outcome should be recorded. The adverse reactions were classified in terms of the localization (local or systemic) and the time of appearance (immediate or delayed). Local reactions (LRs) were expressed as the length of the wheal diameter. Systemic reactions (SRs) were graded in accordance with the standards of the EAACI</description>
