  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority phase IIa trial to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of dupilumab use in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 eligible subject will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      either dupilumab or placebo, stratifying on the disease severity measured by the required&#xD;
      oxygen ≤ 15L or &gt; 15L by nasal cannula. Both arms will receive standard of care management&#xD;
      per current National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 treatment guidelines (8) in addition&#xD;
      to their randomized treatments. Patients will be followed prospectively for up to 60 days&#xD;
      after enrollment.&#xD;
