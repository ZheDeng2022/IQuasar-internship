  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being overweight or obese has been associated with insulin resistance contributing to an&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of type II diabetes. Food intake, metabolic rate, and&#xD;
      blood glucose levels are regulated by the autonomic nervous system, including the vagus&#xD;
      nerve. This study evaluates the hypothesis that non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (taVNS) affects hormones that regulate food intake and blood glucose levels&#xD;
      in a way that is consistent with reduced food intake and lower blood glucose levels. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that these effects of taVNS depend on body weight. In a&#xD;
      cross-over design generally healthy study participants will receive either taVNS or a sham&#xD;
      intervention for 30 minutes on two separate study days. The order of the intervention on the&#xD;
      two study days will be randomized and the two study days are at least one week apart. Based&#xD;
      on body mass index (BMI) study participants are assigned to either a normal weight (BMI&lt;25),&#xD;
      overweight (BMI&lt;30), or obese (BMI&gt;30) group. Capillary blood samples taken by finger prick&#xD;
      before and after the intervention on each study day will be analyzed for blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration and hormones that are linked to food intake and blood glucose levels. In&#xD;
      addition, autonomic function will be assessed by heart rate variability analysis of ECG&#xD;
      recordings obtained before, during, and after the intervention on each study day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies and experimental studies in animals have demonstrated that cervical vagus&#xD;
      nerve stimulation causes weight loss in obese patients and has profound effects on glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis. Furthermore, anorexic and antidiabetic effects have been reported in response to&#xD;
      non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). Thus, non-invasive&#xD;
      taVNS may potentially prevent insulin resistance in obesity. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the acute effects of taVNS on hormones and adipokines linking obesity with&#xD;
      insulin resistance in human subjects. The hypothesis of this study is that acute application&#xD;
      of taVNS elicits anti-diabetic effects through modulation of plasma levels of insulin,&#xD;
      glucagon, C-peptide, GLP-1 (stimulates insulin and suppresses glucagon release), and GIP&#xD;
      (gastric inhibitory polypeptide, stimulates insulin secretion). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that taVNS elicits anorexic effects by modulating ghrelin and&#xD;
      leptin plasma levels. Finally the investigators hypothesize that taVNS may reduce the impact&#xD;
      of obesity on insulin resistance by modulating PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1;&#xD;
      increased in obesity and metabolic syndrome), resistin (adipose tissue secretory factor,&#xD;
      suggested to link obesity with insulin resistance), vistatin (enriched in visceral fat and&#xD;
      may stimulate the insulin receptor), adipsin (secreted from adipocytes; improves Î²-cell&#xD;
      function), and adiponectin (secreted from adipose tissue; increases insulin sensitivity). In&#xD;
      normal weight (BMI&lt;25, n=14), overweight (BMI&lt;30, n=14), and obese (BMI&gt;30, n=14) and&#xD;
      otherwise healthy study participants blood glucose levels and plasma concentrations (finger&#xD;
      prick blood sampling) of insulin, glucagon, C-peptide, GLP-1, GIP, ghrelin, leptin, PAI-1,&#xD;
      resistin, vistatin (Bio-Plex kit 171A7001M), adipsin, and adiponectin (Bio-Plex kit&#xD;
      171A7002M) will be determined before and after 30 minutes of taVNS (EMS 7500, 10 Hz, 300ms,&#xD;
      n=7 in each body weight group) or sham taVNS (control experiment, n=7 in each body weight&#xD;
      group). Before, during and after taVNS or sham taVNS autonomic function will be assessed by&#xD;
      heart rate variability analysis from ECG recordings. The investigators expect that the&#xD;
      outcome of this study will demonstrate that taVNS lowers blood glucose levels and elicits&#xD;
      hormone/adipokine responses consistent with anorexia and improved insulin resistance. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that these effects of taVNS will be more pronounced in&#xD;
      obese compared to overweight and normal weight study participants.&#xD;

    <description>A bipolar clip electrode is attached to the auricle at the location of the cymba conchae. Electrical stimulation (30 Hz stimulation frequency, 300 Î¼s pulse width) is applied for 30 min. The stimulation current is determined individually for each participant by slowly increasing the stimulation current until the participants feel a mild tingling sensation at the site of the electrode. Then the current is gradually reduced until the tingling sensation disappears. This current will then be used for taVNS. A TENS 7000 or EMS 7500 device (510(k): K080661) is used.</description>
