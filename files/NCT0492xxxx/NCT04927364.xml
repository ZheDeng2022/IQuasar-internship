  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) augmented&#xD;
      with dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) skills as a treatment for Veterans with an alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder (AUD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 60% of those with AUD will experience a major relapse period within 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment, irrespective of the intervention (psychosocial and/or pharmacological) employed.&#xD;
      Consequently, the high prevalence of AUD and relapse following treatment in Veterans is&#xD;
      associated with substantial resource allocation and costs for the VA Health Care System.&#xD;
      Current pharmacological and psychosocial interventions demonstrate only a moderate level of&#xD;
      efficacy, which is reflected in the high rate of relapse in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS is a neurostimulation method that is at the forefront of innovative, non-invasive, and&#xD;
      safe treatments for AUD, and other psychiatric disorders. To reduce the high rate of relapse&#xD;
      in Veterans with AUD, it is necessary for interventions to more effectively address the&#xD;
      associated neurobiological dysfunction and explore ways to enhance these interventions.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that TMS is a promising new intervention for AUD, but an&#xD;
      emerging body of work is demonstrating that the effects of TMS may be enhanced by combining&#xD;
      it with behavioral therapy. As such, we proposed a combined TMS and dialectical behavior&#xD;
      therapy approach for Veterans with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBT is an evidence-based psychotherapy that combines standard cognitive-behavioral techniques&#xD;
      for emotion regulation and distress tolerance with contemplative mindfulness practices to&#xD;
      enhance skills necessary to identify and change negative thinking patterns and pushes for&#xD;
      positive behavioral changes. DBT has been robustly demonstrated to be efficacious in treating&#xD;
      depression, other mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder, binge-eating disorders, alcohol, and drug use disorders, and traumatic brain&#xD;
      injuries. Additional controlled studies are needed to determine if combining DBT skills with&#xD;
      other effective treatments for AUD are effective in promoting sustained abstinence.&#xD;

    <description>Participants' ratings on standardized emotional regulation measures will be compared pre-treatment and post-treatment. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) with a minimum score of 10 and a maximum score of 70 will be administered. Participants will also complete the Brief COPE inventory to assess a range of coping strategies. The scoring for both measures computes a separate score for each strategy and the higher the score, the greater the use of that strategy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will be open to male and females, regardless of race and ethnic origin,&#xD;
             21-70 years of age, who are in active treatment for an AUD at the VAPAHCS, Foundations&#xD;
             of Recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th&#xD;
             Edition (DSM-5) criteria for AUD, and alcohol is self-identified as the primary&#xD;
             substance of misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to read, verbalize understanding, and voluntarily sign the Informed Consent Form&#xD;

             clinically contraindicated to require participants to discontinue such medications for&#xD;
             research. rTMS is safely administered to individuals who are taking psychotropic&#xD;
             medications that do not lower seizure threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
