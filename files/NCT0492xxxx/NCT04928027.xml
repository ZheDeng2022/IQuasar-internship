      The investigators are conducting a study to compare the self-reports of executive functions&#xD;
      (that is to say, what role cognitive processes such as working memory and attention) in&#xD;
      persons with Parkinson's Disease to the reports of executive functions completed by their&#xD;
      significant others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct this study, the investigators need the participation of persons who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with Parkinson's Disease and their significant others.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the self-reported executive&#xD;
      functions (EFs) in persons with Parkinsons disease (PD) and their significant others.&#xD;
      Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as attention, inhibition, working&#xD;
      memory, and cognitive flexibility. As this proposed study will test not only cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, but specific aspects of it (i.e., EFs) without excluding persons with PD who&#xD;
      have identified cognitive impairments, outcomes gathered could provide valuable information&#xD;
      to better assist all types of persons with PD. Comparing their self-reported EFs to the EF&#xD;
      ratings completedy by their signifiant others can help determine if a disparity exists&#xD;
      between self-perceptions and actual observed EF abilties. This study would assess EFs through&#xD;
      inhibition responses of participants via computerized versions the Comprehensive Executive&#xD;
      Function Inventory-Adult Self-Report and Observer forms.&#xD;

        Parkinson's group: Adults with a Parkinson's disease diagnosis and their significant&#xD;
        others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy elderly: no history of neurologic disease (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 30-79 years with no history of other neurologic diseases, orthopedic, or arthritic&#xD;
        conditions that preclude ability to walk&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some of the earliest cognitive symptoms of Parkinsonism involve executive function deficits&#xD;
        (e.g., working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning; Williams-Gray, Foltynie, Lewis, and&#xD;
        Barker, 2006). What is less understood, however, is whether a relationship exists between&#xD;
        the self-reported EFs in persons with Parkinsonism and their significant others. The need&#xD;
        for research to investigate the relationship between EFs in persons with Parkinsonism is&#xD;
        evident in the limited body of literature currently available.&#xD;
