  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome (OSA). It consists of a pressure generator connected to a mask applied to the&#xD;
      patient's face. CPAP treatment is restrictive, and nearly a quarter of patients abandon it&#xD;
      over the long term. Various factors can influence adherence to CPAP therapy, including&#xD;
      adverse events associated with the mask. However, it is clear that compliance with CPAP&#xD;
      treatment, even if it has tended to improve over the last 30 years, is still sub-optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air Liquide Medical Systems has developed a mask that aims to improve comfort and ease of use&#xD;
      for the patient. This leaky nasal mask has a &quot;silent&quot; intentional leak port, which&#xD;
      significantly reduces the noise caused by the escape of air. The noise associated with&#xD;
      intentional leakage is one of the discomforts reported by patients and their spouses. In&#xD;
      addition, this mask is equipped with a new generation headgear with adjustment indicators to&#xD;
      assist the patient in fitting the mask. Optimal headgear fit is a prerequisite for comfort&#xD;
      during treatment, as it reduces unintentional leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate, through a questionnaire, the comfort and general&#xD;
      appreciation of a nasal mask equipped with a silent leak system and a headgear with&#xD;
      adjustment aids, of patients with OSA treated with CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the appearance of CPAP side effects related to the mask,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect the patient's appreciation of the mask headgear,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the discomfort caused by the nasal obstruction reported by the patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the daytime sleepiness of the patient,&#xD;

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome (OSA). It consists of a pressure generator connected to a mask applied to the&#xD;
      patient's face. CPAP treatment is restrictive, and nearly a quarter of patients abandon it&#xD;
      over the long term. Various factors can influence adherence to CPAP therapy, including&#xD;
      adverse events associated with the mask. Unintentional leaks, i.e. a leak between the&#xD;
      pressure generator and the patient's upper airway, are among the most frequent. Therefore,&#xD;
      optimizing the choice of mask is one of the main means used by medical-technical providers,&#xD;
      in charge of installing CPAP and its technical follow-up at home. In order to cover the needs&#xD;
      and anatomical particularities of the OSA patient population treated with CPAP, a large&#xD;
      number of mask types and sizes are currently available on the market. However, it is clear&#xD;
      that compliance with CPAP treatment, even if it has tended to improve over the last 30 years,&#xD;
      is still sub-optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air Liquide Medical Systems has developed a mask that aims to improve comfort and ease of use&#xD;
      for the patient. This leaky nasal mask has a &quot;silent&quot; intentional leak port, which&#xD;
      significantly reduces the noise caused by the escape of air. The noise associated with&#xD;
      intentional leakage is one of the discomforts reported by patients and their spouses. In&#xD;
      addition, this mask is equipped with a new generation headgear with adjustment indicators to&#xD;
      assist the patient in fitting the mask. Optimal headgear fit is a prerequisite for comfort&#xD;
      during treatment, as it reduces unintentional leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate, through a questionnaire, the comfort and general&#xD;
      appreciation of a nasal mask equipped with a silent leak system and a headgear with&#xD;
      adjustment aids, of patients with OSA treated with CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 days of use, secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the appearance of CPAP side effects related to the mask (air leaks, injury&#xD;
           to the nasal bridge, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect the patient's appreciation of the mask headgear, which includes indications&#xD;
           to help with the installation in the form of graduated markers, as well as the&#xD;
           appreciation of the general aesthetics of the mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the discomfort caused by the nasal obstruction reported by the patient, in&#xD;
           relation to the inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the daytime sleepiness of the patient, compared to the inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To study the parameters of the CPAP treatment.&#xD;
