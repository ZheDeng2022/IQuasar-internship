      This study is to compare the continuous use of nutritional support with the use of approved&#xD;
      oral nutritional supplements to reach protein and energy goals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a strong and independent long-term risk factor for mortality,&#xD;
      rehospitalisation and functional decline, particularly in the elderly, polymorbid medical&#xD;
      patient population. The randomized-controlled Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty,&#xD;
      Functional Outcomes and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT, Lancet&#xD;
      2019) included 2028 patients in eight Swiss hospitals and found that nutritional support&#xD;
      during the inhospital stay reduces very efficiently the risk for complications and mortality&#xD;
      with numbers needed to treat (NNT) of 23 and 37, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, the nutritional intervention was not continued after hospital discharge of patients and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up data of patients showed a lack of sustained effect of the initial&#xD;
      nutritional support strategy. There is a current lack of trial data investigating whether&#xD;
      long-term use of nutritional support has a sustained effect on clinical outcomes in this&#xD;
      patient population. This study is to compare the continuous use of nutritional support with&#xD;
      the use of approved oral nutritional supplements to reach protein and energy goals and to&#xD;
      analyze whether medical patients at nutritional risk show a sustained benefit from long-term&#xD;
      nutritional support after hospital discharge, and why and how nutritional support affects the&#xD;
      course of disease from a mechanistic physio-pathological standpoint.&#xD;
