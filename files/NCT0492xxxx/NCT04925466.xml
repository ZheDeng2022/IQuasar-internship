  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compliance of continuous positive airway pressure （CPAP） derived from auto-titration is&#xD;
      similar to that derived from manual titration, although pressure derived from the former was&#xD;
      usually 2-5 cmH2O higher than the latter. Therefore the Investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      accurate titration maybe not necessary for successful treatment of obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) as long as CPAP pressure was not lower than the minimal effective pressure.&#xD;

      Study Design: A randomized, cross-over and double-blind study. Objective: To compare the&#xD;
      pressure of 10 cmH2O and minimal effective pressure derived from manual titration on the&#xD;
      effect of CPAP treatment in OSA. Methods: Patients with suspected OSA (age, body mass index&#xD;
      and symptom) to be referred to a sleep centre were recruited. Patients with OSA confirmed by&#xD;
      overnight full polysomnography (PSG) were invited to do standard overnight manual titration&#xD;
      under PSG based on the Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual guidelines. Patients whose&#xD;
      manual titration pressure lower than 10cmH2O and willing to participate in the study were&#xD;
      invited to repeat two more nights (3th PSG and 4th PSG) under CPAP pressure at both 10cmH2O&#xD;
      and the pressure derived from manual titration in random order. The sleep apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI), obstructive sleep apnea index (OHI), arousal index (ArI), oxygen desaturation&#xD;
      index (ODI), sleep structure, and treatment preference were to be observed.&#xD;
