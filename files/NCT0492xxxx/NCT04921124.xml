      To test for a difference in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of&#xD;
      teriparatide (PTH 1-34), between healthy male and female volunteers matched to military&#xD;
      recruits in training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teriparatide, first licensed for fracture prevention in osteoporosis in 2003, is a human&#xD;
      recombinant preparation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34. The licensed dose is a 20 µg&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous (S/C) injection delivered once daily using a pre-filled pen. Published&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data focus on administration in adult female&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women. Eli Lilly did not publish their original 'First in Human' data,&#xD;
      therefore there is a lack of available data in men. The patent on the Eli Lilly formulation&#xD;
      expired in August 2019 and three teriparatide biosimilars have been released onto the UK&#xD;
      market. Gedeon Richter and Thornton and Ross presented data in osteoporotic patients to the&#xD;
      MHRA to license their products as biosimilars. Teriparatide has also been investigated in the&#xD;
      treatment of stress fractures, but there are no published data comparing the PKs and PDs of&#xD;
      these drugs in a population equivalent to individuals undergoing military training (i.e.&#xD;
      young healthy men and women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data to support the equivalence of teriparatide between sexes is limited. Citrate&#xD;
      and calcium infusions have been used to characterise the impact of sex differences on PTH&#xD;
      dynamics in twelve women with mean age ± SD of 26.4 ± 1.6 years and 12 men with mean age of&#xD;
      26.6 ± 1.3 years. They reported no between sex differences in serum PTH concentrations. It&#xD;
      has also been reported that 2-weeks of intermittent PTH administration in mice was anabolic&#xD;
      for cortical bone, with a greater effect observed in male compared with female animals. No&#xD;
      studies have investigated between sex PK or PD differences or efficacy of teriparatide&#xD;
      injection in humans. By examining this, the present study will help to further our&#xD;
      understanding of how teriparatide can be used in men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review considering a number of trials supported the use of PTH in its licensed indications&#xD;
      and demonstrated the efficacy of this drug in both male and female subjects. The evidence&#xD;
      base cited in this review is primarily from post-menopausal women in line with the licensed&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compliments the RETURN trial which is investigating the efficacy of teriparatide&#xD;
      for accelerating stress fracture healing in Army infantry recruits (EudraCT: 2018-002130-20).&#xD;
      The study is based at the Infantry Training Centre (ITC), which currently predominantly&#xD;
      trains men, hence men will form the majority of the RETURN study participants. Opening front&#xD;
      line roles to women comes with a well-documented risk of musculoskeletal injury due to the&#xD;
      nature of infantry training (HQ Army, 2016). If the results of the RETURN trial are to be&#xD;
      extrapolated to women and inform Defence treatment policy for stress fractures, the between&#xD;
      sex differences in PK and PD in a population matched to individuals in military training must&#xD;
      be established. This study is required if the results of RETURN are to be extrapolated to a&#xD;
      female population undergoing military training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gedeon Richter preparation, 'Terossa' will be used in this study as this is the&#xD;
      preparation that is being used in the RETURN study. This will control for inter-brand&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrogenous cyclic Adenosine Mono Phosphate is a measurement of PTH 1-34 activity at the&#xD;
      kidney and can therefore be used to estimate the early biological effects of PTH 1-34 in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a difference in the PK or PD profile of teriparatide subcutaneous injection&#xD;
           between men and women?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are the PK and PD measurements reliable and reproducible? The cohort for investigation&#xD;
           is young healthy (free from immune, cardiovascular or metabolic diseases) men and women,&#xD;
           military or physically trained civilians, free from illness, and matched to a military&#xD;
           population in training, based on age, body mass index (BMI) and absence of medical&#xD;
           conditions that would be a bar to entry to the Army (Can I Join The Army | Find Out if&#xD;
           You Are Eligible | British Army - British Army Jobs (mod.uk) [Accessed 16/01/2021]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention involves a single dose of teriparatide administered on 2 occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored for 12 hours, plus a further 12 hours urine collection&#xD;
      followed by a 24-hour washout period.&#xD;
