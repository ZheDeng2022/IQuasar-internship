      This project intends to record the process of tongue extension through a dynamic video, and&#xD;
      establish the tongue examination analysis from the video recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 300 general public will be invited for examinations, and high-quality tongue&#xD;
      examination videos will be recorded by digital cameras. After the tongue examination video is&#xD;
      properly calibrated, the computer analyzes the tongue examination parameters of each frame&#xD;
      and the dynamic parameters, thereby establishing the automatic tongue video analysis system&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors use tongue examination to investigate the&#xD;
      distribution of qi and blood in the human body and the changes in cold and heat, deficiency&#xD;
      and excess. This is a characteristic diagnosis of Chinese medicine and is rich in important&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic information. In recent years, tongue examination through computer image&#xD;
      analysis has been a fairly mature technology, but its application still has many limitations.&#xD;
      A proper tongue examination image capture must be performed by a well-training staff, and&#xD;
      errors caused by the operator cannot be avoided. These restrictions are not conducive to the&#xD;
      popularization of tongue examination applications. This project intends to record the process&#xD;
      of tongue extension through a dynamic video, and establish the tongue examination analysis&#xD;
      from the video recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is estimated that 300 subjects will be admitted to the China Medical&#xD;
      University and its cooperative medical facilities. The general public will be invited for&#xD;
      examinations, and high-quality tongue examination videos will be recorded by digital cameras.&#xD;
      After the tongue examination video is properly calibrated, the computer analyzes the tongue&#xD;
      examination parameters of each frame and the dynamic parameters, thereby establishing the&#xD;
      automatic tongue video analysis system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is different from recording the tongue with photos in the past, but uses dynamic&#xD;
      movies to record the tongue extension process, avoiding the influence of external light&#xD;
      source and tongue placement, seeking the best timing for tongue diagnosis, and it is expected&#xD;
      to produce automatic dynamic video tongue examination analysis, as an innovative analysis&#xD;
      model of TCM tongue examination. Results are expected to reduce operating errors and promote&#xD;
      the popularization of automated tongue examination analysis. In the future, it may be applied&#xD;
      to mobile phones or wearable devices to improve the practicality of TCM tongue examination in&#xD;
      telemedicine and the personalized medicine.&#xD;
