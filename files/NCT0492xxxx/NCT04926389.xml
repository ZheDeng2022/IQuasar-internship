  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several methods aiming at the acceleration of orthodontic tooth movement have been proposed,&#xD;
      including low-level laser therapy (LLLT), which showed promising results. However, the&#xD;
      frequency of patient recall has been one of its major drawbacks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to address the aim of the study.&#xD;
      Sixteen patients will be recruited, requiring the therapeutic extraction of the maxillary 1st&#xD;
      premolars, with subsequent canine retraction into the extraction space. The sample will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2 equal groups, each including 8 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A, one side of the maxillary arch will randomly receive LLLT on days 0, 3, 7, 14,&#xD;
      and every 2 weeks thereafter, while in Group B, one side will also be randomly chosen to&#xD;
      receive LLLT every 3 weeks. The contralateral sides of both groups will serve as the&#xD;
      controls. The LLLT applied will be Diode laser emitting infrared radiation at wavelength of&#xD;
      980 nm, in a continuous mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canine retraction in both groups will be carried out bilaterally using nickel-titanium&#xD;
      closed-coil spring, delivering 150 grams of force, and the rate of tooth movement will be&#xD;
      checked every 3 weeks, over a period of 3 months. Other variables will be also examined&#xD;
      including, interleukin-1β level in the gingival crevicular fluid, root resorption, and molar&#xD;
      anchorage loss.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rate of canine retraction</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and every 3 weeks for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Several landmarks will be identified on the dental cast, including the mid-palatal raphe, the most medial points on the third right and left rugae, and the cusp tips of the right and left maxillary canines. Perpendicular lines will be drawn from the medial points of the right and left third rugae, and the cusp tips of the right and left maxillary canines to the mid-palatal raphe. The antero-posterior measurements will be carried out between the canine lines and the third rugae lines bilaterally, to assess the rate of canine retraction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in IL-1β level in the Ginigval Crevicular Fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 7th, 17th and 21st day</time_frame>
    <description>Samples from the GCF will be collected at baseline (before the first canine retraction), in addition to days 7, 14, and 21. GCF samples will be collected from the distal crevices of the canines, in Groups A and B, on both the experimental and control sides. Measurement of IL-1β level in the GCF will be performed using an ELISA kit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change canine root resorption:</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Root resorption of the maxillary canines will be evaluated and measured on the acquired pre-retraction and post-retraction CBCT scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change molar anchorage loss</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and every 3 weeks for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perpendicular lines will be drawn from the central fossae of both maxillary right and left first molars to the mid-palatal raphe. Consequently, molar anchorage loss will be calculated by measuring the distance between those lines, and the lines representing the third rugae as previously mentioned.</description>
