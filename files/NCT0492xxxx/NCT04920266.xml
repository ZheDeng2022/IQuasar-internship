  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives are to determine the validity of a Smart Cap in measuring fluid intake&#xD;
      during running and fitness exercise and the validity of a Smart Sweat Patch in measuring&#xD;
      sweat rate and sweat chloride concentration during outdoor cycling, running, and fitness&#xD;
      exercise. A secondary objective is to compare regional sweating rate and sweat electrolyte&#xD;
      concentrations (sodium, chloride, and potassium) on contralateral arms with vs. without&#xD;
      tattoos.&#xD;

          -  Subject is 16-65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is moderately-trained (participates in regular outdoor fitness (~1 h), cycling&#xD;
             (1-2 h), or running (0.5-1 h) sessions ≥2x per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is participating in an instructor-led fitness session, typical training run,&#xD;
             or group bicycle ride&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a smoker&#xD;

             results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an allergy to adhesives (e.g., experiences rash reactions to typical&#xD;
             adhesive bandages)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has ≥ 2 cardiovascular risk factors as assessed on the General Health History&#xD;
             Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has participated in a clinical trial within past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has participated in any PepsiCo trial within past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a condition the investigator believes would interfere with his/her ability&#xD;
             to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might confound the&#xD;
             interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is employed by, or has a parent, guardian or other immediate family member&#xD;
             employed by, a company that manufactures any products that compete with any Gatorade&#xD;
             products. If subject is unsure if a company would be considered a competitor to&#xD;
             Gatorade they will be asked to please let the study investigator know the name of the&#xD;
             other company and the nature of their relationship to that company before they sign&#xD;
             the informed consent.&#xD;
