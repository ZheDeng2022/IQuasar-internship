  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental mouth rinse&#xD;
      formulations compared to a positive control mouth rinse and a hydroalcohol control mouth&#xD;
      rinse for the reduction of gingivitis and plaque when used as an adjunct to tooth brushing&#xD;
      during a six-week product usage period.&#xD;

    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean Modified Gingival Index (Mean MGI) After 6 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed by the Modified Gingival Index on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of all scorable teeth: 0 (Normal [absence of inflammation]), 1 (Mild inflammation [slight change in color, little change in texture] of any portion of the entire gingival unit); 2 (Mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit); 3 (Moderate inflammation [moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy] of the gingival unit); 4 (Severe inflammation [marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous bleeding, or ulceration] of the gingival unit).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean Plaque Index (Mean PI) After 6 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque area will be scored by the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index, on 6 surfaces (distobuccal, midbuccal and mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual) of all scorable teeth, following disclosing: 0 (No Plaque); 1 (Separate flecks or discontinuous band of plaque around the gingival (cervical) margin); 2 (Thin (up to 1 millimeter [mm]), continuous band of plaque at the gingival margin); 3 (Band of plaque wider than 1mm but less than1/3 of the surface); 4 (Plaque covering 1/3 or more, but less than 2/3 of the surface); 5 (Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the surface).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean Expanded Bleeding Index (Mean BI) After 4 and 6 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding will be assessed according to the Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 millimeter (mm) diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degree, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 6 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit will be recorded according to the following scale: 0 (Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds); 1 (Bleeding after 30 seconds); 2 (Immediate bleeding).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Bleeding Sites, Based on the Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index After 4 and 6 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent bleeding sites will be calculated by taking the total number of sites with bleeding score greater than 0 divided by the total number of sites assessed for each participant. Bleeding will be assessed according to the Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 millimeter (mm) diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degree, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 6 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed.
