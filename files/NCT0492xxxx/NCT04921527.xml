  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, 2-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Chiauranib plus weekly paclitaxel versus placebo plus weekly paclitaxel in patients with&#xD;
      Platinum-refractory or Platinum-resistant Recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the&#xD;
      angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related&#xD;
      kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with&#xD;
      the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high&#xD;
      selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor&#xD;
      kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms&#xD;
      of clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive treatment with either paclitaxel + Chiauranib or&#xD;
      paclitaxel + placebo. Paclitaxel will be repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Patients with objective response/stable disease after completing 6 courses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      will continue Chiauranib or placebo until progression.&#xD;
