  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase I study of bi-ligand-drug&#xD;
      conjugate CBP-1018 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2&#xD;
      parts: Part A (Dose Escalation) and Part B (Dose Expansion). Both parts include screening&#xD;
      period, treatment period, end of treatment (EOT)/withdrawal, safety follow-up (SFU) and&#xD;
      long-term-follow-up (LTFU). CBP-1018 will be administrated on eligible subjects until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or Sponsor's decision to stop the&#xD;
      study, etc.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A (Dose Escalation) is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of CBP-1018 and determine the MTD and RP2D of CBP-1018 administrated iv Q2W (4 weeks/cycle),&#xD;
      utilizing accelerated titration at lower doses (0.03 mg/kg and 0.06 mg/kg) and an i3+3 design&#xD;
      at following doses (0.08 mg/kg,0.10 mg/kg,0.12 mg/kg and 0.14mg/kg, etc.), respectively. The&#xD;
      DLT evaluation period will be 28 days from the first dose of CBP-1018. Up to 2 subjects will&#xD;
      be allowed under DLT evaluation period at the same time. The interval between the first&#xD;
      treatment of CBP-1018 to the 2 subjects under DLT evaluation period at the same time, is at&#xD;
      least 1 week. Safety monitoring committee (SMC), comprised of Investigators and sponsor's&#xD;
      medical personnel, etc., will be responsible for safety monitoring, dose escalation safety&#xD;
      review and justification, MTD/RP2D determination, and other critical study decisions. A&#xD;
      higher dose level may be added on the decision of SMC, if MTD is not observed at 0.14mg/kg.&#xD;
      Intermediate dose levels among planned dose levels may also be added by SMC for further&#xD;
      exploration. RP2D may be the same dose level as MTD or lower than it. Up to 10 additional&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in one or more dose levels that have been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      tolerable to better estimate the RP2D and better characterize the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics for CBP-1018. Different schedules (QW or Q3W, for example) may be explored&#xD;
      in Part A, according to emerging clinical and PK data, either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (Dose Expansion) is to further evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of CBP-1018 in&#xD;
      4 tumor-specific cohorts, with a Simon's two-stage design in each cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, mCRPC): subjects with mCRPC&#xD;
           have documented failure of prior standard of care (SoC), such as new hormone therapy&#xD;
           (Enzalutamide, apalutamide, etc.), Abiraterone and chemotherapy (Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel,&#xD;
           etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (Advanced renal cell cancer, RCC): subjects with advanced RCC have documented&#xD;
           failure of prior SoC, such as immunotherapy (PD-1/L1 antibody) combined with&#xD;
           anti-angiogenic therapy, targeted therapy (VEGF or mTOR inhibitor, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 (Advanced lung squamous cell cancer, LSCC): subjects with advanced LSCC have&#xD;
           documented failure of prior SoC, such as immunotherapy (PD-1/L1 antibody) combined with&#xD;
           chemotherapy (platinum-based regimen)，chemotherapy (Taxane, Gemcitabine, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4 (Other advanced solid tumors): subjects with other advanced solid tumors have&#xD;
           documented failure of prior SoC.&#xD;
