  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the function and reliability of a noninvasive,&#xD;
      skin-like electronic sensor. The investigators hypothesize that this skin sensor will address&#xD;
      an unmet need to wirelessly and noninvasively monitor and characterize the recovery process&#xD;
      in post-operative patients who have undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will validate the use of the sensor in this patient&#xD;
      population through monitoring of key physiological signals in the recovery process, including&#xD;
      heart rate, respiratory rate, swallow count, talking time, energy expenditure, neck specific&#xD;
      motion, and body orientation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia, dysphonia, and loss of cervical range of motion (ROM) are common complications&#xD;
      after anterior cervical spine surgery, specifically anterior cervical discectomy and fusion&#xD;
      (ACDF). Despite their clinical importance, studies on the treatment and/or prevention of&#xD;
      these complications are limited due to the lack of valid and reliable outcome measures. The&#xD;
      majority of research is found in the otolaryngology literature and has focused on disease&#xD;
      pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia and dysphonia are widely measured by patient self-reported questionnaires,&#xD;
      including the MD Anderson Dysphasia Inventory and SWAL-QOL. However, these validated outcome&#xD;
      tools are cumbersome to complete and, therefore, have not been widely accepted into clinical&#xD;
      practice, including in postoperative ACDF patients. The Bazaz score, a subjective&#xD;
      questionnaire that has not been validated in the literature, has also been used to evaluate&#xD;
      dysphagia after ACDF. Assessment using the Bazaz score is based on clinical examination, with&#xD;
      the surgeon listening to the patient's voice and documenting hoarseness in the post-operative&#xD;
      period. Recently, new patient-centered outcomes, the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) and&#xD;
      Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) have been developed. Both EAT-10 and VHI-10 have excellent&#xD;
      validity and reliability in evaluating dysphagia and dysphonia, respectively, in&#xD;
      post-operative ACDF patients and can be used to document the initial dysphagia or dysphonia&#xD;
      severity and monitor the treatment response in people with a wide array of swallowing and&#xD;
      voice disorders. However, these methods of evaluating dysphagia and dysphonia alone offer&#xD;
      limited information about the severity and characteristic of dysphagia or dysphonia and do&#xD;
      not provide continuous monitoring of swallowing or speaking function throughout the&#xD;
      post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wearable sensors under investigation in this study offer a novel, noninvasive, and&#xD;
      easy-to-use way to monitor dysphagia, dysphonia, cervical ROM, and overall recovery progress&#xD;
      in post-operative ACDF patients. Previous testing has demonstrated the ability of our sensors&#xD;
      to monitor vital signs (including heart rate and respiratory rate), swallow count, talking&#xD;
      time, energy expenditure, cervical neck movement, and body orientation. Sensor-measured&#xD;
      swallow count and talking time, in conjunction with EAT-10 and VHI-10 scores, can provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive view of the progression of dysphagia and dysphonia. Cervical neck movements&#xD;
      measured by the sensor can enable continuous assessment of cervical ROM. Other general&#xD;
      metrics captured by the sensors, including heart rate, respiratory rate, energy expenditure,&#xD;
      and body orientation can provide other meaningful measures of recovery in post-operative ACDF&#xD;
      patients. These sensors have also received positive feedback from patients and physicians on&#xD;
      their comfort, ease of use, and application, further demonstrating the potential value of&#xD;
      these sensors in improving the quality of post-operative care for ACDF patients.&#xD;
