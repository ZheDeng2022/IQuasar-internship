  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic and progressive entities, triggered by exposure to&#xD;
      environmental factors in individuals with a genetic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common environmental factors is the type of diet which is a key influencer on&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Nutrients alter the intestinal microbiota, thus changing the intestinal&#xD;
      permeability. The Western-type diet encompasses sugar, fat, and protein-rich products that&#xD;
      have some deleterious effects on the intestinal microbiome compared to the plant-based&#xD;
      Mediterranean-type diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this fact, diet-based therapeutic efforts have been used extensively in pediatric&#xD;
      Crohn's disease patients and there is strong evidence that exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)&#xD;
      is as effective as corticosteroids to induce both clinical and endoscopic remission but this&#xD;
      treatment strategy is underutilized in adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, interventional, parallel-group study, designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of EEN in inducing clinical remission at 12 weeks in subjects with ileocaecal CD.&#xD;
Patients will receive EEN for 8 weeks, initially building up to the full required volume of formula over the first 3 to 4 days, depending on tolerance and side effects After the completion of the period of EEN, foods will be reintroduced slowly and supplementary enteral nutrition will be continued for another 4 weeks.&#xD;
A total of 256 patients with ileocaecal CD will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive steroids and EEN. Each of the treatment arms will comprise 128 subjects. In order to make the groups comparable, randomization will be stratified according to the severity of the disease according to Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI):&#xD;
CDAI between 150-220 --&gt; Mild&#xD;
CDAI between 220-450 --&gt; Moderate&#xD;
CDAI&gt;450 --&gt; Severe</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Defined as Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) ≤2, at 12 weeks after randomization. The ileocolonoscopies will be evaluated by the site.&#xD;
SES-CD is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease. The SES-CD considers size of ulcerations, ulcerated surface, effected surface and the presence of narrowings, evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score ranges from 0 to 60 where higher scores indicate more severe endoscopic activity.</description>

    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a research tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease. Participants were asked to record the frequency of stools, abdominal pain and general well-being on a daily basis. In addition to the diary data, the investigator assessed the following for the calculation of CDAI: presence of complications (arthritis/arthralgia, iritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum/pyoderma gangrenosum/aphthous stomatitis, anal fissure/fistula/abscess, other fistula, and fever), the use of antidiarrheal medicines, presence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight. The CDAI is the sum of the products of each item multiplied by a weighting factor and generally ranges from 0 up to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Two-item Patient Reported Outcome (PRO-2) is a health outcome directly reported by the patient to quantify a treatment's efficacy that is derived from CDAI diary card.
