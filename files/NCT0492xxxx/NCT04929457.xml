  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Longitudinal and observational registry-based cohort study of individuals participating in&#xD;
      the national digiphysical screening program for Familial Hypercholesterolemia. The&#xD;
      information collected in the screening process will be combined in pseudo-anonymous form with&#xD;
      data from the National Board of Health and Welfare (registries: Cause of Death, Diagnoses&#xD;
      according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Prescribed drugs) and&#xD;
      Statistic Sweden (Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market&#xD;
      studies). Primary analysis: association between Familial Hypercholesterolemia and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Secondary analysis: efficacy and health economic aspects of&#xD;
      digiphysical screening for Familial Hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
