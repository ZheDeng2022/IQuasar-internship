  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-operative Cobb angle compared to the post-operative Cobb angle at 24 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Main Thoracic Cobb Angle will be calculated from the PA TL spine radiograph. The Main Thoracic Cobb Angle is measured by drawing lines through the superior endplate of the upper end vertebra and the inferior endplate of the lower end vertebra that yields the greatest angle of curvature of the structural thoracic curve (at or below T2 and at or above T11-T12). Main Thoracic Cobb Angle will be reported in units of degrees. The change in Cobb Angle will be calculated from two points as the value at the first time point minus the value at the later time point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of secondary spinal surgeries defined as treatment failure up to 24 months postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>CEC adjudication of secondary surgeries will be used for this endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Cobb angle at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Main Thoracic Cobb Angle will be calculated from the PA TL spine radiograph.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in thoracic kyphosis at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Thoracic Kyphosis will be calculated from the Lateral TL Spine radiograph and will be measured as the angle between the superior endplate of T5 and the inferior endplate of T12. Thoracic Kyphosis will be reported in units of degrees. Positive angle corresponds to kyphotic curvature, whereas negative angle corresponds to lordotic curvature.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in coronal balance at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Coronal Balance will be measured from the PA TL Spine radiograph. A vertical line is drawn down from the center of the C7 vertebral body (C7PL), and a vertical line is drawn up from the center of the superior endplate of S1 (also known as the center sacral vertical line; &quot;CSVL&quot;). The distance between these lines is recorded in units of millimeters. The sign is positive if C7PL falls to right of the CSVL and negative if it falls to the left as viewed on the PA image.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in total vertical thoracic spine height (T1-T12) at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Total Vertical Thoracic Spine Height will be calculated from the PA TL Spine radiograph and is defined as the vertical distance between the level of the midpoint of the superior endplate of T1 and the midpoint of the inferior endplate of T12. It will be reported in units of centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in total vertical spine height (T1-S1) at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Total Vertical Spine Height will be calculated from the PA TL Spine radiograph and is defined as the vertical distance between the level of the midpoint of the superior endplate of the T1 superior endplate and the midpoint of the superior endplate of S1. It will be reported in units of centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in shoulder imbalance at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder imbalance will be calculated from the Clavicle Angle and PA TL Spine radiograph. Clavicle Angle is defined as the angle between the Clavicle Horizontal Reference Line (CHRL), which is the line drawn perpendicular to the lateral edge of the radiograph that touches the most cephalad portion of the elevated clavicle and the line connecting the margins of the left and right clavicle. A depressed clavicle yields a positive angle, while a right clavicle above the CHRL yields a negative angle. Clavicle Angle is measured in units of degrees and will be used to determine Shoulder Imbalance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual Subject Success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Cobb angle is less than or equal to 40 degrees at 24 months following treatment without any secondary spinal surgery defined as treatment failure up to 24 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL) at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL Measurement Model is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales are designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning. The 4 Multidimensional Scales are physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning. The 3 Summary Scores are Total Scale score, Physical Health Summary score, and the Psychosocial Health Summary score. Two versions of this assessment will be filled out, one by the subject and one by the parent or legal guardian. Scores are transformed on a scale from 0-100. Higher score means better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Scoliosis Research Society-22 Patient Questionnaire (SRS-22) at all available postoperative timepoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS-22 contains 22 questions covering 5 domains: function/activity 5 items; pain 5 items; self-perceived image 5 items; mental health 5 items; and satisfaction with treatment 2 items. Each item is scored from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Each domain has a total sum score ranging from 5 to 25, except for satisfaction, which ranges from 2 to 10. The sum of the first 4 domains gives a maximum subtotal of 100, and when the satisfaction domain is included, the maximum total is 110. Higher score means better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Neurological status at all available postoperative timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the surgery, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, and annually until skeletal maturity is reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raising. Neurological change will be defined as deteriorate, maintenance or improvement in all sections (motor, sensory, reflex, and straight leg raising) for the time period evaluated. In order for a section to be considered a success, each element in the section must remain the same or improve from the time of the baseline evaluation to the time period evaluated. Therefore, if any one element in any section does not stay the same or improve, then a patient will not be considered a success for neurological status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Status of return to full activity within 3 months per Scoliosis Research Society-22 Patient Questionnaire (SRS-22)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>SRS-22's subdomain function/activity will be utilized to evaluate the status of return to full activity. The subdomain has 5 items and will be scored on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Higher score means better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of device or procedure related adverse events up to 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Device or procedure related adverse events are any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, related to the investigational device or procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of secondary spinal surgeries not defined as treatment failure up to 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery to 24 months.</time_frame>
