  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the safety of the study drug (SHetA2) and see what&#xD;
      effects (good and bad) this drug has on patients with recurrent cervical, ovarian, or&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SHetA2 capsules will be given twice a day, every day in 21-day blocks of time. Each block of&#xD;
      time is called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated until the patient or doctor no longer feel&#xD;
      participation in the study is right for the patient. There will be lab tests and examinations&#xD;
      to monitor the patients progress. We expect that taking part in this research will last up to&#xD;
      three years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5x ULN unless patient is receiving&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to SHetA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other&#xD;
             form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving treatment for active autoimmune disease. &quot;Active&quot; refers to any&#xD;
             condition currently requiring therapy. Examples of autoimmune disease include systemic&#xD;
             lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis. (note if steroid use is &lt;10mg/day prednisolone equivalent and patient has&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or&#xD;

             detected). Ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection; known human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with positive viral load or acquired&#xD;
             immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illness. Patients with HIV and a negative&#xD;
             viral load are allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy that&#xD;
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to&#xD;
             extreme risk or decreased life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including&#xD;
             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain&#xD;
             metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within six months of the first date of&#xD;
             treatment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are&#xD;
        stable (without evidence of progression by imaging (using the identical imaging modality&#xD;
        for each assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]&#xD;
        scan) for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic&#xD;
        symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases,&#xD;
        and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. Carcinomatous&#xD;
        meningitis precludes a patient from study participation regardless of clinical stability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking concomitant therapy with any of the following: other non-study&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy; other investigational therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior bone marrow/hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of solid organ, bone marrow, or progenitor cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to start of study treatment&#xD;
