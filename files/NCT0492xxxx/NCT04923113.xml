  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we know，Helicobacter pylori is closely related to many gastrointestinal diseases such as&#xD;
      chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease,gastric carcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue lymphoma，as well as extra-digestive diseases such as urticaria and chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary diseases and so on.The diagnosis of H. pylori infection is based on&#xD;
      invasive methods requiring endoscopy and biopsy(e.g. histology, culture, rapid urease test,&#xD;
      PCR) or on non-invasive methods (e.g. serology, 13C urea breath test, stool antigen&#xD;
      test).Histology has the highest specificity among the others,and also allows us to determine&#xD;
      the underlying disease and perform antibiotic sensitivity testing.Serological tests are&#xD;
      widely available and more appropriate for epidemiological studies, their main weakness for&#xD;
      clinical use is low specificity.The 13C urea breath test is the most accurate method in&#xD;
      patients irrespective of age.Stool antigen testing,as a promising method, is easy to perform,&#xD;
      and its accuracy may be improved by the use of monoclonal antibodies recently proposed for&#xD;
      capturing H. pylori antigen in stool specimen.Sensitivity and specificity, usefulness,and&#xD;
      limitation of tests should be considered for selection of detection methods of H. pylori. Our&#xD;
      objective is to review the current methods that are used for the detection of H. pylori&#xD;
      infection among patients with chronic atrophic gastritis.Except that,patients with Hp&#xD;
      positive will be further treated with 10-day minocycline-based quadruple therapy,to observe&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of minocycline-based regimen for H.pylori eradication as a first-line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive outpatients (18 to 70 years), with endoscopically proven chronic atrophic&#xD;
      gastritis will be enrolled in our study.5 different methods，including histology,13C urea&#xD;
      breath test,stool antigen test,serological antibody test for H.pylori and serologic test with&#xD;
      a current infection marker of H.pylori，will be performed to detect H. pylori infection.And&#xD;
      patients with Hp positive will be further treated with 10-day minocycline-based quadruple&#xD;
      therapy.Our objective is to compare specificity and sensitivity of the current methods among&#xD;
      patients with chronic atrophic gastritis,meanwhile,to observe the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      minocycline-based regimen for H.pylori eradication as a first-line therapy.&#xD;
