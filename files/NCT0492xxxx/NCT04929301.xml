  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a pilot randomized trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      a structured antenatal milk expression (AME) educational intervention on breastfeeding&#xD;
      outcomes within a sample of low-risk pregnant individuals without other children. A&#xD;
      convenience sample of 45 participants were enrolled and randomized to either the AME&#xD;
      intervention or a control group receiving breastfeeding educational handouts. Both groups met&#xD;
      with study staff at 37, 38, 39, and 40 weeks gestation to receive assigned intervention. AME&#xD;
      participants practiced AME 1-2 times/day and recorded this in a diary. Data were collected&#xD;
      from surveys, interviews, and electronic health record to 3-4 months postpartum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal milk expression (AME) has emerged as a simple, inexpensive, novel method to&#xD;
      increase maternal breastfeeding confidence, avoid early formula use, and increase proportion&#xD;
      of mother's own milk (MOM) feeds-potentially leading to greater breastfeeding satisfaction,&#xD;
      increased breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and improved maternal-infant health&#xD;
      outcomes. AME capitalizes on the production, and sometimes leaking, of milk-commencing during&#xD;
      the second trimester of pregnancy by allowing women to collect and store milk for later use&#xD;
      if needed and gain confidence in breastfeeding and their milk-making capabilities. AME may&#xD;
      also &quot;prime&quot; the hormonal milk production process to create a larger postpartum milk supply.&#xD;
      Pilot studies conducted with diabetic women demonstrate AME's safety, feasibility, and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness in improving breastfeeding rates. AME has yet to be investigated in&#xD;
      non-diabetic populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, investigators trialed our study procedures and milk collection and&#xD;
      analysis methods, and examined the preliminary effectiveness of AME on breastfeeding outcomes&#xD;
      among pregnant people without other biological children. Forty-five healthy, nulliparous&#xD;
      women were enrolled and randomized to either a structured AME educational intervention or&#xD;
      usual care/control group at Magee-Womens Hospital midwife practice at their 34-36 week&#xD;
      prenatal appointment. The Principal Investigator (PI) or an research assistant (RA) met with&#xD;
      all participants weekly from 37 weeks until delivery, during postpartum hospitalization, and&#xD;
      at 1-2 weeks and 3-4 months postpartum. During visits, the PI/RA collected questionnaire data&#xD;
      on maternal health and delivery, stress, depression, as well as outcomes of perceived milk&#xD;
      supply and breastfeeding attitude, satisfaction, confidence, continuation and exclusivity.&#xD;
      Those randomized to AME were taught the technique at the 37 week visit by a lactation&#xD;
      consultant, with instructions to continue 1-2 times/day at home. AME was practiced and&#xD;
      reinforced with the lactation consultant at each subsequent visit. Those in the control group&#xD;
      received breastfeeding handouts at each prenatal visit. For those in the AME group, the PI/RA&#xD;
      also collected a small milk sample at each prenatal visit, along with a written diary&#xD;
      documenting AME at home. The PI/RA collected a milk sample from all participants at&#xD;
      postpartum visits; samples are stored at University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing lab for&#xD;
      subsequent analyses (TBD). The PI/RA conducted semi-structured interviews at 1-2 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum with AME participants about their experiences with the intervention. Summary&#xD;
      statistics were then calculated for feasibility and breastfeeding outcome data, with&#xD;
      significance tests (ANOVA, chi-square) to determine group differences breastfeeding outcomes&#xD;
      as applicable. Interview data were analyzed for major themes to refine the intervention for a&#xD;
      larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in this study were used to revise our AME clinical teaching protocol, AME&#xD;
      diaries, and establish standard operating procedures for milk collection and storage for an&#xD;
      ongoing, larger randomized trial examining AME's effect on breastfeeding outcomes.&#xD;
