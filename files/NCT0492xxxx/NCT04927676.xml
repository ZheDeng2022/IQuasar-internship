      Therefore, the main objective of this prospective pilot study is to evaluate a complete&#xD;
      hormonal profile in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, including anti-mullerian&#xD;
      hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count. Changes in this regard will be evaluated after 2&#xD;
      months of individual treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective cohort pilot study is to evaluate a complete hormonal&#xD;
      profile including AMH and antral follicle count in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
      (HH). As a secondary study objective, changes in these two parameters will be examined after&#xD;
      2 months of individual treatment. The data collected will be used to plan future studies in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is, that AMH levels which range from 0.5 ng/mL to 7.0 ng/mL and antral&#xD;
      follicular counts which range from 2 to 20 can be found in women with HH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary hypothesis the investigators assume that the AMH levels and the antral&#xD;
      follicular counts of women with HH do not change within two months of treatment with&#xD;
      estrogen-/gestagen-replacement therapy or no treatment, whereas AMH levels and antral&#xD;
      follicular counts will increase significantly after two months of pulsatile&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameters are serum level of AMH and the antral follicular count. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome parameters as for the descriptive analysis are: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (either during amenorrhea or on cycle day 2-5 in the&#xD;
      course of treatment), sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone,&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), results of a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA;&#xD;
      if performed), duration since last normal menstruation, patient's age and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be collected and included in the database. They do not require&#xD;
      additional effort on behalf of the patients. All data will be obtained using the&#xD;
      study-specific case report form and will be entered into a SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      Software) database in a semi-anonymized manner: Patient's age, Body mass index, duration&#xD;
      since last normal menstruation, FSH, LH, Estradiol, SHBG, Testosterone, DHEAS, DEXA results,&#xD;
      AMH, Antral follicular count. Data acquisition will be conducted to give an exact&#xD;
      characterization of the patient population to allow a comparison with the published&#xD;
      literature. All taken blood samples are performed as part of the clinical routine at the&#xD;
      Clinical Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Vienna General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a pilot study. This is due to the lack of sufficient literature on&#xD;
      this topic. Fifty women with HH and secondary amenorrhea will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants are informed about the procedure, clinical relevance and the balance&#xD;
      of risk and benefits incurred through study participation. Patients willing to participate&#xD;
      will express this through written affirmation (a &quot;consent form&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All above mentioned data are numerical data and will be reported as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviations. Differences between different treatment groups will be tested using unpaired&#xD;
      t-tests, whereas differences within groups (baseline to follow-up examinations) will be&#xD;
      tested using paired t-tests. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 26.0. P-values&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme values will be double-checked. In addition, random checks by two independent&#xD;
      investigators will be conducted to ensure the accuracy of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, no further data acquisitions, follow-up examinations or surveys&#xD;
      will be necessary. Accordingly, if patients would be undergoing the described interventions&#xD;
      (blood retrieval, DEXA analysis) independent of their choice to participate, this should not&#xD;
      shift cost or risk for them. The analysis and publication of the data will be done with&#xD;
      patient de-identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision on how to proceed after the initial diagnosis is made in the course of routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, after the medical team in charge of the patient has provided precise&#xD;
      information on the advantages and risks of the respective procedures. Participation in the&#xD;
      study therefore has no influence on the type of further procedure or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted as independent official research. The company &quot;Ferring Arzneimittel&#xD;
      GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung)&quot; is supporting the conduct of the study with&#xD;
      3,000 euros. The company produces the preparation &quot;LutreLef&quot;, which is administered to some&#xD;
      patients as part of the clinical routine with the pump system &quot;LutrePulse&quot;.&#xD;
