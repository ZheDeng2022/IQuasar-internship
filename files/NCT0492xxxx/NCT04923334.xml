  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve pain management and reduce opioid reliance for patients&#xD;
      with chronic back pain in Utah Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The study compares&#xD;
      the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic pain treatments using telehealth to overcome access&#xD;
      barriers. We will use automated EHR reminders for electronic referral to teleconsult&#xD;
      services. Our project tests adaptive treatments and uses a hybrid type I design - focused on&#xD;
      effectiveness outcomes while gathering implementation data to inform future efforts to scale&#xD;
      effective strategies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial compares the effectiveness of different strategies to provide&#xD;
      efficacious nonpharmacologic interventions to patients with back pain seeking care in FQHCs&#xD;
      throughout the state of Utah. The strategies evaluated are designed to overcome the barriers&#xD;
      specific to rural and low income communities served by FQHC clinics through innovative use of&#xD;
      telehealth resources. The randomized trial will randomize individual participants to one of&#xD;
      two interventions strategies, one providing both a brief pain teleconsult with a 10-week&#xD;
      telehealth physical therapy, the other uses an adaptive strategy - providing the brief pain&#xD;
      teleconsult first, followed by the 10-week telehealth physical therapy only among those&#xD;
      non-responsive to the brief teleconsult treatment. We will also evaluate outcomes related to&#xD;
      the efforts to implement strategies in FQHC clinics in order to provide valuable information&#xD;
      for future efforts to scale effective strategies into other low resource health care&#xD;
      settings. Assessments will occur at baseline and after 12-, 26- and 52-weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design is a clinical trial testing adaptive interventions. All participants receive the Brief Pain Teleconsult in Phase I. We will randomly assign participants with 1:1 distribution to also receive 10-week Telehealth Physical Therapy during Phase I. All participants are re-assessed at 12 weeks and responder status is determined. For participants not receiving Telehealth Physical Therapy in Phase I, further treatment is based on responder status. Responders receive no further treatment. Non-responders receive the 10-week Telehealth Physical Therapy in Phase II. Participants randomized to Telehealth PT in Phase I receive no further treatment. Long-term assessments occur 26 and 52 weeks after randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study is outcome assessor and investigator blinded. Blinding will only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of participant safety such as a serious adverse event. If blinding is broken, either intentionally or unintentionally, the reason will be fully documented and entered on an electronic case report form. Every effort will be made to discuss the decision to break blinding with the Data Safety Monitoring Board in advance.</masking_description>
