      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with COVID-19 have varying degrees of illness. It can range from no or mild symptoms&#xD;
      to critical illness and death. Some people with COVID-19 have long-term effects regardless of&#xD;
      the severity of their disease initially. Researchers want to learn more to see if they can&#xD;
      better predict where a person may fall on the illness spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow and record symptoms of COVID-19 to see how it progresses in people and why some&#xD;
      people stay sick longer than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-65 who received a COVID-19 positive test result in the 72 hours before their&#xD;
      enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a 30-minute baseline survey. They will answer questions about&#xD;
      themselves and their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a digital wristband and temperature sensor in the mail. They will get&#xD;
      instructions on how to set up and wear the devices. They will download a mobile application&#xD;
      on their phone. The app will collect data from the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear the wristband and sensor every day for the first month. Then they will&#xD;
      wear the devices for a total of 40 days over the next 5 months. On the days they wear the&#xD;
      devices, they will answer a 2-question health survey via the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer a 20-minute online survey about their health every 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are hospitalized, a family member or close friend will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      brief 7-minute online survey about their hospital stay and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent alerts and reminders throughout the study. Participation will last&#xD;
      for 6 months....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 patients experience varying degrees of illness, ranging from no/mild symptoms to&#xD;
      critical illness/death. A subset of covid-19 patients experiences long-term sequelae of&#xD;
      covid-19 regardless of the severity of the disease initially. Predicting where a patient&#xD;
      falls on the illness spectrum is important to allocate sparse resources and intervene&#xD;
      medically at an optimal time. With current recommendations dictating that covid-19 patients&#xD;
      self-isolate and care for themselves at home, the clinical course of covid-19 in most&#xD;
      patients remains largely unknown. Preliminary prognostic and diagnostic models of covid-19&#xD;
      severity rely on clinical data primarily from inpatients with advanced disease where clinical&#xD;
      indicators such as blood oxygen saturation and respiratory rate have been predictive of&#xD;
      covid-19 trajectories. Digital wearables allow for a continuous collection of such&#xD;
      physiological data that can shed light on the onset and progression of covid-19 symptoms in&#xD;
      patient groups, particularly given its varying severity and differential rate of progression&#xD;
      that are associated with key demographics and risk profiles, primarily underlying chronic&#xD;
      conditions. We hypothesize that biometrics collected via a digital wristband are associated&#xD;
      with patient-reported post-acute covid-19 sequalae. This is a prospective, natural history&#xD;
      study of covid-19 among a cohort of 550 patients with positive covid-19 diagnosis who&#xD;
      volunteer to participate in the study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 65. The pediatric population &lt;18 years differs from adults&#xD;
             &gt;18 years in infection rates, symptom manifestation, and outcomes (e.g., multi-&#xD;
             inflammatory syndrome). Although population 12 and older is now eligible to receive&#xD;
             the vaccine, population over 65 was the first eligible age group to receive the&#xD;
             vaccine in the US. Furthermore, protections are in place to reduce transmission among&#xD;
             the elderly in general and in nursing homes in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of a SARS-Cov-19 positive test (PCR or antigen/rapid test) &lt;=5 days&#xD;
             before enrollment. Recruitment materials list patients must be within 3 days of a&#xD;
             positive test, which gives the research team 2 days to enroll patients in the study.&#xD;
             Self-collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        kits and home tests for COVID-19 are not permitted because of the potential for&#xD;
        inappropriate sampling and sample contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Owns or has access to supported device (i.e., smartphone or a tablet) that compliant&#xD;

                  Pro; 11-inch iPad pro (1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation); 12.9-inch iPad pro (1st,&#xD;
                  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th generation)&#xD;

               4. Devices released in 2021 and afterward that are compatible with the Biostrap app.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Speaks English. Non-English speakers will be unable to use the Biostrap mobile app.&#xD;
             Although efforts are currently underway to provide the app in Spanish, the current app&#xD;
             is only available in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to adhere to lifestyle considerations throughout the study duration (i.e.,&#xD;
