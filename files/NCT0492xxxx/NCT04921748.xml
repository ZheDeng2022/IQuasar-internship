  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sequence effect (SE), defined as a reduction in amplitude of repetitive movements, is a&#xD;
      common clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), being a major contributor to freezing of&#xD;
      gait (FOG). During walking, SE manifests as a step-by-step reduction in step length when&#xD;
      approaching a turn or gait destination (dSE). The investigators studied the effect of a&#xD;
      4-week rehabilitation program on the destination sequence effect in patients affected by&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease with and without Freezing of Gait. All subjects were evaluated with&#xD;
      inertial gait analysis for dSE recording.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait impairment and freezing of gait (FOG) represent common and disabling symptoms of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The antiparkinsonian therapy positively modulates a subset of gait&#xD;
      parameters, such as speed of gait and stride length, while its impact on FOG is limited.&#xD;
      Growing evidence supports the efficacy of neurorehabilitation in the treatment of PD across&#xD;
      all phases of the disease. In the last years, the advent of reliable wearable devices has&#xD;
      prompted the widespread study of several parameters of the parkinsonian gait in both clinical&#xD;
      and research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence effect (SE), defined as a reduction in amplitude of repetitive movements, is a&#xD;
      common clinical feature of several tasks of patients affected by PD, being identifiable in&#xD;
      early as well as advanced stages of the disease. During walking, SE manifests as a&#xD;
      step-by-step reduction in step length when approaching a turn or gait destination&#xD;
      (destination sequence effect - dSE). SE is specifically pronounced in PD patients affected by&#xD;
      FOG, and it arises immediately before a FOG episode induced by a turning or a dual-task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SE may be acutely modulated by several rehabilitative strategies such as split-belt treadmill&#xD;
      and reinforcement of visual cues, but not by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS), antiparkinsonian drugs administration, and attention strategies did not influence the&#xD;
      SE, the evidence on the role of neurorehabilitation on gait SE improvement and retention is&#xD;
      extremely scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 43 subjects according to sample size calculation. Patients&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups: patients with freezing of gait (FOG) and without FOG. The&#xD;
      subjects will be divided into two groups: 1) patients with freezing of gait (PD+FOG), or 2)&#xD;
      patients without freezing of gait (PD-FOG). FOG phenotype is defined as: a score between 1&#xD;
      and 4 at either item &quot;2.13 Freezing&quot; or item &quot;3.11 Freezing of gait&quot; of the Unified Parkinson&#xD;
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with a standardized 4-week rehabilitation in-hospital program.&#xD;
      At hospital admission (T0), patients who fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria will be tested&#xD;
      with instrumental gait analysis and administration of a set of the following clinical scales:&#xD;
      rating of PD related motor disability with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale -&#xD;
      part III (UPDRS-III); rating of functional independence as measured through the Functional&#xD;
      Independence Measure (FIM); and rating of dependence in activity of daily living according to&#xD;
      Barthel Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, patients will be treated with 90-minute daily rehabilitative sessions, 6 days a&#xD;
      week (Monday through Saturday) for four weeks (passive, active-assisted, and active&#xD;
      exercises, isotonic and isometric exercises for the major muscles of the limbs and trunk,&#xD;
      cardiovascular warm-up exercises, muscle stretching exercises for functional purposes,&#xD;
      balance training exercises, specific motor exercise for hypokinesia, and 45 minutes of&#xD;
      overground gait training delivered without devices or cueing). The rehabilitation program&#xD;
      will be the same in PD+FOG and PD-FOG groups. At the end of the rehabilitation program (T1),&#xD;
      the patients will complete the study procedure with a second instrumental gait analysis&#xD;
      evaluation and the administration of the same set of clinical scales. No modifications of the&#xD;
      drug regimen were allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gait analysis will be performed with wearable, wireless, inertial system, secured to the&#xD;
      back of the patients between L5 and S1 vertebrae. All subjects will be recorded in the&#xD;
      morning (between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.) and in the ON condition. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      record a walk, at a comfortable pace, of 20 meters. The subjects will stop independently at&#xD;
      the end of the 20-meter pathway, clearly marked by a straight line on the ground. Gait&#xD;
      assessments with episodes of freezing of gait or pauses will be discrded. For each subject,&#xD;
      three optimal performed gait assessments will be recorded. Regarding gait parameters the&#xD;
      investigators will record: speed (m/s), cadence (steps/minute), stride length (meter), step&#xD;
      length (meter), stride duration (second), single support, double support, swing duration,&#xD;
      stance duration (percentage stride distribution). The destination Sequence Effect (dSE) will&#xD;
      be computed as a regression slope (β) of step length according to a previously described and&#xD;
      validated methodology where step length is plotted against step number. Briefly, the length&#xD;
      of the last six steps ahead of the final stride are plotted against the step number, and the&#xD;
      linear regression slope (β) will represent a measure of dSE. In addition, the intercept (I)&#xD;
      of the regression curve will be used as an indirect measure of gait hypokinesia. For each&#xD;
      group, the relationship between gait hypokinesia and sequence effect is expressed by the&#xD;
      function of the linear regression as follow: y = β (x) + I.&#xD;
