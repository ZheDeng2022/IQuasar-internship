      This phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical&#xD;
      study in healthy subjects. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AK3280. Approximately, 36 healthy Chinese subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited and randomized to orally receive AK3280 or matching placebo. The total duration&#xD;
      of the study will be approximately 25 days for each subject.&#xD;

A multiple dosing period follows with daily 200 mg AK3280 b.i.d. administered with a concurrent low-fat meal intake from Day 4 to Day 16 and a 200 mg AK3280 q.d. dosing on Day 17.</description>

Subjects will receive AK3280 following the same dosing schedule as that in Cohort 1, i. e., a single oral dose of AK3280 under fasted conditions on Day 1, multiple AK3280 b.i.d. administration with a concurrent low-fat meal intake from Day 4 to Day 16, and an AK3280 q.d. dose on Day 17.</description>
