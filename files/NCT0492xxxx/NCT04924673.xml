  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the isolation at home implemented in France,&#xD;
      creates unprecedented challenges for diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes have been considered to be at higher risk of infection by the virus,&#xD;
      with a greater risk of mortality; this has been a great source of anxiety for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that stress has an impact on plasma glucose levels. The French situation&#xD;
      where a general confinement has been decreed over the whole territory (which is not the case&#xD;
      for all countries) and for a period of two months, makes it possible to study the impact of&#xD;
      this unique situation on stress, sedentary lifestyle, changes in diet and decrease in&#xD;
      physical activity. There are no similar experiences described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize there will be an increase of HbA1c in the coming months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess changes in glycemic control in diabetic patients after the&#xD;
      confinement period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the prevalence of a state of psychological distress (which could be described&#xD;
           as post-traumatic) following this epidemic situation in a population of patients with&#xD;
           diabetes and to determine the main characteristics of patients with such a state of&#xD;
           psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the evolution of the psychological state at a distance from confinement (6 months&#xD;
           later) with the same questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze characteristics of lifestyle during confinement: food (snacking), frequency of&#xD;
           leaving home, sleep disorders and assess a possible association with variations in&#xD;
           HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, prospective, multicenter study. Participation in the study will be&#xD;
      offered to all consecutive patients seen in Diabetes consultations, who meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
