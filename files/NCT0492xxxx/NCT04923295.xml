  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with average or high average peritoneal glucose transport status be included in the&#xD;
      study as mentioned in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in peritoneal glucose transport will be evaluated before and after one month&#xD;
      treatment with 10 mg of Dapagliflozin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) test for patients before and after Dapagliflozin use and&#xD;
      volume status of patients as measured by ultrafiltration from peritoneal dialysis exchanges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to determine whether dapagliflozin can decrease glucose absorption&#xD;
      from peritoneal fluid and reduce plasma glucose absorption from the PD fluid and thus improve&#xD;
      ultrafiltration with a reduction in intraperitoneal glucose exposure&#xD;

      The research targets patients on peritoneal dialysis with average and high transport status&#xD;
      documented by Peritoneal Equilibrium Transport Test (PET test) in Najah National University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants will be recruited from the patients on peritoneal dialysis in NNUH. A&#xD;
      study team member will prescreen the patient based upon the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If&#xD;
      potentially eligible, the coordinator will approach candidates directly to provide&#xD;
      information about the study and to invite them to voluntarily participate. The primary&#xD;
      investigator will provide the participant with the informed consent document to read to read&#xD;
      and to sign it if they agree to participate. The study includes patients on peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis with average and high transport status documented by Peritoneal Equilibrium&#xD;
      Transport Test (PET test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting treatment with Dapagliflozin all patients included in the study population&#xD;
      will have the following tests performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Peritoneal Equilibrium Test with 4.5% Dextrose peritoneal fluid Hemoglobin A1C&#xD;
      levels 24 urine collection for protein, glucose, and creatine clearance Peritoneal fluid&#xD;
      albumin levels Patients will report daily ultrafiltration volumes one week prior to the start&#xD;
      of treatment Blood pressure, heart rate and weight of patients prior to the start of&#xD;
      treatment Sodium sieving will estimated by subtracting the sodium dialysate concentration at&#xD;
      time zero from the sodium dialysate concentration at one hour. Uric Acid levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then start on Dapagliflozin 10 mg daily for 4 weeks. During the study period&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for any side effects including;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volume Depletion Ketoacidosis Hypoglycemia Urinary Tract infections Uric Acid levels&#xD;
      Discontinuation of drug due to Adverse Events (DAEs) Changes in clinical chemistry/hematology&#xD;
      parameters Adverse events of interest (volume depletion, major hypoglycemic events,&#xD;
      fractures, diabetic ketoacidosis, genital and urinary tract infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will monitored for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose levels Bicarbonate levels Blood pressure readings Hemoglobin A1C levels every 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the volume of ultrafiltration per patient and patient's weight, the&#xD;
      investigators will have the choice to change the prescription; as per the investigator&#xD;
      clinical judgment. For example if a patient with a four PD exchanges using 2.5% dextrose&#xD;
      which yielded about 1.5L of ultrafiltration daily, and once started on Dapagliflozin had an&#xD;
      increase ultrafiltration of 2.3 L a day, the investigator will be able to adjust the&#xD;
      prescription to include 1.5% exchanges; resulting in less ultrafiltration volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study period patient will be evaluated for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Peritoneal Equilibrium Test with 4.5% Dextrose peritoneal fluid 24 urine collection&#xD;
      for protein, glucose, and creatine clearance Peritoneal fluid albumin levels Blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and weight of patients prior to the start of treatment Sodium sieving will&#xD;
      estimated by subtracting the sodium dialysate concentration at time zero from the sodium&#xD;
      dialysate concentration at one hour. Uric acid levels The collection of all blood pressure,&#xD;
      hear rate reading and weights of patients will be recorded along with a daily ultrafiltration&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of serum and peritoneal fluid effluent will be frozen -20C for any future studies.&#xD;
