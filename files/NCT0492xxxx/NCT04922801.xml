      This project will examine the role of the whole body, PET and SPECT imaging before, during&#xD;
      and after radionuclide treatment for 177Lu-Dotatate therapy, whole body and SPECT imaging for&#xD;
      131-I for thyroid cancer therapy, and whole-body imaging for 131I for hyperthyroidism&#xD;
      therapy. Whole-body and SPECT images will be linked to personal dosimeter readings to&#xD;
      determine whether&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current radiation protection advice for patients receiving radionuclide treatment is&#xD;
           appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiopharmaceutical retention and/or SUV change in patients undergoing repeated&#xD;
           radionuclide treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data combined from early (quantitative imaging) and late (whole-body dose rate&#xD;
           measurements) could support individual treatment planning for patients undergoing&#xD;
           repeated cycles of molecular therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This cohort (retro- &amp; prospective) study will be conducted at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS&#xD;
      Foundation Trust (GSTTFT) among patients undergoing MRT. Pre and post-therapy blood tests,&#xD;
      treatment administration, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be undertaken in strict&#xD;
      accordance with existing GSTTFT approved protocols for each type of treatment. With the&#xD;
      exception of hyperthyroid patients receiving I-131 therapy, these procedures are all part of&#xD;
      the standard of care at GSTT. Hyperthyroid patients will be required to have one whole-body&#xD;
      scan at 24hrs post-therapy activity administration in addition to their standard care. This&#xD;
      will not result in additional radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to proceed with MRT will have been agreed upon at the relevant multidisciplinary&#xD;
      meeting in accordance with current practice guidelines. Pre and post-therapy blood tests,&#xD;
      whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be followed as per current GSTTFT protocols. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to undertake the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuroendocrine tumour and thyroid cancer patients: 1-7 days treatment whole-body gamma&#xD;
           camera and SPECT /CT scan. (Part of standard of care post-treatment monitoring at&#xD;
           GSTTFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Hyperthyroid patients: 24-hour post-treatment whole-body gamma camera scan. (Part of&#xD;
           this research protocol, will not involve any additional radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record SELFIE reading for 28 days post-therapy using the sheet provided. (Part of this&#xD;
           research protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete feedback questionnaire. (Part of this research protocol). *Benign thyroid&#xD;
           disease patients only: Reasonable travel expenses for the cost of an additional hospital&#xD;
           visit for post-treatment scans will be reimbursed from the nuclear medicine research&#xD;
           fund SPF228. (Maximum reimbursement 50 £)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, two dosimetry methods will be used and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whole-body self-monitored retention measurements study (SELFIE study):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A handheld radiation monitor (ATOMTEX model AT6130, Belarus) will be used to follow the&#xD;
           time course of radioactivity clearance in each patient. The measurement device (SELFIE&#xD;
           device) will be introduced to patients by a member of the medical physics team. Patients&#xD;
           will be shown how to operate and record readings obtained and will also receive&#xD;
           illustrated written instructions to build confidence. The devices are user friendly and&#xD;
           patients will be asked to record the measurements twice daily using a diary sheet,&#xD;
           typically taking about one minute to complete on each occasion. Measurement can begin&#xD;
           immediately following administration and will continue for 28 days afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following MRT administration, a standard whole-body dosimetry measurement will be taken&#xD;
           by a medical physicist at 1 and 2 meters distance. The patient will begin to take SELFIE&#xD;
           readings at the same time under supervision so that their records can be compared with&#xD;
           the physicists' results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 28 days, patients will be asked to return the diary sheet and SELFIE monitor by&#xD;
           post to GSTTFT in a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On completion of the 28-day exercise, patients will be asked to complete and return a&#xD;
           feedback questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The paper record of SELFIE readings will be reviewed by investigators from each patient&#xD;
           for 28 days post-therapy. All imaging will be performed at GSTTFT by specialist Nuclear&#xD;
           Medicine/PET staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All acquired images will be reconstructed and analysed by investigators using HERMES&#xD;
           software as described in section 13.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging response assessment Planar Whole body, SPECT/CT and PET/CT images will be&#xD;
           acquired to assess uptake patterns and, in the case of sequential treatments,&#xD;
           uptake/retention changes. SPECT/CT, PET/CT and whole-body scans will be performed in&#xD;
           accordance with existing protocols at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. This&#xD;
           will not result in additional radiation exposure. (Schedule illustrated in 16.1&#xD;
           Appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SUV of target and non-target tissues will be calculated from quantitative pre and&#xD;
      post-therapy PET/CT and post-therapy SPECT/CT images. As a result, early tumour response and&#xD;
      toxicity in patients undergoing molecular targeted radionuclide therapy can be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-led dose rate (SELFIE) data and imaging data will be integrated to compare whole-body&#xD;
      retention and evaluate sequential dose rate changes after repeated treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of SELFIE data will be assessed against pre-specified standards (completeness of&#xD;
      data collection, data deviation). Patient satisfaction will be evaluated from the feedback&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
