      This study was planned to examine the effects of Pilates training in Parkinson's Patients.&#xD;
      The study included 34 Parkinson's patients between Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage 1-2.5. Pilates training&#xD;
      was applied to the Pilates group for 8 weeks, 3 days per week. To the control group;&#xD;
      Breathing exercises, active range of motion exercises and relaxation exercises were given as&#xD;
      a home program 3 days per week for 8 weeks. It was concluded that Pilates training performed&#xD;
      to Parkinson's patients 3 times a week for 8 weeks was effective on &quot;core&quot; stability,&#xD;
      thickness of &quot;core&quot; muscles, functional exercise capacity, motor functions, freezing, fatigue&#xD;

      randomly divided into two groups as as Pilates (n: 17) and control (n: 17). Pilates training&#xD;
      was applied to the Pilates group for 8 weeks, 3 days per week. To the control group;&#xD;
      Breathing exercises, active range of motion exercises and relaxation exercises were given as&#xD;
      a home program 3 days per week for 8 weeks. The &quot;core&quot; power with the &quot;sit-ups&quot; and the&#xD;
      modified &quot;push-ups&quot; tests, the &quot;core&quot; endurans with lateral bridge, trunk flexor endurance&#xD;
      and &quot;prone bridge&quot; tests, the thickness of the &quot;core&quot; muscles by ultrasonography, functional&#xD;
      strength of the lower limbs with 5 Times Sit Up Test (5TSST), balance with the Berg Balance&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static endurance of the &quot;core&quot; muscles was evaluated using the lateral bridge test defined by McGill, the trunk flexor endurance test and the &quot;prone bridge&quot; test. The time in which the subjects could maintain the test position was recorded in seconds using a stopwatch. Each measurement was made twice and the best measurement was used in statistical analysis. The test was terminated if it disturbed the test position.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Freezing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ) was used to identify and evaluate the subjective perception of Parkinson's patients regarding the severity and effect of freezing on gait performance. The total score ranges from 0-24, with a higher score meaning that a person's walking performance is more affected by freezing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue, one of the non-motor findings associated with Parkinson's, was evaluated with the Parkinson's Fatigue Scale-16 (PFS-16). The total score ranged from 16 to 80, and a total of 8 points or more was considered tired.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was evaluated with Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). This questionnaire is the most frequently used specific health status measure in PD patients. The total score ranges from 0-100, and lower scores better reflect perceived quality of life.</description>

    <description>Pilates training was carried out as group exercises for about 1 hour, 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Before starting the exercise training, all subjects were taught the key elements of Pilates in 1 session. Pilates training started with standing exercises for warming up and centering in the supine position. Training continued with upper and lower extremity movements. The intensity of the exercises was increased using different positions and elastic bands. Stretching exercises and posture exercises were used during the cooling period. All exercises were started with 10 repetitions and then increased to 20. In order for the patients to perform the movements correctly, each movement was first demonstrated by the physiotherapist. The movements that the patients could not do were applied by modifying them in a suitable way.</description>
