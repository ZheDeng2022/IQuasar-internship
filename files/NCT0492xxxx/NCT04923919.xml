    <textblock>
      Researchers plan to enroll a total of 100 patients with relapsed, refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) to receive a single dose of autologous CAR T cells.The safety of CAR T therapy&#xD;
      was evaluated by observing adverse events after cell therapy;The efficacy of CAR-T therapy&#xD;
      was evaluated against the outcome of patients' own past standard treatment regimens or&#xD;
      historical data.Blood and bone marrow were collected before and 12 months after infusion to&#xD;
      detect the number and activity of CAR T cells, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      CAR T cells.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The diagnosis of myeloid leukemia was clear;Refractory treatment was defined as: (1) 2&#xD;
             patients who did not achieve partial remission after treatment with standard induced&#xD;
             remission regimens.② The patients who relapsed within 6 months after the first&#xD;
             remission were also called early recurrence.③ The failure relapsed 6 months after the&#xD;
             initial response, but was retreated with the original induced response regimen.(4)&#xD;
             multiple relapse.Relapse is defined as: patients who achieve complete remission after&#xD;
             treatment, more than 5% of leukemia cells in the bone marrow, also known as&#xD;
             intramedullary recurrence;Or the presence of leukaemia outside the bone marrow, also&#xD;
