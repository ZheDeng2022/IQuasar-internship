  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infraclavicular nerve block, which is frequently preferred in upper extremity surgeries,&#xD;
      provides additional advantages such as reduction in opioid consumption by providing analgesic&#xD;
      effect in the postoperative period as welll. The success of peripheral nerve blocks is&#xD;
      usually assessed by subjective feedback from the patient, and patient cooperation is needed.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess whether the perfusion index level, which can be measured&#xD;
      noninvasively, can be a predictor of the infraclavicular block success.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients who were operated on for carpal tunnel syndrome under infraclavicular&#xD;
      brachial plexus block were included in our study. After the procedure, at 10-minute&#xD;
      intervals, the sensory block was assessed by a pinprick test, and the motor block was&#xD;
      assessed by the ability to flex the hand and the forearm. In addition, PI and skin&#xD;
      temperature were measured 0-10-20-30 minutes after the block and at postoperative 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
      hours. 30 minutes after the measurements, the surgical procedure was allowed to begin in&#xD;
      patients with successful block.&#xD;

    <measure>Determining of a cut-off value for PI and PI ratio for a successful block.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>There may be changes in the cut-off value depending on the applied plexus area, local anesthesia, volume and concentration of LA and the applied assistive technique (ultrasound or nerve stimulator). For both this reason and due to the high variability in the PI values, the PI ratio was calculated to predict block success.</description>
