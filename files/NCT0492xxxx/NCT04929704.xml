    <textblock>
      The confusional syndrome is defined by the acute or subacute onset of a deficit syndrome&#xD;
      (temporo-spatial disorientation, memory and concentration disorders, abnormal behavior,&#xD;
      impairment of intellectual efficiency, fluctuation of disorders with an increase in the&#xD;
      evening) that may be associated with a productive syndrome (visual or auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations, delusional elements) (French College of Neurology). It is a frequent, serious&#xD;
      and costly problem in hospitalized patients and in emergency rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its prevalence is between 10 and 31% of cases in emergency rooms and concerns up to one out&#xD;
      of two elderly patients during a hospitalization. The potential morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      the confusional syndrome is due in part to the difficulty of identifying and treating rapidly&#xD;
      the triggering and aggravating factors that are often interrelated in the elderly. Most&#xD;
      often, these are drug effects, metabolic disorders, infections, consequences of prolonged&#xD;
      immobilization or physical restraint. The lack of rapid treatment of these causes increases&#xD;
      the risk of medium and long-term cognitive problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the aging population, this is an increasingly expensive problem. In 2012, the&#xD;
      World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe study conducted in 18 European countries&#xD;
      combined estimated its cost at $182 billion per year. The management of confusional syndrome&#xD;
      in the elderly is now a major public health issue. It is a targeted indicator of the safety&#xD;
      and quality of care for the elderly.&#xD;

      However, in the majority of situations, an appropriate history, an analysis of the patient's&#xD;
      treatments, a rigorous physical examination, and a blood biology examination are sufficient&#xD;
      to quickly identify and treat the cause(s) of the confusional syndrome. In the practice of&#xD;
      emergency departments, a brain scan without injection of contrast medium is nevertheless&#xD;
      frequently prescribed for an elderly person presenting a recent alteration of his cognitive&#xD;
      functions. One explanation is that clinical signs suggestive of intracranial lesion may be&#xD;
      more difficult to detect in frail elderly patients with a significant history, in the same&#xD;
      way as those of sepsis for example. On the other hand, an alteration of the cognitive&#xD;
      function without any known antecedents for the patient, probably leads emergency physicians&#xD;
      to suspect too frequently a central neurological cause. However, the cause is most often of&#xD;
      extracerebral origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Paris Saint Joseph Hospital, the number of emergency room visits increased by 4% between&#xD;
      2018 and 2019. The Emergency Department is the second largest emergency department in Ile de&#xD;
      France in terms of attendance of a geriatric patient base (20% of patients seen). These&#xD;
      observations prompt an urban emergency department like ours to evaluate the relevance and&#xD;
      quality of our geriatric emergency medicine practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, several American studies, mostly monocentric and retrospective, have&#xD;
      examined the diagnostic utility of brain scans in elderly patients with confusional syndromes&#xD;
      during their observation in the emergency department. The discovery of a scannographic&#xD;
      abnormality explaining the symptomatology occurred in 10 to 39% of cases depending on the&#xD;
      series. The patient cohorts differed in terms of age and clinical presentation. Some were&#xD;
      predominantly composed of patients with a focal neurological sign associated with confusion,&#xD;
      others exclusively of patients with head trauma. We did not find any study that specifically&#xD;
      evaluated the diagnostic contribution of an emergency brain scan in the elderly patient ≥ 75&#xD;
      years of age with isolated confusion, i.e., in the absence of a neurological localizing sign&#xD;
      and in the absence of a head injury under antiplatelet therapy (AAP) and/or anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy, for which the indication of brain imaging is not debatable. One study evaluated the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield of brain scans in the emergency department in adult patients with an acute&#xD;
      delirious episode. However, it was more about exploring a first psychiatric episode in rather&#xD;
      young patients. This problem appears interesting in the confused elderly subject because the&#xD;
      realization of a CT scan is time-consuming, expensive, and irradiating. It has an impact on&#xD;
      the length of stay in the emergency department, the prolongation of which is itself a source&#xD;
      of a confusional episode, with its share of complications: fall, agitation, disorientation,&#xD;
      mechanical restraint, inappropriate use of benzodiazepines and neuroleptics, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ageing of the population, the morbidity of confusional episodes in the elderly in&#xD;
      the absence of rapid adapted treatment, and the frequent saturation of emergency departments,&#xD;
      it is useful to know the real diagnostic yield of the brain scan performed for an isolated&#xD;
      confusional syndrome observed in the elderly in the emergency department. At the same time,&#xD;
      in France, targeted studies have highlighted an unregulated growth in the prescription of&#xD;
      certain medical imaging procedures. Possible reasons for this include the practice of&#xD;
      defensive medicine by extension of the precautionary principle, and the high expectations of&#xD;
      patients, their relatives, or treating physicians, who may exert pressure to prescribe.&#xD;
      Finally, acting also under the pressure of time management, where the clinical time spent&#xD;
      with each patient tends to be reduced, it is paradoxical that the prescription of brain&#xD;
      imaging examinations has increased in the emergency department in recent years. Determining&#xD;
      the organizational impact on the duration of care would allow us to meet a quality of care&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
