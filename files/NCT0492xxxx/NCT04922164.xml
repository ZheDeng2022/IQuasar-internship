  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Interventions focusing on promoting good behavioural intentions were found to&#xD;
      only have small-to-moderate effect sizes on changing the actual behaviours. Self-regulation&#xD;
      plays an important role to maintain individual attentions to the distant benefits of healthy&#xD;
      behaviours and resist to proximal tempting cues from unhealthy behaviours, and thereby&#xD;
      facilitate the translation of good intention into actual behaviours. However, self-regulation&#xD;
      resources are limited and can be depleted in certain contexts. Providing environmental cues&#xD;
      relevant to the desirable behaviours can activate the nonconscious process and lead to&#xD;
      behavioural change without conscious awareness, the underlying mechanism of cueing&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To test the effectiveness of using two types of cues, social normative and goal-related&#xD;
      cues, to activate the nonconscious process for facilitating the translation of intentions&#xD;
      into actual behaviours. We hypothesize that (1) cueing interventions will be more effective&#xD;
      than will conventional education-based interventions (providing factual information about&#xD;
      health benefits) be for changing behaviours; (2) cueing interventions are more effective for&#xD;
      participants who have a tendency to use an intuitive mode in information processing; and (3)&#xD;
      goal priming is more effective for participants with stronger motivation to pursue the goal&#xD;
      of sustaining breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject and study design: The hypotheses will be tested in the behavioural context of&#xD;
      breastfeeding among first-time mothers because: first, primiparous women may have less&#xD;
      self-regulation resources due to high cognitive demand for postpartum adjustment during&#xD;
      motherhood transition; and second, while breastfeeding intention and initiation were high,&#xD;
      maintaining breastfeeding for the first six months postpartum was generally low in Hong Kong,&#xD;
      indicating a substantial intention-behaviour gap. We propose to recruit 600 primiparous&#xD;
      women. Baseline assessments will be conducted face-to-face using a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire. Participants will be randomly allocated to the control group (receive&#xD;
      education-based messages about the health benefit of breastfeeding) or one of the two&#xD;
      intervention groups (receive either social normative cues or goal-related cues related to&#xD;
      breastfeeding). All messages will be delivered through smartphone on a daily basis over 16&#xD;
      weeks postpartum.&#xD;

    <description>Around 30 pieces of narrative information about how a mother behaves in specific decision context will be derived from our qualitative study to construct social normative cues.&#xD;
For goal-related cues, words relating to each category of breastfeeding-related values, benefits and goals will be identified and used to construct the messages (e.g. &quot;attractive body shape&quot;, &quot;smart baby&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;strong immunity&quot; and etc.). Each goal-priming message will be presented with brief priming words and a picture of an image of the desirable goal.</description>
