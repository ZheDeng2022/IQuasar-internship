      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic soft tissue mobilization in comparison&#xD;
      with the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (hold-relax) technique in reducing&#xD;
      hamstring muscle tightness, pain and improving physical functions in patients with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) by using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Active Knee Extension Angle Test&#xD;
      (AKET) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: A single blinded randomized control trial will be carried out at MSK OPD of&#xD;
      IPM&amp;R, DUHS, Karachi. Data collection will be started after the approval of Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board of Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi. After screening by consultant&#xD;
      physiatrist, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, forty-eight (n=48) patients who will&#xD;
      fulfill clinical plus radiographic classification criteria of ACR (American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology) for osteoarthritis of the knee, will be enrolled in the study. After describing&#xD;
      the study objectives to participants and taking formal consent from them, the assessment&#xD;
      forms will be used to collect the data. Participants will randomly allocate and equally&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups i.e. 24 in interventional group 'A' and 24 in interventional group 'B'.&#xD;
      The interventional group 'A' will be received dynamic soft tissue mobilization on hamstring&#xD;
      muscle along with cryotherapy on knee joint and isometric strengthening exercises for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis while the interventional group 'B' will be received proprioceptive&#xD;
      neuromuscular facilitation (hold relax) technique on hamstring muscle along with cryotherapy&#xD;
      on knee joint and isometric strengthening exercises for knee osteoarthritis. Twelve sessions&#xD;
      will be given each of 30 minutes. Baseline and post treatment assessment will be carried out&#xD;
      by independent assessor, other than the principal investigator who will give the&#xD;
      intervention, to measure outcomes by using visual analog scale (VAS), active knee extension&#xD;
      angle test (AKEA) and knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted within six months right after synopsis approval.&#xD;

        -  History of spinal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient having low backache or sciatica&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 48 patients (24 in one group) is calculated by using open epi software&#xD;
      version 3, Paired Means Power Analysis with 99% Confidence Interval and 95% power of test,&#xD;
      mean ± S.D of VAS 5.27 ± 0.8 in group A and 3.81±1.4 in group B&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be non-probability purposive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected just after the IRB approval. After physician referral and screening,&#xD;
      those 48 patients will be enrolled in the study who will fulfilling the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be signed from all participants after given the brief description of&#xD;
      study objectives, information about treatment, possible risk and benefits of treatment&#xD;
      through an informed sheet which will be translated into Urdu language for the comprehension&#xD;
      of the participant. Each selected subject will go for random allocation by using&#xD;
      randomization software generated random list in one of the two treatment groups with&#xD;
      different interventions. The assessor will be a physiotherapist other than the principal&#xD;
      investigator and will be blinded to the intervention type of patient which will be assessed.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be analyzed by the active knee extension angle test (AKEA test) for&#xD;

      injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) for physical functions. Assessment will be&#xD;
      done on baseline and will reevaluate after 4 weeks treatment on 12th session. 4 weeks&#xD;
      treatment for every patient of each group in alternate days i.e. 12 sessions, each will be of&#xD;
      30 minutes. Every attempt will be done within ethical constraints in obtaining and recording&#xD;
      outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally. In case of any aggravation in symptoms, patients will be allowed to take&#xD;
      similar analgesics and muscle relaxants prescribed by the referring consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;

      will be calculated for quantitative variables like age. For qualitative variables, there will&#xD;
      be calculation of percentage and frequency. The outcomes of the study, pain intensity, muscle&#xD;
      tightness and range of motion (ROM) will be recorded at baseline and after treatment and then&#xD;

    <description>Dynamic soft tissue mobilization will be given in the following sequence, In supine position with 90˚ flexion of knee and hip joint deep longitudinal strokes will be applied from distal to proximal direction along with the tightened area of hamstring while passively stretching the hamstring. Total 5 longitudinal strokes will be applied followed by shaking for 20 seconds. Then progressed to the next dynamic technique in the above-mentioned sequence but the patient will be asked to do leg extension actively to achieve reciprocal inhibition of the hamstring muscle. In The next step, the subject will apply a force to the therapist's hand to engage the hamstring eccentrically as the muscle will be lengthened to its end range. In that position, the therapist will apply 5 deep longitudinal strokes from the distal towards the proximal direction on tight hamstring muscles.</description>

    <description>The position of the patient will be supine lying with 90⁰ flexion of hip. Therapist will passively extend the knee joint where patient will feel a mild stretch. Then therapist will ask the patient to do knee flexion in counter resistance applied by the therapist by using about 50% of his maximum strength and isometric contraction of hamstring muscles will be achieved. Patient will maintain that isometric contraction for 8 seconds then relax on therapist command. Just after relaxation therapist will further stretch the hamstring muscle to the point of mild to moderate painless stretch and patient will hold it for 30 seconds. Three repetitions will be applied in each session.</description>
