  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innovative Design Labs Inc. (IDL) and its collaborators, proposes to create a cloud-based&#xD;
      system which integrates advances and techniques from Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) into&#xD;
      the Hearing Aid (HA) fitting and trial process.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of 2015, 28.8 million U.S. adults could benefit from using hearing aids and the prevalence&#xD;
      of hearing loss in the United States is predicted to rise significantly due to an aging&#xD;
      population and the growing use of personal listening devices. However, only 28.5% of&#xD;
      individuals who could benefit from a HA actually wears one. The non-use of hearing aids by&#xD;
      people with hearing loss has many far-reaching implications for their physical health, mental&#xD;
      health, and their social life. As the market moves towards a, direct-to-consumer distribution&#xD;
      model following the 2017 FDA directive, more patients will be receiving therapy for hearing&#xD;
      loss. While in traditional practice, an audiologist assists the patient with support&#xD;
      adjusting to their new therapy, there is no person fulfilling that role in the&#xD;
      direct-to-consumer model. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the integration of&#xD;
      Health and Wellness Coaching, aided by cloud-based tools, into this process will increase&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction and usage of hearing health products. Specific Aims: 1) Create&#xD;
      patient/coach interaction protocol and training; 2) Develop a cloud-based Health Coaching&#xD;
      Interface; 3) Evaluate system effectiveness through a clinical trial.&#xD;

    <measure>COSI Goal Achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire tracks the goals and needs of the patient through their hearing aid fitting process. Items allow the patient to qualify their degree of change for each of their needs/goals as 1) Much Worse 2) Worse 3) No Difference 4) Better 5) Much Better. Total scores are an average of item scores and range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>AQoL-8D Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) is a measure of health-related Quality of Life. AQoL-8D covers dimensions of Independent Living, Happiness, Mental Health, Coping, Relationships, Self-Worth, Pain, and Senses. Items are scored from 0 to 3. Scores range from 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hours of Hearing Aid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hearing aid usage information for both groups will be automatically logged on non-volatile memory inside of the hearing aid. It will record the amount of time in hours the user spent wearing their hearing aids. It is accessed and downloaded through the provided companion smartphone application.</description>
