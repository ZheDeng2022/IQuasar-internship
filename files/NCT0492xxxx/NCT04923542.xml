  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study of abemaciclib and endocrine therapy with stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS) among patients with hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I/II&#xD;
      trial of abemaciclib and endocrine therapy with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) among&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer brain metastases.&#xD;
      Treatment will be initiated with one week of abemaciclib followed by stereotactic radiation&#xD;
      to sites of brain metastases or post-operative cavities with continued abemaciclib. Safety&#xD;
      will be monitored initially by a 3+3 design. This will be followed by a phase 2 study to&#xD;
      evaluate intracranial progression free survival (PFS). If unexpected neurologic toxicities&#xD;
      are noted, the dose of radiation therapy will be modified.&#xD;
