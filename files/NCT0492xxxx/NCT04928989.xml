    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at workplaces, where the work environment and tasks increase&#xD;
      employee risk of developing neck problems. A total of 320 participants will be recruited&#xD;
      consecutively and after informed consent randomized to convergenge dialogue meeting with or&#xD;
      without neck-specific exercise. The main outcome measure is work ability, measured via the&#xD;
      Work Ability Score.&#xD;

      Background: Collaboration between employees, manager and occupational health expert is needed&#xD;
      to promote work ability. One effective method is a convergence dialogue meeting (CDM). Based&#xD;
      on the existing work situation, factors are identified in these meetings that can strengthen&#xD;
      the employee's work ability and opportunities for a sustainable working life. A combination&#xD;
      of workplace and individual interventions is recommended for best effect. Neck-specific&#xD;
      exercise (NSE) is the method with the most evidence for neck problems. NSE in evidence based&#xD;
      form has not been investigated for work-related neck pain. More knowledge is needed regarding&#xD;
      how CDM can be combined with NSE because clear guidelines are lacking on the best&#xD;
      intervention for increased work ability in the case of neck problems. Also lacking are&#xD;
      evaluations of digitally distributed CDMs and NSE with support from a web-based program for&#xD;
      the current population. The aim of the proposed randomized controlled study is to investigate&#xD;
      the contribution of NSE with four visits to a physiotherapist and support from a web-program&#xD;
      in addition to three digital CDMs promoting the work situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be conducted at workplaces, where the work environment and tasks&#xD;
      increase employee risk of developing neck problems. A total of 320 participants will be&#xD;
      recruited consecutively and after informed consent randomized to CDM with or without NSE. The&#xD;
      main outcome measure is work ability, measured via the Work Ability Score. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are pain, function, health-related quality of life, work absenteeism and&#xD;
      presenteeism, work-related factors, and cost-effectiveness. Pathophysiological aspects&#xD;
      regarding inflammation and stress markers measured in blood and saliva will be studied, as&#xD;
      will muscular changes measured by microdialysis. Interviews are planned with both employees&#xD;
      and managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The goal of the study is to contribute to improved rehabilitation, strengthened&#xD;
      work ability, and a sustainable working life for employees with neck problems.&#xD;
