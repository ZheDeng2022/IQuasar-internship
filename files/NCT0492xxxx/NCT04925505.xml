  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether the success or failure of interscalene brachial&#xD;
      plexus block under general anesthesia can be predicted using perfusion index (PI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of peripheral nerve blocks is usually evaluated by assessment of sensory and&#xD;
      motor function; however, this method cannot be applied in the patient who has uncheckable&#xD;
      mental status, e.g. general anesthesia, or who is uncommunicable, e.g. different language&#xD;
      user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perfusion index (PI) is a numerical value for the ratio between pulsatile and&#xD;
      non-pulsatile blood flow measured by a special pulse oximeter, and PI had been proved as a&#xD;
      useful tool for evaluation of successful supraclavicular nerve block in awake patients as an&#xD;
      objective method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the use of ultrasound guidance in skilled hands, it is a reasonable option to perform&#xD;
      neuraxial and peripheral regional blocks in sedated or anesthetized patients. However, there&#xD;
      has been no evidence of applying PI for predicting the success of nerve block in general&#xD;
      anesthetized patients.&#xD;

    <description>The study included patients aged between 20 and 70 yr who are to undergo elective shoulder surgery under general anesthesia. Patients undergo general anesthesia induction before the interscalene block is performed. Ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block will be performed in anesthetized patients before surgery. PI monitor will be applied to both blocked and non-blocked limbs using two separate oximeters. And the SUCCESS (or failure) of the block will be confirmed by (1) 30% change of heart rate and blood pressure after incision during operation, and (2) pain score, motor and sensory function test after surgery in the post-anesthesia recovery unit.</description>
