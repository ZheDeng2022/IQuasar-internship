    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Double Blinded, Placebo Controlled, Randomized, Cross-over trial using&#xD;
      Qbrexza Cloths to treat hyperhidrosis of amputation sites. There is a 2 week screening period&#xD;
      where patients will use an activity monitor to establish baseline activity level, then&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to receive either Qbrexza cloths or placebo for 4 weeks, then a 2&#xD;
      week washout, and then a 4-week cross-over treatment period.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1 in 190 people in the United States have experienced a limb amputation. Of&#xD;
      these patients with amputations, over sixty percent suffer from hyperhidrosis at the&#xD;
      amputation site. Amputation site hyperhidrosis interferes with these patients' daily&#xD;
      activities as well as their ability to engage in vigorous activity beneficial to their&#xD;
      overall health. In fact, amputees identified heat and sweating as what reduces their quality&#xD;
      of life more than any other problem, even pain. Despite the significant impact hyperhidrosis&#xD;
      has on amputees' quality of life and ability to stay physically active, there are no&#xD;
      self-administered, non-invasive, well-tolerated treatments for amputation site hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin injections are an available treatment option for focal hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
      However, the large surface area covered by the prosthetic and prosthetic sleeve often&#xD;
      necessitates very large volumes of botulinum toxin for effective treatment at amputation&#xD;
      sites. This is costly, making it difficult to be able to treat the entire affected area.&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin also requires office visits and repeat treatments every 4-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycopyrronium cloths are a unique treatment possibility, because they can easily be used&#xD;
      over a large body surface area and can easily be self-administered at home. At this time,&#xD;
      glycopyrronium cloths are only FDA approved for use in the axillae. There are two primary&#xD;
      differences between the use of these cloths at amputation sites and axillae: 1) the&#xD;
      amputation site is occluded during daytime hours by the prosthetic and 2) the area treated&#xD;
      for amputation-site hyperhidrosis (the entire area covered by the prosthetic sleeve) is&#xD;
      typically a much larger surface area than the axillae. These factors could significantly&#xD;
      increase systemic absorption of glycopyrronium and cause systemic side effects. In order to&#xD;
      minimize these effects, the medication will be applied at night, when the site is not&#xD;
      occluded. Frequent visits with the investigator will also encourage early reporting of&#xD;
      symptoms which could be the result of systemic side effects associated with use on a larger&#xD;
      surface area. Patient reported outcomes will be used to determine effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Prospective, Double Blinded, Placebo Controlled, Randomized, Cross-over trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized, using a 1:1 ratio, to one of 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm #1: At Baseline participants will receive active treatment for 4 weeks, completing a&#xD;
           1 week wash out period and then concluding with 4 weeks of placebo treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm #2: At baseline participants will receive placebo for 4 weeks, completing a 1 week&#xD;
           washout period and then concluding with active treatment for 4 weeks.&#xD;
