  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost everyone will have low back pain (LBP) at some point in their lives. LBP is a complex&#xD;
      multifactorial condition for which diagnosis and clinical management remains a challenge.&#xD;
      Factors such as wait times, delays in diagnosis or proper referral can result in Canadian&#xD;
      patients having difficulty getting the care that they need. The overall objective of this&#xD;
      project is to explore how chiropractors, who specialize in the diagnosis and clinical&#xD;
      management of spinal conditions, can transform healthcare trajectories and improve the health&#xD;
      of patients with LBP by integrating medical specialist team.To do so, patients with low back&#xD;
      pain seeking medical care within the public health system will be first seen by&#xD;
      chiropractors. Chiropractors will play a key role in identifying the type of low back pain&#xD;
      and subsequently offering guidance to medical specialists with regard to the best treatment&#xD;
      and management options that are currently recommended. Participating patients will be&#xD;
      followed over a year while extensive health-related data will be collected and compared to&#xD;
      non-triage patients with LBP.&#xD;

        This study will involve individuals seeking medical consultation in the tertiary care&#xD;
        public health system for an episode of LBP. The study will be conducted at the neurosurgery&#xD;
        outpatient clinic affiliated to the Centre Intégré Universitaire de Santé et de Services&#xD;
        Sociaux- Mauricie Centre du Québec (CIUSSS-MCQ; Trois-Rivières' regional healthcare&#xD;
        organization). The CIUSSS-MCQ, established in 2015 as a result of the merger of 12 health&#xD;
        and social services public institutions, totals 974 physicians, including 515 GPs. It&#xD;
        serves a population of over 510,000 inhabitants, of which 83% are over 18 years of age&#xD;
        (17).&#xD;
