    <textblock>
      Inflammatory joint diseases (IJD) are autoimmune diseases with common symptoms of joint&#xD;
      inflammation, pain, stiffness and fatigue. Compared to the general population, this large&#xD;
      patient-group has an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related&#xD;
      mortality. Patients with IJD call for improved CVD screening and risk management as well as&#xD;
      access to evidence-based non-pharmacological treatment alternatives. Evidence supports high&#xD;
      intensity training (HIT) in mitigating risk of CVD and inflammation, but the evidence of&#xD;
      these cardioprotective benefits is unclear in patients with IJD and the feasibility of HIT&#xD;
      protocols in daily clinical care needs to be addressed. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an&#xD;
      important physiological marker and highly correlated to risk of CVD. Despite strong&#xD;
      recommendations, routine assessment of CRF is seldom performed in clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExeHeart study will assess the potential cardioprotective and disease-modifying effect of&#xD;
      HIT in IJD in a randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, the ExeHeart-study will report on&#xD;
      the validity of non-exercise measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF) measures for use in&#xD;
      daily clinical care. Additionally, we will explore the feasibility of HIT by addressing&#xD;
      adherence and fidelity to the HIT treatment protocol in a primary care setting&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients aged 18-70 years&#xD;
      presenting with inflammatory joint disease at the Preventive Cardio-Rheuma clinic at&#xD;
      Diakonhjemmet hospital (Oslo) will be included if eligible for the study. Succeeding baseline&#xD;
      testing, participants are randomized to either experimental group (high-intensity&#xD;
      exercise-HIT) or control group (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is a 12-week HIT program effective on VO2peak, inflammatory markers and risk of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in patients with inflammatory joint disease and what is the&#xD;
           association between VO2peak and disease-specific and cardiovascular disease-related&#xD;
           variables?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is a non-exercise cardio-respiratory fitness algorithm (eCRF) valid in determining&#xD;
           longitudinal change in VO2peak in patients with inflammatory joint disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How feasible is a HIT intervention in primary care in patients with inflammatory joint&#xD;
           disease in terms of adherence and fidelity to the exercise program?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be a between group comparison of VO2peak levels. This will be&#xD;
      carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle, and done by the analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for VO2peak values at baseline along with stratification&#xD;
      factors used in the randomization. Secondary analyses will include between group comparisons&#xD;
      on secondary endpoints, as well as comparisons in the per protocol population. No adjustment&#xD;
      for multiple testing will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between VO2peak and changes in inflammatory markers, disease activity and CVD&#xD;
      risk will be assessed using multiple regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of eCRF models to accurately detect longitudinal change in VO2peak from baseline&#xD;
      to 12 week and 6 month follow-up will be assessed with Pearson or Spearman correlation by&#xD;
      comparing VO2peak derived from a cardiopulmonary exercise test to eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of a HIT program and adherence will be examined with descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Adherence to the prescribed HIT intervention will be recorded by attendance to exercise&#xD;
      sessions. Quality of treatment delivery will be quantified as the number of exercise sessions&#xD;
      complying with the planned exercise intensity and number of exercise sessions requiring dose&#xD;
      modifications such as lower exercise intensity or early session termination. At the 12-week&#xD;
      point, an electronic questionnaire will be distributed to patients in the HIT group.&#xD;
      Questions regarding feasibility and implementation fidelity will address patients'&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction with the HIT program. The ExeHeart study will also include&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews, targeting physiotherapists in charge of supervising the exercise&#xD;
      sessions and 5-7 patients in the intervention group. The interviews will explore barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators in exercise adherence, experience with the protocol and perceived effects of&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;

    <description>Health-related quality of life is measured by the EQ5D-5L questionnaire. Patients are asked to answer their ability to perform walking, personal care and activities of daily life on a 5 point Likert scale from no difficulties to not able to. Pain and anxiety/depression is measured on a 5 point Likert scale from no pain to very strong pain, and no anxiety/depression to extremely anxious/depressed. General experience of health is measured from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) on a numeric rating scale.</description>

    <description>Usual care; CVD risk assessment including general lifestyle advice and relevant medication.&#xD;
The 12-week intervention is carried out as individual or group sessions with maximal 4 patients and supervised by physiotherapists in primary health care. The HIT group complete two weekly HIT sessions and a third weekly session with continuous exercise at moderate intensity. Due to differences in CRF levels, exercise is tailored to each individual to provide the same relative exercise stress and to ensure progression. Target exercise intensity is tracked by a heart rate monitor.&#xD;
Patients are asked to record individual exercise session in a training diary. Succeeding the intervention, an electronic questionnaire will be distributed to patients in the experimental group. Additionally, semi-structured interviews, face-to-face or by telephone/video, will target physiotherapists in charge of supervising the exercise sessions as well as 5-7 patients in the intervention group.</description>
