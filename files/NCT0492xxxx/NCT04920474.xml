  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Research Sample Repository is to make blood samples available for&#xD;
      research studies related to histocompatibility and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&#xD;
      or other cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representatives of participating centers and investigators or research groups may request&#xD;
      access to research samples contained in the Research Sample Repository for the purpose of&#xD;
      conducting research including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigating molecular explanations for histocompatibility or clinical outcomes through&#xD;
           analysis of genomic, epigenetic, or other biomolecular data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluating the factors that affect transplant or cellular therapy outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  studying the distribution of HLA tissue types in different populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  studying the success of transplantation, cellular therapies or supportive care in the&#xD;
           management of marrow toxic injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performing de-linked (anonymous) research&#xD;

      Up to thirty milliliters (30 mL) of blood are collected from adult patients and adult donors.&#xD;
      For pediatric patients where the collection of the full sample is medically contraindicated,&#xD;
      as little as one milliliter (1 mL) of blood may be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where donor or patient blood samples are not available, samples may consist of any&#xD;
      material that could potentially yield testable DNA. Types may include red cell pellets,&#xD;
      extracted DNA, dried blood on filter paper, viable cells, and any other testable material.&#xD;

        Eligibility to participate in the Research Sample Repository Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematopoietic Cell (HC) or Other Cellular Therapy Donors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors are eligible to participate in the Research Sample Repository if they have&#xD;
             donated or are scheduled to donate HCs or cellular therapy products to an allogeneic&#xD;
             recipient either by a marrow harvest or by apheresis. This includes adults with and&#xD;
             without decision making capacity and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All donors registered on the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Registry, regardless&#xD;
             of whether they have been requested to donate a product for a patient, are eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the Research Sample Repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cord Blood Units (CBUs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Testable material from CBUs (Specimens) infused at treatment centers covered under the&#xD;
             C. W. Bill Young Transplantation Program are eligible for inclusion in the Research&#xD;
             Sample Repository. Material may be submitted by participating treatment centers,&#xD;
             centralized laboratories and Cord Blood Banks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation or Other Cellular Therapy Recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All U.S. recipients of allogeneic or autologous HC transplants or cellular therapies&#xD;
             are eligible to participate in the Research Sample Repository. This includes adults&#xD;
             with and without decision making capacity and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Marrow Toxic Injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who is treated for a marrow toxic injury at a center participating in the&#xD;
             NMDP's Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) is eligible to participate in the&#xD;
             Research Sample Repository. This includes adults with and without decision-making&#xD;
             capacity and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients may have received support care only, growth factor support,&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplant or other appropriate medical treatment for marrow&#xD;
             toxic injury&#xD;
