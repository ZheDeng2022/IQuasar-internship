    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the block dynamics and characteristics of&#xD;
      the two approaches while providing effective analgesia and safe anesthesia of the&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided Lateral sagittal Infraclavicular and costoclavicular approach in Brachial&#xD;
      plexus blocks.&#xD;

      Participants between the ages of 18-70 with the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA)&#xD;
      score I-II-III will be included in the study. All participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      preoperatively and information will be given about the anesthetic method to be applied.&#xD;
      Demographic data and ASA scores of the participants will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants included in the study will be taken to the regional anesthesia&#xD;
      application room in the operating room approximately 1 hour before the operation. After&#xD;
      standard anesthesia monitoring (electrocardiography, pulsoximetry, non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure), all participants will be given an iv vascular access with a 20 or 22 G cannula&#xD;
      from the arm that will not be operated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blocks will be made using portable US machine and echogenic block needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all blocks, 20 ml of a mixture of 0.25% bupivacaine, 1% lidocaine will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overall (average) sensory and motor score was also calculated for every participants and&#xD;
      at each time point assessed by averaging the VRS sensory or motor scores of all the 4 nerves&#xD;
      will be tested preoperatively.&#xD;

    <description>Sensory block, defined as a loss of sensation to cold (ice), in the cutaneous distribution of the median (MN), radial (RN), ulnar (UN), and musculocutaneous (MCN) nerves will be assessed and graded according to a VRS (0-100, 100 = normal sensation and 0 = no sensation). Motor blockade of each of the 4 nerves in the ipsilateral upper extremity was also assessed and graded according to a 3-point qualitative scale (2 = normal motor power, 1 = paresis, and 0 = paralysis).Onset of sensory and motor blockade for each nerve was defined as the time (onset time) it took to achieve a sensory VRS of 30 or less and motor power grade of 1 or less, respectively.Time to readiness for surgery was defined as the time it took to achieve an overall sensory score of 30 or less and motor power grade of 1 or less, in all the 4 nerves tested.</description>
