    <textblock>
      Studies have suggested that Obese patients with metabolic syndrome(MetS)were correlated with&#xD;
      knee joint degeneration and osteoarthritis. However, no studies demonstrate the relationship&#xD;
      between obese patients with metabolic syndrome and degenerate meniscus lesions and its knee&#xD;
      function.The aim is to detect the correlation between obese patients with metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and degenerate meniscus injuries.&#xD;

      Obese patients with metabolic syndrome(MetS)were correlated with knee joint degeneration and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. However, no studies demonstrate the relationship between patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and degenerate meniscus lesions or knee function. Participants were&#xD;
      recruited from First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University. 100 BMI&lt;24 people&#xD;
      without Metabolic syndrome volunteers aged between 35-70 years old and 80 Metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      patients with BMI&gt;27 were included in the study. Obese patients with MetS were assessed knee&#xD;
      function and degenerate meniscus tears verified by magnetic resonance imaging. And patients&#xD;
      with a mild or no osteoarthritis with Kellgren and Lawrence grade&lt;2 verified by X ray. We&#xD;
      tested the relationship between metabolic syndrome and degenerate meniscus lesions. Obese&#xD;
      patients with MetS and volunteers were detected by Mcmurry's test and MRI image to measure&#xD;
      degeneration grade of meniscus tears. Number of MetS components were accounted and the knee&#xD;
      function KOOS, IKDC score or degenerate meniscus tears were analyzed.&#xD;

    <measure>the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) total</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) holds five subscales including: Pain (9 items); other Symptoms (7 items); Activities of Daily Living (ADL, 17 items); Sport and Recreation function (Sport/Rec, 5 items); and knee-related Quality of Life (QoL, 4 items). Each subscale is scored separately from zero (extreme knee problems) to 100 (no knee problems).</description>

    <measure>The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC) score to determine the meniscus function. The IKDC is a questionnaire that has high reliability and validity for patients with a meniscal tear[36, 37] [38]. The questionnaire contains 18 items (7 items for symptoms, 1 item for sport activity, 9 items for daily activities, and 1 item for current knee function.) The total score is transformed to a value on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest knee function and 0 is the worst.</description>
