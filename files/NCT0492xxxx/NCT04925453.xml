      Objectives: The proposed study will evaluate a new approach to cognitive rehabilitation of&#xD;
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using a brain stimulation technique called transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS). Specifically, we will investigate how tDCS combined with&#xD;
      cognitive training improves deficits to attention and working memory in Active Duty Service&#xD;
      Members with a history of mTBI. Measures of attention-related brain activity, neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessments, and self-reported clinical outcomes will be used to determine effects of tDCS&#xD;
      vs. sham tDCS when paired with a cognitive training intervention. By doing this study, we&#xD;
      hope to find a reliable, noninvasive, and efficient method of treating mild TBI cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan and Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham) controlled&#xD;
      pilot study. We will recruit 60 Active Duty Service Members who are receiving outpatient&#xD;
      services at Naval Medical Center San Diego, with a history of mTBI and reported&#xD;
      neurocognitive symptoms related to attention, working memory, and related cognitive&#xD;
      processes. Intake will involve a full pre-assessment of symptoms, neurocognitive performance,&#xD;
      and an optional MRI scan. Participants will be randomized to either active or sham tDCS.&#xD;
      Training/tDCS sessions will occur daily over five consecutive days. Random permuted blocks&#xD;
      will be used to ensure exactly equal treatment numbers at certain equally spaced points in&#xD;
      the sequence of patient assignment. Post-intervention assessment will include another&#xD;
      assessment of symptoms, neurocognitive performance, and an optional MRI scan. Participants&#xD;
      will complete assessments of symptoms and neurocognitive performance six-weeks following the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance to TBICoE/Navy Medicine: Aspects of this study will provide insight into a&#xD;
      major research gap highlighted in the mission of the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury&#xD;
      Center, specifically in identifying/ developing innovative treatments/interventions which&#xD;
      promote patient recovery and/or mitigate symptoms after mTBI. Novel, well-tolerated,&#xD;
      neuroplasticity-based interventions that can improve attention, concentration, and working&#xD;
      memory by targeting the underlying neural dysfunction are needed to improve outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life for Active Duty Service Members affected by neurocognitive weakness and&#xD;
      dysfunction following mTBI. If tDCS proves successful in reducing TBI-related symptoms,&#xD;
      improving cognition, or enhancing functional recovery, this non-invasive intervention could&#xD;
      be implemented within various DoD and VA settings, enhancing recovery, improving quality of&#xD;
      life, and bolstering occupational performance.&#xD;

    <description>Based on previous studies targeting working memory, focality of current delivery, and comfort and tolerance levels, (Paulo S. Boggio et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2016; Hoy et al., 2013; Teo, Hoy, Daskalakis, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2011), we will use a 2 mA current administered via two circular carbon rubber core electrodes in saline-soaked surface sponges (25 cm2), placed in a neoprene headcap with marked locations based on the 10-10 EEG system. The anodal stimulating electrode will be at location F3, over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cathodal electrode at location F4, over right DLPFC. Two reference electrodes, CMS and DRL, will be attached to the EarClip and applied to the earlobe with conductive gel.&#xD;
Before each training session, the impedance of the electrodes will be checked and verified to be ≤15 KOhm. Additionally, the stimulation will be terminated if the impedance of the electrodes is &gt; 20 KOhm. The current and impedance will be recorded for every session.</description>

    <description>For sham stimulation, the electrodes will be placed at the same positions as for active stimulation (F3 and F4). After an initial ramp-up period of 30 seconds, stimulation fades out over a period of 30 seconds. Additionally, at the end of the sham stimulation period, stimulation will fade in over a period of 30 seconds and then end with a final 30 second ramp-down period. Participants will feel the initial itching sensation associated with tDCS and experience the ramp-down period at the end of the sham stimulation period but will receive no active current during the rest of the sham stimulation period. This method of sham stimulation has been shown to be reliable (Gandiga et al., 2006).&#xD;
Before each training session, the impedance of the electrodes will be checked and verified to be ≤15 KOhm. Additionally, the stimulation will be terminated if the impedance of the electrodes is &gt; 20 KOhm. The current and impedance will be recorded for every session.</description>

    <description>Intervention sessions will occur during Visits 2-6. Cognitive training will occur concurrently with tDCS in both the active and sham tDCS groups. Over each 46-minute daily training period, 4 of 5 BrainHQ training tasks will be performed for approximately 11 minutes in a randomly selected order. Order of task presentation will be randomized each session. Stimulation sequences will occur in the first 13 minutes (shut off: Minute 13) of the session and the last 13 minutes of the session (turn on: Minute 33). The Symptom Rating Questionnaire (SRQ) will be asked before and after stimulation to assess for any side-effects. The BrainHQ Task Load Index (TLX) will be administered at the end of each intervention session. At the end of Intervention Session 3, subjects will be given a Blinding Questionnaire which asks whether they thought they received active or sham treatment.</description>
