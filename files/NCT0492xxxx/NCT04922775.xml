      In this study, 45 healthy participants between 20 and 40 of age will be included. After&#xD;
      obtaining the consent, the participants will be categorized into two(A&amp;B) groups randomly for&#xD;
      cross-over study. Each of group will accept either conventional taping or Chinese medicine&#xD;
      technique taping before muscle fatigue exercise. To compare the preventive effect, Myoton&#xD;
      PRO, pulse analysis equipment, etc will be applied for evaluation. The application of Chinese&#xD;
      medicine technique (ie. Chinese medicine functional reduction) taking the kinetic chain into&#xD;
      consideration may improve body's functional movement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the importance of exercise is highly valued. The prevalence of sports injury is&#xD;
      also increasing and may be associated with muscle fatigue. Therefore, the study focused on&#xD;
      the prevention of common muscle fatigue in legs during exercise. With the modern sport&#xD;
      medicine knowledge and kinesio taping, the investigators tried to figure out whether muscle&#xD;
      fatigue can be diminished through the concept of Chinese medicine channel sinews techniques&#xD;
      in advance. In this study, 45 healthy participants between 20 and 40 of age will be included.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are as follows: i.pregnancy ii.current health problem iii.injuries of&#xD;
      legs within a month. After obtaining the consent, the participants will be categorized into&#xD;
      two(A&amp;B) groups randomly for cross-over study. Each of group will accept either conventional&#xD;
      taping or Chinese medicine technique taping before muscle fatigue exercise. To compare the&#xD;
      preventive effect, Myoton PRO, pulse analysis equipment, etc will be applied for evaluation.&#xD;
      The application of Chinese medicine technique (ie. Chinese medicine functional reduction)&#xD;
      taking the kinetic chain into consideration may improve body's functional movement. Our goal&#xD;
      is to enhance the coordination of the entire body structure, not merely the partial body&#xD;
      structure improvement. In this way, it will benefit the prevention of exercise injuries and&#xD;
      therapeutic effect.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle tone</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The soft tissue will be evaluated by Myoton PRO. The muscle tone is measured by the &quot;oscillation frequency (HZ)&quot; characterizing the tone of a muscle in its passive or resting state without any voluntary contraction. Abnormally high muscle tine would slow the muscle recovery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The soft tissue will be evaluated by Myoton PRO. The muscle stiffness is evaluated by the &quot;dynamic stiffness (N/m)&quot; characterizing the resistance to a contraction or to an external force that deforms its initial shape. Abnormally high stiffness may lead to an inefficient economy of movement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle elasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle elasticity is evaluated by the &quot;logarithmic decrement&quot; of a tissue's natural oscillation characterizing the ability to recover its initial shape after a contraction of removal an external force of deformation. If the decrement of a muscle decreases, the muscle elasticity increases.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle relaxation</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The muscle relaxation is evaluated by the &quot;mechanical stress relaxation time (ms)&quot; characterizing the time for a muscle to recover its shape from deformation after a voluntary contraction or a removal of an external force.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle creep</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>The creep is evaluated by the &quot;ratio of deformation and relaxation time&quot; characterizing the gradual elongation of tissue over time when placed under a constant tensile stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment by the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The scale shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, or &quot;no hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10, which represents &quot;hurts like the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
