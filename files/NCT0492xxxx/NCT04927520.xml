  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm is one of the most common cerebrovascular diseases, with a prevalence&#xD;
      of about 3.2%. With the aging of the population and the further popularization of MRA and&#xD;
      other examination methods, the prevalence of intracranial aneurysm will further increase.&#xD;
      Rupture of intracranial aneurysm is an important cause of death and severe disability in&#xD;
      patients. The annual rate of rupture of intracranial aneurysm is about 1%, and the size of&#xD;
      aneurysm, the location of aneurysm in the posterior circulation, and the history of&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage on the aneurysm wall are the risk factors for aneurysm rupture.&#xD;
      Phases are currently recognized tools for assessing the risk of aneurysm rupture, which can&#xD;
      provide important guidance for neurosurgeons and patients to decide whether to actively&#xD;
      intervene. In the last century, for patients with intracranial aneurysm with high risk of&#xD;
      rupture, craniotomy and clipping for intracranial aneurysm was the gold standard for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with the rapid development of embolization technology and materials in the past 20&#xD;
      years, the application of endovascular embolization for intracranial aneurysms has been more&#xD;
      and more widely, especially after several large prospective studies such as ISAT and ISUIA,&#xD;
      endovascular embolization has more advantages over craniotomy clipping.Whereas, it is still&#xD;
      very popular to adopt craniotomy clipping for middle cerebral artery aneurysms, the main&#xD;
      reasons for which are relative superficial location, wider aneurysm neck, smaller parent&#xD;
      artery and more branching vessels, etc., which make early endovascular embolization treatment&#xD;
      not advantageous. With the maturity of stent-assisted embolization technology in recent&#xD;
      years, the use of a new generation of stents, and the improvement of perioperative&#xD;
      anti-platelet strategies, endovascular embolization has achieved good results in the&#xD;
      treatment of middle artery aneurysms. However, these studies were retrospective,&#xD;
      single-center studies, subject to a variety of confounding factors, and the reliability of&#xD;
      the results is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it will be of great clinical significance to carry out a prospective, multi-center&#xD;
      clinical study on the treatment strategy of middle cerebral artery aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysms who had been diagnosed with at&#xD;
      least one imaging （CTA/MRA/DSA）were enrolled. The treatment including endovascular&#xD;
      embolization and craniotomy clipping was determined according to routine management in the&#xD;
      center. After receiving informed consent from the patients, the safety and effectiveness data&#xD;
      were obtained to verify whether endovascular embolization was safe and effective. Through&#xD;
      further follow-up and data analysis, protective factors and risk factors for the treatment of&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery aneurysms were investigated. Through well-designed clinical studies,&#xD;
      safer and more effective treatment methods can be found, and potential factors leading to&#xD;
      perioperative complications can be found, ultimately improving the prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery aneurysms.&#xD;

      1. Data collection and management A unified and open public health platform will be&#xD;
           established, and data will be centrally recorded in each central unit for verification&#xD;
           by inspectors. An open network data platform for intracranial aneurysm research was&#xD;
           established by the management personnel of different qualification levels. In order to&#xD;
           ensure the advancement and sustainable development of the data platform construction, a&#xD;
           public research platform for intracranial aneurysms shared in the province was built by&#xD;
           using the keywords and retrieval items commonly used in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After researcher training and standardized study of the scheme, the formal trial was&#xD;
           started. A team of experts will be selected to form an inspection team, which will&#xD;
           initiate visits to each organization and conduct the first inspection visit as soon as&#xD;
           possible after screening the first subject. Regular monitoring visits are required until&#xD;
           the end of the experiment. All the data were collected according to the electronic&#xD;
           medical record (CRF) form, and then the aneurysm data (EDC) was managed according to the&#xD;
           CRF form, and the accuracy and rigor of the data were checked in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study establishes a management committee, including clinical experts,&#xD;
           evidence-based medicine experts, and CRO clinical study supervisors, who are responsible&#xD;
           for project design, task formulation, supervision of project implementation, data&#xD;
           analysis and formulation of standards and guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The central laboratory and imaging interpretation center were established to carry out&#xD;
           unified standard central storage for clinical specimens. The unified image and&#xD;
           laboratory technology platform can be used for the image examination and post-processing&#xD;
           technology in the project. Uniform standard interpretation of imaging data was carried&#xD;
           out. A unified, standardized and efficient transmission mechanism for clinical&#xD;
           specimens, data and data in each center was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Establish a data management committee, set up a network data platform and be responsible&#xD;
           for the construction and maintenance of the database, conduct real-time supervision on&#xD;
           the quality of the input data, ensure the safety, integrity and accuracy of the data,&#xD;
           establish and organize the implementation of the platform or offline dual-channel error&#xD;
           correction and reminder mechanism. Set and manage the rights of all project participants&#xD;
           on the data platform, monitor and record the data entry, modification and retrieval, set&#xD;
           and manage the data publication of the open platform. Contact and consult statistical&#xD;
           experts to conduct periodic analysis of data results and generate research reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Relying on professional CRO company, in the implementation process for the&#xD;
           implementation of the progress and quality of the implementation of random inspection&#xD;
           supervision. At the same time, set up a data regular self-check mechanism. Establish a&#xD;
           mechanism for regular training and evaluation of research participants. During the&#xD;
           research progress, regular project coordination meetings were held to timely coordinate&#xD;
           and solve problems in the process of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size Sample size was calculated according to a calculation formula (α=0.05,&#xD;
           bilateral test, 80% assurance). According to the literature and the data of the center,&#xD;
           the rate of MRS&lt;2 at 3 months was 95% for patients with endovascular interventional, and&#xD;
           was 85% for those with craniotomy and clipping. The number of samples needed for each&#xD;
           group was calculated by the software PASS15 to be at least 141. Considering that the&#xD;
           maximum shedding rate of 20% might occur during the clinical follow-up, 180 cases were&#xD;
           needed for each group, and 360 subjects were finally decided to be included in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Methods Statistical analysis of planned primary and secondary study&#xD;
           endpoints will be conducted in accordance with the intentionality treatment principle.&#xD;
           Subgroup analysis According to the needs of the experiment, the subjects can be divided&#xD;
           into different centers, male and female, and different age groups for corresponding&#xD;
           subgroup analysis. Methods for processing lost data Statistical analysis did not follow&#xD;
           the study protocol population definition and other statistical methods were used to deal&#xD;
           with lost data (e.g. multiple interpolation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethical approval of clinical research projects The study plan was reviewed and approved&#xD;
           by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School&#xD;
           of Medicine. The study protocol was designed and implemented in accordance with the&#xD;
