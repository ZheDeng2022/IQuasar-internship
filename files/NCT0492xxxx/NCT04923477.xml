  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tendinopathy, one of the pathologies identified as part of the cluster of&#xD;
      shoulder symptoms known as subacromial pain syndrome, is a common musculoskeletal shoulder&#xD;
      condition. Resolution of pain and disability is poor despite treatment, with only about 50%&#xD;
      reporting full recovery at 12 - 18 months. Prior studies suggest therapeutic exercise when&#xD;
      used alone and with other interventions can have positive outcomes; however, not all patients&#xD;
      with rotator cuff tendinopathy respond. Few studies have assessed the effects of exercise for&#xD;
      individuals with chronic pain, especially brain driven mechanisms, thought to play a key&#xD;
      role. In this study, we will use brain imaging to understand the mechanisms, identify&#xD;
      predictors of a positive response to exercise, and the relationship to biomechanical and&#xD;
      pain-related factors in patients with RC tendinopathy. The findings from this study will&#xD;
      optimize the delivery and treatment response to exercise for individuals with shoulder pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Theoretical models propose the development of shoulder pain from an acute injury or&#xD;
      repetitive motion seen in sports and certain work environments. Repetitive motions, in&#xD;
      combination with altered muscle activity and altered movement strategies, may lead to damage&#xD;
      of the rotator cuff structures resulting in local shoulder pain. Emerging evidence supports&#xD;
      the hypothesis that localized pain may result in chronic centralized pain over time through&#xD;
      central sensitization. Central nervous system changes, specifically those at the level of the&#xD;
      brain have been shown to play a role in chronic pain. Neurophysiological mechanisms have been&#xD;
      shown to predict symptom progression in other chronic pain conditions. Despite a large body&#xD;
      of evidence that therapeutic exercise, mechanisms leading to pain relief are still not well&#xD;
      understood. Studies identify a critical role of exercise in modulating excitation and&#xD;
      inhibition of key pain centers in the central nervous systems. However, limited evidence&#xD;
      exists as to the mechanisms of exercise in the management of patients with chronic pain with&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise.&#xD;

    <measure>Pennsylvania Shoulder Score (PENN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1, 2, 3 (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PENN is a self-report measure of pain, satisfaction with shoulder use, and function.&#xD;
The pain section has 3 questions of pain at rest, with normal daily activities, and with strenuous activities. The disability section has 20 items rated on a 4-category Likert scale for difficulty (0=cannot do at all, 1=much difficulty, 2=some difficulty, 3=no difficulty, and x=did not do before injury). The satisfaction section is 1 question, rating satisfaction with shoulder use on a 0-10 numeric scale (10 = fully satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Functional MRI (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 and 2 (baseline, 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A high resolution structural image will be acquired from each participant with a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence, with repetition time (TR) = 2200 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.26 ms, slice thickness = 1 mm, 176 slices, 256 × 256 voxel matrices, and 13 mm voxel size. Resting state scans will be acquired while participants rest with eyes closed for 10 min in 40-slice whole brain volumes, with slice thickness = 4 mm, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 28 ms, and flip angle = 77°. Imaging during the rotator cuff muscle activation will be performed by having the participant perform muscle activation tasks for the deltoid and rotator cuff while lying supine in the MRI scanner</description>

    <description>Shoulder kinematics of the humerus, thorax, and scapula will be assessed. Muscle activity will be assessed of the infraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff, deltoid, upper, lower, and middle trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles.</description>

    <description>Therapeutic exercise of resistance and mobility via a combination of HEP and in-person/virtual visits 5 days/ wk x 4 wks. Exercise program instruction in person, then 2-3 visits /wk x 4 wks (in-person or virtual) with a trained professional for progression of exercises. Adherence to exercise will be measured daily via text and recorded in a mobile app. Patients will start with Phase 1 exercises of shoulder external &amp; internal rotation, scapular stabilization, and active shoulder elevation; resistance levels of elastic bands will be assigned and progressed based on patient reported shoulder pain and perceived difficulty. Patients will be progressed to Phase 2 when they complete Phase 1. The exercise protocol will be delivered with the methods previously published by Tate, 2010 and Mintken 2016.</description>
