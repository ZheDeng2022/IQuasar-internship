      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the U.S., over 6.5 million people have heart failure. Researchers want to develop new&#xD;
      testing methods for cardiovascular problems using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve&#xD;
      the clinical diagnosis and management of people with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and test new methods for imaging the heart and blood vessels using MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 years and older who are having an MRI of their heart or blood vessels. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will have an electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) to measure the heart s electrical activity. Then they will have their scheduled MRI&#xD;
      scan. The MRI scanner is a large, hollow tube. Participants will lie on a table that moves in&#xD;
      and out of the tube. During the MRI, they may have contrast dye injected through an&#xD;
      intravenous line inserted into their arm or hand. ECG may be used to monitor their heartbeat&#xD;
      or coordinate pictures with their heartbeat. A flexible belt may be used to monitor their&#xD;
      breathing. A finger probe may be used to track their heart rate and/or oxygenation level.&#xD;
      Their blood pressure may be measured. Pictures may be taken of their blood vessels, heart,&#xD;
      and lungs before, during, and after they get medicine to increase blood flow. They may lie&#xD;
      flat and pedal a stress bicycle to increase their heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 5 years. During that time, participants may receive a yearly&#xD;
      survey about their health. They may be contacted for an optional follow-up MRI within 2 years&#xD;
      of their MRI.&#xD;

      This protocol allows testing of novel research pulse sequences in investigational&#xD;
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and allows application of custom pulse&#xD;
      sequences that are not market-cleared in routine clinical MRI. The purpose of this protocol&#xD;
      is thus to develop novel research sequences and implement and test custom cardiovascular MRI&#xD;
      pulse sequences so that the technical advances at NHLBI can be clinically implemented. This&#xD;
      will improve the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with heart failure.&#xD;
