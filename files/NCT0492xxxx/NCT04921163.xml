  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aluminium allergy is predominantly seen in children with small itchy nodules in the skin&#xD;
      after vaccinations, so-called granulomas. We want to do an exposure study where aluminium&#xD;
      allergic children have to eat aluminium pancakes for a short period of time. The purpose is&#xD;
      to investigate whether a worsening of the children's symptoms can be detected, both itching&#xD;
      of the granuloma, allergic rash on the skin and also the symptoms that are not measurable,&#xD;
      such as headache, stomach ache and general agitation. We also want to examine the&#xD;
      concentration of aluminium in the urine, which reflects the absorption of aluminum from the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of aluminium allergic children have reported that children may react with increased&#xD;
      itching of their granulomas, skin symptoms in the form of redness, itching and rash, as well&#xD;
      as symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain and agitation, by ingesting aluminium-containing&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children are predominantly exposed to aluminium via the diet as they do not yet use&#xD;
      aluminium-containing cosmetic products, stomach acid medicines or deodorants. The amount of&#xD;
      aluminium in children's diet varies between 0.22-0.90 mg/kg body weight/week, depending on&#xD;
      their age. In older children and adults, the intake is less related to the aluminium in&#xD;
      infant formula, breakfast cereals and dried fruit, which is consumed more by children than&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we want to create an exposure study where children have to eat pancakes for&#xD;
      a limited period of time, where aluminium has been used as baking soda, and for two control&#xD;
      periods eat pancakes without aluminium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any symptoms occurring during periods could be used to investigate whether children with&#xD;
      aluminium allergies generally react after intake of aluminium-containing foods and whether as&#xD;
      such it is a consequential condition in some children or whether it is isolated cases. It is&#xD;
      a very important issue to clarify with a view to proper advice, both with regard to the&#xD;
      possible avoidance of specific foods and in the case of future vaccinations.&#xD;
