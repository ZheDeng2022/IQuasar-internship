      The purpose of this study is determine the effect on novel pressure-regulating tourniquet use&#xD;
      on pain, functional recovery, sleep and total blood loss following total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has seen dramatic improvement over&#xD;
      the past 20 years through advances in surgical technique, implant design, perioperative pain&#xD;
      management strategies, and physical therapy protocols. Tourniquet use during TKA, however,&#xD;
      remains controversial due to conflicting reports in the literature on these benefits and&#xD;
      risks of its use. Reported advantages of tourniquet use include improved visualization of the&#xD;
      surgical field and decreased intraoperative blood loss. Reported disadvantages of tourniquet&#xD;
      use include increased postoperative pain and slower functional recovery as a direct result of&#xD;
      the pressure of the tourniquet on the thigh during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally with tourniquet use during TKA, the limb is exsanguinated and the tourniquet is&#xD;
      raised to a fixed, pressure at the beginning of the case, typically 250mmHg to 350mmHg, and&#xD;
      let down after closure. A novel tourniquet design that adjusts the tourniquet pressure in&#xD;
      real-time based on intraoperative patient blood pressure measurements. This design may allow&#xD;
      for the tourniquet to be inflated at a lower mean pressure while still maintaining efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study comparing total blood loss, pain and functional recovery after TKA using&#xD;
      this novel tourniquet design, design (Zimmer A.T.S.Â® 4000TS Automatic Tourniquet System, with&#xD;
      disposable contour cuffs) and TKA without tourniquet would further the current literature.&#xD;
      Total blood loss will be calculated by previously validated methods. Pain and functional&#xD;
      recovery will be closely monitored throughout the postoperative period using a patient&#xD;
      wearable activity tracker (FitBit Inspire HR) and a smartphone-based patient engagement&#xD;
      platform with integrated digital surveys paired with smart-brace based home PT assessments&#xD;
      (FocusMotion).Pain and functional recovery will be closely monitored throughout the&#xD;
      postoperative period using a patient wearable activity tracker (FitBit Inspire HR) and a&#xD;
      smartphone-based patient engagement platform with integrated digital surveys paired with&#xD;
      smart-brace based home PT assessments (FocusMotion). Applying this technology to the proposed&#xD;
      study can help identify problematic pain that is not appreciable during admission; given the&#xD;
      fact that markers of inflammation and myocyte damage increase over time until at least&#xD;
      post-operative day 3, it is possible that TKAs performed under tourniquet may have pain and&#xD;
      narcotic requirements not appreciated with short-stay admissions . The proposed study will&#xD;
      further the literature on pain and narcotic use in the early time period after TKA, and will&#xD;
      help identify if tourniquet has an effect on these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, sleep quality is a component of functional recovery and is correlated with pain.&#xD;
      Knee osteoarthritis affects general quality of life by increasing sleep disturbance and&#xD;
      nighttime wakening, and this is correlated with the pre-operative radiographic severity of&#xD;
      disease. Sleep quality is affected in the immediate post-operative period after TKA as well,&#xD;
      but improves by 3-6 months post-operatively . The proposed study would be the largest&#xD;
      prospective study investigating the effect of TKA on pain and sleep quality, as well as being&#xD;
      the first to investigate tourniquet use as a factor affecting sleep quality and pain. The&#xD;
      proposed study would be the first to collect both subjective and objective data on the&#xD;
      subject, using validated survey measurements as well as the data collected by the Fitbit&#xD;
      Inspire HR device.&#xD;
