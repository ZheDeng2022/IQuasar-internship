  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coverage Africa is a nested study in the large Anticov platform trial that aims to generate&#xD;
      data on new early treatment strategies for mild/moderate COVID-19 patients in&#xD;
      resource-limited-settings to reduce the number progressing to severe forms requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization, thereby relieving the burden on health care systems and contributing to&#xD;
      &quot;flattening the curve&quot; in contexts where none pharmaceutical intervention such as quarantine&#xD;
      are difficult to implement in large urban settings. Treating early when the virus is still&#xD;
      present might also limit transmission. Coverage Africa will be conducted in Guinea and&#xD;
      Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to conduct an open-label, multicenter, randomized, adaptive platform&#xD;
      trial to test the safety and efficacy of several marketed products, including antiviral&#xD;
      therapies versus control in mild/moderate of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in&#xD;
      resource-limited-settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 600 patients in both countries, one site in Guinea and two sites in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two assessed treatments are now the association of Ciclésonide / Nitazoxanide and the&#xD;
      Telmisartan, compared with a control arm: paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive design trial will allow for the removal of drugs, or the addition of new study&#xD;
      arms when new data becomes available. Data on the primary efficacy parameters and safety will&#xD;
      be integrated with the primary endpoint based on an oxygen saturation percentage (SpO2) ≤ 93%&#xD;
      or death within 14 days after randomization to treatment, including death for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will run until December 2021. However, with the proposed adaptive design, the study&#xD;
      could also be interrupted for success earlier than planned with the identification of a&#xD;
      treatment that significantly reduces hospitalization rate as evidence by results from the&#xD;
      primary endpoint.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicentre, multiple country, randomised, open-label, adaptive, platform clinical study aiming to determine the efficacy and safety of various treatment regimens for prevention of the need for hospitalisation for specialised care due to severe progression of COVID-19.&#xD;
The study is designed with the ability to incorporate the adding or dropping of treatment arms and that will include similar inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, the same primary and secondary endpoints, common data entry procedures, a shared database and a single statistical methodology for analysis of the primary endpoint.</intervention_model_description>
