  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the utilization of Ischemic Pre-Conditioning&#xD;
      24-hours prior to hip arthroscopy decreases patient's post-operative pain and opioid&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to take part in one of two treatment procedures 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      their scheduled hip arthroscopy date. Subjects will be randomized into either the IPC or CON&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treatments consist of either 3 rounds of 5 minutes of occlusion alternating with 5&#xD;
      minutes of reperfusion or 3 rounds of 5 minutes of minimal occlusion alternating with 5&#xD;
      minutes of reperfusion. The treatment will last 30 minutes. Days 0-7 post-op will consist of&#xD;
      self-reported pain scales and opioid consumption documentation in the morning and evening.&#xD;
      This is a randomized single-blind research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IPC group will get a standardized pre-conditioning treatment 24 hours prior to their&#xD;
           hip arthroscopy. This consists of 3 rounds of 5 minutes of occlusion alternating with 5&#xD;
           minutes of reperfusion while seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CON group will get a controlled treatment of 20% of limb occlusion pressure 24 hours&#xD;
           prior to their hip arthroscopy. This consists of 3 rounds of 5 minutes of minimal&#xD;
           occlusion alternating with 5 minutes of reperfusion while seated.&#xD;
