      Comparison of the Effects of Low Flow and High Flow Anesthesia on Thiol-Disulfide Homeostasis&#xD;
      and Ischemia Modified Albumin in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our aim is to compare the effects of Low Flow and High Flow Anesthesia on&#xD;
      Thiol-Disulfide Homeostasis and Ischemia Modified Albumin in laparoscopic Cholecystectomy&#xD;
      Surgery using Sevoflurane as an anesthetic gas routinely.&#xD;

      General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness, analgesia in the&#xD;
      whole body, amnesia, and some muscle relaxation. Induction, which is the initial phase of&#xD;
      anesthesia, can be performed with intravenous or inhalation anesthetics. The most common&#xD;
      practice today for maintenance of anesthesia after induction is to add an effective low&#xD;
      intensity inhalation anesthetic to the oxygen, nitrous oxide or oxygen,air mixture. Although&#xD;
      new inhalation agents provide some advantages over old ones, they are more costly. This&#xD;
      situation has brought the development of new anesthetic techniques to the agenda. Interest in&#xD;
      low fresh gas flow anesthesia methods has been increasing in recent years. The high standard&#xD;
      of anesthesia machines, the availability of monitors that continuously analyze the anesthetic&#xD;
      gas composition, and the increase in knowledge on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of inhalation anesthetics have greatly facilitated the safe application of low-flow&#xD;
      anesthesia. The term low flow anesthesia is used to describe inhalation anesthesia techniques&#xD;
      with a semi closed rebreathing system with a reventilation rate of at least 50%, and with the&#xD;
      help of a reversible anesthesia system, after the carbon dioxide is removed from the expired&#xD;
      gas mixture from the patient, the metabolic requirements of the body are determined. At least&#xD;
      50% of the fresh oxygen flow is given back to the patient together with the volatile&#xD;
      anesthetics in sufficient quantity. Many different anesthesia applications with different&#xD;
      fresh gas flow rates have been described. Very high flow &gt; 4 L / min, High flow 2-4 L / min,&#xD;
      Medium flow 1-2 L / min, Low flow 500-1000 mL / min, Minimal flow 250-500 mL / min, Metabolic&#xD;
      flow &lt;250 mL / min. Currents of 1 L / min and below enter the low flow anesthesia head. The&#xD;
      low flow anesthesia we use routinely has many advantages for the patient. Increasing the&#xD;
      respiration rate of the humidified and warmed exhaled gas is of great importance for the&#xD;
      function of the ciliated epithelium and for mucociliary cleaning, it provides a significant&#xD;
      reduction in postoperative sore throat. It has an economic advantage due to the reduction in&#xD;
      anesthetic gas consumption. It reduces exposure to anesthetic gases in the operating room&#xD;
      environmen ; hypoxia, incompatibility of anesthesia depth, hypercarbia, possibility of heat&#xD;
      accumulation and increased risk of bacterial contamination. Safety Features in Anesthesia&#xD;
      Machines; According to the European common standard EN 740 conditions; They have features for&#xD;
      monitoring inspired oxygen concentration, Monitoring of inhaled CO2 concentration, Monitoring&#xD;
      of Volatile anesthetic concentration, Oxygen support insufficiency alarm, Oxygen bypass,&#xD;
      Oxygen rate monitor. Although the risk is very low in low flow, oxygen in inspired fresh gas&#xD;
      to avoid hypoxia Its concentration should be at least 50%. Depth of anesthesia can be&#xD;
      adjusted according to the sevoflurane gas concentration in the monitor. Inspired and expired&#xD;
      CO2 monitoring is important for patient safety. In order to prevent hypercarbia, appropriate&#xD;
      carbon dioxide absorbent should be used and frequent replacement should be provided.&#xD;
      Bacterial filters should also be used in the breathing circuit to prevent heat build-up and&#xD;
      bacterial contamination. In high-flow anesthesia, drying of the respiratory tract and a&#xD;
      decrease in mucociliary activity occurs. The use of a breathing circuit with a moisture&#xD;
      retaining chamber and a moisture retaining filter can prevent this situation. Increasing&#xD;
      anesthetic gas consumption increases the cost of the anesthetic gas in the surgical&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of volatile anesthetics such as desflurane or sevoflurane during general anesthesia&#xD;
      causes an increase in lipid peroxidation or proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, leading&#xD;
      to generalized inflammatory reactions. It is stated that all these can cause oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and under general anesthesia, patients are exposed to oxidative stress caused by&#xD;
      volatile anesthetics. However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which has become a common&#xD;
      procedure due to its advantages, increases the intraabdominal pressure, liver, splanchnic&#xD;
      vessels, mesenteric hypoxia, ischemia. It causes reperfusion damage and consequently an&#xD;
      increase in oxidative stress. Sevoflurane is a widely used anesthetic agent, its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been demonstrated in various studies, it&#xD;
      has been shown that it protects against ischemia-reperfusion damage in vital organs such as&#xD;
      heart, lung and kidney, and has more protective effects on thiol disulfide homeostasis than&#xD;
      desflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiols are compounds containing sulfur group, which are essential antioxidant buffers that&#xD;
      interact with almost all physiological oxidants. Thiol groups are oxidized by the surrounding&#xD;
      oxidant molecules and converted to disulfide structures and then thiol groups, thiol&#xD;
      disulfide balance was a sustainable reaction. Thiols act as fast electron acceptors and play&#xD;
      an important role in defending against reactive oxygen species by contributing a large part&#xD;
      of the total antioxidants present in the body. Plasma thiols have pro-oxidant or antioxidant&#xD;
      effects on physiological events; but they are generally regarded as antioxidants. It also&#xD;
      plays a critical role in programmed cell death, detoxification, antioxidant protection and&#xD;
      regulation of cellular enzymatic activity. Measuring thiols in serum may show an indirect&#xD;
      reflection of antioxidant defense. Another oxidation parameter that can be used as a&#xD;
      perioperative ischemia marker is ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). Hypoxia, acidosis, and&#xD;
      superoxide radical damage cause IMA formation by altering the structure of the N terminal,&#xD;
      reducing the binding capacity of albumin to metals. IMA is an early-rising indicator of&#xD;
      ischemia, it increases in as little as 6 minutes. Anesthesia method, surgical method,&#xD;
      medications used, infection and operation time affect postoperative morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      by changing the stress response.&#xD;
