  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sequelae that occur in post-COVID-19 patients are multiple and, at a therapeutic level,&#xD;
      these represent a new challenge within the general context of the pandemic that the world is&#xD;
      suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virus has managed to end thousands of lives today and many other cases are being charged&#xD;
      as directly responsible for a multiplicity of multi-system damages that need to be diagnosed&#xD;
      and treated. Among the most relevant, are those that can affect to neurological, respiratory&#xD;
      and musculoskeletal levels in patients without previous pahologies, and in patients at risk&#xD;
      who already had a pathology prior to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, signs and symptoms have been observed characteristic in the organ systems&#xD;
      described above in post-contagion patients, directly associated with sequelae SARV-CoV2. The&#xD;
      radio frequency (RF) of electromagnetic waves represents a technology of proven efficacy and&#xD;
      safety in multiple fields of both human and veterinary medicine. These include neurological&#xD;
      and pneumological pathologies, and very especially those that affect the locomotor system. In&#xD;
      therapeutics there are different RF modalities depending on the modality, polarity, type of&#xD;
      signal and frequency, which in turn translate into different therapeutic profiles, clinical&#xD;
      indications, efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the RF technologies most used today and that have a greater scientific background, is&#xD;
      the one known as Resistive Capacitive Monopolar Radio Frequency at 448 kHz (INDIBA®) (RFMCR).&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of RFMCR in the treatment of neurological,&#xD;
      respiratory and musculoskeletal sequelae in patients presenting this type of pathologies that&#xD;
      appear after contagion by COVID-19. Through this non-invasive technique, the investigators&#xD;
      want to show that RF can help the physical rehabilitation of these patients through metabolic&#xD;
      stimulation, increased vascularization and oxygenation of directly affected tissues, effects&#xD;
      of deep hyperthermia generated by the interaction of the current with the treated biological&#xD;
      substrate, as well as the activation of tissue regeneration, the result of subthermal action.&#xD;
      It is thus intended to improve signs such as lung capacity, dyspnea, neuropathies and global&#xD;
      muscle capacity, which are essential for the recovery of the post-COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that current post-COVID-19 treatments can be significantly&#xD;
      improved in order to prevent complications and ensure the patients' well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new post-pandemic era has left sequelae in patients who presented the signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently faced a positive for COVID-19. Such sequelae will be evident&#xD;
      at various systemic levels of the affected patienta in the short, medium and long term&#xD;
      future. One of these levels is neurological, respiratory and musculoskeletal complications&#xD;
      and injuries that have been documented throughout all scientific research since the beginning&#xD;
      of massive infections worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by penetrating the respiratory route (mostly), by fluid contact,&#xD;
      and to a lesser extent, through the ocular pathway. In the field of neurology, pulmonology&#xD;
      and the musculoskeletal system, different forms of RF, nerve infiltrations, lymph node&#xD;
      injuries, plantar fasciitis, spinal (peripheral) nerve disorders, etc. have been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators focus on one of the most prevalent symptoms (those that affect the&#xD;
      respiratory system), the bibliography that endorses that the RFMCR could improve has been&#xD;
      referenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1992, Martínez Rubio and Bordas described how, from the first treatment session, 60% of&#xD;
      asthmatic patients treated (n = 52) improved significantly, both in terms of bronchospasm and&#xD;
      dyspnea. In general, 5 to 10 sessions were necessary to improve symptoms in more than 75% of&#xD;
      patients. In 2020, Bito et al. published how the use of this technology significantly&#xD;
      increases chest wall motility in older women (74.6 ± 5.4 years on average; n = 28). These&#xD;
      symptomatic effects can be correlated with the findings of Tashiro et al., which proved that&#xD;
      15 minutes of treatment at the epigastric level significantly increased (p &lt;0.016) the levels&#xD;
      of total hemoglobin (Hb) and oxy-Hb, and how this significant increase, was maintained at&#xD;
      least up to 30 minutes after the end of the treatment (at which time measurement was&#xD;
      interrupted). These findings reinforce those described by Bito et al. and those of Yokata et&#xD;
      al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No less important are the proven effects of hyperthermia in strengthening the immune system&#xD;
      both in healthy patients (prevention) and in patients with infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefits of RFMCR in patients with&#xD;
      neurological, respiratory and/or musculoskeletal problems which started after SARV-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. The work proposed here aims to demonstrate the advantages of establishing RF as an&#xD;
      excellent treatment for post-COVID-19 sequelae, due to its ability to reinforce immune&#xD;
      action, modulate the inflammatory response and activate cellular and tissue regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this research work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the efficacy of RFMCR as a therapy in neurological, respiratory and&#xD;
           musculoskeletal pathologies derived from the sequelae of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evidence and document the effects generated by the treatment with RFMCR in such&#xD;
           systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the level of benefit from RF in each of the different systems treated and&#xD;
           define the benefit/risk ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To present and validate the therapy for the injuries under study that show significant&#xD;
           improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This clinical study will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the principles&#xD;
           established in the current revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza,&#xD;
           2013) and in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The researcher is aware, when signing the protocol, of the obligation to adhere to the&#xD;
           instructions and procedures described in it, and will ensure that the established&#xD;
           provisions are strictly adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study will not begin until the approval of the Research Ethics Committee has been&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the informed&#xD;
           consent document, and any other information that is presented or facilitated to the&#xD;
           possible subjects is reviewed and approved by the CEI. The Researcher agrees to allow&#xD;
           direct access to the REC to all relevant documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           INFORMED CONSENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In this case, patients must give their consent prior to being included in the study. The&#xD;
           content and the procedure for obtaining it must be in accordance with all applicable&#xD;
           legal requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The investigator is responsible for obtaining the written informed consent of each&#xD;
           patient participating in this study, after having explained in an understandable way,&#xD;
           the nature, objectives, methods, expected benefits and possible risks of the study. The&#xD;
           investigator must also explain to them that patients are completely free to refuse to&#xD;
           participate in the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for whatever reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The study patients will give their consent, signing the corresponding model. For this&#xD;
           purpose, each informed consent must be signed by both the investigator and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONFIDENTIALITY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All information related to the study is considered confidential in compliance with the&#xD;
           confidentiality and custody of the data collected, in accordance with the 3/2018 Law on&#xD;
           the protection of personal data (LOPDGDD), (article 5). Article 5.1 .f) of the RGPD&#xD;
           states that personal data will be treated in such a way as to guarantee confidentiality&#xD;
           and integrity&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the study data, only the main researcher&#xD;
           and her team of collaborators will have access to it, the CEI and the pertinent health&#xD;
           authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCING&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The financing is assumed by the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic. There&#xD;
           is no direct economic consideration for this, although there is a dedication of time and&#xD;
           work by the team of physiotherapists (social security, payroll, personal income tax,&#xD;
           etc.) that is not economically remunerated and is assumed or absorbed this way. In&#xD;
           addition, the RFMCR technology (equipment and accessories) will be provided by the&#xD;
           company INDIBA S.A., through a temporary assignment without any financial compensation&#xD;
           either from the Gema León Physiotherapy Clinic, or from any patient. The treatment of&#xD;
           these is completely free for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient must travel to the clinic facilities and it is the researcher who will be&#xD;
           responsible for the treatment in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No difficulties are foreseen in its performance since it will be carried out using a&#xD;
           schedule adapted to the patient that allows the study to be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to carry out a longitudinal study with the participation of 32 patients who&#xD;
      confirmed a positive test for COVID-19. The sample size for our study is large enough to&#xD;
      detect a clinically important difference in the primary outcome (s). For this, the&#xD;
      investigators reviewed references at the bibliographic level, in which paired studies&#xD;
      obtained a statistically significant value, being able to support our study. If the sample&#xD;
      size was insufficient but statistically significant, the investigators would resort to&#xD;
      expanding the sample. The division of the sample is carried out at random within the&#xD;
      established groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided INTO TWO GROUPS: group A, or placebo, evaluated and administered&#xD;
      false treatment with the machine turned off; and group B or group of treatment with RF. This&#xD;
      group will be divided into 3 subgroups. Thus, there will be 4 divisions of 8 participants&#xD;
      each: Group 1 &quot;Placebo&quot; with neurological, respiratory and/or musculoskeletal pathologies&#xD;
      acquired after COVID-19, as sequelae of this and confirmed positives in a test carried out&#xD;
      without performing treatment with RF; Group 2.1 or B1 &quot;Neurological Pathologies after&#xD;
      COVID-19&quot; and positive in COVID-19 with RF treatment; Group 2.2 or B2 &quot;Respiratory&#xD;
      Pathologies after COVID-19&quot; and positive in COVID-19 with RF treatment and Group 2.3 or B3&#xD;
      &quot;Musculoskeletal Pathologies after COVID-19&quot; and positive in COVID-19 with RF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will be evaluated at the beginning, a second evaluation after 3 weeks and a third&#xD;
      final control after 12 sessions. A fourth evaluation will be carried out after the last and&#xD;
      final evaluation, 6 weeks after finishing the treatment. Each of the participants will be&#xD;
      informed of the study, the objective, its possible benefits and the side effects that could&#xD;
      arise. A) Therefore, each patient must give their free and confirmed consent through&#xD;
      signature. Among the items in the methodology, the following stand out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary data parameters: A series of questions will be asked to each of the patients about&#xD;
      the conditions diagnosed during the disease and those suffered after the infection that are&#xD;
      directly related to abnormalities to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Data Parameters: The therapeutic protocol will be executed in the facilities of the&#xD;
      Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic (Cordoba, Spain). Such RF therapeutic&#xD;
      protocol will be implemented by application with an INDIBA® Activ device, whose function is&#xD;
      to reduce inflammation, stimulate immunity and promote tissue regeneration. This will consist&#xD;
      of a 30-minute treatment, composed by 5 minutes of treatment with the capacitive electrode&#xD;
      and 25 minutes of the resistive electrode. A total of 12 sessions will be scheduled (two per&#xD;
      week), and all processes will be documented from the beginning of therapy (the resources used&#xD;
      will be provided by INDIBA and the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic, whose&#xD;
      supervision will be carried out by the direction of both).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables: variables of nominal type such as sex, age, vaccination, number of days&#xD;
      with symptoms, type of symptom will be created. The patients will be grouped into 4 groups of&#xD;
      8 participants each (32 in total): Group 1 or A &quot;Control&quot; without pathologies neurological,&#xD;
      respiratory and/or musculoskeletal previous and positive confirmed in test carried out&#xD;
      without protocol of RF wave treatment. or Placebo. Group 2.1 or B1 &quot;Neurological Pathologies&#xD;
      after COVID-19&quot;. Group 2.2 or B2 &quot;Respiratory Pathologies after COVID-19&quot;. Group 2.3 or B3&#xD;
      &quot;Musculoskeletal Pathologies after COVID-19&quot; (these last three subgroups being group B of&#xD;
      treatment with RFMCR, INDIBA® Activ&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variables: In order to compare the variables between groups, different methods of&#xD;
      pain threshold and function of the mentioned systems will be used, such as: Global&#xD;
      Functionality Scale (GAF), Katz Index for Independence, Lawton and Brody Scale of Basic&#xD;
      Activities, Barthel index for disability, European Quality of Life 5-D Questionnaire (EURO-&#xD;
      QoL 5-D) for quality of life, Tinetti test for gait and balance, joint amplitude scale&#xD;
      measured with the goniometer (goniometry), strength muscle dynamometer (Dynamometry), pain&#xD;
      index (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Ashworth Scale modified for spasticity, reflectivity&#xD;
      measurement with the Wartenberg Scale for bone tendon reflexes (ROTs), examination of&#xD;
      sensitivity from evaluation of dermatomes, measurement of lung function with spirometry,&#xD;
      tests for respiratory muscle function (measurement of inspiratory and expiratory pressures&#xD;
      maximum; Pimax and Pemax, respectively), and Sadoul scale for dyspnea and measurement of&#xD;
      costal excursion. The statistical analysis is based on variables of nominal type mostly,&#xD;
      which are suitable for the Chi square test with a significance value of 95% for the results&#xD;
      (p &lt;0.05). However, if there are numerical data that must be compared between groups, the&#xD;
      analysis will be used for ANOVA test with the same significance value for the comparison&#xD;
      between results.&#xD;
