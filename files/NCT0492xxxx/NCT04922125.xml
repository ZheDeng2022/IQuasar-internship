  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diets containing (whole) pulses have been associated with the potential to increase satiety&#xD;
      (and acute food intake). In vitro digestion studies of pulses have shown that (thermal)&#xD;
      processing has the potential to modulate macronutrient digestion kinetics. Changes in food&#xD;
      (micro)strucutral properties have been identified to retard nutrient release, with a possible&#xD;
      effect on appetite sensations. Based on distinct in vitro digestion behaviour, two&#xD;
      differently processed pulse meals were chosen to be investigated in humans with the aim to&#xD;
      confirm in vitro findings and gain a mechanistic understanding of the influence of structural&#xD;
      aspects of pulses on appetite sensations.&#xD;
