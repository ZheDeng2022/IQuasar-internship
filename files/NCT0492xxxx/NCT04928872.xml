  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) measure plasma glucose concentration continually and thus&#xD;
      they are a key tool in the management of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key&#xD;
      factor in diabetes management is a reduction of dietary carbohydrates (CHO) and/or exchanging&#xD;
      high glycemic index (GI) CHO with low GI CHO. However, the protein and fat content of the&#xD;
      meal can have a significant impact on the glucose readings obtained from a CGM as there is no&#xD;
      enough data available on their sensitivity during meals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 1 screening visit of approximately 1 hour and 9 study days of&#xD;
      approximately 8 hours. Subjects will be asked to arrive in the fasted state on all study&#xD;
      days. Fasting prior to screening is not required. On the screening day, body weight, height,&#xD;
      and body composition by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be measured. In addition,&#xD;
      habitual dietary intake, physical activity level (PASE), and quality of life (SGRQ-C) will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the relation between plasma amino acid, triglycerides, and glucose concentration&#xD;
      measured by standard methods (such as finger stick) and continuous wearable devices, a&#xD;
      premarket FDA-approved continuous glucose monitor (CGM) from Abbott (FreeStyle Libre Pro)&#xD;
      that monitors glucose concentrations every 15 min is used. The single-use sensors are placed&#xD;
      on the upper arm and contain a very tiny 5 mm filament (&lt;0.4 mm diameter) that is introduced&#xD;
      into the skin when the sensor is placed. On the first study day, the CGM will be placed to&#xD;
      monitor glucose concentrations until the last study day. At least every 14 days, sensors will&#xD;
      be replaced by new ones. On each study day, body weight and height will be measured and the&#xD;
      glucose concentration data will be downloaded from the sensor onto the reader device. A&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted in a peripheral vein of the lower arm or hand to enable blood&#xD;
      sampling. The arm will be put in a hot box to allow collecting arterialized venous blood&#xD;
      samples. After taking a baseline blood sample, the predefined meal will be consumed within 10&#xD;
      min. Small arterialized venous blood samples (5 ml) will subsequently be drawn at times: 15,&#xD;
      30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 minutes (13 blood samples, total blood&#xD;
      approx 65 ml). Samples will be collected in predefined tubes, plasma/serum separated,&#xD;
      aliquoted, and stored at -80 deg. Celsius for later assays and/or send to a local accredited&#xD;
      laboratory for the concentrations of amino acids and other parameters (including fatty acids,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin).&#xD;

    <measure>Prediction models of postprandial plasma amino acid patterns in relation to the macronutrient content of predefined meals as assessed by plasma concentrations of amino acids, glucose, and/or triglycerides</measure>
    <time_frame>9 study visits: one meal per one study day, 2-3 meals per week, 8-hour blood blood sample collection after a meal intake. Study completion: 4-5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants consume 9 predefined meals in the fasted state with macronutrient composition reflecting common meals in the US diet. One meal is consumed during one study visit with a total of 9 visits. A baseline sample is collected followed by an intake of one meal during one study visit. Blood samples (in the 15-and 30-minutes interval) are collected for 8 hours after a meal intake. Collected plasma will be used for amino acid analysis. Statistical models will be used to predict plasma amino acids from patterns of amino acids, glucose, and/or triglycerides in the consumed meals.</description>

A baseline sample is collected followed by an intake of one meal during one study visit. Blood samples (in the 15-and 30-minutes interval) for glucose measurements are taken and plasma samples are collected. Plasma glucose is measured by a glucose monitor and outsourced to the certified laboratory. Information from continuous glucose monitor is collected at the end of each study day.</description>
