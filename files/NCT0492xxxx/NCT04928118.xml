  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) are exposed to the risk of&#xD;
      suffering from a damage to the kidneys which goes under the name of Contrast-Associated Acute&#xD;
      Kidney Injury (CA-AKI), which is more common if the subject has advanced heart or kidney&#xD;
      disease. Up to 1 high risk patient in 3 can suffer from CA-AKI. Impella is a pump which&#xD;
      sustain the heart in the course of PCI in high risk individuals. Incidentally, Impella was&#xD;
      shown to also reduce the incidence of CA-AKI. The reason why Impella protects the kidneys is&#xD;
      not currently known. The investigators aim at understanding it through measurements of kidney&#xD;
      blood flow and metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is among the major determinants of morbidity&#xD;
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients undergoing complex, high-risk&#xD;
      indicated procedures (CHIP) are exposed to an increased risk of CA-AKI. Recent observational&#xD;
      data suggested that mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with Impella in the course of CHIP&#xD;
      PCI, i.e. Impella-protected PCI, may abate the risk of CA-AKI. A direct effect of MCS in&#xD;
      improving renal perfusion has been postulated, but mechanistic evidence on the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic effects of Impella on kidney hemodynamics is lacking. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that such improved renal outcomes during Impella protected PCI are attributable&#xD;
      to increased blood flow as well as increased oxygen delivery to the kidneys granted by MCS.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to fully characterize the renal hemodynamics as well as renal&#xD;
      oxygen delivery and consumption during Impella-protected PCI using state-of-the-art invasive&#xD;
      measurements, and to correlate those with functional magnetic resonance imaging of the&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
