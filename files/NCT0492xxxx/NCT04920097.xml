    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized control trial will evaluate auricular point acupressure (APA) on&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN), rigorously considering point specificity and placebo&#xD;
      effects by integrating self-report measures, psychophysical measures (QST), endogenous&#xD;
      biomarkers (cytokines), and neuro-imaging to investigate APA's efficacy and underlying&#xD;
      mechanism(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a randomized control trial, three-group design: (1) APA Group, (2)&#xD;
      Sham APA Control, and (3) Usual Care Control. A smartphone application for ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) will be used to monitor APA adherence and capture momentary CIN&#xD;
      severity and analgesic use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN)-pain, numbness, or tingling distributed in the hands&#xD;
      and feet-produces persistent symptoms affecting sensation and balance in cancer survivors. Up&#xD;
      to 50% of cancer survivors still suffer CIN 6 years after treatment. Duloxetine, the only&#xD;
      recommended drug by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, was found to be superior to&#xD;
      placebo but improved CIN by only 0.73 points (0-10 scale). No effective treatment for CIN has&#xD;
      been established except exercise, with an effect size of &lt;0.508. Opioids relieve CIN pain,&#xD;
      but long-term use is strongly discouraged due to opioid overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test auricular point acupressure (APA), an innovative and&#xD;
      scalable solution developed from auricular acupuncture. APA is a non-invasive (needleless)&#xD;
      and active treatment for patients with pain, whereas acupuncture is an invasive (using&#xD;
      needles) and passive treatment (administered by a licensed practitioner). In APA, small seeds&#xD;
      are taped on specific ear points by a skilled provider and patients press on the seeds to&#xD;
      stimulate ear points three times daily, three minutes per time, for a total of nine minutes&#xD;
      per day. APA provides pain relief within 1-2 minutes after ear stimulation and sustains pain&#xD;
      relief for one month after a 4-week APA intervention. APA is popular in Taiwan, China, and&#xD;
      Europe. Though its use is sparse in the U.S., a limited number of clinical trials have&#xD;
      supported APA in pain management.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective randomized controlled study will randomly assign participants into three groups: (1) APA Group (Self-Learn APA), (2) In-Person Group (In person training), and (3) Usual Care Control. During intervention phase, participants in the APA and In-Person groups will receive four in-person seed placement with weekly cycles, while Usual Care Group will receive counseling related how to self-manage their CIN to control time and attention. Participants in Usual Care will be re-randomized to APA or In-Person groups after completion of the study assessment. This proposed trial will evaluate the APA sustained effects for CIN up to a 3-month follow-up. The data will be collected at pre-intervention (T1), post-completion of the 4-week APA treatment (T2), and follow-ups at monthly post-completion of treatment for 3 months (T3-T5), for a total of 5 assessments. The primary endpoint is at 1-month follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

The PI and Co-Is will be blinded regarding group assignment and will not contact or interact with the participants during the intervention and outcome assessments.

    <description>Physical function will be assessed using the subscale of physical function, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29. The subscale of physical function has a range of 5 (unable to function) to 20 (able to function without difficulty).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain sensitivity will be measured by QST. The QST battery consists of light touch sensation as assessed by the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMT), threshold and tolerance, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). The threshold responses will be conducted in randomized and counterbalanced order; CPM will always occur last. Temporal summation measures, CPM, and after-sensation responses to these measures will be combined to create the central sensitization index for use in statistical analyses.</description>
