      Study objective: This study is planning to explore factors predicting the use of&#xD;
      life-sustaining treatment, develop the screening criteria of proactive clinical ethics&#xD;
      consultations, the effect of proactive clinical ethics consultations and interprofessional&#xD;
      practice on end-of-life care of the critically ill in the intensive care settings, and&#xD;
      develop the competency for trainees by interprofessional education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data will be collected and analyzed for patients dying in the intensive care&#xD;
      settings during the first stage of the study. Factors predicting the use of life-sustaining&#xD;
      treatment will be determined. The Delphi technique will be applied to secure a consensus&#xD;
      among the panel of experts chosen to help develop the screening criteria of proactive ethics&#xD;
      consultations. A prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted during the second&#xD;
      stage of the study on a convenience sample of adult critical ill patients in the intensive&#xD;
      care settings. Patients will randomize to the intervention group receive proactive ethics&#xD;
      consultations. The control group will undergo routine intensive care, receiving clinical&#xD;
      ethics consultations as requested by healthcare team, patients or family. All participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire rating their satisfaction with the healthcare&#xD;
      process and consultations if conducted. Mean length of stay and the duration of the use of&#xD;
      life-sustaining treatment will be compared between two groups. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include the proportion of satisfied families and healthcare team members. The&#xD;
      interprofessional education with the core curriculum and case scenario for simulation will be&#xD;
      developed, implement, and evaluated.&#xD;
