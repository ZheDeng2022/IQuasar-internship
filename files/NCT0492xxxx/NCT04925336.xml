  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the intraoperative pain is a major challenge for the anesthesia team. During&#xD;
      anesthesia, changes in heart rate and blood pressure are interpreted qualitatively to&#xD;
      evaluate the sympathetic response to nociceptive stimulation or the adaptation of analgesia&#xD;
      during surgery. The new nociception monitors under development quantitatively explore other&#xD;
      variables dependent on sympathetic activity or sympathetic / parasympathetic balance, such as&#xD;
      the pulse wave amplitude measurement (Surgical Pleth Index (SPI index)), the pupil dilation&#xD;
      reflex, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (ANI, Analgesia Nociception Index), or skin conductance&#xD;
      index. Taken independently, these tools provide an assessment of nociception based on&#xD;
      variations in the autonomic system, more robust than simply observing heart rate or blood&#xD;
      pressure raw values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the relationship between variations in the neurovegetative system and pain can be&#xD;
      compromised by various factors or intraoperative events such as hypovolemia, bleeding,&#xD;
      certain sympathomimetic or sympatholytic treatments, the hypnosis depth, ventilation&#xD;
      variation, fast filling, or body temperature. Moreover, investigators do not know the delay&#xD;
      between the application of the painful stimulus and the observation of the variation of the&#xD;
      different neurovegetative variables. This constitutes a limit of the practitioners'&#xD;
      confidence in these monitoring tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nociception transmission pathways of to the vegetative centers and cortical areas are&#xD;
      complex. Investigators hypothesis is that neurovegetative variations in response to&#xD;
      nociceptive stimulation are not always associated with a cortical somatosensory response. In&#xD;
      this project investigators investigate the relation between cortical (EEG) and vegetative&#xD;
      reactions to acute and tonic nociceptive stimuli, as a preliminary step to apply these&#xD;
      procedures to assess intraoperative reactions to nociceptive procedures in anesthetized&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Simultaneous scheme of cortical activation and neuro-vegetative responses secondary to controlled nociceptive stimuli will be defined as the occurrence of at least one among the following:&#xD;
Changes of time-frequency distribution of the electroencephalographic activity during phasic or tonic pain stimulation, compared to a prior baseline period.&#xD;
Recording of cortical evoked responses during phasic pain stimulation in a time latency range between 100-500 msec.&#xD;
Changes in parasympathetic tone measured by Analgesia/Nociception Index (ANI) method (threshold of 50/100) during phasic or tonic stimulation&#xD;

    <description>Among the EEG and neurovegetative modifications, investigators will select the dominant association according to the different types of nociceptive stimulation. The dominant association will constitute the pattern of interest. This pattern will be selected if present in more than 80% of subjects. If investigators obtain several patterns of interest associating different cortical or neurovegetative parameters, the final selected pattern will be made up of the smallest number of parameters in order to envisage its transfer in anesthesiological routine</description>
