  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic chronic arthritis characterized by systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, persistent synovitis and final joint destruction Inflammatory diseases can lead&#xD;
      to decreased productivity and impaired health-related quality of life. As a chronic disease,&#xD;
      rheumatoid Chronic arthritis needs long-term treatment. At the same time, RA can cause skin,&#xD;
      eye, lung, liver, kidney, blood and cardiovascular diseases All of them were extraarticular&#xD;
      lesions. It causes a heavy burden to the patients themselves, their families and the society.&#xD;
      The main clinical manifestations of RA were morning stiffness Joint swelling and pain,&#xD;
      cartilage destruction and joint space narrowing, if not treated, will lead to joint&#xD;
      destruction, deformity and dysfunction The rate of disability is high. As a new drug in the&#xD;
      treatment of RA, tofacitinib can relieve RA symptoms and promote joint healing It can recover&#xD;
      the injury and correct the abnormal immune function. At present, studies have proved that the&#xD;
      traditional anti rheumatic drugs are ineffective in the treatment of RA. The addition of&#xD;
      tofacitinib to patients may be beneficial to the treatment.&#xD;

      Participant inclusion and selection criteria: A total of 170 patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis of patients must meet the ACR 1987&#xD;
      classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, female, aged 30-65 years old, all The&#xD;
      patients have been using traditional dMARDs combined with glucocorticoid for 1 month&#xD;
      (glucocorticoid dosage 10-15mg/day), and the DAS28 scores are all greater than 3.2,&#xD;
      considering that the disease is still active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Including other connective tissue diseases, neurological diseases,&#xD;
      combined depression, ongoing antidepressant treatment, severe cardiovascular disease, latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis, tumors, severe liver and kidney dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomly divided into two groups: tofacitinib treatment group and control group with 85 cases&#xD;
      each. The probability of patients being classified into different groups: both are 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: basic dMARDs of all subjects: methotrexate (10mg) combined with&#xD;
      [(sulfasalazine (2g/day), isilamod (50mg/day), leflunomide (20mg/day)] One or two of the two.&#xD;
      All subjects used glucocorticoids (10-15 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tofacitinib group: combined with tofacitinib 5mg/twice a day on the basis of the above&#xD;
      scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated once a month for the first three months, including the DAS28&#xD;
      score, serum C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver and kidney function&#xD;
      and other serological indicators. After three months, the disease will be evaluated once 1-2&#xD;
      months. The assessment content is the same as above. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research endpoints: 1. After treatment, the DAS28 score is less than 2.6, considering the&#xD;
      disease remission, gradually reduce the dose to stop the hormone. 2. Hormone use for more&#xD;
      than 6 months cannot be reduced or stopped or if the condition worsens, consider adding other&#xD;
      dMARDs or biological agents to control the condition. 3. The test needs to be terminated in&#xD;
      case of serious adverse reactions. All subjects recorded the time when hormones were stopped&#xD;
      and the total amount of hormones used.&#xD;
