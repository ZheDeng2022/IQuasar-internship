  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate W-SUDs as a digitally-delivered substance use disorder program&#xD;
      through a fully-powered randomized control trial that will test the comparative efficacy of&#xD;
      the mobile-app based substance use disorder program to reduce substance use relative to an&#xD;
      education-only control condition, which has no cognitive behavioral therapy and the content&#xD;
      is not delivered through a conversational user interface.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase II will evaluate the efficacy of W-SUDs in a large scale RCT relative to an&#xD;
      education-only control condition. Primary outcomes will be measures of the quantity and&#xD;
      frequency of substance use including, number of substance use occasions, heavy drinking days&#xD;
      (if applicable) and percent days abstinent. Additionally, Phase II will evaluate whether&#xD;
      W-SUDs results in a greater reduction in substance-related problems compared to an Education&#xD;
      Only control group and explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If engagement with W-SUDs, relative to education-only control,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improves symptoms of depression and anxiety;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improves work productivity (i.e. reduce presenteeism/absenteeism);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduces cravings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. improves situational confidence.&#xD;

Using conversational tones, it encourages mood tracking and delivers general psychoeducation as well as tailored empathy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based behavior change tools, and behavioral pattern insight. Woebot's app-based platform and user-centered design philosophy makes it an optimal modality for Substance Use Disorders (SUD) treatment delivery. It offers immediate, evidence-based tailored support in the patient's peak moment of craving.</description>

    <description>The education only control intervention is a form of psychoeducation for those seeking treatment for their alcohol and/or substance use concern. Psychoeducation is commonly provided for those with substance use. Psychoeducation in substance use is intended to increase the users' knowledge of their substances of use, and effects on the body, behaviors, and consequences. The recipient of psychoeducation is expected to increase their own awareness of their substance use and ideally incorporate this newfound knowledge when making changes to their substance use. The information provided in this group are from factsheets found on NIAAA, NIDA, and CDC web pages.</description>
