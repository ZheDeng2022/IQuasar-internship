    <textblock>
      There is no standard of care therapy for patients with granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease (GLILD) seen in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Abatacept has recently&#xD;
      looked promising for the treatment of patients with complex CVID. This study is a multi-site,&#xD;
      phase II, randomized, blinded/placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric and adult&#xD;
      subjects to determine the efficacy of abatacept compared to placebo for treatment of subjects&#xD;
      with GLILD in the context of CVID.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is no standard of care therapy for patients with granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease (GLILD) seen in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Abatacept is a&#xD;
      recombinant, human fusion protein of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and&#xD;
      human IgG1 that blocks T cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking CD28&#xD;
      engagement- the &quot;second signal&quot; needed for T cell activation. Abatacept has recently looked&#xD;
      promising for the treatment of patients with complex CVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-site, phase II, randomized, blinded/placebo-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      in adult and pediatric subjects ≥50 kg (cohort 1), with an additional cohort (#2) of&#xD;
      pediatric subjects &lt;50 kg tested as a single arm, receiving open-label abatacept. Cohort 1&#xD;
      utilizes a 'delayed-start' design to obtain maximum statistical power from this cohort.&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will be open label due to the lack of a suitable placebo for pediatric dose&#xD;
      abatacept syringes. A total of 45 evaluable subjects will be treated in cohort 1 and 15&#xD;
      evaluable subjects in cohort 2.&#xD;

    <description>Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator, inhibiting T lymphocyte activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Orencia solution supplied in a prefilled syringe should be refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F). Orencia should not be used beyond the expiration date on the prefilled syringe. The product should be protected from light by storing in the original package until time of use. The prefilled syringe should not be frozen.</description>
