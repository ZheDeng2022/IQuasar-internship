  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of a brief SIGH of 4 seconds at 35 cmH20 has shown to reliably predict fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in critically ill patients undergoing pressure support ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-expiratory occlusion test (EEOT) has been also used in the same type of patients,&#xD;
      with the same purpose, but in a limited amount of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the reliability of the the two test in assessing fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessing preload dependence in critically ill patients is a challenge for the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU) physicians. During controlled mechanical ventilation, dynamic indexes can be&#xD;
      applied in non-arrhythmic patients with sufficiently high tidal volume (VT), i.e., &gt;8 ml/kg&#xD;
      and non-severely impaired lung compliance. The interplay between mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      hemodynamic is more complex in patients with a spontaneous breathing activity, whose&#xD;
      respiratory efforts affect intrathoracic pressure and venous return to the right ventricle&#xD;
      (RV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these limitations, functional hemodynamic assessment, consisting in maneuvers&#xD;
      determining a sudden change in cardiac preload, such as Passive leg raising (PLR) or&#xD;
      end-expiratory occlusion test (EEO), represents a valuable means for assessment of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both PLR and EEO have been successfully utilized for assessing fluid responsiveness,&#xD;
      regardless of ventilatory assistance and mode of ventilation. Unfortunately, however, some&#xD;
      drawbacks limit the extensive use of these maneuvers in clinical practice. One the one hand,&#xD;
      PLR cannot be applied in some clinical situations, such as traumatisms of the hip, legs or&#xD;
      lumbar spine, deep venous thrombosis, intracranial or abdominal hypertension. Indeed, a&#xD;
      recent large observational study showed PLR to be the most common form of assessment of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness, being used, nonetheless, in only 10.7% of the patients necessitating the&#xD;
      assessment of fluid responsiveness. On the other hand, rates of EEO failure as high as 22.5 %&#xD;
      have been reported, consequent to visible patient's effort against the occluded airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recently successfully tested a new approach for assessing fluid responsiveness in&#xD;
      patients undergoing partial ventilatory assistance. It has been proposed that the changes&#xD;
      from baseline of systolic arterial pressure (SAP), pulse pressure (PP) and stroke volume&#xD;
      index (SVI) in relationship to the airway pressure (Paw) generated during a &quot;sigh&quot; maneuver&#xD;
      can predict fluid responsiveness in ICU patients undergoing pressure support ventilation&#xD;
      (PSV) In the first &quot;proof of concept&quot; study (performed in 40 hemodynamically unstable ICU&#xD;
      patients) three sighs has been tested, in a computer-generated random order, at either 15&#xD;
      (SIGH15), 25 (SIGH25) and 35 (SIGH35) cmH2O of total inspiratory Paw (PEEP + PSV). THe&#xD;
      results showed that only the variation of the pulse pressure recorded after SIGH35&#xD;
      application successfully predicted fluid responsiveness. [AUC of PP after SIGH35 = 0.91 (0.82&#xD;
      - 0.99); sensitivity 75% (47.6%-92.7%) and specificity 91.6 (73.0%- 98.9%); best threshold&#xD;
      value of the ROC curve was -35% from baseline].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic Measurements. All patients will have an internal jugular vein catheter and a&#xD;
      thermistor-tipped arterial catheter (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) in the femoral&#xD;
      artery that was connected to the PiCCO2plus monitoring device (for measuring the cardiac&#xD;
      index (through transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis).&#xD;
