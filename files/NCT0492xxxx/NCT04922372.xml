      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients requiring posterior single crowns, does the use of Milled BioHPP PEEK copings&#xD;
      veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin offer better surface texture and clinical performance&#xD;
      when compared Milled BioHPP PEEK copings veneered with manual layering?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of the problem Nowadays, metal free restorations are widely used. PEEK is one among&#xD;
      these restorations that has many applications in dental field. Owing to PEEK's excellent&#xD;
      mechanical properties, it is gaining popularity in prosthodontics. The opaque nature of PEEK&#xD;
      allows its use as a framework material in fixed prosthodontics and composite resin material&#xD;
      is used as a veneering material to achieve aesthetics .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compatible composite veneering material can be manufactured by both manual and CAD/CAM&#xD;
      techniques. Yet, there is no enough research regarding the influence of the veneering&#xD;
      technique on the surface texture and clinical performance of these restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale PEEK combination of mechanical properties and high biocompatibility make it a very&#xD;
      promising material . PEEK based crowns are veneered by composite resin material. Among the&#xD;
      methods of fabrication of veneering composite is the manual layering and CAD/CAM techniques .&#xD;
      The surface flaws and internal defects determine the strength of the material and affects its&#xD;
      performance . Accordingly the evaluation of the veneering technique is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for carrying out this study lies in providing an alternative solution to the&#xD;
      manual veneering technique, which will, in-turn, provide better surface properties and&#xD;
      clinical performance of the restoration and accordingly increase its longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The aim of this study is to evaluate the surface texture and clinical performance of milled&#xD;
      BioHPP PEEK veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin and compare them to milled BioHPP PEEK&#xD;
      veneered manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the surface texture and clinical performance between milled BioHPP&#xD;
      PEEK veneered with CAD/CAM composite resin and milled BioHPP PEEK veneered manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: (surface texture) of the two groups will be assessed using the modified&#xD;
           USPHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcome: (fracture) of the two groups will be assessed using the modified Ryge&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;

      Intervention: Examination and diagnosis: - Selection and examination of the patients&#xD;
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Diagnosis of the patients' chief complaint and&#xD;
      teeth that will be involved in this study will be done then performing proper scaling and&#xD;
      polishing procedure, Primary impression will be taken to produce study cast. The patients&#xD;
      will be asked to maintain good oral hygiene measures by using tooth brush twice daily. -&#xD;
      Taking a pre-operative professional photo, Tooth preparation procedure: Recording the sulcus&#xD;
      depth and gingival condition prior to preparation, Conservative tooth preparation will be&#xD;
      prepared after local anesthesia has been given as required., Full coverage preparation will&#xD;
      be carried out , After tooth preparation, adequate 2ry Impression using non aqueous&#xD;
      elastomeric impression materials and bite registration will be taken., Fabrication of the&#xD;
      temporary restoration using composite resin temporary material and cemented using non Eugenol&#xD;
      Zinc Oxide temporary cement, Fabrication and cementation of restoration: Bio-HPP will be&#xD;
      supplied in the form of discs to fabricate crown core by CAD/CAM technology then veneered&#xD;
      with two veneering techniques; the CAD/ CAM and the manual technique using the visio.lign&#xD;
      system of appropriate shade. The finished Bio HPP crown will be cemented by adhesive resin&#xD;
      cement according to manufacturer instruction, Criteria for discontinuing: Restoration will be&#xD;
      removed when there are any signs of leakage, fracture or severe post-operative pain due to&#xD;
      pulpal response and replaced by a temporary restoration cemented with Ca (OH) cement in order&#xD;
      to alleviate pain, Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol: - ''In the first&#xD;
      visit, a Face to Face adherence session will be held in which the patient should be informed&#xD;
      about the study steps and how to maintain oral hygiene measures. Further sessions will occur&#xD;
      at the follow-up visits.8 Participant patients will be asked about any problems they are&#xD;
      having. Patients will be recalled every three months for one year for follow up visits.&#xD;
      Permitted or prohibited interventions: Oral hygiene measures are permitted for enhanced&#xD;
      results while using hard tooth brushes or abrasive containing tooth paste after intervention&#xD;
      are prohibited&#xD;
