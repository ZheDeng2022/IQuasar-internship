  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a significant medical problem in the United States and across the world. Despite&#xD;
      significant progress in understanding how to better manage diabetes, there is oftentimes&#xD;
      still uncertainty in the optimal management strategy for a specific patient. As a result,&#xD;
      providers and patients must often use a trial-and-error approach to identify an effective&#xD;
      treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project team has previously developed a Diabetes Dashboard that summarizes relevant&#xD;
      patient information (e.g., medication history and recent hemoglobin A1c trend). This&#xD;
      dashboard allows a clinician to select a target hemoglobin A1c level for the patient in 3 or&#xD;
      6 months, then compare and contrast different options for treatment, including weight loss&#xD;
      and the use of different medication regimens. Included in this comparison are known benefits&#xD;
      and side effects, as well as the likely chances of achieving the treatment target given the&#xD;
      experience of past, similar patients. The Diabetes Dashboard is already available as an&#xD;
      optional tab in the EHR system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project team has also previously developed the Disease Manager App for evidence-based&#xD;
      chronic disease management and health maintenance. The Disease Manger Application is fully&#xD;
      integrated with the EHR, and it provides care guidance via individual chronic disease modules&#xD;
      as well as a unified module that encompasses all relevant modules for chronic diseases and&#xD;
      health maintenance. The initial modules that have been developed are for chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and health maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to evaluate the Diabetes Dashboard integrated with the&#xD;
      Disease Manager App. The Intervention consists of the diabetes module of the Disease Manager&#xD;
      App, which incorporates content from the Diabetes Dashboard for pharmacotherapy prediction&#xD;
      and provides a link to the Diabetes Dashboard.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic pre-post trial of the Diabetes Dashboard integrated with the&#xD;
      Disease Manager App. The Disease Manager App is available as a tab in the EHR and enables&#xD;
      clinicians to confirm relevant patient parameters. A link to the Diabetes Dashboard will be&#xD;
      available from the Disease Manager App diabetes module. In the Diabetes Dashboard, providers&#xD;
      can select treatment goals and review likely outcomes from alternative treatment strategies&#xD;
      through an interactive graphical user interface. In the review process, the Diabetes&#xD;
      Dashboard enables providers and patients to compare up to three potential therapies side-by&#xD;
      side including weight-loss in terms of a) personalized, predicted probability of achieving&#xD;
      treatment goals; b) general potential risks, benefits, and medication costs; and c) relevant&#xD;
      financial information specific to the patient's insurance. The personalized prediction is&#xD;
      performed by a predictive model developed by analyzing data sets of patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The Disease Manager App and the Diabetes Dashboard are seamlessly integrated with&#xD;
      the EHR using an interoperability standard known as SMART on FHIR (short for Substitutable&#xD;
      Medical Apps Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being conducted at University of Utah primary care clinics. In all primary care&#xD;
      clinics, providers will be provided with access to the Diabetes Dashboard integrated with the&#xD;
      Disease Manager App. Iterative enhancements will be made to the tool if warranted based on&#xD;
      the results of a formative evaluation during the 1-year pragmatic implementation study. Use&#xD;
      of the tool and associated suggestions will be optional and up to the discretion of the&#xD;
      clinician. Use of the tool will be regularly monitored, and a mixed-methods evaluation will&#xD;
      be conducted of the tool and its impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, which are an important&#xD;
      physiological marker of diabetes control. Secondary measures will include body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) and the cost of diabetes medications prescribed. Other measures will include usage of&#xD;
      the tool and clinical users' opinions of the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study analyses will be limited to adult patients who were seen at least twice in&#xD;
      the primary care clinics during the evaluation period for office visits with a visit&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, who are known to have diabetes mellitus (but not type-1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus), who had at least one HbA1c of &gt;= 7.5% during the evaluation period, and&#xD;
      who are not already on maximal diabetes therapy (as defined by the use of short-acting&#xD;
      insulin) at the start of the study. Secondary study analyses will be conducted on patient&#xD;
      subsets, including a per protocol analysis of cases where the tool was used.&#xD;
