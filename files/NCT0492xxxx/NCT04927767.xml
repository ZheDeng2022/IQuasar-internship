  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of continuous change of the supporting oral tissues, removable dentures can gradually&#xD;
      lose retention and stability, resulting in reduced masticatory efficiency. Denture adhesive&#xD;
      is a commercially available material used to adhere a denture to the oral mucosa. Our&#xD;
      previous review indicated that denture adhesive can improve denture retention, bite force and&#xD;
      masticatory performance of complete denture wearers. However, related studies in partial&#xD;
      dentures are rare. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of denture adhesives&#xD;
      on the masticatory performance and oral health related quality of life of removable partial&#xD;
      denture and complete denture wearers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified and recruited from the patient pool of the Prince Philip&#xD;
      Dental Hospital (PPDH). Target patients are those who have problems with their existing&#xD;
      dentures (for example, dissatisfied denture retention and stability, or reduced chewing&#xD;
      efficiency), but do not plan to have new dentures. After sample size calculation, 47&#xD;
      participants are expected to be recruited for this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, each participant will be interviewed by a trained interviewer and undergo a&#xD;
      clinical examination. Information about the oral condition, denture condition, masticatory&#xD;
      performance, oral health related quality of life, socio-demographic and other data will be&#xD;
      recorded. Saliva samples will be collected for analysis of oral microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercial copolymer-based cream adhesive (Polident, GlaxoSmithKline, Sussex, UK) is&#xD;
      selected as the denture adhesive. Participants will be shown to apply the adhesive following&#xD;
      the manufacturer's instructions. The denture is pressed firmly into place, then held firmly&#xD;
      as the participant bites down to secure it. Participants will be instructed to apply the&#xD;
      adhesive twice daily with an 8-hour interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements will be taken before application of denture adhesives, 1 week, 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 12 weeks after usage of denture adhesives.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, each participant will be interviewed by a trained interviewer and undergo a&#xD;
      clinical examination. Information about the oral condition, denture condition, masticatory&#xD;
      performance, oral health related quality of life, socio-demographic and other data will be&#xD;
      recorded. Saliva samples will be collected for analysis of oral microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the data collection methods are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Oral condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral mucosa moisture:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A non-invasive oral moisture checking device (Mucus III, Life Co. Saitama, Japan) will&#xD;
           be placed on the tongue and bilateral buccal mucosa of the participants to measure their&#xD;
           oral moisture level (Murakami et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dentition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number and distribution of the remaining teeth and abutment teeth will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tooth mobility will be measured according to Miller's classification (Miller,&#xD;
                1938), and graded as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. No detectable movement or only slight movement of the crown in horizontal&#xD;
                     direction (â‰¤ 1mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Visually increased mobility of the crown &gt; 1 mm in a horizontal direction&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Severe mobility of the crown in both horizontal and vertical directions&#xD;
                     impinging on the function of the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth) score will be computed for every&#xD;
                individual. The tooth is recorded as D when dentine caries or cavity with or&#xD;
                without fillings are present. The tooth is recorded as M when it has been. When a&#xD;
                permanent or temporary filling is present, or when a filling is defective but not&#xD;
                decayed, the tooth is counted as F.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The number and type of occluding pairs between upper and lower natural teeth and&#xD;
                artificial teeth will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Denture-bearing tissue Denture-bearing tissue will be clinically assessed according to&#xD;
           Kapur's method (Kapur, 1967) with minor modification, in which the tissue is scored&#xD;
           based on the ridge shape, tissue resiliency and depth of sulcus (location of border&#xD;
           tissue attachment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Condition of denture-bearing mucosal tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of denture-related stomatitis will be recorded, which is characterised as&#xD;
      inflammation and redness of the oral mucosa underneath the denture base. The Newton&#xD;
      classification will be applied to classify the denture-related stomatitis (Scully, et al.&#xD;
      2008), which is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 - localized inflammation or pinpoint hyperemia; Type 2 - more diffuse erythema&#xD;
      involving part or all of the mucosa which is covered by the denture; Type 3 - inflammatory&#xD;
      nodular/papillary hyperplasia on the central hard palate or the alveolar ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination will be based on the most severe segment of the edentulous region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Denture condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Denture base material and integrity Denture base material (acrylic or metal) will be&#xD;
           recorded. Denture integrity will be assessed, and any of the following problems will be&#xD;
           recorded: fracture of denture base or flange, broken clasps or rests, loss of abutment&#xD;
           teeth, loss of non-abutment natural teeth, severe wear of prosthetic teeth, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Denture retention and stability Denture retention and stability will be evaluated&#xD;
           according to Kapur's, Corrigan's and Limpuangthip's methods (Kapur, 1967; Corrigan et&#xD;
           al., 2002; Limpuangthip et al., 2018), and a sum score will be given to each denture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Denture hygiene Denture hygiene will be determined by the Denture Cleanliness Index&#xD;
           (Mylonas et al., 2014), which is scored from 0 to 4 according to the condition of&#xD;
           staining, plaque, debris and calculus on denture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           0 - Clean denture. No plaque is visibly seen, no staining, no plaque detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. - Denture is visibly clean. Little staining (&lt; 25% of fitting surface stained)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. - Denture has visible plaque and/or debris. Moderate staining of fit surface (25 -&#xD;
                50% of fitting surface stained)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. - Denture has visible plaque and/or debris. Severe staining of fit surface (&gt; 50%&#xD;
                of fitting surface stained)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. - Denture has visible calculus deposition, on any surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Masticatory performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximum bite force:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximum bite force in the incisal (central incisor) and bilateral posterior (first&#xD;
           molar) regions will be measured by an occlusal force measurement device (iBite, Loadstar&#xD;
           Sensors, CA, USA) (Fan et al., 2020). Two measurements will be taken for each site and&#xD;
           the higher value will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Masticatory efficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A colour-changeable chewing gum (XYLITOL, Lotte Co., Ltd., Saitama, Japan) will be&#xD;
           applied to evaluate the masticatory efficiency of the participants. After 90 seconds of&#xD;
           chewing, the chewed gum will be collected and the level of color change will be measured&#xD;
           by a colorimeter (Shenzhen Threenh Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Three&#xD;
           readings will be taken: at the centre and approximately 4 mm to its right and left, to&#xD;
           obtain a mean a* value (CIE-L* a* b* colour system) (Fan et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perceived chewing ability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validated Chinese version of the chewing function questionnaire (CFQ) that contains 10&#xD;
      food items in five levels of chewing difficulties with two food items in each level will be&#xD;
      used (Fan et al., 2020). &quot;No response&quot; is given to the food item not consumed. The score of&#xD;
      each food item will be summed to give a total CFQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Oral health related quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validated Chinese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous subjects&#xD;
      (OHIP-EDENT-C) will be applied for assessing the OHRQoL of the participants (He et al.,&#xD;
      2015). It consists of 19 items grouped into seven domains to describe the functional&#xD;
      limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological&#xD;
      disability, social disability and handicap of the participants, with higher score indicating&#xD;
      lower OHRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Background information of denture wearers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data including age and gender of the participants will be collected. Background&#xD;
      information regarding denture wearing experience and habits, general satisfaction about the&#xD;
      current dentures, number of currently using drugs will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a self-controlled clinical trial to investigate the influence of denture adhesives on&#xD;
      the denture retention &amp; stability, denture hygiene, masticatory performance and OHRQoL of&#xD;
      elderly RPD wearers. The primary outcome is the change in masticatory performance. Ethics&#xD;
      approval by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital&#xD;
      Authority Hong Kong West Cluster has been obtained before implementation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercial copolymer-based cream adhesive (Polident, GlaxoSmithKline, Sussex, UK) is&#xD;
      selected as the denture adhesive. For participants in &quot;both dentures group&quot;, the DA will be&#xD;
      used for both dentures, while for participants in &quot;single denture group&quot;, the DA will be used&#xD;
      for eligible RPD only. Participants will be shown to apply the adhesive following the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. The denture is pressed firmly into place, then held firmly as&#xD;
      the participant bites down to secure it. Participants will be instructed to apply the&#xD;
      adhesive twice daily with an 8-hour interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements will be taken before application of denture adhesives, 1 week and 12&#xD;
      weeks after usage of denture adhesives. Phone calls will be given to the participants at 2&#xD;
      weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after baseline to check their adherence and amount of denture&#xD;
      adhesive used.&#xD;
