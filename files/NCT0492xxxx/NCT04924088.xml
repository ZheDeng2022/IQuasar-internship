  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The legal team in medical-legal partnerships works with healthcare providers to improve their&#xD;
      clients' lives. It is unknown whether this approach is better than providing usual legal&#xD;
      services, with no special emphasis on non-legal matters and no particular collaboration with&#xD;
      healthcare providers. The investigators propose to randomly assign 300 Veterans with&#xD;
      housing-related legal problems to either legal help from a medical-legal partnership or help&#xD;
      from lawyers in the community. The investigators will follow the randomized Veterans in this&#xD;
      study for one year to determine if there is a difference between the two groups of Veterans&#xD;
      in their housing situations and their mental health. The investigators will also interview&#xD;
      Veterans in both groups about their experience of the legal services they have received.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medical-legal partnership (MLP) is an innovative intervention that is being introduced both&#xD;
      in and outside of the VA healthcare system. The objective of the proposed project is to study&#xD;
      whether MLPs improve housing for homeless Veterans. MLPs represent a potentially effective&#xD;
      rehabilitative model. The VA has created interventions to help Veterans with criminal justice&#xD;
      problems, but there has been little attention on important civil legal problems, such as&#xD;
      evictions, landlord disputes, and rent arrears, that may interfere with stable housing and&#xD;
      health. A number of community-based legal providers outside the VA are beginning to partner&#xD;
      with VA medical centers to form MLPs to help Veterans address these civil legal issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MLPs are especially important for Veterans whose psychiatric conditions make it more&#xD;
      difficult for them to work with the legal system. MLPs address problems with evictions and&#xD;
      other housing-related issues within an integrated multidisciplinary framework, encompassing&#xD;
      the legal and mental health teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' experience and prior work with MLPs uniquely positions us to complete the&#xD;
      proposed work. The first VA MLP in the country was established between VA Connecticut and the&#xD;
      Connecticut Veterans Legal Center. This MLP will be the investigators' study site and has&#xD;
      become a model for other sites. The investigators have already conducted a funded&#xD;
      uncontrolled observational study and found that MLPs improve housing and mental health&#xD;
      outcomes of Veterans. However, more rigorous research is needed on this model. The&#xD;
      investigators are proposing the first randomized controlled trial of VA MLP. The results will&#xD;
      help VA leadership make informed decisions about supporting the investment and expansion of&#xD;
      MLPs as an intervention for Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      community-based, interdisciplinary intervention to address housing-related legal issues and&#xD;
      support the rehabilitation of homeless and at-risk Veterans. The results will inform the VA&#xD;
      about the potential of integrating non-VA community legal providers into the VA healthcare&#xD;
      system as a new interdisciplinary care model. To achieve this goal, the investigators have&#xD;
      two main study aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of MLP on housing outcomes (primary), mental health and social&#xD;
      integration outcomes (secondary) There has been no randomized controlled trial of MLPs and&#xD;
      this would be the first study of its kind. The field of MLPs is in desperate need of more&#xD;
      rigorous study and VA needs guidance on whether MLPs should be supported and promoted as an&#xD;
      effective intervention. The investigators recently completed an uncontrolled observational&#xD;
      study of VA MLPs funded by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation. The current proposal&#xD;
      represents a logical next step in the evidence hierarchy for MLPs. In this current proposal,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial with 300 low-income Veterans&#xD;
      with mental illness at VA Connecticut with a treatment group that receives on-site MLP&#xD;
      services and a control group that receives outside legal assistance. The investigators will&#xD;
      enroll Veterans with housing-related legal issues including rent-based evictions, rule&#xD;
      violations, and other landlord tenant disputes because of their potential impact on homeless&#xD;
      and at-risk Veterans. Participants will be followed for one year and the main outcome of&#xD;
      interest will be their housing status after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary outcome will be the change in mental health symptomatology over time as measured&#xD;
      by the BASIS-R. Because the investigators posit that MLPs especially benefit Veterans whose&#xD;
      severe symptoms impair their ability to navigate the legal system, in secondary analyses, the&#xD;
      investigators will test the extent to which mental health overall and psychotic symptom&#xD;
      severity (as measured by the BASIS-R) moderate response to MLP assignment. Based on MLPs&#xD;
      posited impact on mental health service use and their fostering Veteran empowerment, the&#xD;
      investigators will test weeks using any VA mental health service and self-rated empowerment&#xD;
      as potential mediators of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the Veteran experience with seeking and receiving legal interventions The VA&#xD;
      healthcare system is focused on understanding the Veteran experience and providing patient&#xD;
      centered care. MLPs are a new intervention it is important to examine how Veterans feel about&#xD;
      the MLP intervention. Additionally, some Veterans do not have access to MLPs and they may&#xD;
      seek assistance from other types of providers and services, so it is also important to&#xD;
      examine Veterans' experiences when they don't have access to MLPs. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will include a qualitative component to complement the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. There is potentially rich qualitative data that will not be captured by the&#xD;
      quantitative assessments collected in the randomized trial conducted for Aim 1. The&#xD;
      investigators will interview a total of 30 participants- 15 participants each from the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups. The investigators will interview each participant twice, once&#xD;
      at 3- month follow-up and again at 6-month follow-up. The results will shed light on initial&#xD;
      and longer-term Veteran rehabilitation experiences with seeking and receiving assistance from&#xD;
      MLP and outside legal providers for housing-related needs.&#xD;
