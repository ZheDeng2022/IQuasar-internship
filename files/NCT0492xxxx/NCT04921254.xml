    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of BSG005 following single and multiple ascending doses in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. The study will include a single ascending dose part and a multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      part&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of BSG005 in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
      The study will also include pharmacokinetic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an ascending single dose part (SAD) with 6 subject in a study dose cohort of&#xD;
      which 2 will be placebo and 4 will be on active drug. This concept will be replicated in the&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 6 cohorts in the SAD with a starting dose calculated from the GLP NOAEL dose&#xD;
      levels and from that increasing dose levels will be tested after a Safety Review Committee&#xD;
      (SRC) has approved the escalation to next dose level. The key parameters are infusion&#xD;
      reactions, kidney, liver and potassium changes during and after administration of BSG005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the outcome of the SAD part the MAD part may include 4 or 5 dose levels&#xD;
      administered daily over 7 days. Key parameters are the same as in the SAD part but extended&#xD;
      to cover monitoring over 14 days. Pharmacokinetics at day 1 and day 7 will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key evaluation is on safety and tolerability during and after 7 days of dosing and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic investigations and the steady state plasma levels.&#xD;
