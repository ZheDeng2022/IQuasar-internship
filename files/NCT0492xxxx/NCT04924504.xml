    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the metabolic changes during pregnancy in women with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes in order to detect the pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      behind severe insulin resistance during pregnancy as well as the short- and long term&#xD;
      consequences for mother and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included pathophysiological mechanisms potentially associated with severe insulin resistance&#xD;
      are: Maternal hormonal, inflammatory and metabolic markers in the blood, as well as the&#xD;
      level, content and bioactivity of exosomes and genetic variants associated with overweight&#xD;
      and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the analysis on maternal blood, the same analysis will be performed on&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood in order to determine the correlation between markers associated with&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity in maternal and umbilical blood. Furthermore, fetal metabolic changes&#xD;
      influence on fetal growth and development will be evaluated. Postpartum, the breast milk will&#xD;
      also be examined for metabolic active substances that could influence the newborns growth and&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating one potential short-term consequence of diabetes during pregnancy, the&#xD;
      association between insulin resistance and structural and functional changes in the placenta&#xD;
      will be examined as well as the consequences of such changes on fetal growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating one potential long-term consequence of diabetes during pregnancy, the&#xD;
      association between treatment with high doses of insulin during pregnancy and the future risk&#xD;
      of developing cardiovascular diseases and heart failure will be examined.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational study including app. 24 pregnant women from the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Aalborg and Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 8 healthy women without pregestational or gestational diabetes, 8 women&#xD;
      with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes with a total daily insulin dose &lt;= 75 units/day&#xD;
      and 8 women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes with a total daily insulin dose &gt;=&#xD;
      100 units/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three study days: One in gestational week 28-36 (day 1), one during labour (day 2)&#xD;
      and one 6 months postpartum (day 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal profiles and inflammatory markers will be measured at all three study days. During&#xD;
      labour both maternal and umbilical blood will be collected. The blood sample analysis will&#xD;
      include HbA1c, glukose, insulin, C-peptid, human anti-insulin antibody, lipid profile, liver&#xD;
      enzymes, creatinine, FGF-21, TSH, Cortisol, human chorionic gonadotropin, estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone, SHBG, prolactin, human placental lactogen, placental growth hormone, PAPP-A,&#xD;
      sFlt-1, PP13, IGF-1, IGF-BP's, Leptin, Adiponectin, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1α, IFN-ɣ, TNF-α,&#xD;
      ICAM1, VCAM and CD163. In addition to this, exosomes will be isolated precisely and profiling&#xD;
      of the content of exosomes will be performed using in vitro assays. Proteomics and miRNAs&#xD;
      sequencing will be employed. Furthermore, whole genome analysis will be applied to find&#xD;
      genetic variants associated with overweight and diabetes (genetic analysis will not be&#xD;
      performed on umbilical cord blood). Insulin sensitivity will be estimated using the&#xD;
      homeostasis model assessment, IS-HOMA, based on fasting C-peptid and glucose concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the blood samples, the following examinations will be performed at day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, weight and bioelectrical impedance analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample (Albumin-to-creatinine ratio)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central arterial pressure waveform analysis (SphygmoCor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan of the placenta and heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the blood samples, the following examinations will be performed at day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placenta will be collected for a postpartum histopathological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast milk (analyzed for lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, prolactin,&#xD;
           prolactin-binding protein, oxytocin, ghrelin, insulin, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1α,&#xD;
           IFN-ɣ, TNF-α, ICAM1, VCAM, CD163 and untargeted metabolomics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skinfold measurement of the newborn with a caliper&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the blood samples, the following examinations will be performed at day 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, weight and bioelectrical impedance analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample (Albumin-to-creatinine ratio)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central arterial pressure waveform analysis (SphygmoCor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast milk (analyzed for lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, prolactin,&#xD;
           prolactin-binding protein, oxytocin, ghrelin, insulin, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1α,&#xD;
