  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of a modified version of the behaviour&#xD;
      management technique Latent inhibition in combination with Er:YAG laser for achieving&#xD;
      reduction of dental anxiety in paediatric dental patients. The main objectives are to compare&#xD;
      dental anxiety felt during the laser and conventional dental treatment. The outcomes will be&#xD;
      dental anxiety assessment by a self-reported anxiety during treatment in both group as well&#xD;
      as measurement of heart rate dynamics during the procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When providing dental care to child patients with a high level of dental anxiety, the range&#xD;
      of approaches are divided into two sections - use of behavior management techniques and&#xD;
      application of alternative methods for caries removal. In attempt to reduce dental anxiety,&#xD;
      they can be mixed and matched in accordance with the dentists' choice. Owing to the promoted&#xD;
      advantages Er:YAG laser turns into an ideal alternative technique for hard dental tissue&#xD;
      therapy in anxious pediatric patients.This is a protocol for a randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. The participants will be children aged aged 6-12 years, requiring conservative&#xD;
      treatment of occlusal carious lesions on a second primary molar. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to experimental or control group via computer-generated sequence. In both groups&#xD;
      Latent inhibition will be used as an anxiety-management technique. In the experimental group&#xD;
      caries treatment will be performed with Erbium:YAG laser, whereas in the control group with&#xD;
      the conventional rotary instruments. Outcome measures will be dental anxiety felt before and&#xD;
      after the treatment and the dynamics of heart rate, registered during the treatment session.&#xD;
