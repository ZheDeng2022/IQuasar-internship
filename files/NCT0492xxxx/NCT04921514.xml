      This study will evaluate and describe the occurrence of Acute traumatic stress and&#xD;
      persistence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after resuscitated sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      (SCD) in patient and relatives present during the event. The population will be composed of&#xD;
      40 patients: 20 with resuscitated SCD and 20 relatives. Two interviews will be performed by a&#xD;
      psychologist within one week after resuscitated SCD and at month 3. Questionnaire Stanford&#xD;
      Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ), Life Events Checklist for Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (LEC-5) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) will be filled during these interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of therapeutic advances, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a frequent (60000/year&#xD;
      in France) and often fatal disease (5% survival). Because it is by definition unexpected, the&#xD;
      psychological impact on resuscitated patients and on relatives may be important. However&#xD;
      little studies have evaluated it. Patients who later develop PTSD, generally have acute&#xD;
      stress disorder. In patients with resuscitated sudden cardiac death, acute psychological&#xD;
      distress is frequent and PTSD was identified in 40% of patients. Concerning relatives,&#xD;
      Haywood (2018) call them the &quot;forgotten patients&quot; to emphasize the absence of recognition of&#xD;
      his psychological trauma. PTSD was more frequent in people who were witness of the SCD vs&#xD;
      those who were not there. Hofland et al (2018) showed that people present during&#xD;
      resuscitation maneuvers had more acute stress than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate acute stress disorder with SASRQ scale in patients with resuscitated&#xD;
      SCD and their relative just after the event. At 3 months, presence of PTSD will be evaluated&#xD;
      with PCL-5 and LEC-5 in patients and their relatives.&#xD;

    <description>During an interview with a trained psychologist, the presence of acute stress will be assessed by the SASRQ test within one week of the occurrence of a sudden recovered death.&#xD;
The diagnosis of acute post-traumatic stress disorder is made according to the presence of at least three dissociative symptoms out of five, and other symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance or marked anxiety or hypervigilance. Each symptom is thus evaluated dichotomously. A symptom is present if the intensity of the response is 3 or more (0 &quot;from 0 to 2&quot; and 1 &quot;from 3 to 5&quot;).</description>

    <intervention_name>PCL-5 with LEC-5 questionnaire</intervention_name>
    <description>This questionnaire will be completed during an interview with a psychologist trained in the protocol, 3 months after the sudden death.&#xD;
The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the 20 symptoms of PTSD according to the DSM-V. It is associated with the LEC-5 questionnaire.&#xD;
The self-reported scale uses ratings of &quot;0 to 4&quot; to assess each of the symptoms.&#xD;
A threshold of 38 on the PCL-5 seems reasonable to suggest the presence of PTSD.</description>
