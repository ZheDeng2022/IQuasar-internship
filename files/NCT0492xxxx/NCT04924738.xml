    <textblock>
      This prospective observational trial includes women with high risk pregnancies complicated&#xD;
      with hyperglycemia in pregnancy and excessive body weight. The participants are enrolled when&#xD;
      pregnant and monitored throughout pregnancy and delivery until the offspring is 6 months old.&#xD;
      This research addresses the question which risk factors for non-communicable disorders such&#xD;
      as hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes for a woman and her offspring can be detected&#xD;
      during pregnancy and in early childhood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The available epidemiological data clearly indicate a significant increase in the percentage&#xD;
      of people with obesity and the metabolic syndrome in the population of women of reproductive&#xD;
      age. These diseases predispose to the onset of type 2 diabetes at a young age and accelerate&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular diseases, while in pregnant population they constitute a serious&#xD;
      risk factor for gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent decades have brought a growing amount of evidence from prospective studies indicating&#xD;
      the adverse impact of gestational diabetes on the health prognosis of the mother and her&#xD;
      child. In the short-term perspective, hyperglycemia in pregnancy constitutes a risk factor&#xD;
      for numerous maternal-fetal complications, in particular hypertensive diseases in pregnancy,&#xD;
      excessive fetal growth, intrapartum complications induced by excessive birth weight of the&#xD;
      newborn, which can result in intrapartum neonatal asphyxia or maternal postpartum&#xD;
      haemorrhage. Gestational diabetes is also associated with an increased risk of fetal&#xD;
      intrauterine death in late pregnancy, during delivery or postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is growing evidence of the adverse effects of gestational diabetes on&#xD;
      long-term health outcomes of the mother and her offspring, even when glucose tolerance&#xD;
      disorders are resolved after delivery. Hyperglycemia detected in pregnancy is a strong risk&#xD;
      factor for the development of type 2 diabetes within several years after experiencing a&#xD;
      complicated pregnancy. Moreover, maternal hyperglycemia has been shown to adversely affect&#xD;
      the long-term risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes in the&#xD;
      offspring of this pregnant population. This relationship is so clear that it is the exposure&#xD;
      of the fetus to the abnormal intrauterine metabolic environment that is considered to be one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of the significantly increased prevalence of the aforementioned&#xD;
      civilization diseases among children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors of the study expect that the obtained results will provide important data&#xD;
      enabling early identification of the population that can benefit most measurably from the&#xD;
      diagnosis and possible treatment of conditions predisposing to the non-communicable diseases.&#xD;
      The authors believe, that this study will identify specific maternal characteristics that&#xD;
      could be targets for individualized interventions modifying risk factors of civilization&#xD;
      diseases in mothers and their offspring. The authors expect that the measurable effect of the&#xD;
      research will be achievable in the short term - in the form of reduction of maternal-fetal&#xD;
      complications characteristic of pregnancy complicated with obesity and / or gestational&#xD;
      diabetes (maternal &quot;diabesity&quot;), and in the long term - in the form of improvement of the&#xD;
      incidence rates of non-communicable disorders in the population of pregnant women of a risk&#xD;
      profile similar to this presented by the cohort included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of epigenetic risk factors of intergenerational glucose tolerance&#xD;
           disorders and examining the possibility of their modification so as to break the&#xD;
           intergenerational &quot;vicious circle&quot; of metabolic syndrome and lifestyle diseases&#xD;
           resulting from it;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of mechanisms responsible for the intergenerational transmission of&#xD;
           classic and &quot;new&quot; risk factors of non-communicable diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gather information for future trials on development and evaluation of interventions&#xD;
           aimed at reducing the effects of the intergenerational &quot;vicious circle&quot; of obesity,&#xD;
           insulin resistance and diseases related to lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes the following visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V0 - recruitment, V1 - gestational age 28-32 weeks, V2 - gestational age 36-38 weeks, V3 -&#xD;
      delivery, V4 - six weeks postpartum, V5 - six months postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the V0, the researchers will collect detailed information concerning demographics,&#xD;
      anthropometrics, past diseases, pregnancy-related conditions, lifestyle and dietary habits&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the V1, V2, V4 and V5, the researchers collect data regarding maternal glucose levels and&#xD;
      body weight, perform noninvasive tests of cardiovascular function and collect biological&#xD;
      material to be aliquoted, frozen and stored for further examination of biomarkers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress, fat tissue function, inflammation, insulin resistance, clotting system,&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk; also information regarding fetal growth (V1,V2) and child's&#xD;
      anthropometrics and development (V4, V5) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the V3, the researchers collect a detailed information regarding delivery and neonatal&#xD;
      anthropometrics, and collect samples of placenta and cord blood to be aliquoted, frozen and&#xD;
      stored for further examination (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the V6, the researchers collect information regarding maternal dietary and lifestyle&#xD;
      habits, perform noninvasive tests of cardiovascular function and collect biological material&#xD;
      to be aliquoted, frozen and stored for further examination of biomarkers of oxidative stress,&#xD;
      fat tissue function, inflammation, insulin resistance, clotting system, cardiometabolic risk.&#xD;
