      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, open-label, phase IIIb clinical study. The&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Savolitinib in the treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 mutations. The study involves a&#xD;
      Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. It is planned that about 40&#xD;
      study sites will enroll 163 advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 mutations&#xD;
