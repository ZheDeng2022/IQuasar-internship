      This trial was an observational phase IV prospective multicenter study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of Cinnomer® in patients with MS in Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study was safety evaluation. To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      Cinnomer®, at each visit, the AEs, seriousness of observed AEs, and abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      findings were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Cinnomer® as the secondary objective, the indicative&#xD;
      parameters of MS activity, including relapse information, MRI findings, and EDSS scores were&#xD;
      considered. Also, questionnaires assessing the patients' QoL and depression were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 368 patients and the 14 months of the study was considered applicable for&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness evaluation of Cinnomer®, 40 mg/ml, three times per week, in patients&#xD;
      with relapsing forms of MS.&#xD;
