  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scar is an unpleasant symptom that commonly appear after orthopedic surgery, especially the&#xD;
      joint procedure. Due to the wide motion range, skin around joint has excessive tension that&#xD;
      may increase risk for wide or conspicuous scar formation of surgical wound. Noticeable scar&#xD;
      can negatively impact the quality of life and psychosocial development. However, scar&#xD;
      management is overlooked in early recovery period easily. Patients commonly start to turn&#xD;
      their attention to the surgical scar after the completion of rehabilitation or the resolution&#xD;
      of disease or unbearable symptom. It is always beyond the best period of scar treatment, 3 to&#xD;
      6 months after wound healing. This study is aimed to observe and evaluate the scar formation&#xD;
      with or without aggressive management in pediatric population within 6 months after wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;

      This is an observational, case-control study. Patients will be invited to participate and&#xD;
      allocated to scar dressing group if they plan to use scar dressing. After gaining the written&#xD;
      inform consent, participants will be asked to fulfill the patient diary, including the record&#xD;
      of scar dressing use, patient scar assessment scale and satisfaction assessment, with&#xD;
      parents' help. In regular group, patients are retrospectively selected by matched factors,&#xD;
      such as demographics data. Scar-related data, including scar pictures, vancouver scar scale&#xD;
      assessment and complication, are collected from medical history in both groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Vancouver Scar Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgical wound healing</time_frame>
    <description>Vancouver scar scale includes four items toward evaluation of observable aspects of the scar. Each item is rated with 4-6 possible points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Scar Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgical wound healed to 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>In scar dressing group, patient scar assessment scale consists of 6 questions. Each question is rated from 1 to 10. 1 is the best and 10 reflects the worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of incision site complication</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgical wound healed to 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of the population suffering from surgical scar-related complications are analyzed, especially the ones toward scar dressing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgical wound healing</time_frame>
    <description>In scar dressing group, patients are asked with serial questions to rate satisfaction toward scar dressing on a numeric rating scale. 1 means the most unsatisfaction and 10 means the most satisfaction.</description>
