  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      rehabilitation methods post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Population of interest is adult&#xD;
      hip/knee clinic patients over age 18 who are indicated for unilateral primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty. All TKA patients are prescribed physical therapy (PT) for rehabilitation&#xD;
      post-operatively. The investigators will compare this current treatment with a new,&#xD;
      validated, wearable smart knee brace (FM2 Knee Brace) that can be used for rehabilitation&#xD;
      post-TKA. Following enrollment in the study, the investigators will match and randomize&#xD;
      participants into two cohorts (outpatient PT versus FM2 Knee Brace). Outpatient PT group will&#xD;
      be prescribed routine six-week course of outpatient PT (no pool exercises, remainder at&#xD;
      therapist's discretion) to start as soon as possible upon discharge. The FM2 Knee Brace group&#xD;
      will complete device set up at pre-op visit and will be prescribed 3-4 exercises to complete&#xD;
      at their discretion over six weeks. The investigators will collect measurements of knee&#xD;
      flexion, extension, total arc of motion at pre-op visit and at 6-week, 3-month, and 1-year&#xD;
      post-op visits. The investigators will also plan to record additional PROs, therapy&#xD;
      compliance, and complication rates. The investigators will compare the two groups to test&#xD;
      whether the new FM2 Knee Brace is noninferior to regular PT when recovering from TKA, and if&#xD;
      the new technology could be an alternative to outpatient PT.&#xD;
