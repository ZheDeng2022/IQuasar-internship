    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, open label Phase Ib dose-escalation study of the combination of&#xD;
      VEN and OM, conducted using an innovative Bayesian Optimal Interval-design, to find the MTD&#xD;
      in participants with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies including those failing&#xD;
      treatment with venetoclax-containing regimens. Treatment plan will consist of an induction&#xD;
      phase, followed by a consolidation phase if applicable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study of VEN and OM, the investigator will conduct a Bayesian Optimal&#xD;
      Interval-designed trial following the approach of Yuan et al 40 to find the MTD with a target&#xD;
      DLT rate of 2%, 4 pre-specified doses, and between 24 and up to 30 participants. Beginning&#xD;
      with the first participant treated at the lowest dose of OM 0.625 mg/m2 q12h with VEN 400 mg,&#xD;
      dose escalation and de-escalation of OM will involve a comparison of the observed DLT rate&#xD;
      (p) at the current dose with a pair of fixed, pre-specified boundary rates: λe (escalation)&#xD;
      with p ≤ 0.157; λd (de-escalation) with p ≥ 0.238; or otherwise remain at the same dose per&#xD;
      the dosing schedule. The trial will start with a cohort size of 1 participant (unless DLT is&#xD;
      experienced) and escalated for each subsequent participant until the first DLT occurs and the&#xD;
      current dose cohort is expanded to 3.40 In a simulation of these conditions with a target DLT&#xD;
      rate of 20% (1), the percentage correct selection of the MTD is between 60% with enrollment&#xD;
      of 20 participants and 70% with enrollment of 24 participants. Implementation of the trial&#xD;
      design will be performed using R package 'BOIN'. If the investigator observes an unexpected&#xD;
      toxicity in Cohort 1 the investigator will use OM 0.5 mg/m2 daily with VEN for Cohort -1&#xD;
      Following each cycle, participants will be evaluated for complete response (CR) by&#xD;
      International Working Group (IWG) criteria 41&#xD;
