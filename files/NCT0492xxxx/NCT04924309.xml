    <textblock>
      Donor sperm provides a viable option for patients with significant male factor infertility.&#xD;
      However, since the source of sperm is not from the male partner, the psychological burden of&#xD;
      these couples is more pronounced and complex than other patients.The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the stress faced by participants undergoing assisted reproduction with donor&#xD;
      sperm and to further investigate its impact on pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of infertility patients has increased significantly in recent years, and&#xD;
      infertility caused by the male partner accounts for about 30%-50% of infertility factors.&#xD;
      Donor sperm provides a viable option for patients with significant male factor infertility.&#xD;
      However, since the source of sperm is not from the male partner, the psychological burden of&#xD;
      these couples is more pronounced and complex than other patients. Many factors such as&#xD;
      social, marital, and family problems may contribute to their depressed emotional state. And&#xD;
      the impact of these negative emotions on pregnancy outcomes cannot be ignored. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators intend to investigate the stress faced by participants undergoing assisted&#xD;
      reproduction with donor sperm to provide a reliable basis for future psychological&#xD;
      interventions and health education for this group of patients and improve the quality of life&#xD;
      of infertility patients.&#xD;
