      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri&#xD;
      standardized extract (300 mg/day) taken for 12 weeks in 264 veterans with GWI, and to gain&#xD;
      insight into the underlying biological mechanisms of nootropic, anti-inflammatory, and&#xD;
      adaptogenic actions tied to Bacopa.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GWI, a disabling, multi-symptom complex illness, is dominated by neurological and&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms and cognitive problems are some of the most reported issues in Veterans&#xD;
      with GWI. A study conducted in 2013, reported that 96% of veterans with GWI in their study&#xD;
      reported cognitive problems, including memory and recall, so it is one of the most prominent&#xD;
      symptoms of the disorder. Bacopa has been shown to be effective in improving memory and&#xD;
      recall in several studies in general and in the elderly population. Therefore, to target&#xD;
      these immune and neurocognitive defects tied to GWI, likely attributable to chemical and&#xD;
      environment exposures in wartime efforts, this study will evaluate the efficacy of Bacopa in&#xD;
      a phase II clinical trial. Bacopa has not been studied in GWI, but the published studies with&#xD;
      evidence of its nootropic, adaptogenic, pro-cholinergic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      activity in older populations provide motivation to examine the potential benefits of this&#xD;
      nutraceutical in ailing veterans with risk of cognitive function decline. Most importantly,&#xD;
      data are available for its safety and tolerability in human subjects and the biochemical&#xD;
      targets of this nutraceutical align with the symptoms of this population. Moreover,&#xD;
      computational modeling performed by this research team has identified multiple therapeutic&#xD;
      targets in the GWI, several of which appear to be candidates for Bacopa's multiple modes of&#xD;
      action in the blood and brain. This suggests that Bacopa may be useful in ameliorating a&#xD;
      myriad of symptoms experienced by veterans afflicted with GWI, due to the multi-organ system&#xD;
      involvement tied to GWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate cognitive function as evidence of efficacy of Bacopa on&#xD;
      CNS symptom management of Gulf War Illness.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Stratification of randomization according to whether participants are willing to commit to providing an additional blood draw 12 weeks after initiation of the intervention explicitly acknowledges the likelihood of participant dropout and nonrandom missing data. In formally accounting for this strong predictor of missing data, the stratified design strengthens the statistical inference regarding treatment effects. Furthermore, the stratified design will improve the study's efficiency by minimizing wasted materials.</masking_description>
