&#xD;
         11. Any severe and uncontrolled ocular disease that may, in the ophthalmologist's opinion,&#xD;
             present a specific risk to the patient's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if&#xD;
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise&#xD;
