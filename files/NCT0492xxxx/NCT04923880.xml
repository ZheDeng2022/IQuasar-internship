      Five Cystic Fibrosis (CF) centers, key stakeholders, and a palliative care institute have&#xD;
      collaborated to create a novel primary palliative care intervention for patients with CF,&#xD;
      &quot;Improving Life with CF: A Primary Palliative Care Partnership,&quot; and established the&#xD;
      infrastructure and support necessary for a follow-on implementation study. This intervention&#xD;
      provides a framework for a nationally generalizable model to improve best practices in&#xD;
      generalist-level palliative care in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Implement a primary palliative care intervention comprising screening-and-triage&#xD;
      workflows, best practice treatment guides for high frequency problems, patient/family and&#xD;
      provider education, and a quality improvement (QI) toolkit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility, uptake, and preliminary outcomes during a multisite pragmatic,&#xD;
      implementation trial of the intervention at 5 diverse Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subaim 2.1: Evaluate feasibility and uptake as measured by rates of screening and treatment&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Related to feasibility and uptake of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &gt; 80% of individuals with CF of all ages will receive an annual palliative care&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &gt; 25% of individuals with CF will receive a palliative care screening prompted by&#xD;
           hospitalization, new diagnosis of CF-Related Diabetes, need for transplantation, or&#xD;
           another disease- or treatment-specific trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Related to provider education:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) &gt; 80% will access &gt;1 training(s) (on-demand webinars or in-service by trained site&#xD;
      educators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subaim 2.2: Evaluate data on preliminary outcomes for individuals with CF by comparing&#xD;
      ratings on patient- and caregiver-reported outcome measures (e.g., Integrated Palliative Care&#xD;
      Outcome Scale, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, Memorial Symptom Assessment&#xD;
      Scale-Cystic Fibrosis, and Brief Assessment Scale for Caregivers) during the trial to&#xD;
      baseline ratings and exploring covariates of change (age, race/ethnicity, gender, disease&#xD;
      severity, CFTR modifier treatment, psychological distress, and varied indicators reflecting&#xD;
      intervention implementation).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care intended to mitigate the suffering and&#xD;
      illness burden experienced by patients with serious illnesses, and their families, from the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis forward. The illness burden experienced by patients with CF and their&#xD;
      caregivers is characterized by problems in many domains (e.g., physical symptoms, emotional&#xD;
      distress, caregiver burden, and need for goal-setting). Interventions to address the goals of&#xD;
      palliative care must be undertaken throughout the course of the illness by CF&#xD;
      professionals-an approach known as generalist-level or primary palliative care. At present,&#xD;
      there are no standardized, generalizable models of primary palliative care for CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New CF Foundation guidelines recommend that CF Centers screen all adults and children from&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis, along with caregivers of individuals with CF of all ages, for unmet&#xD;
      palliative care needs annually and after &quot;triggers&quot; such as hospitalization or other major&#xD;
      events (Kavalieratos D et al. J Palliat Med. 2020 Sep 16. Epub ahead of print). The goal is&#xD;
      to identify high frequency problems, such as symptom distress and the need for advance care&#xD;
      planning (ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention will involve a multi-site implementation trial of a new care model&#xD;
      that applies the CF Foundation Palliative Care Guidelines (Kavalieratos D et al., 2020) at&#xD;
      five CF Centers across the country. We will collect longitudinal data from patients and&#xD;
      family caregivers on palliative care outcomes and also evaluate uptake of the care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, each of the 5 participating CF Centers will recruit all eligible adolescent and&#xD;
      adult CF patients plus one identified caregiver per patient of any age. Participants will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to have their questions answered by a member of the site's study staff&#xD;
      and will have at least 24 hours to decide whether they wish to participate. Those who agree&#xD;
      to participate will be assigned a study ID number and their status tracked in a secure&#xD;
      enrollment log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the system-level palliative care intervention involving individuals&#xD;
      with CF and their primary caregivers at each site, patients and caregivers consenting to&#xD;
      participate in the outcome assessment will complete a baseline questionnaire packet. This&#xD;
      packet will include validated questionnaires that will be repeated during the outcome&#xD;
      assessment. Participants will be reimbursed $20 for the baseline assessment, which is&#xD;
      expected to take &lt; 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment will include sociodemographic items that assess age, gender,&#xD;
      racial/ethnic status, primary language, marital status, educational level, employment status,&#xD;
      annual household income, and insurance status, and will be completed by patients and&#xD;
      caregivers to profile the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 3 months of trial implementation, patients and caregivers who consented to&#xD;
      participate in the baseline assessment will be asked to complete a second questionnaire&#xD;
      packet (identical to the first). This will occur approximately 2 years following baseline, in&#xD;
      study months 25-27. Participants will be reimbursed $20 for the outcome assessment, which is&#xD;
      expected to take &lt; 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline research assessment, all study sites will seek to implement new CF&#xD;
      Foundation guidelines recommending annual and triggered palliative care needs assessments for&#xD;
      individuals with CF and their primary caregivers (Kavalieratos D et al., 2020). As each of&#xD;
      the CF Centers in the study adopt this new system-wide care model, the proposed study will&#xD;
      conduct an intervention trial to support practice change, involving: 1) practice-level&#xD;
      screening-and-triage workflows, 2) best practice treatment guides for management of high&#xD;
      frequency problems; 3) provider education in generalist-level palliative care, supported by&#xD;
      on-demand webinars and 4) train-the-trainer approach (education and manuals); and 5) a QI&#xD;
      toolkit including resources for patient and family education, the monitoring of quality&#xD;
      indicators for successful implementation of routine screening, and focused studies related to&#xD;
      specific objectives of palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process measures collected in the trial will include data on uptake of the intervention,&#xD;
      including rates of screening, triage, use of best practice guides, and provider use of&#xD;
      education (on-demand webinars and on-site in-services and training) at each site. For process&#xD;
      measures, the electronic medical record or other tracking systems at each site will be&#xD;
      queried quarterly under a waiver of written authorization for medical record abstraction.&#xD;
      This de-identified, aggregate information, such as percentage of center patients who receive&#xD;
      an annual or clinically triggered palliative care screening (e.g., Subaim 2.1, hypotheses 1a&#xD;
      and 1b), will be entered by the Research Coordinator into a REDCap® database for the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from the participating sites (process data on intervention uptake from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record, and quantitative data from patients and caregivers from REDCap®)&#xD;
      will be merged into a SPSS database by the Research Manager at the Data Coordinating Center,&#xD;
      MJHS Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process measures will provide information related to the feasibility and uptake of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention. The analysis will evaluate a) the proportion of patients and&#xD;
      caregivers who completed annual screenings vs. patients and caregivers who are eligible; b)&#xD;
      the proportion of screenings completed by patients and caregivers following specific&#xD;
      triggers: hospitalization, new diagnosis of CF-Related Diabetes, and referral/declined&#xD;
      referral for transplant evaluation; c) the proportion of patients and caregivers whose&#xD;
      screening identified a need for further assessment for various symptoms or needs; and d) the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who underwent a change in care plan based on the triage approach for&#xD;
      different symptoms or needs. The analysis will evaluate each of these outcomes by patient age&#xD;
      group (adults, adolescents, older children, and young children). Uptake also will be assessed&#xD;
      by the number of Care Team members who access on-demand webinars or on-site in-service&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each site, the new model will be judged to be feasible or not, based on whether the Center&#xD;
      achieves all of the following benchmarks: 1) the structural components can be implemented and&#xD;
      sustained over time and 2) by the outcome assessment, &gt;80% of patients due for an annual&#xD;
      screening are screened, and &gt;25% of patients who need a 'triggered' screening are screened.&#xD;
      The overall feasibility of the model relative to national distribution will be affirmed if at&#xD;
      least four of the practices demonstrate that the model is feasible at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation of feasibility will be complemented by exploratory quantitative analyses. In&#xD;
      the quantitative analyses, all study variables will be described, and distributions&#xD;
      evaluated. Generalized logistic linear mixed effects models will evaluate changes in all&#xD;
      uptake variables. Uptake variables (1=screened, 0=not screened) will serve as the outcome in&#xD;
      separate models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study variables will be described and distributions evaluated. Linear mixed effects&#xD;
      models will evaluate changes in the typical primary outcomes (CFQ-R physical and emotional&#xD;
      functioning subscale scores) and secondary outcomes (IPOS total score, MSAS-CF total score,&#xD;
      total scores for the BASC, PHQ, GAD, PSS, and other CFQ-R subscales (e.g., vitality,&#xD;
      digestive, respiratory symptoms, and role subscale scores)) as preliminary data for a&#xD;
      fully-scaled randomized clinical trial. Time will serve as the fixed effect. Individual&#xD;
      intercepts, site, and time will serve as random effects. The best fitting covariance&#xD;
      structure will be selected using Akaike's Information Criterion. Additional separate models&#xD;
      will evaluate patient- (sociodemographics, disease severity-, and psychological&#xD;
      distress-related variables), provider- (use of education sessions), and site-level predictors&#xD;
      of uptake (size of practice). SPSS version 25 will be used for all analyses. All analyses&#xD;
      will be two-tailed with alpha set at .05. With baseline data prior to the intervention,&#xD;
      longitudinal data from the outcome assessment, and process data about uptake of the&#xD;
      intervention by each site, we also will be able to explore relationships between the&#xD;
      intervention &quot;dose&quot; trends (e.g., the frequency of screening and triage across patients and&#xD;
      the type of clinical interventions recommended and utilized) and effects on patient symptoms,&#xD;
      function, or HRQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of source data will occur at each study site and by the Data Coordinating Center&#xD;
      (the MJHS Institute). Process data on uptake of the intervention at the CF Centers and&#xD;
      individual self-report or parent proxy report questionnaires, will be checked by research&#xD;
      staff using a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Manual specifying the standard practices,&#xD;
      methods, and protocol. A member of the study staff will cross-check all data and review all&#xD;
      self-report measures to ensure their completeness. Any errors in completion will be reviewed&#xD;
      to determine if directions or procedures for the assessments need to be altered. In this&#xD;
      case, permission from the IRB will be requested to change any procedures. In addition, study&#xD;
      personnel will use IRB-approved eligibility checklists to ensure that all patients and&#xD;
      caregivers who are approached for participation in study assessments are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Coordinators at each site will be in weekly contact with the Site PIs and Research&#xD;
      Manager at the Data Coordinating Center (the MJHS Institute) to review any issues with the&#xD;
      data (i.e., missing data) and ensure data integrity. Given the multi-center nature of the&#xD;
      study, the study PIs (Anna Georgiopoulos, MD, and Lara Dhingra, PhD) will also meet regularly&#xD;
      by telephone and videoconference with the Site PIs to review study conduct at all sites.&#xD;
      Sites will be required to review their progress regularly and report unanticipated events,&#xD;
      protocol deviations, and protocol violations at least monthly to the study PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Lara Dhingra, Co-PI at the MJHS Institute, the Data Coordinating Center for this study,&#xD;
      and her research team will oversee the conduct of monthly protocol compliance audits. These&#xD;
      will focus on informed consent procedures, participant eligibility, baseline and outcome&#xD;
      assessments, and quarterly review of process measures. Protocol compliance will consist of&#xD;
      100% verification of the protocol specific measures identified in the protocol being&#xD;
      available and accurately noted for the participant being reviewed. All study questionnaires&#xD;
      will be audited for completeness by Dr. Dhingra, who also will conduct quality checks of the&#xD;
      database that will receive this information; these data verification audits will be conducted&#xD;
      for 100% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has been reviewed by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board, with the determination that the program is minimal risk and that there is no need for&#xD;
      a Data Monitoring Committee for this study. Study PIs will be responsible for safety&#xD;
      monitoring. Site PIs or their designees will be available at all times to respond to any&#xD;
      question of safety.&#xD;
