  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's goal is to use non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS) techniques to treat language&#xD;
      impairment associated with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      combine behavioral language intervention with individualized noninvasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      techniques, called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to help the brain&#xD;
      reorganize around damage and improve language functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder that selectively affects&#xD;
      language comprehension and/or production, with initial preservation of other cognitive&#xD;
      domains. As tDCS has not been extensively studied in PPA, the investigators will measure both&#xD;
      short- and long-term effects of stimulation in patients with this neurodegenerative disorder&#xD;
      that affects specific language regions. Previous research suggests that neurostimulation with&#xD;
      tDCS can safely induce changes in neural plasticity that can lead to long-term restoration of&#xD;
      synaptic function. Thus, individually targeted stimulation to structurally preserved but&#xD;
      dysfunctional regions may be able to produce behavioral improvements in primary progressive&#xD;
      aphasia (PPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS is a method of stimulating the brain that does not require any sedation or surgery. TDCS&#xD;
      is a technique that sends a weak electrical current through the scalp to stimulate the brain&#xD;
      areas below. The information gained from this research study will aid in the development of&#xD;
      therapies to improve language in people with neurological conditions that affect language&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS will be applied over the activated area identified with the functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) fMRI-localizer task. This approach will allow for individually&#xD;
      optimized tDCS electrode placement. It will also account for potential inter-participant&#xD;
      variability in the brain atrophy and language organization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of study sequence and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1: Baseline screening, language testing, one event-related brain potential (EEG-ERP)&#xD;
      session Weeks 2: fMRI session to determine most effective treatment Weeks 3-4: tDCS with&#xD;
      Language Treatment Part 1 Weeks 5 and 6: rest-period, post-treatment assessment Weeks 7 to 8:&#xD;
      TDCS with Language Treatment Part 2 Weeks 9 and 10: rest period, post-treatment assessment&#xD;
      2-month follow-up, language assessment, one MRI scan, one EEG-ERP session&#xD;

    <description>During intervention excitatory/anodal tDCS will be administered alongside speech-language therapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks. The exact location of the stimulation and electrode configuration will be targeted individually based on the optimal site identified in fMRI. TDCS will be administered with NeurConn1 Channel DC- Stimulator Plus (neuroCare Group, MÃ¼nchen, Germany) according to established guidelines and procedures. The active tDCS will be delivered for 20 minutes using sponge electrodes with a 30-s ramp-up and ramp-down period</description>

    <description>The sham will be administered alongside speech-language therapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks. For sham, stimulation will be ramped up and then down to 0 milliamperes (mA) in the first minute of stimulation. The sham parameters were chosen based on previous reports that the perceived sensations on the skin, such as tingling, fade out in the first 30 s of tDCS</description>
