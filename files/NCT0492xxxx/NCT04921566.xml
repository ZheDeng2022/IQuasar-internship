    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled (laboratory blinded), randomized, two period, single-center,&#xD;
      crossover, comparative study, where each participant will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference (Toradiur®, 10 mg) or the test (Torasemide, 10 mg) formulation in each period of&#xD;
      study (sequences Test-Reference (TR) or Reference-Test (RT)), in order to evaluate if both&#xD;
      formulations are bioequivalent&#xD;
