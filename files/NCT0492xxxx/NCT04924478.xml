      This study will recruit patients who are being prescribed Mepolizumab as part of their&#xD;
      standard clinical care for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. Over the course of&#xD;
      their treatment, research data (questionnaires) and research samples (blood, breath and&#xD;
      urine) will be collected in parallel to standard clinical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data and samples will be investigated to help better understand how Mepolizumab works,&#xD;
      why it doesn't work in certain patients and why it works very well in others. This will help&#xD;
      prescribers better identify patients that will benefit from Mepolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EVOC4M is a prospective observational study investigating Mepolizumab in the treatment of&#xD;
      severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients receiving Mepolizumab as part of their standard clinical&#xD;
      care in an NHS commissioned Specialised Adult Severe Asthma Service. Over the course of their&#xD;
      treatment, research data (questionnaires) and research samples (blood, breath and urine) will&#xD;
      be collected in parallel to standard clinical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies have demonstrated blood eosinophil levels to be predictive of the magnitude&#xD;
      of the impact of Mepolizumab in reducing severe disease exacerbations but it is appreciated&#xD;
      that there are still treatment failures despite this selection criteria. Clinical decision&#xD;
      and policymaking are increasingly concerned by the health economic implications of these&#xD;
      high-cost therapies and so clinical biomarkers are now being sought for theragnostics:&#xD;
      prediction of treatment response&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will try to identify biomarkers that will can discriminate between those that&#xD;
      respond to Mepolizumab (&quot;responders&quot;) and those that do not (&quot;non-responders&quot;). This will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of how Mepolizumab works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the investigators are interested in exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs),&#xD;
      which are measured in exhaled breath samples. Exhaled breath is safe and easy to collect and&#xD;
      has direct contact with the organ of interest, the airways. A VOC biomarker that predicts&#xD;
      Mepolizumab success may translate to clinical practice.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from University Hospital Southampton (UHS). UHS operates a&#xD;
        regional specialist clinical severe asthma service, prescribing biological therapies,&#xD;
        including Mepolizumab. Patients will be exclusively recruited from a pool of patients&#xD;
        awaiting biological therapies for severe asthma at these centres. Patients are only&#xD;
        eligible for Mepolizumab following NICE mandated multidisciplinary team approval reviewing&#xD;
        biological eligibility, treatment adherence and satisfaction that other co-morbid&#xD;
        conditions have been satisfactorily addressed.&#xD;
