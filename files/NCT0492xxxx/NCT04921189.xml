  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality and neurological outcomes among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors have&#xD;
      not improved despite the medical advances. The whole body ischemia/reperfusion injuries after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest mainly damaged the brain. To improve the neurologic outcome among those&#xD;
      patients, additional interventions would be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combined use of cortisol, ascorbic acid (vitamin C),&#xD;
      and thiamine during the early post-resuscitation period would attenuate the whole-body&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion injuries among the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors treated with&#xD;
      targeted temperature management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality and neurological outcomes among the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors&#xD;
      are still dismal. In addition, the metabolic and oxidative stress can persist or even worsen&#xD;
      at the cellular level after resuscitation, and these whole-body ischemia/reperfusion injuries&#xD;
      contribute to multiple organ failure, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Therefore,&#xD;
      additional interventions to reduces the injuries would be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol has beneficial antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties and stabilizes cellular&#xD;
      membranes exposed to oxidative stress. It also maintains hemodynamic stability and improves&#xD;
      organ function by reducing ischemia/reperfusion injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiamine is a cofactor that acts on enzymes essential for glucose metabolism, the generation&#xD;
      of adenosine triphosphate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production. It&#xD;
      assists the cellular metabolisms and attenuates the potential adverse effect of ascorbic acid&#xD;
      (vitamin C) by preventing the conversion of ascorbic acid into oxalate. Ascorbic acid is a&#xD;
      well-known antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory effects. It acted as an antioxidant defense&#xD;
      substance, reducing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species and improving&#xD;
      microcirculation by limiting oxidative injury and endothelial barrier disruption. The&#xD;
      theoretical and experimental studies suggested the concomitant use of cortisol, thiamine, and&#xD;
      ascorbic acid might have potential treatment synergism for whole-body ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      injuries after cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that their combined use during the early post-resuscitation&#xD;
      period will reduce the whole-body ischemia/reperfusion injuries, especially the brain, in&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted temperature management.&#xD;
