    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if neoadjuvant capmatinib can improve outcomes in&#xD;
      participants with stages I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon 14 mutations and/or&#xD;
      high MET amplification beyond those achieved with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.&#xD;

      This trial is a phase II, two cohort study of neoadjuvant capmatinib treatment (pre-surgery)&#xD;
      which will be given for 8 weeks prior to a surgical resection and then followed by a three&#xD;
      year adjuvant capmatinib treatment (post surgery). Following treatment, there will be a two&#xD;
      year survival follow-up. The two molecularly defined cohorts will be enrolled in parallel.&#xD;
      Approximately 38 evaluable participants will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment participants will visit their treating physician to assess overall health&#xD;
      status which will include lab-work and other safety assessments. Survival follow-up will be&#xD;
      every 6 months which can be conducted via a telephone visit for up to approximately 2 years&#xD;
      after end of treatment.&#xD;
