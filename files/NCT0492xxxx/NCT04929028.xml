      This phase II trial studies the side effects of chemotherapy and intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy in treating patients with low-risk HIV-associated anal cancer, and&#xD;
      nivolumab after standard of care chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      high-risk HIV-associated anal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and&#xD;
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab after standard&#xD;
      of care chemotherapy and radiation therapy may help reduce the risk of the tumor coming back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of reduced intensity chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) in low-risk&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety of nivolumab after standard CRT in high-risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy (2-year disease-control rate [DCR]) of reduced intensity CRT in&#xD;
      low risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the efficacy (2-year disease-free survival [DFS] rate) of nivolumab after&#xD;
      standard CRT in high risk disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of CRT on immune function (CD4+ cell count) and human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of nivolumab on immune function (CD4+ cell count) and HIV viral&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) adherence before, during, and after&#xD;
      treatment with CRT and nivolumab to identify potential barriers to cART adherence when&#xD;
      receiving concurrent oncological care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype in primary tumor and explore the&#xD;
      relationship between specific HPV subtypes and clinical response to reduced intensity CRT or&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between expression of PD-1 in immune cells and PD-L1 in&#xD;
      immune cells or cancer epithelial cells in the primary diagnostic tumor and clinical response&#xD;
      to nivolumab or reduced intensity CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the effects of reduced intensity CRT and nivolumab on viral HIV reservoirs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify the presence of cell-free plasma HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) before and&#xD;
      after reduced intensity CRT and nivolumab and explore the relationship with clinical&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe the effect of reduced intensity CRT on quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOW-RISK STRATUM: Patients receive mitomycin IV on day 1 and either fluorouracil IV on day 1&#xD;
      or capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Monday-Friday until the completion of&#xD;
      radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients also undergo&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) for 20-23 treatment sessions&#xD;
      over 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for&#xD;
      years 1-2, every 6 months for year 3, and then annually for years 4-5.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Participant is able to understand and willing to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Participant must have histologically proven stage (T3-T4N0M0 OR&#xD;
             T2-4N1M0) invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus or anorectum as&#xD;
             documented before CRT initiation, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
             (AJCC) 8th edition. Participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal margin are&#xD;
             eligible if there is evidence of extension of the primary tumor into the anal canal.&#xD;
             Participants with tumors of non-keratinizing histology such as basaloid, transitional&#xD;
             cell or cloacogenic histology are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: HIV-positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one&#xD;
             of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a licensed health care&#xD;
                  provider. If the record contains information that the patient is taking Food and&#xD;
                  Drug Administration (FDA)-approved combination therapy for HIV infection, then&#xD;
                  this can be part of the record substantiating the HIV positive diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay&#xD;
                  demonstrating &gt; 1000 RNA copies/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay&#xD;
                  confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot&#xD;
                  confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a kit that has been certified or&#xD;
                       licensed by an oversight body within the participating country and validated&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
                       Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result&#xD;
                       must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial&#xD;
                       assessment. A reactive initial rapid test must be confirmed by either&#xD;
                       another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen&#xD;
                       preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
                       competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
                  nivolumab in participants &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
                  study&#xD;

          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) must agree to follow&#xD;
             contraception requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
                  reason and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
                  teratogenic, FOCBP must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
                  method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
                  study participation and 5 months after completion of nivolumab administration.&#xD;
                  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  NOTE: A female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual&#xD;
                       orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the&#xD;
                       following criteria: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not&#xD;
                       undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been&#xD;

                       out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has&#xD;
                       had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIGH-RISK STRATUM: Participant must have a CD4 count of &gt;= 100 cells/uL at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment OR &gt;= 100 cells/uL before receiving prior CRT, as CD4 may be&#xD;
             low due to the effects of CRT&#xD;

             the margins were positive, and/or if the stage is T2N0 based on tumor size before the&#xD;
             procedure. This means that participants with T1N0M0 anal margin squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma who underwent surgical excision with negative margins and no involvement of&#xD;
             the anal verge and/or anal canal are not eligible Baseline imaging including,&#xD;
             fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and A/P C+CT must be&#xD;

             central review (including discrepancies between local read and central review) will be&#xD;
             returned to the site within 5 business days of submission, allowing participants with&#xD;
             imaging suspicious for lymph node (LN) involvement determined by central review to&#xD;
             undergo a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy at their local center confirming&#xD;
