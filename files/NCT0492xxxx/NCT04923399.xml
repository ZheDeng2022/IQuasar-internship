  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is a type of neuropathic pain that brings great physical and&#xD;
      psychological pressure to patients. Chronic pain can cause changes in the composition of&#xD;
      central and peripheral body fluids, and these changes may be useful for the prediction and&#xD;
      treatment of pain. In this study, the whole blood of patients with trigeminal neuralgia and&#xD;
      non-chronic pain was collected, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to&#xD;
      determine the peripheral transcriptome changes of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) patients. And&#xD;
      compare the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of TN and&#xD;
      non-chronic pain patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is a kind of paroxysmal, knife-cutting, stubborn and severe pain in the&#xD;
      facial distribution area of the trigeminal nerve caused by slight stimulation, which brings a&#xD;
      great physical and psychological burden to the patient. Chronic pain can cause changes in the&#xD;
      composition of central and peripheral body fluids, and these changes are very useful for the&#xD;
      prediction and treatment of pain. In this study, the whole blood of patients with trigeminal&#xD;
      neuralgia and non-chronic pain was collected for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)&#xD;
      sequencing. The results of transcriptome sequencing can derive the differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes in the whole blood of TN patients and the pathways enriched by differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes. At the same time, NPY (Neuropeptide y) plays an important role in head and face pain.&#xD;
      We will also verify the difference in NPY expression in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of&#xD;
      TN and non-chronic pain patients, and the correlation between NPY expression and pain.&#xD;
