  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States is battling dual pandemics: healthcare provider (HCP) exhaustion and&#xD;
      COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic death toll has surpassed 595,000 and continues to climb as&#xD;
      the worldwide outbreak continues. Moreover, we have yet to understand the health impacts of&#xD;
      &quot;long-COVID&quot;. As evidenced by the national burnout epidemic in HCPs, persistent workplace&#xD;
      stress not only impacts personal provider wellbeing, but also influences effective practice&#xD;
      and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, we propose a 4-year, multi-site, four-arm parallel-group randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) comparing 2 non-pharmacological interventions: Transcendental Meditation&#xD;
      (TM) and Experience Resolution Methodology (ERM) to Treatment as Usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study lasts up to 24 months for enrolled participants and is considered&#xD;
      minimal risks.&#xD;

      The United States is battling dual pandemics: healthcare provider (HCP) exhaustion and&#xD;
      COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic death toll has surpassed 595,000 and continues to climb as&#xD;
      the worldwide outbreak continues. Moreover, we have yet to understand the health impacts of&#xD;
      &quot;long-COVID&quot;. Taxed with an overloaded healthcare system, longer shifts, disrupted work-life&#xD;
      balance, and the responsibility to uphold biosecurity with limited personal protective&#xD;
      equipment (PPE), frontline HCPs are experiencing unprecedented levels of distress. A major&#xD;
      and shared anxiety among HCPs is the fear of propagating the disease to their coworkers and&#xD;
      their families. As evidenced by the national burnout epidemic in HCPs, persistent workplace&#xD;
      stress not only impacts personal provider wellbeing, but also influences effective practice&#xD;
      and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National institutes, such as the Joint Commission, are calling for the prioritization of&#xD;
      healthcare workforce resilience in an effort to protect against rapid turnover, medical&#xD;
      errors and suboptimal patient care. Resilience is defined as the &quot;ability to respond to&#xD;
      stress in a healthy, adaptive way, such that goals are met with minimal psychologic and&#xD;
      physical cost&quot;. However, the major obstacle to systematically addressing HCPs burnout and&#xD;
      building a resilience-based workforce is the sparsity of data on qualitative, physiologic,&#xD;
      and biological predictors of resilience and evidence-based preventative, diagnostic, and&#xD;
      treatment strategies. At this point, most health care institutions, if they are addressing&#xD;
      burnout and resilience at all, offer a form of executive coaching. However, there is limited&#xD;
      systematic evidence to support benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, we propose a 4-year, multi-site, four-arm parallel-group randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) that will be operationalized via three distinct aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To assess the efficacy of 1) Transcendental Meditation® (TM®) versus Treatment as&#xD;
           Usual (TAU), 2) a form of coaching termed Experience Resolution Methodology (ERM) versus&#xD;
           TAU, and 3) TM plus ERM versus TAU in increasing resilience and reducing burnout&#xD;
           syndrome in HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To characterize the biometric, immunologic, and neuro-functional characteristics&#xD;
           of HCPs' resilience and burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To develop a medical predictive model and a composite resilience and burnout&#xD;
           index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the term &quot;health care provider&quot; (HCP) will be all inclusive of any individual&#xD;
      working in a health care setting with patient-facing responsibilities in addition to&#xD;
      physician and physician trainees.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MBI consists of 3 scales to assess emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment with higher scores reflecting greater burnout. The MBI is composed of 22 items, each rated on a scale of 0 to 6, 0 being equivalent to &quot;never&quot; and 6 being equivalent to &quot;every day.&quot; The lower scores reflect greater burnout.</description>
