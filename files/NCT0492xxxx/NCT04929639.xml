  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity is a global health problem that concerns the whole world. It is associated&#xD;
      with many concomitant health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart&#xD;
      failure. There are publications showing that morbid obesity increases chronic intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure, and it has been investigated that this chronic pressure exposure may cause many&#xD;
      comorbidities accompanying obesity. When we reviewed the literature, we could not find an&#xD;
      adequate study showing the effects of obesity-related increased intra-abdominal pressure on&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show the effect of obesity-related intra-abdominal pressure on&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and morbidity.&#xD;

      Our study included 80 female patients with ASA (American Society of Anesthesia) II-III, who&#xD;
      were planned to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gasterctomy or bypass operation after ethics&#xD;
      committee approval. BMI (body Mass Index)&gt; 35, 18-65 years old, female, non-smoker, not&#xD;
      undergoing revisional bariatric surgery, and not undergoing major abdominal surgery before&#xD;
      were included. Propofol 2mg/kg, Remifentanil 1mcg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6mg/kg were&#xD;
      administered to the patients by monitoring with ECG, pulse oximetry and non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement, which we performed in bariatric surgery patients in our clinic. The&#xD;
      corrected weights of the patients were used in dose calculations as recommended by the&#xD;
      Society of Bariatric Anesthesia. Immediately after intubation, while the patient was lying in&#xD;
      the supine position, intra-abdominal measurement was taken from the bladder catheter and&#xD;
      recorded. Then, after the surgical site antisepsis, when the trocar required for the&#xD;
      operation was placed by the general surgeon, another measurement was made from the trocar&#xD;
      port. The measurements were recorded. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      maintenance fluids, and complications were recorded every 5 minutes intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Postoperative hospital stay of the patients, urine output, onset time of bowel movements, and&#xD;
      all complications were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS 21.0 computer program was used for statistical analysis. The normality of the&#xD;
      distribution of the data was evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Intergroup data will&#xD;
      be evaluated by one-way ANOVA, and in-group data will be evaluated with repetitive ANOVA&#xD;
      test. Chi-square was used in the analysis of ordinal data. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered as a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference. The sample size was calculated as 80 patients at 90%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
