  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The product innovation is a wearable device that (combined with a smartphone and back-end&#xD;
      analytics system) acts as a sensor, processor and actuator, and is therefore designed to&#xD;
      identify critical parameters (Kangaroo Mother Care adherence and temperature of neonate on a&#xD;
      24/7 basis and temperature of mother during these episodes), make intelligent and early&#xD;
      diagnosis of (persistent or impending) neonatal hypothermia, maternal/neonatal fever and&#xD;
      non-adherence to Kangaroo Mother Care and then trigger audio or visual alerts (via the&#xD;
      wearable or smart-mobile phone) for action by the care-giver or front-line healthcare worker&#xD;
      to enhance Kangaroo Mother Care duration or referral to a health facility as needed.&#xD;

      Project design and implementation plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The logic model envisioned in this study as i) wearable sensors, technology design and&#xD;
      development with research team personnel as 'inputs'; ii) data analytics deployment with&#xD;
      detection of abnormalities as 'processes'; and iii) feedback alerts appraisal as the&#xD;
      'outputs' for this phase of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan comprises of two steps: a non-clinical phase and a clinical phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The non-clinical phase comprises of the design, development and deployment of the data&#xD;
      capture and analytics system. This includes mobile phone app building with features such as&#xD;
      push notifications, offline data storage and synchronization on connectivity, local data&#xD;
      analysis (with sequentially increasing capabilities as more data comes in) and alerting&#xD;
      stakeholders. In addition, capability development of primary nodes for temporary storage and&#xD;
      real-time data analysis as also for long-term data storage capabilities that could be scaled&#xD;
      to district-level and state-level expansion in future will be done. Data monitoring capacity&#xD;
      will be built on real-time visualization dashboards and raising alerts for targeted&#xD;
      stakeholders. The entire computational hardware, algorithms/AI engine, network architecture,&#xD;
      overall data visualization including heat maps (infrastructure) for this proposed study will&#xD;
      be developed by industry experts (will be subcontracted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii)In the second phase, it is proposed to undertake a technological-feasibility study as a&#xD;
      small-scale clinical trial (in a convenient sample of 20 mother-baby pairs) for testing in&#xD;
      real-world conditions while the mother-infant pairs are in the hospital for a few days and&#xD;
      when they are discharged for follow-up at home for up to a week. This phase will also include&#xD;
      a qualitative research component to study acceptability and feasibility of alerting and&#xD;
      actionable advisories sent to care-givers and field staff. All data obtained from this&#xD;
      program will reside within dedicated servers with storage facilities within the selected&#xD;
      hospital from where mother-infant pairs are recruited. Institutional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      approval, clinical trial registration and data safety monitoring board constitution will be&#xD;
      undertaken to protect human research participants.&#xD;
