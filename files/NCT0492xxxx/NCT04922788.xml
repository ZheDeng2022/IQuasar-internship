  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of&#xD;
      Nanocovax vaccine in volunteer subjects 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, adaptive, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Nanocovax vaccine against COVID-19&#xD;
      in volunteer subjects 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age stratified as 18-45, 45-60, and &gt; 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of immunogenicity will be further expanded in a subset of Phase 3 (1000&#xD;
      participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo group with a ratio of 2:1 (2 subjects injected with&#xD;
      Nanocovax 25 mcg : 1 subject injected with placebo).&#xD;
