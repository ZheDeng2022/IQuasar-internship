      1. Study name: Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)&#xD;
           with Amlodipine on ventricular remodeling in hypertension and left ventricular&#xD;
           hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medicine: sacubitril/valsartan (ARNI, 200mg tablet) and the matching placebo; amlodipine&#xD;
           (5mg tablet) and the matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale: according to the results of previous clinical studies, ARNI has obvious&#xD;
           advantages in improving cardiac remodeling and reducing blood pressure. However, there&#xD;
           is no evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of ARNI in reducing blood pressure and&#xD;
           improving ventricular remodeling in hypertension patients with left ventricular&#xD;
           hypertrophy (LVH) compared with calcium channel blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: to demonstrate the superior efficacy of ARNI on improvement of LVH and blood&#xD;
           pressure control compared with amlodipine in hypertension patients with LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study design: This study This is a 24-week prospective, randomized, active-controlled,&#xD;
           double-blind, multi-center study, with two equally sized treatment groups:&#xD;
           sacubitril/valsartan (200mg tablet); amlodipine (5mg tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: men or women aged over 18 years; Untreated patients or patients with&#xD;
           taking single antihypertensive drugs; Essential mild to moderate hypertension;&#xD;
           Echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: Eligible patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups,&#xD;
           taking one pill of sacubitril/valsartan (200mg tablet) + one pill of matching placebo of&#xD;
           amlodipine daily, or one pill of amlodipine (5 mg/tablet) + one pill of matching placebo&#xD;
           of sacubitril/valsartan daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: after meeting the inclusion criteria, there will be 2-week placebo run-in.&#xD;
           Then patients will be randomly assigned into ARNI group and amlodipine group. There will&#xD;
           be 5 visiting points in the treatment period, which will be the 4th week, 8th week, 12th&#xD;
           week, 18th week and 24th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size: 120 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Timeline: After obtaining the approval of Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital in April&#xD;
           2021, recruitment will start. Patients enrollment and follow-up will be performed&#xD;
           between June 2021 to June 2022.&#xD;

           double-blind, multi-center study, with two equally sized treatment groups:&#xD;
           sacubitril/valsartan (200mg tablet); amlodipine (5mg tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: men or women aged over 18 years will be screened for hypertension and&#xD;
           LVH. Eligible patients should be untreated patients or patients with taking single&#xD;
           antihypertensive drugs with essential mild to moderate hypertension (clinic systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure ≥ 140 and &lt; 180mmHg), and echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH (LVMI:&#xD;
           male≥115g/m2, female≥ 95g/m2). Patients should have abilities to understand the study&#xD;
           requirements and provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: After screening period and run-in period by centers,&#xD;
           eligible patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, taking one pill of&#xD;
           sacubitril/valsartan (200mg tablet) + one pill of matching placebo of amlodipine daily,&#xD;
           or one pill of amlodipine (5 mg/tablet) + one pill of matching placebo of&#xD;
           sacubitril/valsartan daily. At the 12th week of treatment, if systolic blood pressure ≥&#xD;
           120 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg and no safety problems, dosage titration&#xD;
           (sacubitril/valsartan 200mg QD to 400mg QD, amlodipine 5mg QD to 10mg QD) should be&#xD;
           conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: after meeting the inclusion criteria, there will be 2-week placebo run-in.&#xD;
           Clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, echocardiography, NT proBNP,&#xD;
           myocardial fibrosis index, concomitant medication records and adverse event records will&#xD;
           be collected at randomization/the end of run-in period. Then patients will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned into ARNI group and amlodipine group. The treatment will be observed for 24&#xD;
           weeks. There will be 5 visiting points in the treatment period, which will be the 4th&#xD;
           week, 8th week, 12th week, 18th week and 24th week. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was&#xD;
           detected at randomization, the 12th week and 24th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size: At least 60 eligible patients should be enrolled in each group, and a total&#xD;
           of 120 patients should be enrolled in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Timeline: After obtaining the approval of Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital in April&#xD;
           2021, recruitment will start. Patients enrollment and follow-up will be performed&#xD;
           between June 2021 to June 2022.&#xD;
