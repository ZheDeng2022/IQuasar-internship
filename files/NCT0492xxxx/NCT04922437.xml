      PURPOSE. To compare the results between two sites of implantation of the continent&#xD;
      catheterizable channel (CCC): native bladder or enterocystoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. Retrospective monocentric study of pediatrics and adult patients who underwent a&#xD;
      continent cystostomy between 1991 and 2020 with a continent catheterizable channel implanted&#xD;
      in the native bladder's detrusor (D group) or the enterocystoplasty (EC group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric and retrospective study involving adult and pediatric population who&#xD;
      underwent the creation of a CCC between June 1991 and January 2020. Two different surgical&#xD;
      techniques were performed: on the first hand, the implantation of the channel in the native&#xD;
      bladder's detrusor (D group), on the other hand the implantation of the channel by&#xD;
      seromuscular plicature on the anterior wall of the enterocystoplasty (EC group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCC were made from the appendix, an ileal or sigmoid segment, an ureter or a skin flap.&#xD;
      Bladder augmentation and cervicoplasty (Kropp, Kurzrock, Young-Dees, artificial urinary&#xD;
      sphincter, sling suspension of the bladder neck, closure of the bladder neck) were frequently&#xD;
      associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following informations were obtained in all included patients by charts reviews: age at&#xD;
      surgery, gender, main underlying pathology, details of operative reports with the type of&#xD;
      channel, bladder augmentation and/or associated cervicoplasty, early postoperative&#xD;
      complications, complications appearing during the follow up period and the requirement of&#xD;
      surgical or non-surgical revision, finally the channel continence at the last follow up.&#xD;
