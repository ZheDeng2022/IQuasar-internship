      CLINATEZO cohort will evaluate overall survival, real world progression-free survival, best&#xD;
      response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (SCLC) who received atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy part of the French Early&#xD;
      Access Program (ATU). Subsequent treatments (treatment delivered immediately after treatment&#xD;
      with atezolizumab and chemotherapy) will be recorded. Those outcomes will be correlated to&#xD;
      clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard-of-care first-line treatment for advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer is&#xD;
      platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) with etoposide. Despite response rates of 60&#xD;
      to 65%, limited progress has been made in more than two decades; outcomes remain poor, with a&#xD;
      median overall survival of approximately 10 months. Small cell lung cancer has a high&#xD;
      mutation burden, which suggests that these tumors may be immunogenic and could respond to&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that&#xD;
      inhibits PD-L1-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1-B7-1 signaling and restores tumor-specific&#xD;
      T-cell immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced,&#xD;
      metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer has been granted access for patients in France part of an&#xD;
      Early access program (ATU), in May 2019.&#xD;
