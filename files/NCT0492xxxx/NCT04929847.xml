  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Notwithstanding the continuous progress in cancer treatment, patients with cancer still have&#xD;
      to cope with quality of life (QoL) - impairing complications. Especially an extensive&#xD;
      spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with cancer treatments. The number&#xD;
      and type of cutaneous toxicities have evolved over the past 50 years, paralleling the&#xD;
      development of new chemotherapeutic agents. The chemotherapy-related skin toxicities can&#xD;
      significantly impede the patient's emotional, physical, social, and financial well-being&#xD;
      resulting in a poor QoL. In rare cases of severe cutaneous reactions, treatment modifications&#xD;
      are needed, resulting in a diminished overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important organizations in the field of oncology and supportive care, such as the MASCC, the&#xD;
      ASCO, and the ESMO, have developed guidelines for the management of cancer therapy- related&#xD;
      cutaneous toxicities based on available scientific evidence. Still, for some interventions,&#xD;
      the evidence of recommendation is moderate to insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to&#xD;
      elucidate other new potential management strategies for dermatological complications of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. Based on the previously mentioned supportive care guidelines for the&#xD;
      ChemoSkin project, a novel emollient to tackle the cutaneous adverse events of chemotherapy&#xD;
      has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ChemoSkin project general aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel skincare product to&#xD;
      manage chemotherapy-related cutaneous toxicities.&#xD;
