  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sex gap in alcohol consumption is closing rapidly, due to alarming increases among women.&#xD;
      From 2002-2013, Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) increased 84% for women, compared to 35% for men.&#xD;
      As such, there is an urgent need to determine the factors underlying sex differences in risk&#xD;
      for AUD. Current addiction models propose three domains that drive problematic alcohol use&#xD;
      and serve as candidate sex-specific risk factors: executive function, negative emotionality,&#xD;
      and incentive salience. Data suggest that poor inhibitory control, a key component of&#xD;
      executive function, is a stronger risk factor for women than for men. Moreover, there is have&#xD;
      preliminary evidence that female drinkers show less engagement of neural inhibitory&#xD;
      circuitry, and that this sex difference is influenced by estradiol. However, the degree to&#xD;
      which hormonally-moderated sex differences in executive function extend to the negative&#xD;
      emotionality and incentive salience domains, and how these sex differences influence current&#xD;
      and future drinking is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms underlying sex-specific risk for AUD,&#xD;
      and ultimately to help develop sex-specific prevention and treatment efforts. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to determine the neural and hormonal factors contributing to&#xD;
      sex-specific risk for AUD in three addiction domains: inhibitory control (executive&#xD;
      function), negative emotionality, and alcohol cue reactivity (incentive salience).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete three experimental sessions. In each session, participants will provide detailed reports of their alcohol consumption over the past five days, and they will provide a blood sample for hormone assays. They will perform tasks during fMRI to assess each of the neurofunctional addiction domains: inhibitory control, negative emotionality, and cue reactivity. Following the fMRI scan, subjects will self-administer intravenous alcohol to provide a controlled assessment of pharmacologically-driven alcohol consumption.</description>
