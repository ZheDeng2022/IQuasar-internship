    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5% to 10% of differentiated thyroid cancers become resistant to standard treatment with&#xD;
      radioactive iodine. In these cases, treatment options are limited and generally not&#xD;
      effective. Researchers want to see if they can better detect thyroid tumors by using a&#xD;
      compound called 68Gallium-DOTATATE. This compound may bind to a tumor and make it visible&#xD;
      during a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. This information&#xD;
      might help guide future research and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the people with thyroid cancer whose tumors have a high uptake of&#xD;
      68Gallium-DOTATATE as analyzed by imaging with PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 years and older with thyroid cancer that has spread outside of the thyroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. Some samples&#xD;
      will be used for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have imaging scans that follow standard of care. These scans may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, spine, or liver&#xD;
&#xD;
      18-FDG-PET/CT as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a PET/CT scan. They will get an intravenous (IV) line. They will get&#xD;
      an IV injection of 68Gallium-DOTATATE. It contains radioactive tracers. The PET/CT scanner is&#xD;
      shaped like a large donut. It contains crystals. The crystals pick up small radiation signals&#xD;
      that are given off by the tracers. The CT part of the scan uses low-dose x-rays. The pictures&#xD;
      made by the scanner show where the tracers are in the body. The session will last 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 3 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is designed to identify the patients with metastatic radioactive iodine (RAI)&#xD;
      non-avid or non-responsive thyroid cancer RAI non-responsive Hurthle cell thyroid cancer&#xD;
      (HTC), differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC),&#xD;
      whose tumors are&#xD;
&#xD;
      characterized by a high expression of somatostatin receptors type 2 (SSTR2) by a one-time&#xD;
      experimental imaging using 68Gallium(68Ga)-DOTATATE Positron Emission Tomography/Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT) scan. Participants will also undergo standard of care imaging per ATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      guidelines. Both the experimental 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan and the standard of care imaging&#xD;
      will be performed within a 3 month timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to compare the prevalence of patients with metastatic RAI-non-avid or&#xD;
      RAI-non-responsive thyroid cancer whose tumors are characterized by a high SSTR2 expression&#xD;
      by imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT between three groups: (1) Group HTC - the molecularly&#xD;
      and&#xD;
&#xD;
      histologically unique subtype of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) - Hurthle cell thyroid&#xD;
      cancer (HTC), (2) Group DTC - patients with remaining histological types of DTC, and (3)&#xD;
      Group MTC -- patients with metastatic thyroid cancer of neuroendocrine origin - medullary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      (MTC). The Second goal of this study is to analyze the associate between the 68Ga-DOTATATE&#xD;
      uptake and molecular signature of thryoid cancer and tumor volume, and to create a repository&#xD;
      of data for future research in thyroid cancer.&#xD;
