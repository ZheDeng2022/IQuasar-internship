  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is one of the more common soft tissue sarcomas (STS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients presenting with large, high-grade, localized LMS are at significant risk of&#xD;
           developing metastasis following curative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical trials of neoadjuvant or adjuvant anthracycline and ifosfamide have suggested&#xD;
           that patients with localized STS who are at high-risk of metastasis may benefit from&#xD;
           chemotherapy, but the magnitude of benefit in unselected patient population is&#xD;
           relatively small.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, patient age, and tumor size and grade are used to assess risk of metastases&#xD;
           and survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies evaluating tumor response by imaging and histopathology have not established&#xD;
           correlation between tumor characteristics as biomarkers for risk of metastasis or&#xD;
           sarcoma recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is present in blood of patients with advanced/metastatic&#xD;
           LMS and may serve as biomarker of tumor response to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A biomarker of tumor response and patient survival benefit from chemotherapy early in&#xD;
           the course of chemotherapy would be of significant impact in treatment planning.&#xD;
