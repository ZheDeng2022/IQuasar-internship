      The project will be properly embedded in the clinical practice landscape to both provide a&#xD;
      real-world context for research requirements gathering and research result assessment, and a&#xD;
      practical application context from the industrial perspective. The landing is planned for&#xD;
      cardiology solutions as carotid plaque assessment that can be value-adding features to tackle&#xD;
      the current challenges of stroke prediction. The development of stroke prediction model could&#xD;
      accelerate the R&amp;D process and land to key market ultrasound prototypes/products in an agile&#xD;
      way. Collaboration and alignment with key market business and R&amp;D (China Digital Innovation&#xD;

      Stroke is a global disease with high mortality and disability. Evaluation of the stability of&#xD;
      carotid plaque has important clinical significance for stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a practical, fast, non-invasive, non-radiative inspection technique, ultrasound is widely&#xD;
      used in the evaluation of carotid plaque stability. There are many methods for evaluating the&#xD;
      stability of carotid plaque by ultrasound. The texture features extracted from&#xD;
      two-dimensional ultrasound images can be used to quantify subtle differences in follow up&#xD;
      scanning. The elastography of the plaques can be used to quantify changes in the elastic&#xD;
      properties of reactive plaques. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be used to quantify&#xD;
      the density of microvessels. However, the results obtained by these different methods are&#xD;
      biased and show poor agreement. We lack a unified, systematic evaluation system and objective&#xD;
      guideline for plaque stability assessment. In this context, the topic of plaque stability&#xD;
      assessment has been intensively explored by researchers from all over the world. Based on&#xD;
      state-of-the-art assessment, we found that some plaques that were judged stable on ultrasound&#xD;
      did eventually rupture. On the contrary, some unstable plaques on ultrasound did not cause&#xD;
      stroke. This confusion indicates that plaque rupture is not only related to its intrinsic&#xD;
      characteristics, such as size, shape, composition etc., but also to external factors such as&#xD;
      biomechanics, strain, flow field, etc.. In order to achieve a better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathological plaque behaviour, it is necessary to study the hemodynamic problems in the&#xD;
      arteries, such as wall shear stress, flow separation, and secondary flow. The recent rapid&#xD;
      developments in artificial-intelligence techniques have been widely used in medical imaging&#xD;
      and image analysis. These techniques allow supervised learning taking full advantage of the&#xD;
      available big data. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to use artificial&#xD;
      intelligence technique to i) evaluate a number of indicators including plaque histology,&#xD;
      hemodynamics, etc., ii) establish a uniform and quantitative criteria for judging the&#xD;
      stability of carotid plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key scientific problem to be solved in this project is to establish an objective model&#xD;
      for predicting the risk of carotid plaque rupture for clinical decisionmaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be mainly divided into three main modules: database establishment, model training and&#xD;
      clinical validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Database establishment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtaining clinical information of the patients from the electronic medical record&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use of image analysis techniques in ultrasound images to study the relationship between&#xD;
           different image texture parameters and plaque histological composition. A method for&#xD;
           evaluating the stability of carotid plaque based on texture parameters will be&#xD;
           established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of ultrasound (shear-wave) elastography to establish a method for assessing the&#xD;
           carotid-plaque vulnerability based on the assessment of tissue elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Combining carotid velocity vector imaging with the blood-flow vortex manipulation&#xD;
           technique to achieve an accurate measurement of the central position of the vulnerable&#xD;
           plaque blood flow vortex and the orbital angular momentum, providing a new technique for&#xD;
           vulnerable plaque detection based on vortex vector blood flow. Block detection new&#xD;
           technology. The biomechanical characteristics of arterial plaques will be evaluated by&#xD;
           detecting the synchrony and coordination of the arterial wall. The relationship between&#xD;
           the biomechanical characteristics and stability of different types of plaques in the&#xD;
           cardiac cycle will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use of quantitative CEUS analysis and localization microscopy to study the relationship&#xD;
           between CEUS and neovascularization in carotid plaques, focusing on the influence of&#xD;
           microvessel density, architecture, and other quantitative features extracted from CEUS.&#xD;
           Based on these features, a prediction model for plaque rupture will be designed and&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Use of computational fluid dynamics modeling to study the effects of geometrical changes&#xD;
           on local hemodynamics and blood component concentration distribution during plaque&#xD;
           growth. Further analysis of the growth mechanism of plaque and its effect on&#xD;
           hemodynamics will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Deep-learning model After obtaining all the parameters mentioned above, the correlation&#xD;
      between these parameters and carotid plaque stability will be studied through machine&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A machine-learning classifier will be designed that takes the extracted features as input.&#xD;
      Feature selection will be implemented through k-fold cross-validation to identify the set of&#xD;
      complementary features that most contribute to assess plaque stability and predict plaque&#xD;
      rupture. In particular, we aim at predicting whether a stroke will occur within 1 year. When&#xD;
      sufficient data is available, a deep convolutional neural network will also be designed and&#xD;
      trained to learn the prediction model. In this process, the risk of overfitting will be&#xD;
      carefully considered by evaluating the classification performance over training, test, and&#xD;
      validation sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the model complexity will be adjusted to the available training sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. clinical evaluation The validation of the developed stroke prediction model from rupture&#xD;
      of carotid plaques will be extended to a number of hospitals. The model reliability and&#xD;
      usability will be tested. Model update and improvement is envisaged in a cyclic fashion,&#xD;
      profiting from clinical results and feedback. The accuracy rate auxiliary decision support is&#xD;
      expected to levels that are not lower than 90%.&#xD;

        According to previous research and experience, the percentage of neovascularization grade&#xD;
        II and above accounted for about 79% of all plaques in the enrolled patients,&#xD;
        neovascularization grade I accounted for 21%, neovascularization grade II predicted the&#xD;
        recurrence of stroke in the same basin 10%, neovascularization I The recurrence rate of&#xD;
        stroke in the same watershed below grade is 6%, and the sample size is calculated to be&#xD;
        about 100 cases. Gray-scale ultrasound shows the presence or absence of hypoechoic and&#xD;
        iso-echoic, calcified nodules and other characteristics. The loss to follow-up rate is&#xD;
        calculated as 10-15%. This study intends to include 2000 patients with acute anterior&#xD;
        circulation ischemic stroke. A total of 100 patients were enrolled in this research center.&#xD;
