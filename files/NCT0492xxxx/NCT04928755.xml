  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims: To increase the number of patients that benefit from Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SABR) for lung cancer using new treatment methods that reduce the amount of non-cancer&#xD;
      tissue receiving a high radiation dose without affecting tumour dose coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: SABR is a treatment for lung cancer which offers major advantages over&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy. It is a more precise highly effective treatment with significantly&#xD;
      improved treatment outcomes (greater elimination of cancer cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SABR requires high doses per treatment so extreme accuracy is required to minimise healthy&#xD;
      tissue damage. Normal breathing results in significant tumour movement, therefore to avoid&#xD;
      missing the tumour, larger volumes need to be treated, resulting in more good tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UK Standard practice requires the tumour to be irradiated in all positions during breathing&#xD;
      whilst the new approach targets the tumours at the position it spends most time to minimise&#xD;
      normal tissue affected by radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice for SABR patients would be improved (fewer severe radiation side-effects)&#xD;
      and potentially could become a viable treatment for high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 30 SABR patients receiving current standard SABR treatment will be recruited. This&#xD;
      is an observation study in which patients will continue to receive standard of care but in&#xD;
      addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A camera will be used to make videos of how the patient's chest moves in 3D at CT and&#xD;
           treatment. I will build a complex mathematical model that infers movement of the tumour&#xD;
           from movement of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their breathing patterns, corresponding tumour motions and treatments plans will be&#xD;
           utilised to develop a method for safely implementing the new treatment approach.&#xD;
