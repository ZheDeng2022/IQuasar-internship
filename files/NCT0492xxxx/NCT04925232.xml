  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility of the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) for symptoms associated with Visual Snow syndrome (VS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will gather information about the treatment of up to 10 people with VS using rTMS.&#xD;
      Treated participants will undergo 10 sessions of rTMS administered 5 times a week over 2&#xD;
      weeks. All visits will take place in the University of Colorado School of Medicine&#xD;
      NeuroMag/Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation laboratory on University of Colorado Anschutz&#xD;
      Medical Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims for this feasibility study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether any participant experiences untoward effects of rTMS in the setting of&#xD;
           visual snow syndrome and determine the potential drop-out rate of larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the performance of a novel scale (Colorado Visual Snow Scale) and two three&#xD;
           psychophysical visual processing tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine the standard deviation and test-retest reliability for the novel scale&#xD;
                and two visual processing tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determine whether the visual processing tasks perform similar to performance found&#xD;
                by the developer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe changes in outcome measures between pre- and post-treatment with rTMS&#xD;
