  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial fractures make up a significant proportion of injuries in trauma patients (1, 2).&#xD;
      Approximately 3 million individuals suffer craniofacial trauma in the United States on a&#xD;
      yearly basis, and approximately 50% of all wounds presenting to emergency rooms involve the&#xD;
      head and neck (1, 2). Treatment of these fractures often results in standard surgical&#xD;
      interventions. While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its efficacy is well accepted today (3). Previous&#xD;
      research work showed that the administration of antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight&#xD;
      hours after the intervention reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial&#xD;
      fractures from 42.2% to 8.9% (4). However there is still no consensus about the duration of&#xD;
      the postoperative administration. In literature postoperative prophylaxis in facial fractures&#xD;
      varies from single-shot up to duration of 7 and even ten days postoperatively. The use of&#xD;
      antibiotics can be associated with allergic or toxic reactions, adverse effects, drug&#xD;
      interactions and increasing bacterial resistance (5). In addition some authors assume that a&#xD;
      prolonged administration of antibiotics might increase the risk of infectious complications&#xD;
      via superinfection. On the other hand a short term or single shot administration might not be&#xD;
      enough to prevent the onset of a postoperative infection. Up to date there is no standard to&#xD;
      support the duration of antibiotic administration after surgical repair of a facial fracture.&#xD;
      In this proposal, Investigators are aiming to investigate if either the utility of&#xD;
      antibiotics administered for 3 days or 5 days make a difference in the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      after facial fractures.&#xD;

      This proposed research is a retrospective chart review to examine if either the utility of&#xD;
      antibiotics administered for 3 days or 5 days make a difference in the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      after facial fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records of trauma patients who were admitted to Methodist Health System (MHS) between&#xD;
      January1st 2010 and December 31st 2015 will be retrieved to review the clinical charts&#xD;
      according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be segregated in to two groups according to the duration of antibiotic use,&#xD;
      group 1 (less than 3days) and group 2 (5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographics and clinical outcomes parameters as noted above will be attained from the&#xD;
      patient's medical records.&#xD;
