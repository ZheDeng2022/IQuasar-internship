  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androcur is a type of treatment called cyproterone acetate (CPA). Androcur and other CPA&#xD;
      treatments work by blocking a group of male sex hormones called androgens in the body. It can&#xD;
      be given to men and women to treat conditions that are caused by higher levels of androgens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAs, including androcur, are currently available as treatments for doctors to give to&#xD;
      patients who have these types of conditions. But, in a study, researchers found that&#xD;
      participants had a certain medical problem when they took CPAs for a long time. This medical&#xD;
      problem was a tumor of the brain or spinal cord that is mostly not malignant and is called&#xD;
      meningioma. This eventually led health authorities to change the instructions for how doctors&#xD;
      should use CPAs to treat patients. This included what health conditions should be treated&#xD;
      with CPAs, how long patients should receive them, and what dose of CPA should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about how doctors are using CPAs to treat&#xD;
      patients after the update to the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer this research question, they will give to the doctors a web-based questionnaire&#xD;
      asking about the advisability or necessity of the treatment (also called &quot;indications of&#xD;
      approved use&quot;), the measures to be followed to reduce the risk and how much the doctors knew&#xD;
      about the risk of meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researches will then analyze the answers to the questionnaire. The results will be the&#xD;
      percentage of physicians with correct answers for each individual knowledge question from the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include information collected from a diverse sample of doctors during&#xD;
      approximately 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors must have given CPAs as a treatment to at least 1 patient in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no required visits or tests in this study.&#xD;
