  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric disorders and treatment with antidepressants SSRI/SNRI (selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors/ serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) are common in people with&#xD;
      morbid obesity who are candidates for bariatric surgery. Although longitudinal assessments&#xD;
      reveal positive effects of bariatric surgery on quality of life and mood, depressive&#xD;
      disorders may also deteriorate after bariatric surgery. There is few and inconsistent data&#xD;
      about the postoperative pharmacokinetics of SSRI/SNRI. The aims of our study were to provide&#xD;
      comprehensive data about the postoperative bioavailability of SSRI/SNRI, and the clinical&#xD;
      effects on the course of depression.&#xD;

      Prospective multicenter study including 63 patients (i.e. 46 participants in the bariatric&#xD;
      surgery group, and 17 participants in the conservative group as controls) with morbid obesity&#xD;
      and therapy with SSRI/SNRI: participants filled the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI)&#xD;
      questionnaire, and plasma levels of SSRI/SNRI were measured by HPLC (High Performance Liquid&#xD;
      Chromatography), preoperatively (T0), 4 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2) postoperatively.&#xD;

    <description>The BDI is a psychological test that measures the severity of depressive symptoms or depression. The test procedure is a self-assessment measure including 21 questions on a four-level scale with values from 0 to 3 in terms of occurrence and intensity, providing a sum value between 0 and 63. Based on this value, it is possible to determine whether the person is non-depressed (0), minimally depressed, mildly depressed, moderate to severely depressed or severely depressed (63).</description>

        As part of the regular consultation at the obesity center of the three study sites patients&#xD;
        were assessed for participation according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the&#xD;
        study. An interprofessional team decided about the treatment, consisting of gastric bypass&#xD;
        surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB]), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or conservative therapy&#xD;
        (consisting of medical visits, nutritional counseling, physiotherapy, antiobesogenic&#xD;
        medication and psychological coaching). Afterwards, patients who had met the inclusion&#xD;
        criteria were asked for participation, and were allocated (according to the treatment&#xD;
        option) to the &quot;bariatric surgery group&quot; with the two subgroups &quot;gastric bypass&quot; and&#xD;
        &quot;sleeve gastrectomy&quot;, and to the &quot;conservative group&quot;.&#xD;
