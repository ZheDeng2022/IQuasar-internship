  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no evidence-based intervention for individuals exposed to trauma that is&#xD;
      designed to aid recovery and prevent the development of post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). This randomized control trial proposes to test a one-time prophylactic treatment for&#xD;
      the prevention of symptoms of PTSD and related mental health disturbances and the promotion&#xD;
      of resilience using a single dose of hydrocortisone (HCORT) or placebo, administered within&#xD;
      six hours of trauma exposure. People at risk for PTSD have demonstrated low cortisol levels&#xD;
      before and in the aftermath of traumatic exposures and lower cortisol levels have also been&#xD;
      observed in combat veterans with PTSD. Administering HCORT at the time of trauma would help&#xD;
      boost the body's natural stress recovery systems to facilitate resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who present to the emergency department following trauma exposure and report&#xD;
      high distress, panic, anxiety or dissociation will be invited to participate in this clinical&#xD;
      trial. 220 trauma survivors will be randomized and recruited at two locations: Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Hospital in New York City, US, and a civilian/military hospital in Tel Hashomer, Israel.&#xD;
      Trauma survivors will be assessed at 2, 6, 12 and 28 weeks post-treatment. HCORT closely&#xD;
      resembles cortisol produced in the adrenal glands and released during stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that HCORT treatment will result in an accelerated decline in the presence&#xD;
      and severity of PTSD and related mental health symptoms compared to the placebo group. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for analysis of potential biomarkers to obtain more information&#xD;
      about the mechanisms of action of this intervention. The information obtained will be&#xD;
      relevant in determining whether early intervention with a single dose of HCORT, compared to&#xD;
      placebo, administered within several hours following trauma exposure, will reduce the risk of&#xD;
      developing PTSD in trauma survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary findings using HCORT in PTSD prevention have been encouraging (Zohar, Yahalom et&#xD;
      al. 2011, Cohen, Kaplan et al. 2016). However, it is imperative to provide a more definitive&#xD;
      study of HCORT effects across a wide range of demographic and traumatic exposures. In&#xD;
      addition, prior studies used a single IV dose of HCORT administered in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) and it is critical to determine whether effects would be comparable using&#xD;
      oral HCORT. The advantage of an oral prophylactic is that a pill is a portable prophylactic&#xD;
      that could be carried by first responders, military personnel and other people whose&#xD;
      occupations expose them to risk of trauma exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this RCT will add to the existing literature in several important ways. The&#xD;
      study will be larger in scope, and will target a more extensive biological profile to&#xD;
      elucidate mechanisms of action. To maximize enrollment within a shorter period of time, the&#xD;
      study will be conducted at two sites. The first site is the ED at the Mount Sinai Hospital,&#xD;
      located in East Harlem in New York City (NYC), and the second is the ED at Sheba Medical&#xD;
      Center in Israel. These sites allow for the evaluation of a broad range of trauma survivors.&#xD;
      In NYC, the large urban ED provides services to a diverse population with respect to race,&#xD;
      ethnicity and trauma exposure. At Sheba Medical Center, those who present to the ED are&#xD;
      active duty, reserve military personnel and civilians. By including both sites, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in a global and&#xD;
      more ethnically diverse sample that includes people exposed to a wide variety of traumas.&#xD;
      Prior research (Ozer, Best et al. 2003) and results from the researchers' intervention&#xD;
      studies indicate the importance of recruiting participants who are distressed, including&#xD;
      those expressing feelings of dissociation, when they present to the ED (i.e., such people are&#xD;
      at greater risk for the development of PTSD) following trauma exposure that is&#xD;
      life-threatening or causes injury (Yehuda, Bryant et al. 2005). For this reason, the current&#xD;
      study will select participants who meet a specified threshold for acute distress following&#xD;
      trauma exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is accumulating evidence to support the potential mechanism of action of the&#xD;
      administration of HCORT on achieving homeostasis and resilience following exposure to a&#xD;
      critical traumatic incident. In this interventional study, the researchers will collect blood&#xD;
      samples for the purpose of conducting further analyses of biomarkers to obtain more&#xD;
      information about the mechanisms of action of this intervention and to enhance knowledge&#xD;
      about mechanisms associated with resilience. These aims will be achieved by assessing&#xD;
      candidate neuroendocrine biomarkers as well as related molecular networks (e.g., genome wide&#xD;
      methylation and expression) relevant to PTSD risk, and resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the current trial using oral administration of HCORT is successful, it will generate a&#xD;
      viable, safe, portable, lightweight, prophylactic treatment that can be self-administered and&#xD;
      made available to military personnel, first responders and other civilians exposed to extreme&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
