  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RA is a common autoimmune disease that causes joint damage.It is necessary to reach the&#xD;
      standard as soon as possible and give effective drugs according to the patient's disease&#xD;
      activity to avoid disability. Tofacitinib(TF) is a new type of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (JAKi) for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA. However, there is alack of Chinese&#xD;
      data on the joint scheme, long-term use, maintenance and stop of TF in the real world. We&#xD;
      will use the new JAK combination regimen to treat RA patients, and carry out long-term&#xD;
      clinical follow-up for 30 weeks.&#xD;

      Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of TF combined with/ without IGU for&#xD;
      30 weeks in patients with moderate to severe active RA with different clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and subgroups by using a prospective cohort , and to find the best&#xD;
      combination scheme of TF.&#xD;

    <measure>The percentage of patients who achieve clinical remission at week 30 using European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients whose Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) achieve remission（DAS28-ESR≤ 2.6）and Low Disease Activity (DAS28-ESR ≤ 3.2). The DAS28 is a composite score derived from 4 of these measures，that is the count of tender joint count（TJC, 0-28）and swollen joint count（SJC, 0-28）, measure erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/h) or C reactive protein (CRP, mg/L) and to make a patient assessment of disease activity i.e. 'global assessment of health' (GH) using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 = best, 100 = worst. DAS28 values were calculated as follows: DAS28- ESR = 0.56√(TJC) + 0.28√(SJC) + 0.70 ln ESR + 0.014 x GH. High disease activity: DAS28-ESR &gt; 5.1; Moderate disease activity: 5.1≥ DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1; Low disease activity (LDA) and Remission mean Clinical remission.</description>
