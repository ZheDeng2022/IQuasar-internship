    <textblock>
      This open-label, exploratory study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or combinations, in participants with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose tumors are biomarker positive as per treatment&#xD;
      arm-specific definition. Eligible participants with mCRC will be enrolled into specific&#xD;
      treatment arms based on their biomarker assay results.&#xD;
