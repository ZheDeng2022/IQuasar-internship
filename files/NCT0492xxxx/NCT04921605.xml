      The study is designed to assess the feasibility of the DragonFly transcatheter mitral valve&#xD;
      clamping system for the treatment of symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-center design. Patients are clinically symptomatic&#xD;
      patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation despite medical therapy with an expected&#xD;
      moderate or greater surgical risk and prohibited to thoracotomy. After signing an informed&#xD;
      consent form, subjects are enrolled and treated with the DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral Valve&#xD;
      Repair System. All subjects receive clinical follow-up immediately after the procedure,&#xD;
      before discharge, and 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of MAEs at 30 days and immediate procedural success is used as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. The MAEs include device- or procedure-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke,&#xD;
      renal failure, and nonelective cardiovascular surgery associated with adverse events. The&#xD;
      immediate procedural success is defined as successful implantation of a tricuspid valve-clamp&#xD;
      device with at least a one-grade reduction in severity of tricuspid regurgitation at&#xD;
      discharge (30-day echocardiography if discharge records were not available or were&#xD;
      uninterpretable). Subjects who died or underwent tricuspid valve surgery prior to discharge&#xD;
      were defined as immediate procedure failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, the&#xD;
      incidence of serious adverse events, heart failure rehospitalization, changes of NYHA&#xD;
      classification, reduction of tricuspid regurgitation severity, the proportion of&#xD;
      reoperations, changes of quality of life as assessed by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      Questionnaire (KCCQ) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises two main objectives, firstly, to assess the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the DragonFly transcatheter mitral valve clamping system for the treatment of symptomatic&#xD;
      severe tricuspid regurgitation despite medical therapy with an expected moderate or greater&#xD;
      surgical risk and prohibited to thoracotomy. Secondly, to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      performance of the device and to familiarize clinicians with the device and procedure.&#xD;
