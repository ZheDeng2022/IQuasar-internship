      In this study, we investigate the safety and efficacy of topical sirolimus in the treatment&#xD;
      of superficial complicated vascular anomolies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular anomaly is a kind of rare disease. According to histology, biological behavior and&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, it can be divided into two categories: vascular tumor and vascular&#xD;
      malformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitors are proved with the properties of anti-proliferation and anti-angiogenesis.&#xD;
      Therefore, they have been used in the treatment of vascular anomalies. Sirolimus, by its&#xD;
      ability to prevent downstream protein synthesis and subsequent cell proliferation and&#xD;
      angiogenesis, has become a novel and effective treatment. However, after the children reach&#xD;
      complete response, there may still be skin manifestations that affect the appearance and&#xD;
      cause psychological shadows. Therefore, intervention is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have reported that topical sirolimus is effective in treating Kaposiform&#xD;
      Hemangioendothelioma (KHE). It is absorbed through the skin, avoiding the first pass&#xD;
      elimination effect of the liver. Fewer adverse reactions have been observed. In this study,&#xD;
      we investigate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous administration of sirolimus in the&#xD;
      treatment of superficial complicated vascular anomalies.&#xD;

    <description>Achauer BM et al. made the four-level standard as follows. Grade I: tumor size and skin lesion color regression ≤ 25%; grade II: tumor size and skin lesion color regression 25%-50%; grade III: tumor size and skin lesion color regression 50-75%; grade IV: tumor size and skin lesion color regression ≥75%. After 6 months of treatment, the pzrticipant will be evaluated. Grade I will be viewed as invalid. Grade II and grade III will be viewed as effective, and grade IV will be viewed as very effective. Those in grade Ⅱ, Ⅲ or Ⅳ will be calculated in effectiveness rate.</description>
