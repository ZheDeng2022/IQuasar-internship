  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this cohort study is to determine genetic, clinical biologic and&#xD;
      metabolic factors associated with patient heterogeneity in regards to severity of NAFLD at&#xD;
      diagnosis as well as during the clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at diagnosis, with the aim to better characterize patients of different severity and&#xD;
           improve our understanding of clinical and histological heterogeneity at diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during the clinical course to better understand and predict disease progression in terms&#xD;
           notably of fibrosis progression and progression to cirrhosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and is currently the most common cause of liver disease in many developed&#xD;
      countries worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to improve the scientific knowledge on markers associated with&#xD;
      disease severity and progression in NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicentre French NAFLD cohort of well-characterized patients with biological&#xD;
      samples covering the entire spectrum of NAFLD severity (steatosis, NASH, significant&#xD;
      fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma).&#xD;
