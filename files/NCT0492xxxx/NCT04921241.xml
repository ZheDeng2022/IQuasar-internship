  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its initial outbreak in late 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the&#xD;
      novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has ravaged the globe, causing illness characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation and impaired oxygen levels. As a particularly vulnerable group, pregnant women&#xD;
      have had a heightened prevalence and severity of infection. In this context, a new population&#xD;
      of children has emerged who were exposed to maternal COVID-19 in the womb. As maternal&#xD;
      diseases during pregnancy may impact the health of offspring over the life course, health&#xD;
      outcomes among these individuals must be urgently evaluated. In the current study, the&#xD;
      investigators will leverage a perinatal biorepository comprised of pregnant women with and&#xD;
      without COVID-19 to delineate the metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles of these&#xD;
      offspring. This work stands to benefit the burgeoning population of children exposed to&#xD;
      COVID-19 in the womb and to deepen the mechanistic understanding of developmental origins of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic disease with respect to maternal infections.&#xD;

        We are recruiting mothers who had COVID-19 during pregnancy and their offspring (9-24&#xD;
        months old). We are also recruiting mothers who were at risk for but not infected with&#xD;
        COVID-19 during pregnancy and their children to serve as controls. Mothers in both arms had&#xD;
        been contemporaneously enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 Perinatal Biorepository during&#xD;
        pregnancy.&#xD;
