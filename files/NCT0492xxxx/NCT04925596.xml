  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portugal has the highest benzodiazepine utilization compared to other European countries. The&#xD;
      high utilization of benzodiazepines has been a concern due to reported side effects of&#xD;
      long-term use and dependence. Also, these data demonstrate that doctors are possibly choosing&#xD;
      an inadequate treatment to manage anxious and depressive syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to develop and implement in primary health care units an online&#xD;
      educational program, following a cluster randomized study design; to study the impact of this&#xD;
      educational program for changing general practitioner's benzodiazepine prescription pattern;&#xD;
      to analyze of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the e-PrimaPrescribe&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BZD excessive prescription has long been considered a serious mental health concern in many&#xD;
      countries. A large number of interventions using different methodologies have been&#xD;
      implemented to change BZD prescription pattern at primary health care settings, with limited&#xD;
      positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the implementation of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1&#xD;
      intervention. In the study it was developed an online platform, named ePrimaPrescribe, which&#xD;
      was delivered using a Digital Behavior Change Intervention(DBCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators included all primary health care units from one region in Portugal which&#xD;
      were randomly allocated to receive a Digital Behavior Change Intervention (DBCI) in the&#xD;
      format of an online platform to reduce BZD prescription (ePrimaPrescribe) or an online&#xD;
      platform concerning communication techniques (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primarily aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Digital Behavior&#xD;
      Change Intervention (DBCI) using as outcome measure the frequency of BZD prescriptions issued&#xD;
      per month. Secondarily the investigators aimed to analyze the effect of ePrimaprescribe on&#xD;
      antidepressant prescriptions, to study the effect of ePrimaprescribe on diagnosis definition&#xD;
      associated with BZD and antidepressant prescription; to perform a cost analysis considering&#xD;
      the monthly National Health Service spending with BZD co-payment. The investigators finally&#xD;
      aim to analyze the implementation process using quantitative and qualitative methods.&#xD;
