  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common pathology, affecting around 12% of the general population, up to 25% in&#xD;
      some cohorts, as well as a significant part of the reasons for emergency room visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike cluster headaches, the use of high-flow oxygen therapy has not yet been validated in&#xD;
      patients with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several aspects of its pathophysiology, still studied to this day, suggest that the&#xD;
      use of normobaric oxygen could have beneficial effects on migraine attacks: tissue hypoxia,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular dysfunction with vasodilation, inflammation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, high-flow oxygen therapy has no significant side effects and almost no&#xD;
      contraindication (mainly COPD and other chronic respiratory failure) Its use in the event of&#xD;
      a migraine attack would thus allow less recourse to conventional analgesics (with significant&#xD;
      side effects for some), a shorter stay in the emergency room, and therefore a benefit in&#xD;
      terms of cost and relief for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the sponsor wish to carry out a multicenter prospective interventional,&#xD;
      single-blind randomized placebo-controlled in parallel groups study.&#xD;
