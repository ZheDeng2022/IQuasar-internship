  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study was to reveal the positive effects of the visual/auditory&#xD;
      distraction usage on anxiety, pain and behavioural control in paediatric patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of this study was to assess the effect of the cartoon-assisted audio/visual&#xD;
      distraction technique usage on paediatric patient's anxiety, pain and behaviour during dental&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 4-9 years old who met inclusion criteria received restorative treatment in two&#xD;
      sessions, with or without cartoon-assisted visual/auditory distraction technique. The parents&#xD;
      were informed about the study following the initial dental examination of the patient and the&#xD;
      written informed consents were obtained from parents of all participants included in the&#xD;
      study. Following the initial dental examination, dental prophylaxis was performed to&#xD;
      children. A behavioural assessment was done following a dental prophylaxis. Children who&#xD;
      demonstrated a negative or positive attitude according to the behaviour assessment were&#xD;
      selected. Although, children with definitely negative or definitely positive behavioural&#xD;
      attitude were not selected. Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Dental treatment was carried out with showing cartoon movie as a visual/auditory&#xD;
      distraction during the treatment in the second visit (V2). The third visit (V3) did not&#xD;
      consist any visual/auditory distractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Dental treatment was carried out without any visual/auditory distraction in the V2.&#xD;
      The V3 consisted cartoon movie as a visual/auditory distraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric patients were able to choose any of the 12 cartoon movies that have been approved&#xD;
      by two paediatric dentists who carried out the study. Before each treatment session, parents&#xD;
      were kindly requested to leave the operating room. Same treatment procedures were carried out&#xD;
      in both groups during each visit in the following consecutive order. During each treatment&#xD;
      session, corresponding measures were observed. Corresponding measures: (1) the child's&#xD;
      anxiety; (2) the child's pain perception during local anaesthesia and treatment; (3) the&#xD;
      child's cooperation and general behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the child's anxiety, pain perception and, cooperation and general behaviour&#xD;
      for both two groups were evaluated by statistical analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out in Istanbul Medipol University Department of Pedodontics, period&#xD;
      between June 2020 - October 2020 following the ethics committee approval (REF:&#xD;
      E-10840098-604.01.01-E.60990). The parents were informed about the study following the&#xD;
      initial dental examination of the patient and the written informed consents were obtained&#xD;
      from parents of all participants included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised crossover clinical study, the sample consisted of 72 children aged between&#xD;
      4-9 years old who applied for routine dental care in paediatric clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial dental examination eligible patients were selected (n=95) after 3&#xD;
      months of recruitment (June 2020 and August 2020). Each eligible patient was evaluated for&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these patients, 7 children demonstrated definitely&#xD;
      negative behaviour at the first visit (V1) and 16 children did not show-up to their scheduled&#xD;
      V1, thus 23 patients were excluded. A total of 72 patients were included the study. A&#xD;
      randomization list was generated using online software&#xD;
      (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm), where consecutive patients enrolled on the&#xD;
      study were randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The random allocation&#xD;
      sequence was generated by an independent researcher; thus, the operator and observer were&#xD;
      blinded to the assignment of the study participants to the groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Dental treatment was carried out with showing cartoon movie as a visual/auditory&#xD;
      distraction (group A) during the treatment in the second visit (V2). The third visit (V3) did&#xD;
      not consist any visual/auditory distractions, tell-show-do (group B) technique was used as a&#xD;
      behavioural guidance technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Dental treatment was carried out using tell-show-do (group B) technique without any&#xD;
      visual/auditory distraction in the V2. The V3 consisted cartoon movie as a visual/auditory&#xD;
      distraction (group A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This randomised crossover clinical study lasted five months with three months&#xD;
      for recruitment and two months to allocate treatment arms, including a two-week washout&#xD;
      period in between interventions. At the V1 following the initial dental examination, dental&#xD;
      prophylaxis was performed using a slow-speed hand piece with a prophylaxis paste to children.&#xD;
      A Frankl Behaviour Rating Score was assigned following dental prophylaxis. Children&#xD;
      demonstrated a score 2 or 3 according to the Frankl Behaviour Rating Scale were selected&#xD;
      [Frankl et al., 1962]. Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to as G1 (AB) or G2&#xD;
      (BA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric patients were able to choose any of the 12 cartoon movies that have been approved&#xD;
      by two paediatric dentists who carried out the study, checked for violence, slang language,&#xD;
      and appeal to the 4-9 age range. The screen was attached to the dental unit; hence, the child&#xD;
      could watch the cartoon movie clearly. While the same paediatric dentist performed all dental&#xD;
      procedures in each session to remove the inter-operator variability, an independent,&#xD;
      non-blinded observer recorded the data (all objective and subjective measures). Before each&#xD;
      treatment session, the treatment stages were explained to the child using the tell-show-do&#xD;
      technique the patient was requested to interrupt the treatment as little as possible. Parents&#xD;
      were kindly requested to leave the operating room. Same treatment procedures were carried out&#xD;
      in both groups during each visit in the following consecutive order. After the same topical&#xD;
      anaesthesia application, mandibular block anaesthesia was performed, and followed by&#xD;
      restoration treatment in lower primary molar tooth. Each visit time did not last longer than&#xD;
      30 minutes. The period between V2 and V3 was two weeks, which established as a washout&#xD;
      period; the patients did not receive any intervention to let the effects of the previous&#xD;
      intervention diminish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Pre-operative pulse rate was retrieved by a pulse oximeter to evaluate the&#xD;
      child's anxiety objectively. In addition, Venham Picture Test (VPT) was applied before the&#xD;
      beginning and at the end of each visit to evaluate the child's subjective anxiety [Venham et&#xD;
      al., 1981; Li and Lopez, 2005]. Eight cards, with two figures on each, represented anxious&#xD;
      and non-anxious mood in the VPT. Cards were shown to the child in their numerical order and&#xD;
      he/she was asked to choose the figure that felt closest to him/her at that moment. Choice of&#xD;
      &quot;anxious&quot; figure was recorded as one, and &quot;non-anxious&quot; figure was recorded as zero, which&#xD;
      totalled to a final score. According to the VPT, the score ranges from 0 (not anxious) to 8&#xD;
      (extremely anxious).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, pulse rate was retrieved with the pulse oximeter at five-minute&#xD;
      intervals starting from the local anaesthesia application. Moreover, the child's cooperation&#xD;
      and general behaviour during treatment was rated by examiner using the Houpt Scale [Houpt et&#xD;
      al., 1985].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooperation and general behaviour during treatment were evaluated using the Houpt Scale&#xD;
      taking into consideration the patient's reactions, and interruption of treatment. The&#xD;
      following treatment phases were evaluated, and an average was calculated to determine&#xD;
      patient's general behaviour score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia application, The intraoral procedure with a high-speed rotary instrument,&#xD;
      Matrix application, Restorative treatment (etch/adhesive application/polymerase/composite&#xD;
      application with light-curing), Finishing. In order to evaluate pain perception during local&#xD;
      anaesthesia, Sounds, Eyes and Motor Scale (SEM) scoring, which is a non-subjective method&#xD;
      based on the observation of the physician, was used by the same examiner [Wright et al.,&#xD;
      1991]. This method consists of two categories as comfortable (grade 1), and uncomfortable&#xD;
      according to the patient's reactions. Uncomfortable responses were evaluated in three&#xD;
      sub-categories: mild discomfort (grade 2), moderate discomfort (grade 3), and severe&#xD;
      discomfort (grade 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the treatment, post-operative pulse rate and VPT were repeated. Moreover, at the&#xD;
      end of the dental treatment, Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale was applied to the child to&#xD;
      measure the self-reported pain during treatment [Wong and Baker, 1988]. Detailed explanation&#xD;
      regarding the figures of the scale was provided to the child. Six faces ranging from happy to&#xD;
      crying was shown to the child and the question &quot;How much did you hurt during the treatment?&quot;&#xD;
      was asked. Based on the self-reported answer, the score was noted to the patient form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data was recorded to spreadsheets using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,&#xD;
      Redmond, WA, USA) for further analysis. SPSS software version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk,&#xD;
      NY, USA) was used for statistical inference and generating corresponding figures. A&#xD;
      descriptive data analysis was conducted, and data were presented as frequency, percentage,&#xD;
      mean, and standard deviation. Repeated-measures analysis was also used to test the carryover&#xD;
      effect associated with this crossover study. Independent-samples t-test was used according to&#xD;
      sums and differences of patient-reported anxiety level, pulse rate, SEM, Houpt, and WBF scale&#xD;
      values of study group in both visits (V2, V3) for statistical analysis. The significance&#xD;
      level was set as &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
