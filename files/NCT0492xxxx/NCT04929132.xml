      The aim of this study was to investigate the added value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound&#xD;
      (CEUS) for differentiating low risk patients with breast nodules categorized as 4A using the&#xD;
      Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The study included patients with 4A&#xD;
      nodules confirmed by core biopsy and/or surgery. The CEUS parameters were assessed to&#xD;
      evaluated the added value in BI-RADS 4A nodules&#xD;
