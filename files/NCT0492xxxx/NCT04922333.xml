  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether receiving a bisphosphonate medication&#xD;
      called risedronate can reduce bone and muscle loss following bariatric surgery. Participation&#xD;
      will involve up to 6 study visits and last about 1 year. Risedronate is a medication that&#xD;
      prevents bone breakdown and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in older men and women. However, risedronate&#xD;
      has not been approved for the prevention of bone and muscle loss following vertical sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will involve completing two visits before beginning the&#xD;
      intervention. Participants who qualify will be scheduled to begin the intervention program&#xD;
      which will involve taking 6 monthly doses of a risedronate or placebo pill. Participants will&#xD;
      then receive monthly contacts by study staff during this time to remind participants to take&#xD;
      the intervention pill and ask about any adverse events. After the completion of intervention&#xD;
      period, participants will complete up to 4 follow up study visits at 6 months (2 visits) and&#xD;
      at 12 months (2 visits).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to definitively test whether risedronate use can&#xD;
      effectively counter sleeve gastrectomy (SG) associated bone loss. To do this, we propose to&#xD;
      randomize 120 middle-aged and older (â‰¥40 years) SG patients to six months of risedronate or&#xD;
      placebo treatment, with musculoskeletal outcomes assessed at baseline, six, and 12 months.&#xD;
      Due to its robust change following SG and clinical utility in predicting fracture, our&#xD;
      primary outcome is change in total hip areal (a) bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual&#xD;
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This will be complemented by DXA-acquired aBMD assessment&#xD;
      at other skeletal sites and appendicular lean mass, as well as quantitative computed&#xD;
      tomography (QCT) derived changes in bone (volumetric BMD, cortical thickness, and strength)&#xD;
      and muscle (cross sectional area, fat infiltration) at the hip and spine - allowing for novel&#xD;
      assessment of intervention effectiveness on several state of the art bioimaging metrics.&#xD;
      Select measures of physical function (fast 400-m walk, stair climb) are also included as&#xD;
      proxies of fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the study team aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the effect of risedronate compared to placebo on 12-month change in total&#xD;
      hip aBMD following SG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effects of risedronate compared to placebo on 12-month change in&#xD;
      DXA-acquired aBMD at additional skeletal sites and appendicular lean mass; QCT-derived&#xD;
      measures of bone and muscle at the hip and spine following SG; and select physical function&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Investigate the impact of treatment group assignment on biomarkers of bone turnover&#xD;
      and bone-muscle crosstalk to elucidate mechanisms underlying change in DXA and QCT-derived&#xD;
      metrics.&#xD;
