      Multi-center Observational Study on the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Anti-PD-1&#xD;
      mAb Treated Tumor Patients by Artery Ultrasound Follow-up&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a self-control, multi-center observational study. This study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of anti-PD-1 mAbs on atherosclerotic plaques in those anti-PD-1 mAbs treated&#xD;
      patients. The method for quantification and evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques are based&#xD;
      on the calculation of the plaque area of atherosclerotic plaques on the long axis direction&#xD;
      of artery on the ultrasound images. By comparing the plaque areas at the same location of&#xD;
      artery in each patient before and after anti-PD-1 mAbs treatments, to assess the progression&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic plaques response to anti-PD-1 mAbs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The subjects knew about the experiment and signed the informed consent voluntarily;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subjects complicated with tumor diseases and atherosclerotic plaques;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subjects received regular PD-1 inhibitor treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subjects had ultrasound images of atherosclerotic plaques before- and after- or&#xD;
             during PD-1 blockade treatment at the two different timepoints;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subjects received regular treatments of PD-1 inhibitor during the two timepoints&#xD;
             of artery ultrasound examinations;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subjects who had ultrasound images before the initiation of first-dose PD-1&#xD;
             inhibitor, the interval between these two timepoints should be restricted within 1&#xD;
             month;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subjects who had ultrasound images after 3 months of PD-1 inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             lactating women;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Plaque areas can not be calculated because of the quality of ultrasound image;&#xD;
