  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more patients are undergoing elective surgery after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and little&#xD;
      is known about the residual pulmonary changes in these patients after infection and&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications. So, we propose an observational study comparing&#xD;
      postCOVID-19 patients with normal population (control group) undergoing surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common lung complications of severe COVID-19 are pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory&#xD;
      failure/ARDS. Manifestations of lung inflammation or fibrosis were also observed in late&#xD;
      stages of COVID-19 causing respiratory sequelae. Fibrous lesions may form during the healing&#xD;
      of pulmonary chronic inflammation or proliferative diseases, with gradual replacement of&#xD;
      cellular components by scar tissues indicating a poor outcome of COVID-19. Ultrasound allows&#xD;
      to stratify the severity of lung damage and combined with the clinic, can help estimate the&#xD;
      patient's prognosis and support therapeutic decision-making. On the other hand, pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammatory processes and fibrosis are responsible for a decrease in respiratory&#xD;
      distensibility or pulmonary compliance. Pulmonary parenchyma distensibility is known as&#xD;
      static distensibility or compliance and it´s calculated by mechanical ventilators during&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies that determine the results of lung ultrasound and pulmonary compliance&#xD;
      in preoperative and intraoperative period respectively in postCOVID patients, and the&#xD;
      postoperative complications of postCOVID patients are poorly understood.&#xD;

        The written consent forms are obtained from all the subjects who agreed to participate in&#xD;
        the study. Patients who suffered Covid-19 prior to surgery without previous moderate-severe&#xD;
        pulmonary pathology, that at the time of surgery present negative PCR and absence of clinic&#xD;
        due to SARS-CoV-2, are included in the Post-COVID 19 group. The &quot;control group&quot; includes&#xD;
        patients over the age of 18 who did not have COVID-19 and without moderate-severe pulmonary&#xD;
        pathology prior to surgery.&#xD;
