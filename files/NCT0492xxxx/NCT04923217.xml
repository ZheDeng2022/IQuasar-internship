  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser(MRKH) syndrome is described as absence or underdevelopment of&#xD;
      vagina and uterus. This condition is extremely rare congenital malformation that affects one&#xD;
      in every 5000 female births. Medical management of MRKH syndrome includes the creation of a&#xD;
      neovagina using nonsurgical or surgical procedure. In Vietnam, since 2014, Davydov technique&#xD;
      has been used to create neovagina for patients with MRKH syndrome at Tu Du hospital which is&#xD;
      the biggest obstetric and gynecological hospital in south of Vietnam. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this surgical approach on patient's life and sexual activity hasn't been&#xD;
      assessed. The objective of this study is to assess the quality of life, the psychological&#xD;
      impact and the sexual function of Vietnamese women with MRKH syndrome after Davydov surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at Tu Du hospital, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Female patients&#xD;
      who was diagnosed as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome were performed Davydov&#xD;
      procedure to create neovagina at department of Anaesthesia and Intensive care, Tu Du&#xD;
      hospital. Based on data of department of Anaesthesia and Intensive care, a list of&#xD;
      potentially eligible patients who underwent Davydov surgery at least 6 months was made.&#xD;
      According this list, patients will be contacted by telephone or email to set up an&#xD;
      appointment at Tu Du hospital to assess the effectiveness of Davydov procedure which based on&#xD;
      anatomy and function of neovagina. On appointment day, paticipants will be provided a copy of&#xD;
      informed consent documents. Written informed consent is going to be obtained by the&#xD;
      investigator from all women before the enrolment. Because MRKH syndrome is a rare condition,&#xD;
      so the investigators take all patients who are suitable to inclusion criteria and accept to&#xD;
      participate our research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of Davydov procedure according to anatomy aspect: the obstetric and gynecologic&#xD;
      doctors assess the length and diameter of neovagina through gynecological examine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of Davydov procedure according to functional aspect: the psycological doctors assess&#xD;
      the impact of patient's neovagina on life and sexual function through questionnaires&#xD;
      involving World Health Organization Quality of life Scale (WHOQoL-BREF), Female Sexual&#xD;
      Function Index (FSFI), Beck depression inventory (BDI) and self-composed qualitative&#xD;
      questionnaire. The interview with patient will be held individually and conducted by&#xD;
      psychological doctor. The paticipants will be requested to record the conversation.&#xD;

    <description>The psychological doctor uses the questionnaire named World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale(WHOQoL-BREF) in the interview to ask patient. The patient's Quality of Life will be assessed based on the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire 's score. All the results will be collected and calculated subsequently. The raw scores are converted to transformation scores. The first transformation converts scores to range of 4-20 and the second transformation converts domain scores to 0-100 scale. Higher scores reflect better Quality of Life.</description>

    <description>The psychological doctor uses the questionnaire named Female Sexual Function Index Scale (FSFI) in the interview to ask patient. The patient's sexual function will be assessed based on the FSFI questionnaire 's score. All the results will be collected and calculated subsequently. The FSFI's minimum total score is 2 and the FSFI's maximum total score is 36. The patient is diagnosed to have sexual dysfunction when the FSFI's total score is less than 26,55.</description>
