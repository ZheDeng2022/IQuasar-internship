      Study background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired heart rate recovery following active stand is associated with morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Evidence for the repeatability of this measure is limited. This study seeks to&#xD;
      determine the repeatability of the active stand procedure in eliciting heart rate recovery in&#xD;
      healthy adults of all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine the repeatability of heart rate recovery in response&#xD;
      to the active stand procedure among different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a repeatability study with between group comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in the Clinical Research Facility in St James's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the staff and student population of Trinity College&#xD;
      Dublin and St James's Hospital, from the Trinity Retirement Association and from the&#xD;
      community in the St. James's Hospital catchment area. Participants will be healthy adults&#xD;
      (over 18 years old). They will be invited to participate via an email and poster campaign.&#xD;
      Participation will be fully voluntary. Participants who meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      selected. Informed, explicit voluntary consent will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and processing will be carried out by the Research Physiotherapist. A&#xD;
      clinical visit for the participant will be arranged at a time most convenient for them.&#xD;
      Participants will conduct the active stand assessment on three occasions.&#xD;

    <description>The participant is asked to lie down for 10 mins without moving or speaking. A heart rate monitor is attached while the participant is lying down. They are then asked to stand up as quickly as possible and to remain standing unassisted for 3 minutes. The participant will be asked to describe any symptoms at 1 and 3 minutes after standing. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored constantly throughout the test.</description>
