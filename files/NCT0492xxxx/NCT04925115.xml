      Now a days, modern time, new researches increased knowledge of researchers on physical&#xD;
      activity and its effect on academic stress. Literature search shows to reduce academic stress&#xD;
      among people all types of physical activities were effective and useful. Particularly&#xD;
      moderate level of physical activity like brisk walking was significantly associated with&#xD;
      academic stress, as compare to hard and light physical activities. Many Studies and research&#xD;
      was available on the effectiveness of physical activities and found effective for dealing&#xD;
      with academic stress but these were single centered and lacking control on confound variables&#xD;
      observation, For example, Age, BMI, Socio-economic status, Semester pressure, Curriculum&#xD;
      burden, depression, anxiety ,stress , demographics etc were absent in previous studies plus&#xD;
      the available research is partial, includes only females. This research will be impartial and&#xD;
      free from gender discrimination. Both male and female students will be taken in consideration&#xD;
      for test and a multi-centered study will be conducted focusing on the confounding variables&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of physical activity on academic stress with controlling&#xD;
      variables is the recommendation of this research&#xD;
