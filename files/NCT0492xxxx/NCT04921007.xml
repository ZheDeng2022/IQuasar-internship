      This study will be conducted to evaluate efficacy of ultrasound guided sacral erector spinae&#xD;
      plane block for postoperative analgesia in pediatric anorectal surgery in comparison to&#xD;
      caudal block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia in children has become increasingly popular over the past few decades. A&#xD;
      variety of peripheral and central nerve blocks have been developed to ensure that&#xD;
      perioperative pain can be effectively controlled. So, it possible to reduce the dose&#xD;
      concentrations of systemic drugs and improved hemodynamic stability in high-risk patients.&#xD;
      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block with various approaches been used in many surgeries and&#xD;
      obtained great popularity despite of its novelty. After first description; lower thoracic,&#xD;
      lumbar and sacral approaches were defined for postoperative analgesia. There are a few cases&#xD;
      in which sacral ESP block was administered and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound guided&#xD;
      sacral ESP block and caudal block. It is hypothesized that sacral ESP block will be&#xD;
      comparable to caudal block as a promising effective alternative for analgesia in patients who&#xD;
      will undergo pediatric anorectal surgery with fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, comparative clinical study will include 60 children who will be&#xD;
      scheduled for elective anorectal surgery under general anesthesia in Mansoura university&#xD;
      hospitals. Informed written consent will be obtained from parents of all subjects in the&#xD;
      study after ensuring confidentiality. The study protocol will be explained to parents of all&#xD;
      patients in the study who will be kept fasting prior to surgery. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two equal groups (ESP and caudal) according to computer-generated table of random&#xD;
      numbers using the permuted block randomization method. The collected data will be coded,&#xD;
      processed, and analyzed using SPSS program. All data will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant if P value is â‰¤ 0.05.&#xD;
