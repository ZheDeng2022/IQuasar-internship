  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin diseases can have various origins. However, a number of them are linked to an imbalance&#xD;
      in the immune system which will lead to either an excessively strong autoimmune response or a&#xD;
      complete lack of response against cancer cells. Indeed, both melanoma and vitiligo are&#xD;
      pathologies where the immune system plays an important role in the progression of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced stage melanoma (metastatic lymph node and / or visceral) have a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Although targeted therapies and immunotherapies have improved the outcome for patient however&#xD;
      significant proportion of these patients (~ 50%) developed resistance to therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitiligo is a relatively common dermatosis affecting approximately 0.5% to 1% of the French&#xD;
      population. Vitiligo results from the destruction of the melanocytes by the immune system. It&#xD;
      is manifested by acquired depigmented macules, well limited and asymptomatic. Patients&#xD;
      suffering from this condition have a marked decrease in their quality of life. There has been&#xD;
      shown a strong link between vitiligo and melanoma. Indeed, patients with melanoma who develop&#xD;
      vitiligo (~ 9% of patients treated with anti-PD-1 drugs) have a better prognosis compared to&#xD;
      patients who do not develop vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, in melanoma cases where the immune system is inactive, the investigators have&#xD;
      identified a new molecule secreted by melanoma cells, ITGBL1, leading to the exclusion of&#xD;
      immune cells, decreased cytokines secretion and decreased immune cell activation. It is&#xD;
      therefore essential to better understand the regulatory mechanism of the immune system in&#xD;
      patients with vitiligo or in patients with melanoma treated by immunotherapy in order to be&#xD;
      able to propose new therapeutic solutions for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study to date has investigated the expression of ITGBL1 and serum inflammatory markers&#xD;
      during the development of melanoma. Likewise in vitiligo, if a loss of ITGBL1 is observed,&#xD;
      new treatments could be developed in order to limit the progression of the disease by&#xD;
      re-expressing this protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators exploratory study will provide the first answers to the predictive&#xD;
      value of these markers for these pathologies in order to adapt and develop new treatments.&#xD;
