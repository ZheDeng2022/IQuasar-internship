  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare metabolic and feeding behaviour responses to 4 days of extended&#xD;
      evening fasting vs. a control trial&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Humans have evolved as a diurnal species, internally governed by the circadian system, which&#xD;
      dictates our hormone regulation. 'Chrononutrition' is a sub-discipline which combines food&#xD;
      timing with circadian physiology. The most popular method of time-restricted feeding in the&#xD;
      UK is to skip breakfast. However, data from several meta-analysis have shown that skipping&#xD;
      breakfast is associated with weight gain and insulin resistance, likely due to eating later&#xD;
      into the evening/night and therefore, out of sync with our circadian rhythm. Recent research&#xD;
      has shown that skipping dinner (evening fasting) has improved markers of cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      health in clinical populations, although these are typically from longer-term studies.&#xD;
      Despite these promising findings, it is not yet known whether these findings are population&#xD;
      specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators are interested in examining the metabolic response pre and post&#xD;
      intervention to see whether these promising findings can translate into a healthy population.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will be monitoring subjective appetite, energy intake and&#xD;
      expenditure to assess whether there is any short-term adaptation to a specific feeding&#xD;
      window.&#xD;

    <measure>Glycaemic control (Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 hours following the standardised breakfast meal on day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>A metabolic assessment lasting 3.5 hours will take place following a standardised, laboratory-based meal. The investigators will be taking periodic capillary and venous blood samples to measure post-prandial glucose and insulin, which together comprise 'glycaemic control'.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy Intake (Kilocalories)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Energy intake will be measured both during lab and outside of the laboratory when the participants are free-living. During lab, energy intake will be measured through ad-libitum feeding buffet where 20 minutes will be permitted to eat as much or as little as they desire, until 'comfortably full and satisfied', followed by post-feeding measurement of the remaining food. Outside of laboratory feeding will also be monitored through food diary's and weighing any investigator issued meals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Energy expenditure will be measured via a chest-worn device (Actiheart) which combines heart rate and accelerometry to gauge calories expended.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortisol awakening response</measure>
    <time_frame>Five samples will be collected by the participant within the first hour of waking on day 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The cortisol awakening response will be measured on the final morning of each trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale for Subjective Ratings of Appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 hours between 8am-10pm from day 1 to day 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective appetite will be measured on mobile devices via a software which replicates a 100mm visual analogue scale. The scale is divided into subscales of different appetite perceptions including: hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption.&#xD;
(i.e. from 0 - 100), with a rating of 100 fully supporting the perception and a rating of 0 fully opposing the perception.</description>

    <measure>Acylated Ghrelin (appetite hormone)</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 hours following the standardised breakfast meal on day 1 and day 4.</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will undertake 4 days of extended evening fasting (feeding between 8am-4pm). The participants will visit the laboratory on day 1, following a 16 h fast, where baseline measures will be taken and the response to a standardised meal will take place. The participant will also have an opportunity to feed ad-libitum before they leave the laboratory. The participant will continue to adhere to the feeding window on day 2 and day 3, although this will be in free-living conditions. On day 4, the participant will arrive back to the lab for post-intervention assessment, identical in format to day 1 with a metabolic assessment and energy intake assessment via a ad-libitum meal.</description>
