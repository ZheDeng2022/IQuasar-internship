    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a neoadjuvant (i.e. pre-treatment)&#xD;
      exercise regimen on extremity function and postoperative wound healing. The study group will&#xD;
      include patients with a primary diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiation therapy and surgical resection. Patients with upper or lower extremity&#xD;
      sarcomas will be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
