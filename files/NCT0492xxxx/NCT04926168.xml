  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylated glioblastoma treated with or&#xD;
      without six months of adjuvant TMZ after standard radiation (6000 centigray (cGy)) plus&#xD;
      concurrent Temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives include to prospectively assess the overall adverse event profile in the&#xD;
      two treatment arms. To compare lymphocyte counts overtime between the two treatment arms and&#xD;
      to prospectively compare quality of life in the two treatment arms as assessed by MD Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and Neurological quality of Life/minimal&#xD;
      infecting dose (NeuroQoL) (MID). The study will also compare progression-free survival&#xD;
      between the two treatment arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent phase III trials in patients with newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma have&#xD;
      demonstrated that adding new agents (such as cilengitide, bevacizumab, or nivolumab) to&#xD;
      standard radiation and TMZ do not improve survival in this disease. The modest effects on&#xD;
      survival observed with the OptuneÂ® device are offset by the high costs, inconvenience, and&#xD;
      impact on the social interactions of patients wearing this device. Unfortunately, there are&#xD;
      currently no novel therapies poised to displace the European Organization Research &amp;&#xD;
      Treatment Cancer (EORTC) regimen as the standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).As a result, a formal evaluation of the efficacy of the 6&#xD;
      months of adjuvant TMZ in this regimen is important to patients and research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is of particular importance in the 40% of patients who have MGMT methylated&#xD;
      glioblastoma. The very small benefit observed in MGMT unmethylated patients has led&#xD;
      investigators in Europe and the United States of America (including Cancer Therapy Evaluation&#xD;
      Program (CTEP) sponsored studies) to approve clinical trials in MGMT unmethylated patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma that entirely omit TMZ in both the concurrent and the&#xD;
      adjuvant settings Given the marginal value of TMZ in the MGMT unmethylated patient&#xD;
      population, the investigator's propose to study the value of adjuvant TMZ in the subset of&#xD;
      the MGMT methylated population. If omitting adjuvant TMZ is not detrimental to outcomes in&#xD;
      the methylated population then it is extremely unlikely to benefit the unmethylated&#xD;
      population where TMZ has even less effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, exploring the value of the six months of adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma is important. If this was shown to be of minimal value&#xD;
      in prolonging survival there would be an immediate impact on both the standard care of&#xD;
      patients and research efforts to improve therapeutic outcomes.&#xD;
