  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid agonist treatments are the gold standard for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet,&#xD;
      even effective treatments average only 50% six-month retention. Despite extensive research&#xD;
      into treatment options, it remains important to improve understanding of factors that&#xD;
      contribute to relapse and identify interventions to mitigate these risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress-exposure is problematic for people trying to recover from substance use disorders&#xD;
      (SUDs) because it weakens inhibition of automatic behaviors and increases drug craving and&#xD;
      likelihood of relapse. However, paths through which stress affects behavior are incompletely&#xD;
      understood and current SUD treatments do not target effects of stress on drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will explore whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) might&#xD;
      improve treatment outcomes for people with OUD entering methadone treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine the impact of rTMS treatment over one of two theoretically-driven&#xD;
      neural targets on substance use and cognitive outcomes associated with treatment success&#xD;
      (executive function and emotional arousal).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Competing Neurobehavioral Decisions Systems (CNDS) model of addiction suggests that&#xD;
      people with SUDs have altered function and connectivity in fronto-cortical executive control&#xD;
      regions (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) and fronto-cortical limbic control&#xD;
      regions (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]). Namely, elevated activity in limbic circuitry&#xD;
      results in hypersensitivity to drug cues and stress, and decreased executive control impairs&#xD;
      the ability to resist drug urges. The CNDS theoretical framework can guide selection and&#xD;
      testing of rTMS targets that could improve understanding of the mechanisms of SUDs and&#xD;
      stress-induced drug use. Results from previous research suggest that therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      rTMS for SUD could occur via excitation of dlPFC or inhibition of mPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will administer excitatory (10Hz) dlPFC rTMS and inhibitory (1Hz) mPFC rTMS&#xD;
      (through an electromagnetic coil placed against the scalp) coupled with tasks of executive&#xD;
      function and emotional arousal during stress and neutral conditions (guided imagery task&#xD;
      using personalized scripts) in adults with OUD early in methadone treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine and compare how strengthening dlPFC activity or reducing mPFC&#xD;
      activity may reverse stress-induced executive and emotional dysfunction, respectively, and&#xD;
      improve treatment outcomes in persons with OUD seeking to abstain from opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed design study will be used to examine the effects of active rTMS vs. sham (within&#xD;
      subject) over one of two locations: 10 Hz dlPFC rTMS (group 1) or 1 Hz mPFC rTMS (group 2) in&#xD;
      subjects receiving methadone treatment for OUD. The general rTMS treatment protocol will be&#xD;
      the same for both groups and will consist of 2 stimulation sessions per day, separated by&#xD;
      ~30min, for 5 days (10 total stimulation sessions per treatment protocol). The sham protocol&#xD;
      will be the same except the sham rTMS coil will be used. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to groups and complete the 2 conditions (active vs. sham rTMS) in random order.&#xD;
      Immediately prior to and after each 5-day rTMS treatment protocol, participants will attend&#xD;
      an assessment visit when they will complete multiple tasks during both stress (guided imagery&#xD;
      stressor) and neutral conditions. These tasks are designed to measure executive function,&#xD;
      emotional arousal, and drug-seeking behavior.&#xD;
