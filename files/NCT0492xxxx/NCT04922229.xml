  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses a central question within the practice of dentistry: What is the&#xD;
      optimal treatment of carious pulp exposure, in a tooth with a vital pulp and normal periapex.&#xD;
      In addition, the project seeks to identify clinical and laboratory findings that would be&#xD;
      predictive of success of vital pulp therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 120 patients will be randomized to two groups. All patients will have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis with normal apical tissues. The groups will be root canal&#xD;
      treatment and vital pulp therapy (VPT). The patients will be followed clinically and&#xD;
      radiographically for 2 years following the treatment. Predictors of the outcome of VPT will&#xD;
      be clinical and laboratory-based parameters.&#xD;

          -  Maxillary or mandibular first or second mature permanent molars with carious lesions&#xD;
             or restorations (excluding crowns), with signs and symptoms of reversible or&#xD;
             irreversible pulpitis, requiring treatment, where pulp exposure is probable upon&#xD;
             excavation.&#xD;

             treatment will be considered a treatment failure and treated with RCTx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Teeth that require elective RCTx for restorative purposes.&#xD;
