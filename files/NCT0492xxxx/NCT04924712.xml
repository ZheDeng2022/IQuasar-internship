  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a clinical entity defined by the association of&#xD;
      selective albuminuria resulting in hypoalbuminemia, and nonspecific glomerular lesions,&#xD;
      called minimal change disease (MDC) for corticosteroid-sensitive forms and lesions of Focal&#xD;
      Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) for severe forms, generally corticosteroid-resistant&#xD;
      (CR-INS) (Korbet 1995). The specific complication of this renal disease is its immediate&#xD;
      recurrence on the graft (Dantal 1996, Dantal 1995) leading, in 50% of cases, to the failure&#xD;
      of the transplantation, condemning these patients to dialysis for life. The origin of this&#xD;
      syndrome is currently unknown, but a number of clinical observations tend to show an&#xD;
      involvement of the immune system (Shaloub 1974). A number of studies have demonstrated a link&#xD;
      between atopy, diet and nephrotic attacks (Lagrue 1982, 1984; Laurent 1987, 1988, 1989). Our&#xD;
      team has also shown that plasma exchanges and immunoadsorptions can lead to total or partial&#xD;
      remissions, supporting the evidence for the presence of a pathogenic plasma factor linked to&#xD;
      immunoglobulins (Dantal 1991, Dantal 1994, Dantal 1998), previously suggested by the&#xD;
      observation of immediate recurrence of the initial disease on the graft after renal&#xD;
      transplantation (Hoyer 1972, Dantal 1995, Dantal 1996). Finally, more recently the use of&#xD;
      anti-CD20 treatment specifically depleting B lymphocytes has made it possible to favorably&#xD;
      treat a significant number of patients (Haffner 2009; CaraFuentes 2013; Iijima 2017; Siligato&#xD;
      2018). In 2009, the study of a patient with IPEX syndrome, who displayed INS/MCD, highlighted&#xD;
      the importance of regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of INS (Hashimura 2009). These&#xD;
      results were corroborated by two studies showing regulatory T cell dysfunction in INS&#xD;
      patients (Prasad 2015; Bertelli 2016). This alteration is also linked to allergies&#xD;
      (Stelmaszczyk-Emmel 2015) and could be due to an aberrant microbiota or dysbiosis (Rodrigé&#xD;
      2011; Ohnmacht 2016). The hypothesis of a causality between dysbiosis, lymphocyte alteration&#xD;
      and the onset of an INS has recently been raised (Uy 2015; Kaneko 2017). Two studies have&#xD;
      shown intestinal dysbiosis in pediatric INS/MCD, with reduction of circulating Tregs (Tsuji&#xD;
      2018, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and objectives Our hypothesis is that in INS/FSGS patients, the alteration of the&#xD;
      immune system could be linked to an imbalance of the microbiota. Our objective is to compare&#xD;
      the intestinal (and/or urinary) microbiota of the adult INS patient, in nephrotic attacks vs&#xD;
      in remission with in parallel a complete monitoring of peripheral immune cells (T and B&#xD;
      subtypes, NK, monocytic and dendritic cells) to estimate the possible change in the&#xD;
      microbiota between the 2 disease states, and its potential impact on the immune system. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the microbiota and the immune system of recurrent INS/FSGS&#xD;
      patients after transplantation with non-recurrent post-transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of the study This study should make it possible to 1 / bring together the cohort and&#xD;
      the associated samples, necessary to achieve our goals; 2 / carry out the most exhaustive&#xD;
      cytometric analysis of the peripheral sub-populations of these patients and 3 / analyze the&#xD;
      intestinal and urinary microbiota. We will first collect a group of INS patients (n = 25) in&#xD;
      nephrotic surge, then these same patients in remission. The second group to be collected will&#xD;
      be a group of recurrent INS/FSGS patients after renal transplantation and a group of&#xD;
      non-recurrent INS receiving the same therapeutic protocol (n = 5/5). As control groups, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect proteinuric patients of other origin as well as healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (n = 10/10). All patients and healthy individuals will sign an informative consent.&#xD;

    <description>The microbiota will be analyzed using DNA extracted from fecal or urine samples (see table below § 4) which will be lysed using the DNA extraction kit (ZR Fecal DNA extraction kit Zymo research). The V1-V2 regions of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes will be amplified by PCR and sequenced. Analysis will be performed at CHU of Nantes.</description>

    <measure>Cytometric analysis of peripheral immune populations</measure>
    <time_frame>Jan 2022 to July 2024</time_frame>
    <description>The blood cells will be recovered by density gradient (Ficoll) and frozen in 20% DMSO. They will then be labelled and identified by flow cytometry. Spectral technology (Aurora - Cytek) will be used allowing to use 2 combinations of 31 and 33 Ab each (subpopulations T, Tregs, B naive, mature, transitional, memories, plasmablasts, B regs (GZMB, IL10, PD1) , monocytes, NK, DC, pDC). These analyzes will be carried out at the CRTI (Center for Research in Transplantation and Immunology) - INSERM UMR 1064.</description>
