      The technique of pursed lip breathing allow the patients to control the oxygenation and&#xD;
      ventilation. This technique is performed by allowing the person to inspire through the nose&#xD;
      exhale through the mouth at a slow controlled flow. This technique works by moving oxygen&#xD;
      into your lungs and carbon dioxide out of your lungs. Pursed lip breathing (PLB) helps to&#xD;
      slow down breathing rate and relieving shortness of breath by keeping the airways open&#xD;
      longer. So patients can remove the air that is trapped in to the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent systematic review that is published in 2018, PLB was shown to significantly&#xD;
      improve ventilation related outcomes such as respiratory rate and minute ventilation, but not&#xD;
      dyspnea and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic breathing (DB), that is also called deep breathing, this breathing is done by&#xD;
      contracting the diaphragm, a muscle located horizontally between the thoracic cavity and&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. During this type of breathing, air enters in to the lungs, the chest does&#xD;
      not rise and belly expands. Diaphragmatic breathing encourages fully oxygen exchange, that is&#xD;
      the beneficial trade of incoming oxygen for out going carbon dioxide.&#xD;

    <measure>COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a questionnaire for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can be filled in to quantify their symptoms in the form of scores (0-40). Changes From the Baseline will be Assessed. It is categorized into four groups, that are, low(1) , medium(2), high(3) and very high(4) based on the level of effect of the disease on status of health.</description>

    <measure>6 min walk test: Distance (meters)</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 min walk test was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline, It is a subjective numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates &quot;no dyspnea&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;unbearable dyspnea.&quot; A number is chosen by the patient in order to decide the best score that matches his level of dyspnea during physical activity.</description>
