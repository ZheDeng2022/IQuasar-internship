  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to support development of asciminib in the pediatric population (1&#xD;
      to &lt;18 years) previously treated with one or more TKIs. Full extrapolation of the efficacy of&#xD;
      asciminib from adult to pediatric patients will be conducted. Full extrapolation is based on&#xD;
      the concept that CML in the pediatric population has the same pathogenesis, similar clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and progression pattern as in adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to support development of asciminib in the pediatric population (1&#xD;
      to &lt;18 years) with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&#xD;
      (PH+ CML-CP) previously treated with one or more Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      asciminib in pediatric patients with the goal of identifying the pediatric formulation dose&#xD;
      (fed) leading to asciminib exposure comparable to 40 mg BID in adult patients (fasted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pediatric formulation group will include at least 15 participants in each of the&#xD;
      following two age categories: 1 to &lt;12 years and 12 to &lt;18 years; leading to at least 30&#xD;
      participants enrolled treated with the pediatric formulation. It will follow a two-part study&#xD;
      design consisting of a dose determination part (Part 1) and a cohort expansion (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, 4-6 participants will be enrolled in order to obtain at least 4 participants&#xD;
      evaluable for PK (these participants may be from either of the age categories described&#xD;
      above). The initial starting dose will be based on body weight, and will be administered BID&#xD;
      with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the body weight adjusted dose has been determined in Part 1 of the study, the remaining&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in Part 2 until at least 30 participants, including those who were&#xD;
      included in Part 1, have been enrolled (15 per age group) in the pediatric formulation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that the pediatric formulation is currently in development and not yet&#xD;
      available, this study will start with the recruitment of adolescent patients. These&#xD;
      participants aged 14 to &lt;18 years, weighing at least 40 kg will receive the adult formulation&#xD;
      at a flat dose of 40 mg BID under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the treatment period of the study will be 5 years (260 weeks).&#xD;
      Participants who, according to Investigator's judgement, are benefiting from study treatment&#xD;
      will remain on treatment up to the completion of the treatment period (Week 260/5 years). The&#xD;
      primary analysis is planned after all participants have completed at least 52 weeks of study&#xD;
      treatment or discontinued earlier.&#xD;
