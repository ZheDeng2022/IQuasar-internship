    <textblock>
      A phase I/II clinical study of JS004 in subjects with head and neck cancer in China, to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, antitumor activity and biomarkers of&#xD;
      JS004, define the MTD and RP2D. A cycle is 21 days (3 weeks) which includes JS004 being&#xD;
      administered IV Q3W. All patients will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      and iRECIST, or intolerable toxicity per CTCAE 5.0, withdrawal of consent, or end of the&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs first.Disease progression must be confirmed at least 4 weeks but no&#xD;
      longer than 8 weeks after initial documentation of progression.&#xD;
