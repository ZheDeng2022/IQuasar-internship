  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CASES-TCM study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study, which will enroll&#xD;
      20,000 patients with acute stroke (ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage) within 7 days&#xD;
      of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study attempts to depict major clinical characteristics of acute stroke in patients with&#xD;
      Chinese medicine treatment and to explore any difference compared with other non-Chinese&#xD;
      medicine use cohorts and the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine.&#xD;

Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.5 - Severe disability.

    <measure>Change in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score between baseline (admission) and discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>At admission (baseline) and discharge (14 days - mean for length of hospitalization for stroke patients)</time_frame>
    <description>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. It is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
