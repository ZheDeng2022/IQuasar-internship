  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease. It is estimated that up to 40% of adults may&#xD;
      develop diabetes in their lifetime. Patients with poorly controlled blood sugars often visit&#xD;
      the emergency department for treatment of potentially dangerous and life-threatening&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, including &quot;diabetic ketoacidosis&quot; (DKA), a condition where the&#xD;
      body does not have enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin that is produced. As&#xD;
      a result, the body produces a chemical called &quot;ketones&quot; as another source of energy, which&#xD;
      increase the acid levels of blood and impairs organ function throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the emergency department, patients with DKA are usually treated with insulin and large&#xD;
      amounts of intravenous fluid. Recent research suggests the fluid type used may be important&#xD;
      in treating DKA. Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is the most commonly used intravenous&#xD;
      fluid in treating DKA, but it has a very high concentration of chloride and can lead to&#xD;
      additional acid production when given in large volumes. Ringer's lactate is another type of&#xD;
      intravenous fluid that more closely matches the chemistry of fluid in our bodies and in&#xD;
      theory, does not increase the acidity of blood. While there may be benefits to giving&#xD;
      Ringer's lactate instead of normal saline, past studies have included very few patients and&#xD;
      thus, definite recommendations on preferred fluid type still cannot be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's research question is: In adults with DKA, does giving Ringer's Lactate result in&#xD;
      faster resolution of DKA compared to normal saline? The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients who are given Ringer's Lactate will have faster resolution of DKA. If the hypothesis&#xD;
      is correct, results will provide scientific proof that current diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
      guidelines should change with respect to fluid choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with DKA presenting to the emergency department will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either normal saline or Ringer's Lactate. As this is an exploratory&#xD;
      (pilot) study, the main goal is to ensure that a larger study will be practical and feasible&#xD;
      on a scale involving multiple emergency departments across Canada. Completion of a larger&#xD;
      study across multiple sites with more patients will improve our understanding of how fluid&#xD;
      choice influences patient-important outcomes such as faster resolution of DKA (meaning&#xD;
      patients can leave hospital sooner), fewer admissions to the intensive care unit, fewer&#xD;
      deaths and fewer cases of permanent kidney damage. A total of 52 participants (26 per group)&#xD;
      will be recruited for this pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will assess the practicality of enrolling patients in London and help&#xD;
      identify barriers and problems with running a larger trial. The overall goal is to determine&#xD;
      if Ringer's Lactate will resolve DKA faster than normal saline. If this is true, patients may&#xD;
      spend less time in the hospital, which benefits both individual patients and the healthcare&#xD;
      system overall. If this hypothesis is correct, findings could provide high-level proof to&#xD;
      change current practice guidelines and affect DKA management globally.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening&#xD;
      complication of diabetes which requires treatment with intravenous (IV) fluid and insulin to&#xD;
      correct hyperglycemia and reverse acidosis. Current DKA management guidelines recommend&#xD;
      normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) for resuscitation and treatment.1-3 However, saline's&#xD;
      chloride content is higher than that of human plasma and can cause a hyperchloremic metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis, particularly when administered in large volumes (often needed in patients with&#xD;
      DKA). Use of saline may thus worsen the clinical condition of patients who are already in an&#xD;
      acidotic state.4-7 Alternatives to saline are balanced crystalloids (e.g. Ringer's&#xD;
      lactate-RL) which have chloride concentrations similar to human plasma; therefore, treatment&#xD;
      with balanced crystalloids may lead to faster DKA resolution. One recent study (Self et al.)&#xD;
      of emergency department (ED) patients presenting with DKA demonstrated that treatment with&#xD;
      balanced crystalloids resulted in more rapid DKA resolution compared to saline (13.0 vs 16.9&#xD;
      hours, p=0.004).8 While the difference in resolution time between groups was small, the&#xD;
      authors suggested that &quot;consistent implementation of interventions that deliver small&#xD;
      improvements in outcomes…can translate into substantial improvements in population health and&#xD;
      health system function.&quot; However, this study was single-centred, non-blinded, and was a&#xD;
      post-hoc subgroup analysis of completed trials (i.e. SMART9 and SALT-ED10) and power was not&#xD;
      prospectively calculated. Other studies on this topic have been limited due to small sample&#xD;
      sizes (45-77 patients) leading to low power with limited conclusions.11-14&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE(S); INCLUDING SPECIFIC AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESES The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients who are administered IV RL will have faster DKA resolution without a&#xD;
      concomitant increase in adverse outcomes when compared with normal saline. However, a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is necessary to assess the feasibility of a future&#xD;
      multi-centre trial. The specific objectives for this pilot study are to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a full-scale multi-centred RCT and to use this pilot data to inform&#xD;
      the future trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Design and Setting This will be a single-centre, triple-blind pilot RCT evaluating&#xD;
      the superiority of IV RL (intervention) compared to saline (comparator) in treating adult ED&#xD;
      patients presenting with DKA over a one-year period. The study setting is London Health&#xD;
      Sciences Centre (LHSC)'s Victoria Campus, an academic tertiary care centre with ~90,000 ED&#xD;
      visits/year in London, Ontario. Study conduct will be in accordance with the CONSORT&#xD;
      statement for pilot feasibility trials.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Screening, Consent, and Enrolment During weekday business hours (M-F&#xD;
      0700-1700), research assistants (RAs) will screen and identify eligible patients using the ED&#xD;
      tracking board. They will approach the treating physician to confirm eligibility before&#xD;
      discussing the study with the patient and seeking informed consent. Because the diagnosis of&#xD;
      DKA requires laboratory confirmation, all patients with a point-of-care blood glucose&#xD;
      confirming hyperglycemia (≥14mmol/L) will be approached for enrolment as a &quot;possible DKA&#xD;
      patient&quot;. If the treating physician agrees that DKA is possible and IV fluid is indicated,&#xD;
      study fluid will be administered per the randomization protocol after consent is obtained. If&#xD;
      patients are initially enrolled but the physician ultimately confirms they do not meet DKA&#xD;
      criteria, they will be excluded from the analysis. During evening and weekend hours, RAs will&#xD;
      be available on-call, however nighttime coverage (after 2300h) will not be feasible for this&#xD;
      pilot. After hours (and in the event study processes are affected by a prolonged COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic), treating physicians can directly enroll patients as there will be study posters to&#xD;
      outline enrolment processes and physicians will receive email and in-person reminders on&#xD;
      study recruitment. Study personnel will review daily ED visit logs to identify missed&#xD;
      patients to screen for bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Comparator The intervention is administration of IV Ringer's lactate and the&#xD;
      comparator is administration of IV normal saline. Rate of study fluid will be at the treating&#xD;
      physician's (both ED and inpatient, if consulted for admission) discretion. Apart from fluid&#xD;
      administered, there will be no other changes to the patient's clinical care, and patients&#xD;
      will receive standard DKA treatment which may include insulin, electrolyte replacement,&#xD;
      and/or supportive management. Pharmacy-prepared kits of 8 x 1L bags of study fluid (in Self&#xD;
      et al., a maximum of 7090mL was given8) will be kept in a secure space within the ED. Once&#xD;
      packaged, IV bags are useable for 30 days before expiration. If a kit is opened but not used&#xD;
      completely, individual 1L bags may be returned to the pharmacy to save on costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, Blinding, Allocation Concealment Enrolled patients will be block randomized to&#xD;
      treatment or comparator in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The block size will be unknown to&#xD;
      investigators and those involved in patient care and will be small enough to ensure balance&#xD;
      between each arm throughout the trial. The randomization list will be prepared by the&#xD;
      pharmacy. The patients, treating physicians, and outcome assessors will be blinded to&#xD;
      assigned treatment. The pharmacy will prepare an opaque covering over each fluid bag within&#xD;
      study kits, which will not be removed during the infusion to maintain blinding. Each bag will&#xD;
      be labelled with a kit number and scannable bar code to ensure the patient receives study&#xD;
      fluid as ordered which will be entered on their Medication Administration Record (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Study data for each enrolled patient will be abstracted from the hospital's&#xD;
      electronic medical records into the Lawson REDCap data storage platform. Study data will&#xD;
      include minimal demographic information (e.g. sex, date of birth), the patient's medical&#xD;
      history (e.g. comorbidities, medications), arrival ED information (e.g. CTAS, arrival&#xD;
      vitals), hospital interventions (e.g. IV fluids administered), comprehensive bloodwork&#xD;
      results, and discharge and outcome information (e.g. length of stay, intubation, diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS The investigators will follow an intention-to-treat analysis. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to summarize patient characteristics. Chi-square tests with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be used to examine differences in categorical variables between&#xD;
      groups, and two-tailed unpaired t-tests will be used to compare continuous variables. For&#xD;
      this pilot study, no interim analysis, Data Safety Monitoring Board, or adjudication&#xD;
      committee is planned, but these will be developed for the full-scale trial. This trial will&#xD;
      be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The full-scale multi-centred will include 516 participants (258 per arm),&#xD;
      assuming α=0.05, power=80%, 1:1 allocation, a 40% (6.76 hours) minimal clinically important&#xD;
      reduction in DKA resolution time, and 10% attrition rate. This trial will be conducted at 6&#xD;
      ED sites over 2 years. Based on this, the sample size for this local pilot RCT is 52&#xD;
      participants (26 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for Full-Scale Trial The sample size calculation for this trial was based on a&#xD;
      study of Clinical Effects of Balanced Crystalloids vs Saline in Adults with Diabetic&#xD;
      Ketoacidosis8 which compared the clinical effects of balanced crystalloids with the clinical&#xD;
      effects of saline for the acute treatment in DKA in two clinical trials (Isotonic Solutions&#xD;
      and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial [SMART]9 and the Saline Against Lactated Ringer's or&#xD;
      Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency Department [SALT-ED]10). The primary outcome for this comparison&#xD;
      was the time between ED presentation and DKA resolution, measured in hours. Self et al.&#xD;
      (2020) found an absolute reduction in time to DKA resolution of 3.9 hours. In the balanced&#xD;
      crystalloids group (n=94), the median time to resolution of DKA was 13.0 hrs [IQR: 9.5-18.8],&#xD;
      while in the saline group (n=78) the median time to resolution was 16.9 hrs [IQR: 11.9-34.5].&#xD;
      The IQR was used to calculate the standard deviation for each group based on the following&#xD;
      assumption for normally distributed data: SD=IQR/1.35. The pooled standard deviation was then&#xD;
      calculated based on the sample size and standard deviation of each group from the Self et al.&#xD;
      (2020) study [√((n1-1)*SD12 + (n2- 1)*SD22)/(n1+n2-2))] and was determined to be 12.37. To&#xD;
      establish superiority of balanced crystalloids versus saline in the time to resolution of&#xD;
      DKA, a superiority margin for a clinically significant difference was chosen to be a 40%&#xD;
      (=6.76 hours) reduction in time to resolution of DKA based on expert consensus and patient&#xD;
      partner feedback. A conservative attrition rate of 10% was selected for the sample size&#xD;
      calculation, as loss to follow-up rates should be low given the nature of the intervention&#xD;
      (IV fluids) and follow-up period (&lt;24 hours). The actual attrition rate determined by this&#xD;
      pilot study will inform the sample size calculation for the full-scale multicentre study.&#xD;
      Therefore, to achieve 80% power at the 5% level of significance with equal allocation, the&#xD;
      sample size for the balanced crystalloids (Ringer's lactate) group and the saline group,&#xD;
      while accounting for a 10% loss to follow up and a 25% reduction in time to DKA resolution,&#xD;
      is 516 participants (258 per group). The sample size was calculated using Wang and Ji's&#xD;
      (2020) method16 for common clinical study designs available at&#xD;
      http://riskcalc.org:3838/samplesize/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct the full-scale trial at 6 ED sites over 2 years, which&#xD;
      would require an average minimum recruitment of 86 participants per site (43 per site per&#xD;
      year). This research group has established relationships with these other Canadian EDs and&#xD;
      have previously conducted successful studies. If further sites are needed for recruitment,&#xD;
      the investigators will leverage the Network of Canadian Emergency Researchers (NCER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size for Pilot Trial For the full-scale trial, a minimum of 43 participants must be&#xD;
      recruited annually per site on average. The LHSC Victoria Campus ED treats approximately 130&#xD;
      patients with DKA annually, based on the hospital's Decision Support data from the most&#xD;
      recent fiscal year (Mar 1 2019 - Feb 29 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DKA by Site Patients Victoria Hospital 130 (E1010) Type 1 DM with ketoacidosis 70 (E1110)&#xD;
      Type 2 DM with ketoacidosis 51 (E1112) Type 2 DM with keto &amp; lactic acidosis 1 (E1410)&#xD;
      Unspecified DM with ketoacidosis 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on research team hours of coverage (0700-2300) and past data from ED presentation time&#xD;
      of potentially eligible patients, the investigators expect to approach at least 104 (80%) of&#xD;
      eligible patients in the one-year pilot study period, and a minimum of 43 approached&#xD;
      participants (41.3%) must be recruited to meet the feasibility target. According to data from&#xD;
      similar past trials, the investigators anticipate being able to recruit at least 50% of&#xD;
      approached patients (target sample size of 52 patients, 26 in each arm). With 104 patients&#xD;
      approached per year, a 90% two-sided confidence interval around the anticipated recruitment&#xD;
      rate will have a total width of 0.17, i.e. a lower limit of 0.415 and an upper limit of&#xD;
      0.585. Because the lower limit excludes the minimum feasibility target of 41.3%, the&#xD;
      investigators can be 90% confident that the future trial is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Patients may refuse to participate,&#xD;
      refuse to answer any questions, or withdraw from the study at any time with no effect on&#xD;
      their future care. Participants do not waive any legal rights by signing the consent form.&#xD;
      They will receive a copy of the letter of information should they be willing to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no anticipated risks to participating in this study, other than a low possibility&#xD;
      of a privacy breach occurring with the data collected during this study. However, the study&#xD;
      team will take all necessary precautions to prevent this from happening and will remove any&#xD;
      personal identifiers from all data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BENEFITS For participants who are randomized to the Ringer's Lactate Group, there is a&#xD;
      possibility that they may benefit from this intervention. The hypothesized benefit from the&#xD;
      administration of the IV Ringer's Lactate may include improved faster resolution of DKA than&#xD;
      if IV normal saline was administered. However, there is no guarantee that participants will&#xD;
      benefit personally from participating in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will contribute important knowledge regarding DKA treatment. This pilot study will&#xD;
      directly inform if a full-scale clinical trial evaluating the use of a Ringer's Lactate&#xD;
      compared to normal saline as part of DKA care in the ED is possible.&#xD;

               -  Are initially seen at another ED and transferred to LHSC for care and/or&#xD;
                  admission&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Receive &gt;1L of IV fluid prior to enrolment (e.g. pre-hospital by EMS or while&#xD;
                  waiting to be seen) - this may cause study contamination&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are initially enrolled due to clinical suspicion of DKA based on elevated&#xD;
                  point-of-care glucose, but ultimately do not meet clinical/laboratory criteria&#xD;
                  for DKA (e.g. &quot;hyperglycemia&quot; only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have euglycemic DKA (generally those on SGLT-2 inhibitors)&#xD;
