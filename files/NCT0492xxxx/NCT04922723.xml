  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TMZ is a standard therapy for GBM. The study will demonstrate that Daratumumab can&#xD;
      collaborate with TMZ to enhance the cytotoxicity against GBM cells. Collectively, the&#xD;
      preclinical data along with existing in vivo studies by others provides the rationale for&#xD;
      therapeutic targeting of CD38 in GBM and its microenvironment. Daratumumab is commercially&#xD;
      available, is safe and well tolerated when combined with alkylating chemotherapy, radiation&#xD;
      therapy and has attained therapeutic CSF levels. Thus, the addition of Daratumumab to the&#xD;
      frontline treatment regimen of GBM can potentially have a significant clinical benefit.&#xD;
      Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled in this trial. Up to 6 will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      phase I part and 10 to 13 in the phase II part to come up with a total of 16 patients with 2&#xD;
      phases combined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer. Current therapeutic strategies include&#xD;
      maximal safe surgical resection followed by course of Temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT). Despite trimodality treatment, recurrence remains inevitable. Our study will&#xD;
      use Daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, in combination with TMZ and RT in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM patients. There is pre-clinical evidence suggesting Daratumumab is cytotoxic to&#xD;
      GBM in a multimodal fashion, its safe when combined with chemotherapy &amp; radiation therapy as&#xD;
      well as has the potential to cross blood brain barrier.&#xD;

If there is no DLT in the first 3 patients, the investigators will move forward to conduct the phase II clinical trial. If there is a DLT, another three patients will be enrolled. The study may be suspended with additional discussions in the data monitoring committee if there are ≥2 identified DLTs in the first 3 patients or ≥2 DLTs in the first 6 patients.

             to assess the risk of Daratumumab during pregnancy. On the other hand, TMZ is a&#xD;
             category D drug where adverse events are observed in animal reproduction studies. May&#xD;
             cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant females. Male and female patients&#xD;
