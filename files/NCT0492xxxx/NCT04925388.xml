    <textblock>
      Hospitals, and more specifically Intensive Care Units (ICU), face the challenging issue of&#xD;
      emergence and rapid spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR). In some cases, the&#xD;
      therapeutic choice is extremely limited. Prevention and adequacy of antibiotic therapy (AB)&#xD;
      are the key responses applied toward these threats. A delayed adequate AB is a known factor&#xD;
      of poor prognosis. Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are frequent, polymicrobial and life&#xD;
      threatening diseases. Source control and adequate AB are instrumental issues in this setting.&#xD;
      Despite technical advances, susceptibility testing of the microorganisms collected from&#xD;
      peritoneal samples is not usually available before day two or three after surgery. In this&#xD;
      time lapse, empiric AB might be inadequate (not targeting all the pathogens, which leads to a&#xD;
      prolonged duration of AB and potential increased morbidity/mortality risk) or too broad (with&#xD;
      the two issues of ecology with an increased risk of selection of MDR bacteria and additional&#xD;
      costs). In a pilot study evaluating the potential benefit of a direct culture of peritoneal&#xD;
      samples from resuscitation patients treated for peritonitis, we observed that conventional&#xD;
      treatment made it possible to obtain microbiological results within a median of 3 [extremes&#xD;
      2-7] days whereas a direct microbiological technique by E-test gave results in 1 [1-2] days&#xD;
      (p &lt;0.0001). With this technique close to conventional microbiological, a change in&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy could have been achieved within an average of 1 [1-2] days versus 4 [1-11]&#xD;
      days with conventional management (p = 0, 0006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of modern molecular techniques suggests that a large margin of improvement&#xD;
      for the rendering and the precision of the results is possible.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiinfective agents are aimed at eradicating microorganisms, or at least significantly&#xD;
      reducing the size of inoculum to facilitate the natural activity of host defence mechanisms.&#xD;
      One of the most challenging issues faced by prescribers is the emergence of multidrug&#xD;
      resistant bacteria (MDR) and fungi, especially in the ICU setting. In some instances, the&#xD;
      therapeutic options are extremely limited or even totally inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responses to this threat are improvements in prevention of nosocomial infection,&#xD;
      antiinfective stewardship policy, and a better use of available resources including&#xD;
      optimization of antibiotic therapy from the empiric phase of treatment. The optimization of&#xD;
      antibiotic and antifungal therapy is a key issue. In a recent paper analysing the antibiotic&#xD;
      prescription in a tertiary care hospital over a 9 to 10 weeks period, the authors reported an&#xD;
      inappropriateness in 37% of the cases involving indication of therapy (17.5%), choice of the&#xD;
      spectrum (7.6%) and application of the treatment (dosage, timing, duration…)(9.3%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed adequacy for antibiotic therapy is a known factor of prolonged duration of&#xD;
      anti-infective therapy and consequently of selection pressure. Adequacy is defined as the&#xD;
      microbiologically effective antimicrobial treatment against the causative pathogens. A&#xD;
      decreased duration of antibiotic therapy is an easy to implement strategy to decrease the&#xD;
      emergence of resistance both at individual and community levels. This strategy of a reduced&#xD;
      duration of therapy has additional potential advantages such decreased incidence of adverse&#xD;
      effects and reduced costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of an empiric antibiotic (AB) therapy is often a difficult challenge. Despite&#xD;
      advances in conventional microbiologic techniques, identification and susceptibility testing&#xD;
      of the microorganisms collected from a suspected infectious site are not usually available&#xD;
      before day two or three after sampling. In this time lapse, empiric AB therapy might not&#xD;
      target all the pathogens, which leads to a prolonged duration of AB and potential increased&#xD;
      morbidity/mortality rates. To overcome this uncertainty, physicians frequently prescribe very&#xD;
      broad-spectrum empiric regimens to target a maximum number of potential pathogens. This is&#xD;
      specifically the case in ICUs where life-threatening infections justify this policy. However,&#xD;
      as mentioned above, the consequences in terms of selection pressure, cost and adverse effects&#xD;
      are of major importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the disadvantage of delayed microbiologic results, some authors in ICU medicine&#xD;
      tried to shorten the delay of results of susceptibility testing in using direct E-test. The&#xD;
      E-test antimicrobial susceptibility procedure is a quantitative method for antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility testing that consists of a reagent strip with a predefined gradient of AB. The&#xD;
      stable gradient provides an inoculum tolerant system that allows its application directly to&#xD;
      clinical specimens. This method has been shown to be reliable for predicting the&#xD;
      susceptibility of microorganisms directly from positive blood cultures. It has also been&#xD;
      applied directly to sputum samples from patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the&#xD;
      physicians in charge of the patient still have to wait for at least 24 hours before having&#xD;
      the first results of bacterial growth and susceptibility. However, in case of slow-growth&#xD;
      this delay could be enlarged. In addition, this technique is inaccurate for antifungal&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major advances in molecular biology over the last decade led to the development of rapid&#xD;
      diagnosis and identification techniques. Techniques of genomic analyses bring important&#xD;
      information on pathogen identification and on presence of certain resistance genes in hours&#xD;
      rather than days and allow an early adaptation of antibiotic treatment,allowing the physician&#xD;
      to choose the most accurate therapeutic strategies. Promising results have been obtained in&#xD;
      the field of pneumonia. On the opposite, few data are available in intra-abdominal&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Unyvero (Curetis) platform is a turnkey rapid diagnostic system that can be used to&#xD;
      diagnose severe infections in 4 to 5 hours. The Unyvero IAI panel (Intra-Abdominal Infection)&#xD;
      covers the bacteria involved in IAI, such as Gram negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae,&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii), Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus spp.,&#xD;
      Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.), anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spp., B fragilis,&#xD;
      Prevotella spp.) and fungi (Candida albicans, C glabrata, C tropicalis, Candida spp.), as&#xD;
      well as some antibiotic resistance genes such as certain ESBL (CTX-M) and carbapenemases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These infections are among the most frequent complications in surgical patients and are&#xD;
      marked by a severe prognosis. They are characterized by high proportions of MDR isolates,&#xD;
      reaching 85% of all the cultured organisms. In addition, the characteristics of bowel flora&#xD;
      with mixed Gram positive, Gram negative and anaerobes bacteria lead to the constant threat of&#xD;
      inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy. These IAI need an early efficient antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      combined to source control, especially in the most severe cases admitted in ICU.&#xD;
      Postoperative IAI are the cases where the needs for an adequate antibiotic treatment from the&#xD;
      empiric phase are the most significant. In community-acquired infections, guidelines have&#xD;
      been published that give satisfactory results in a vast majority of the cases. On the&#xD;
      opposite in postoperative cases, many unsolved questions remain depending of the case mix and&#xD;
      local epidemiology, leading to high proportion of inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy, and&#xD;
      consequently increased duration of treatment, delayed adequacy and increased mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fungal infections, especially candidas are another issue in these cases of IAI. These&#xD;
      microorganisms are reported in up to 30% of the operative samples in postoperative&#xD;
      intraabdominal infections. However, due to the lack of relevant clinical criteria and the&#xD;
      slow growth of these microorganisms, more than 70% of all antifungal empiric therapies given&#xD;
      for these patients are inappropriate, and not necessary in most of them. In line with the&#xD;
      French recommendations, in patients at risk of fungal infections an empiric antifungal&#xD;
      therapy will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every approach aimed at improving the empiric antiinfective therapy in postoperative IAI is&#xD;
      welcomed. To our knowledge, few data are available addressing this issue. Techniques derived&#xD;
      from conventional cultures are of interest but the delay to reach bacterial growth remains&#xD;
      high and obviously &gt;24 hours. Due to the capacities of the rapid molecular diagnostic test,&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions (initiation of empirical therapy, interruption of unnecessary empirical&#xD;
      therapy or adjunction of specific additional regimens such as antifungal agents) could be&#xD;
      performed in a few hours. The potential benefit of these techniques and gain of time could be&#xD;
      illustrated in an experimental pilot study performed in our unit analysing peritoneal samples&#xD;
      of ICU patients with secondary peritonitis when these new molecular techniques were not yet&#xD;
      available. The conventional approach brought results in a median delay of 3 [extremes 2-7]&#xD;
      days while the use of direct antibiotic-enriched agar plates were available in 1 [1-2] days&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0001). A change in AB regimens would have been made in a median delay of 4 [1-11] days&#xD;
      versus 1 [1-2] days if direct cultures were applied, respectively (p=0.0006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an external evaluation of a multiplex PRC rapid test for detection of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal infections was assessed in 4 laboratories of microbiology. Three hundred&#xD;
      clinical samples were evaluated including 107 peritoneal fluids, 47 ascites, 36 peritoneal&#xD;
      cavity drain fluids, 32 swabs (eswab fluid as well as charcoal swabs), 27 pus, 29 bile, 7&#xD;
      tissue samples, 7 aspirates, 5 pancreatic fluids, and 3 samples were from blood culture&#xD;
      bottles inoculated with peritoneal fluid. Microbiology results were negative for 86 samples.&#xD;
      Of these, 62 samples (72%) were also negative with the Unyvero IAI test while pathogens were&#xD;
      detected in the remaining 24. In 16/24 samples, the pathogens detected by Unyvero IAI were&#xD;
      confirmed by sequencing. Overall Sensitivity was 91.2% and Specificity 99.5%. Most pathogens&#xD;
      detected by the Unyvero IAI test achieved a sensitivity of at least 80.0% while 12/27 panel&#xD;
      targets achieved a sensitivity of 100%. Specificity ranges from 97.3% to 100% over all panel&#xD;
      targets.The Unyvero IAI cartridge was able to detect additional microorganisms in particular&#xD;
      anaerobes with most detections confirmed by sequencing. Time to identification was reduced by&#xD;
      an average of about 17h (39:06 ± 16:09 h for microbiology vs 22:02 ±4:12 h Unyvero IAI (ID&#xD;
      +resistance markers)) and time to full microbiological results was reduced by an average of&#xD;
      about 41h (64.19 ± 12.10 h for microbiology vs. 23.44 ± 3. 58 for Unyvero IAI). The most&#xD;
      frequent resistance markers detected were mecA/mecC (n=25), aacA4 (n=20), blaCTX-M (n=17) and&#xD;
      nine instances of carbapenemase were identified. PPV range from 62.5 to 93.8% while NPV range&#xD;
      from 70.2 to 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a rapid molecular diagnostic test by multiplex PCR on the peritoneal samples from&#xD;
      ICU patients admitted for an intra-abdominal infection is feasible and makes it possible to&#xD;
      obtain the identification of the germs present in the clinical sample and detect the presence&#xD;
      of certain resistance genes in the first 24 hours after surgery, making it possible to reduce&#xD;
      exposure to antibiotics and antifungals without increasing the frequency of clinical or&#xD;
      microbiological failures&#xD;
