  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) pandemia is&#xD;
      considered to be the current major global health issue. With no specific treatment or vaccine&#xD;
      known to be licensed, empowering the immune system to overcome the inflammatory status&#xD;
      associated with the late stages of the disease, particularly by anti-inflammatory nutrients,&#xD;
      is of great concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective in reducing both the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections, including&#xD;
      measles, vitamin A and its derivatives are reported to enhance the immune system and/or&#xD;
      antibody response to virus vaccinations in children, particularly those with vitamin&#xD;
      insufficiency. Retinoids are, therefore, proposed as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19. The study is aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin A supplementation on&#xD;
      disease improvement in pediatric and adolescent patients with either moderate or severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
