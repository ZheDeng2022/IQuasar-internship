  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present clinical trial is to determine whether the use of an elastic&#xD;
      abdominal binder is effective in the non-pharmacological management of symptomatic,&#xD;
      neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) in individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) or Parkinson variant multiple system atrophy (MSA-P).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial with an open-label treatment extension phase. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      recruit n = 30 individuals with MSA-P or PD with known or suspected OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening Visit, after patient information and written informed consent, the&#xD;
      participants will first undergo a comprehensive neurological and cardiological evaluation, as&#xD;
      well cardiovascular autonomic function testing to confirm the diagnosis of symptomatic,&#xD;
      neurogenic OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the participants will be asked to wear physical activity monitoring (PAM) sensors&#xD;
      for five consecutive days and to measure the blood pressure (BP) regularly following a home&#xD;
      BP diary (i.e. Home Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On treatment day-1 (i.e. Visit 1), the participants will undergo an instrumented in-lab gait&#xD;
      analysis, followed by a head-up tilt and active standing test. Afterwards, they will wear the&#xD;
      first type of binder for two hours (either the investigational elastic abdominal binder or&#xD;
      the placebo-comparator binder, depending on the randomization assignment). At the end of the&#xD;
      two hours, the participants will repeat the in-lab gait analysis and the head-up tilt-/active&#xD;
      standing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one-day wash-out, the same procedure of treatment day-1 (i.e. Visit 1) will be repeated&#xD;
      with the outstanding type of binder (i.e. treatment day-2, Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this, all participants will be invited to wear the investigational elastic&#xD;
      abdominal binder and the PAM sensors for five more days and to repeat the home BP&#xD;
      measurements (i.e. Home Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final follow-up visit is scheduled to return the PAM sensors, the BP monitor and to detect&#xD;
      eventual adverse and serious adverse events occurred during Home Phase II.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;ABDO-SYNCRO 3-BAHNIG&quot; is an elastic abdominal binder with a 3-stripes Velcro fastening, capable of developing a 20 ± 2 mmHg pressure on the abdominal wall. This device will be tested as potentially beneficial with respect to the mentioned primary and secondary outcomes. The investigators anticipate to use this elastic abdominal binder, since participants of a previous trial reported this device to be comfortable enough and to have used it regularly during the open-label follow-up phase. Size will be chosen depending on the abdominal circumference of the participant, according to the size tables provided from the manufacturer (SYNCRO-MED GmbH).</description>
