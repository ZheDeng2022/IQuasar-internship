  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first report of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      variant of concern (VOC) P.1 in Manaus, Brazil, a rapid spread of this lineage across the&#xD;
      country has been observed. Recent studies indicate that this variant is associated with&#xD;
      higher transmissibility; it is not known whether it is associated with clinical severity and&#xD;
      higher mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective cohort study carried out at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.&#xD;
      Adult patients aged 18 years or more and 65 years or less who were admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      due to symptomatic COVID-19 from June 2020 to May 2021 and had a reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold value for either SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      N1 or N2 target ≤ 25 were eligible to the study. Samples from 86 patients (43 from June 2020&#xD;
      to November 2020 and 43 from February 2021 to May 2021) were sequenced for further&#xD;
      evaluation. These dates were defined since the emergence of P.1 lineage in late January.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data regarding ventilatory support, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory findings&#xD;
      and mortality were collected from each patient. This retrospective cohort aims to assess&#xD;
      whether the number of days needed for supplementary oxygen either by noninvasive ventilation&#xD;
      or high-flow nasal cannula from onset of symptoms differs among patients infected with the&#xD;
      P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant and those infected with other variants.&#xD;
