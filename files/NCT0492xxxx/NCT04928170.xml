  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease and is characterized by cartilage&#xD;
      destruction, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone sclerosis and cysts. Modern treatment&#xD;
      strategies, as well as preventive measures, include early detection and knowledge of the&#xD;
      early course of the disease. This includes how stress patterns, physical activity, impaired&#xD;
      function and metabolic changes and other comorbidities affect development and possible&#xD;
      associations with osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective was to study the early development of osteoarthritis of the knee and&#xD;
      its association with hand- and general osteoarthritis, metabolic diseases, biomarkers,&#xD;
      long-term pain, physical function and stress patterns&#xD;

      The overall objective was to study the early development of osteoarthritis of the knee and&#xD;
      its association with hand- and general osteoarthritis, metabolic diseases, biomarkers,&#xD;
      long-term pain, physical function and stress patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 4 different research areas that are studied with the help of several&#xD;
      smaller sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research area 1: Metabolic osteoarthritis - to study the connections between metabolic&#xD;
      factors and osteoarthritis development in the knee and hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Relationship between knee osteoarthritis and metabolic factors B. Relationship between&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the hand and metabolic factors Research area 2: Biomarkers in knee and hand&#xD;
      osteoarthritis - to study cartilage and bone markers that reflect different processes in&#xD;
      osteoarthritis development, e.g. inflammation, matrix degradation both in the short and long&#xD;
      term Research area 3: Pain and osteoarthritis - to study pain development and pain pressure&#xD;
      thresholds in relation to lifestyle, depression and health-related quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis Research area 4: Physical function and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis - to study physical function, physical activity and measured stress patterns,&#xD;
      as well as changes in stress patterns and the relationship between these and the development&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a longitudinal cohort study including 306 individuals with knee pain in&#xD;
      the southwest of Sweden, the Halland osteoarthritis (HALLOA) cohort. The enrolments took&#xD;
      place from 2017-2019. The participants were recruited: 1) by primary health care clinics when&#xD;
      searching care for knee pain, or 2) by advertisements in local newspapers. The inclusion&#xD;
      criterions were current knee pain, aged 30-65 years, with no former known radiographic knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (RKOA). the exclusion criterions were no cruciate ligament rupture or&#xD;
      rheumatologic disorder. A general practitioner examined all participants to confirm the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be followed for five years with yearly follow-ups.&#xD;
