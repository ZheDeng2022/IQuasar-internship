  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, single-center study to assess the safety of&#xD;
      tislelizumab with BCG, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy results in subjects who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC without prior BCG treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 130,000 new cases were diagnosed with bladder cancer in China each year. About&#xD;
      75-85% of them are NMIBC. The standard care for high risk (HR) NMIBC is intravesicular BCG&#xD;
      instillation. Despite BCG treatment, 40% of patients will eventually experience a recurrence,&#xD;
      which is associated with a poorer prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center Phase I safety and efficacy study of tislelizumab with BCG treatment.&#xD;
      The study will determine the safety of administering tislelizumab at 200mg iv q3w in&#xD;
      conjunction with intravesicular BCG treatment in HR NMIBC patients who was treatment-naïve or&#xD;
      BCG naïve, but underwent TURBT to remove all resectable disease (residual CIS acceptable)&#xD;
      within 6 weeks and confirm absence of muscle invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCG installation was the stander treatment for HR NMIBC. Despite BCG treatment, 40% of&#xD;
      patients will eventually experience a recurrence, which is associated with a poorer&#xD;
      prognosis. It was reported that BCG increased antigen expression and cytokine release from&#xD;
      tumor cells, leading to immune cell (e.g. CD4+ and CD8+T cells, NK, macrophages) recruitment&#xD;
      and immune-mediated cytotoxicity (indirect effect). PD-L1 expression intravesicular is found&#xD;
      to be extremely abundant in the tumor tissue in patients failing BCG treatment. Which may&#xD;
      inhibit the T cell to eliminate cancer cells. Based on these data, a combination of&#xD;
      tislelizumab with BCG may be effective in preventing recurrence of NMIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 subjects will be treated at a dose of 200 mg tislelizumab with 120 mg BCG to explode&#xD;
      safety for the combination though observing DLT within 28days. If no safety issues are&#xD;
      present, we will carry out multi-cohort Phase II study（TACBIN-02）&#xD;
