  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of super hypofractionated&#xD;
      whole breast irradiation (SHF-WBI) in breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving&#xD;
      surgery. Eligible breast cancer patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate&#xD;
      the acute and late radiation-induced toxicities, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis,&#xD;
      death, contralateral breast cancer and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible breast cancer patients will receive SHF-WBI of 5.2 Gy in 5 fractions to ipsilateral&#xD;
      whole breast within one week and a sequential tumor bed boost of 5.2 Gy in 2 fractions at the&#xD;
      discretion of the radiation oncologist. All patients are treated with intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT) technique. The primary endpoint is ≥2 grade any acute radiation&#xD;
      induced toxicity event. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate the acute&#xD;
      and late radiation-induced toxicity, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, death and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with&#xD;
      a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 10% during and within 6 months after SHF-WBI&#xD;
      comparing to hypofractionated whole breast irradiation(40-42.5Gy/15-16Fx) and lost rate of&#xD;
      follow up of 10%. In total 217 patients are needed to be recruited.&#xD;
