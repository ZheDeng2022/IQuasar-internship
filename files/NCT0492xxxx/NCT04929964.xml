    <textblock>
      The objective was to find out the impact of COVID-19 on stage of breast cancer at&#xD;
      presentation and its effects on overall onco-surgical management. The investigator carried&#xD;
      out this research to see the presenting stage of breast cancer in the participants in this&#xD;
      pandemic and correlate its effect on stage of breast cancer and upstaging of disease&#xD;

      This retrospective observational study was conducted at department of surgery PNS Shifa&#xD;
      hospital Karachi after obtaining permission from ethical review committee. Participant's data&#xD;
      of all operated cases for suspicious lump breast (abnormal findings on ultrasound and&#xD;
      mammogram, BIRAD III or above and abnormal FNAC results;C3 or above) from January1,2020 to 31&#xD;
      January 2021 was retrieved. Out of these only those participants were included in whom the&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed on histo-pathological examination. Participants who&#xD;
      had already had their surgery pre covid (December 2019), were excluded. Data were collected&#xD;
      on standard pre-designed questionnaire and from paper documents retrieved from patient&#xD;
      records. Participant presentation time was calculated as the time interval between the&#xD;
      appearance of the first symptoms of breast cancer (day 0) and the date of initial&#xD;
      presentation to hospital by patient and consultation for breast symptoms. Time taken for&#xD;
      start of treatment was calculated by counting number of days from the first presentation day&#xD;
      to hospital until the date when definitive treatment for Carcinoma Breast was initiated&#xD;
      (chemo/radio/surgery). Time duration for definitive surgery was counted from the day of first&#xD;
      presentation to the hospital till the date surgery was conducted(modified radical mastectomy&#xD;
      (MRM)/breast conserving surgery (BCS)/toilet mastectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presentation 'Delay' was defined as a patient reporting to the hospital for medical advice 30&#xD;
      days after noticing the first possible symptoms of breast cancer while time taken for start&#xD;
      of treatment was calculated form time of first presentation to hospital (day 0) till the&#xD;
      first day of start of definitive first treatment for breast cancer. The investigator labelled&#xD;
      delay in treatment if it was initiated later than 62days .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire inquired about the symptoms, date of presentation of the first symptoms,&#xD;
      date of first reporting to hospital, reasons for the delayed presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who were admitted and underwent pre anesthesia assessment underwent COVID&#xD;
      testing according to the protocol. If the patient turned out COVID positive, their symptoms&#xD;
      were noted and the COVID team (infectious disease department) was notified. The quarantine&#xD;
      protocol at investigating hospital was, complete isolation for 14 days with one PCR-negative&#xD;
      report after completing quarantine, with no residual respiratory symptoms of cough, fever,&#xD;
      and shortness of breath. This protocol was followed for all elective breast surgery patients&#xD;
      admitted in the hospital. All COVID-positive patients underwent the same treatment protocol&#xD;
      as non-COVID patients with regards to management of breast cancer. Patients with early breast&#xD;
      cancer (upto stage 2A) underwent modified radical mastectomy/breast conservative surgery&#xD;
      first, followed by chemotherapy/radiotherapy, locally advanced cases (stage 2B and above) had&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant treatment first followed by surgery, and advanced cases(stage 4/metastatic)&#xD;
      underwent palliative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data obtained were analyzed using IBM SPSS 23.0. Descriptive statistics like age were&#xD;
      presented as range and means. Categorical data were analyzed using fisher exact test and&#xD;
      t-test was applied to numerical data. In all cases, a 95% confidence interval was used and p&#xD;
      value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
