  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle super ovulating drugs (gonadotropins) are usually&#xD;
      taken to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg. In Vitro Fertilization protocols&#xD;
      are constantly under review in order to improve the recruitment of the follicles, which&#xD;
      contain the eggs, whilst minimizing the doses of gonadotrophins required, with the ultimate&#xD;
      aim of increasing the live birth rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The addition of growth hormone, which is a biological hormone that can be synthetically&#xD;
      produced, as a supplement to gonadotrophins in an In Vitro Fertilization cycle has been&#xD;
      suggested as a way in which In Vitro Fertilization pregnancy rates may be increased.Growth&#xD;
      hormone has been shown, in animal and human studies, to be important in the recruitment of&#xD;
      follicles.However, to date, only a limited number of clinical studies have been performed in&#xD;
      order to assess whether the addition of growth hormone can improve the probability of&#xD;
      pregnancy in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for In Vitro Fertilization. As the total&#xD;
      number of patients analysed in these studies was small it has not been possible to determine&#xD;
      whether if there is any improvement the outcome of an In Vitro Fertilization cycle when a&#xD;
      woman is given growth hormone therapy as a supplement during her treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using growth hormone therapy as&#xD;
      a supplement to the administration of gonadotropins in an antagonist In Vitro Fertilization&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
