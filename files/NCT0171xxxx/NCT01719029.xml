    <textblock>
      A better understanding of the optimal diet for women with gestational diabetes is fundamental&#xD;
      to the management of this rapidly growing problem in pregnancy. Careful comparison studies of&#xD;
      the current low- carbohydrate, higher-fat diet versus a diet higher in complex carbohydrate&#xD;
      but lower in fat is critical in order to determine which diet results in a more favorable&#xD;
      maternal 24-hour glucose, lipid, and inflammatory profile, all of which directly effect&#xD;
      optimal fetal growth and may influence the future health of the offspring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the doubling in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) over the last&#xD;
      10 years, dietary management guidelines remain ambiguous due to the paucity of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. New diagnostic criteria recently developed for the diagnosis of GDM are&#xD;
      expected to increase the prevalence to 10-15% of all pregnant women. There is growing&#xD;
      recognition that GDM has long-term implications on maternal risk for diabetes and that the&#xD;
      intrauterine GDM environment is an independent risk factor for childhood obesity and impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance. Yet, how diet can be used to modify fetal fuel and attenuate this risk&#xD;
      remains unknown in humans. Fundamental to the management of GDM is dietary intervention, yet&#xD;
      the historic practice of advising a low-carbohydrate (CHO), higher-fat diet has not been&#xD;
      sufficiently tested. Both animal and non-human primate data support a fetal programming&#xD;
      influence that maternal high-fat diets may promote insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,&#xD;
      and hepatic steatosis in the offspring. Recent human data suggest that high maternal&#xD;
      triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA), variables sensitive to dietary manipulation,&#xD;
      are independent risk factors for fetal macrosomia and adiposity. As a result, consensus&#xD;
      groups have abandoned any specific diet recommendations for women with GDM. Despite the&#xD;
      pivotal role of diet therapy in the treatment of GDM, no randomized trials have directly&#xD;
      compared glycemic and lipoprotein profiles of the conventional higher-fat diet with any other&#xD;
      diet. To address this critical need, the aims of this randomized cross-over trial are to&#xD;
      study the effects of a high complex carbohydrate/low-fat diet (HC/LF; 60% CHO, 25% fat, 15%&#xD;
      protein) compared to the usual care, low-CHO/higher fat diet (LC/HF; 40% CHO, 45% fat, and&#xD;
      15% protein) in GDM women on: 1) 72-hour glycemic profiles using a continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring system within subjects; 2) postprandial lipemia by measuring serial plasma TG and&#xD;
      FFA over a 5-hour, post-breakfast meal period within subjects; and 3) maternal lipoproteins,&#xD;
      inflammatory profiles, and in-vitro adipose tissue lipolysis after 6-8 weeks of diet therapy&#xD;
      between subjects. We will also measure neonatal adiposity by air displacement plethysmography&#xD;
      and newborn markers of lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and dietary fat intake in the babies&#xD;
      born to mothers with GDM. This pilot study will directly test which GDM diet is most&#xD;
      effective in limiting maternal hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      fashion, potentially optimizing fetal substrate availability and fetal growth. Our goal is to&#xD;
      determine which diet intervention might favorably impact a cycle that could otherwise&#xD;
      perpetuate future diabetes, obesity, and CVD in both mother and offspring.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Inclusion Criteria. Potential participants will be â‰¥ 0-36 years old,&#xD;
        which includes the offspring of the pregnant mothers with GDM. Pregnant women will be&#xD;
        between the ages of 18-40 years and will have a BMI of 26 - 35 kg/m2 at the time of&#xD;
        diagnosis, a singleton pregnancy, and will not be taking medication for their GDM on&#xD;
        entrance to the study. Subjects will have been diagnosed with GDM according to the criteria&#xD;
        established by the ADA and the ACOG (19;35;53), specifically, they will meet the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 50-gram Glucola in which the one hour reading is &gt;200 mg/dL and the FBG is &gt;95 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two abnormal values on a 100-gram 3 hour glucose tolerance test based on the Coustan&#xD;
             and Carpenter criteria as adopted by the ADA and Fourth International Workshop on&#xD;
             Gestational Diabetes (76;77):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting &gt; or = to 95 mg/dL but &lt;126 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1 hr &gt;/= 180 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 hr &gt;/= 155 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3 hr &gt;/=140 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Those women with overt diabetes and those suspected of having&#xD;
        preexisting diabetes by any of the following criteria will be excluded, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting glucose &gt;110 mg/dL, due to the high likelihood of rapidly failing diet and&#xD;
             requiring medical treatment (35).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Random glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin A1C &gt; 6.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting TG &gt; 400 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who smoke will be excluded since this is the leading cause of low birth weight. In&#xD;
        addition, women with other risk factors for placental insufficiency, including hypertension&#xD;
        requiring beta-blocker treatment, renal disease, thrombophilias, preeclampsia, steroid use,&#xD;
        history of pancreatitis or infectious disease such as hepatitis, or intrauterine growth&#xD;
        restriction will be excluded.&#xD;
