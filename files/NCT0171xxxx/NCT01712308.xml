  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of and how well sotatercept works in treating&#xD;
      patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis or anemia. Sotatercept may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety and efficacy of sotatercept as therapy for persons with&#xD;
      myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sotatercept subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks. Cycles repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to&#xD;
      achieve anemia-response after 8 cycles will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;

    <description>Severity graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Toxicity is defined as an adverse event and classified as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. Such adverse events will be recorded by the principal investigator in a database. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, including start/stop dates, and frequency tables for each group will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anemia-response</measure>

    <description>Defined as an increase in hemoglobin level equal to or greater than 1.5 g/L without red blood cell-transfusion OR becoming red blood cell-transfusion-independent in a patient who is red blood cell-transfusion-dependent. Will be based on the intent-to-treat principle.</description>
