  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in Europe and United States and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of death worldwide and affects more than 10,000 Danes each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in a late and stationary phase after stroke have shown that physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      is of great importance for survival and physical ability of these patients, however many&#xD;
      studies show that patients lie or sit next to their bed under hospitalization for more than&#xD;
      88.5 % of the daily hours. Physical activity in stroke patients has never previously been&#xD;
      measured immediately after debut of symptoms; furthermore there is no knowledge about the&#xD;
      optimal dose of physical rehabilitation for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometers, small measuring devices, are a relatively new way to measure physical&#xD;
      activity precisely, and hence it is possible to obtain an objective measure of how active&#xD;
      stroke patients are in the first week after admission. The accelerometers measure a variable&#xD;
      voltage, depending on the range and intensity of movement. They can measure movement&#xD;
      dependent of the placement of the accelerometer, for instance over the hip, arm or leg.&#xD;
      Studies confirm their reliability, even in patients with abnormal gait, such as stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach of studying the effects of physical activity and rehabilitation is through&#xD;
      the examination of biomarkers. Studies have shown that biomarkers released during physical&#xD;
      activity can inhibit biomarkers released after tissue injury in the brain, as seen after&#xD;
      stroke. These brain biomarkers cause further damage and studies show that the higher the&#xD;
      levels, the higher the damage. It is therefore obvious to examine whether physical activity&#xD;
      rehabilitation can down regulate this destructive process in patients with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarification of the optimal dose of physical activity in stroke patients immediately after&#xD;
      debut of symptoms and examination of both the biochemical aspects of physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      as well as the optimal dose of physical rehabilitation is of great importance for many&#xD;
      patients, their relatives as well as of a great socioeconomic importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the project is to investigate feasibility of treadmill training on a&#xD;
      weight-bearing treadmill in the acute phase after admission after an ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Furthermore we wish to investigate the acute inflammatory response after ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      whether it changes with treadmill training.&#xD;
