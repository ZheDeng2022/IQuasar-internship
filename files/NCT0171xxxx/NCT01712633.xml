      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to study the brain. It takes a series&#xD;
      of pictures that can be used to look at how the brain processes information. It is used to&#xD;
      study problems with thinking, language, and movement, among other things. Researchers are&#xD;
      working to develop new and better fMRI techniques. To test these techniques, they want to&#xD;
      perform fMRI scans on healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test different fMRI techniques in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have fMRI scans of the brain. During these scans, they will be asked&#xD;
           to perform simple tasks. These tasks may involve language, thinking, or motor skills.&#xD;
           The scanning sessions will last up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to return for additional fMRI scans over several years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non invasive imaging technique that enables&#xD;
      scientists to understand the biological basis of higher order cognitive functioning such as&#xD;
      emotions, attention, language and visual processing. It has been used as a research tool&#xD;
      since the 1980 s. Recently, fMRI has received approval by the Center for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services (CMS) to be used clinically which we believe will drastically increase its&#xD;
      use in clinical decision making by physicians in the very near future. However, currently&#xD;
      implemented imaging techniques have technical and physiologic limitations such as&#xD;
      susceptibility artifacts, image distortions, physiological noise, and MRI induced energy&#xD;
      deposition from radiomagnetic waves typically used in fMRI acquisitions that may potentially&#xD;
      reduce the clinical effectiveness of this imaging modality. This protocol is a unique&#xD;
      technical development pilot study being conducted jointly by researchers at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of physiologic and technical factors of fMRI imaging methods and equipment that&#xD;
      may affect image quality, reproducibility, and reliability in the clinical setting. These&#xD;
      studies are an important basis upon which improved regulatory evaluation of new functional&#xD;
      imaging technologies can be performed as these technologies become increasingly used in&#xD;
      patient care in the future.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers, new or from current NIH protocols are eligible. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
             will be defined according the history obtained from reported medical history, medical&#xD;
             record (reported at registration), the MRI safety questionnaire, and a clinical grade&#xD;
             noncontrast brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to travel to the NIH for follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilingual or multilingual subjects can participate in this study as long as the&#xD;
             subjects are also fluent in English. Subjects do not need to be native or monolingual&#xD;
             speakers of English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria will be used to exclude subjects from participating in this&#xD;
        protocol:&#xD;
