      The purpose of this study is to determine how children with a history of severe, chronic&#xD;
      Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) who were treated with rituximab might respond to&#xD;
      vaccines. Eligible patients are previously or currently enrolled in a study entitled &quot;Open&#xD;
      Label, Phase I/II Trial of Rituximab for Chronic, Severe Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura&#xD;
      in Children and Adolescents&quot; and have decided to obtain an inactivated influenza vaccination.&#xD;
      These patients will be invited to provide one blood sample prior to vaccination and a second&#xD;
      sample following vaccination to quantify immune response to vaccination.&#xD;

      The purpose of this ancillary, pilot-phase study is to determine how children with a history&#xD;
      of severe, chronic ITP who were treated with rituximab might respond to vaccines. Eligible&#xD;
      patients are previously or currently enrolled in a study entitled &quot;Open Label, Phase I/II&#xD;
      Trial of Rituximab for Chronic, Severe Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura in Children and&#xD;
      Adolescents&quot; (CHB 02-12-160) and have decided to obtain the trivalent, inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccination. These patients will be invited to provide one blood sample prior to vaccination&#xD;
      and a second sample 4-8 weeks after vaccination to quantify immune response to vaccination.&#xD;
      Additionally, if patients are scheduled to receive a tetanus booster vaccination within one&#xD;
      month before or after the influenza vaccination, response to tetanus will also be quantified.&#xD;
      This sample will be collected during the same phlebotomy as the influenza sample. In some&#xD;
      cases, a blood sample was stored prior to rituximab treatment and will be used for baseline&#xD;
      assessment. The primary and secondary objectives for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the portion of patients who will respond adequately to influenza&#xD;
           vaccination, with adequacy defined as a titer greater than 1:32 for each strain of virus&#xD;
           in the vaccine, measured 4-8 weeks after administration of the vaccine OR greater than a&#xD;
           four-fold increase in titers measured 4-8 weeks after administration of the vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability to mount a response to the influenza vaccine, with response&#xD;
           defined as any increase in influenza antibody titer for each strain of virus between&#xD;
           samples before and 4-8 weeks after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability to mount an adequate response to tetanus toxoid, with adequacy&#xD;
           defined as in the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability to mount a response to tetanus toxoid, with response defined as&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare response to influenza vaccination received less than one year after rituximab&#xD;
           and greater than one year after rituximab.&#xD;
