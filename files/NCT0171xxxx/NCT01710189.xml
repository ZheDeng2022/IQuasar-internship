    <textblock>
      Many viral infections of global importance, including HIV, are transmitted across the mucosal&#xD;
      surface of the genital tract. As immunity against these infections is likely to be primarily&#xD;
      mediated by antibodies in mucosal secretions, developing techniques to increase the levels&#xD;
      and persistence of antiviral antibody on mucosal surfaces may enhance the protection against&#xD;
      a number of important infections. Preclinical studies have anatomically targeted vaccine&#xD;
      antigens to sites where genital tract immunity is induced. This response is likely due to the&#xD;
      ability of regional lymph Preclinical studies have anatomically targeted vaccine antigens to&#xD;
      sites where genital tract immunity is induced. This response is likely due to the ability of&#xD;
      regional lymph nodes to &quot;pattern&quot; the cell surface markers of responding vaccine specific&#xD;
      lymphocytes with homing markers. In contrast, injecting a distant muscle (such as in the arm)&#xD;
      which shares no anatomical relationship with the vagina, may not pattern cells with homing&#xD;
      markers for the genital tract. Direct injection of inguinal lymph nodes is impractical in&#xD;
      humans but intramuscular injection into the thigh will target antigens to the deep inguinal&#xD;
      lymph nodes shared in common with the cervix/vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a Phase IV randomised, single centre, open label, laboratory assessment&#xD;
      blinded exploratory trial to assess mucosal immunogenicity following three targeted&#xD;
      intramuscular immunisations with TicoVac vaccine. 20 subjects will be randomised to each of2&#xD;
      groups immunised in right deltoid or right anterolateral thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial screening visit subjects will be immunised at 0, 1 and 6 months. There&#xD;
      will be follow up visits 5 days after each immunisation and a final visit at 7 months. Blood&#xD;
      samples and cervicovaginal secretions will be taken prior to each immunisation for&#xD;
      immunological measures. In addition, blood samples will be taken at each immunisation and&#xD;
      follow up visit for measurement of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by ADITEC, which is a collaborative research programme that aims to&#xD;
      accelerate the development of novel and powerful immunisation technologies for the next&#xD;
      generation of human vaccines.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether targeting vaccine antigens to lymph nodes (internal iliac)&#xD;
      which drain both the lower limb and the cervix/vagina alters the subsequent antibody response&#xD;
      detected in the cervix/vagina, when compared with targeting vaccine antigens to unrelated&#xD;
      lymph nodes such as those in the axilla that drain the right deltoid muscle of upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right arm has been specifically selected as lymphatics in the right upper part of the&#xD;
      body drains directly into the blood stream via the right lymphatic duct with no shared&#xD;
      lymphatic connections to the rest of the body. In contrast lymph from the rest of the body&#xD;
      ultimately drains into the thoracic duct (see figure below). By immunising the right arm the&#xD;
      investigators can be sure that vaccine antigens and antigen presenting cells and activated&#xD;
      lymphocytes will not pass through any lymph nodes in common with the cervix or vagina. In&#xD;
      contrast by injecting the anterolateral thigh (right side selected for uniformity) the&#xD;
      investigators can be sure that vaccine antigens will pass through the external inguinal lymph&#xD;
      nodes which will also receive antigens and lymphocytes responding to vaginal or cervical&#xD;
      infection or inflammation. The choice of right leg is just to standardise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigators hypothesis therefore that as a result of antigen presentation and&#xD;
      stimulation within a specifically &quot;genital tract milieu&quot; T &amp;B lymphocytes leaving the&#xD;
      external iliac nodes as a result of an immunisation into the thigh will be patterned in such&#xD;
      a way as to more likely home back to the cervix and vagina due to the common drainage of the&#xD;
      cervix, vagina and thigh (Figure 1) into the external iliac and lateral aortic lymph nodes.&#xD;
      In contrast, cells leaving the axillary lymph nodes after immunisation of the right arm will&#xD;
      enter the blood directly via the right lymphatic duct and so will not pass through any lymph&#xD;
      nodes in common with the cervix and vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will detect an effect of targeted immunisation in a number of ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. By detecting increased levels of vaccine-specific antibodies in cervico-vaginal&#xD;
           secretions as a result of more activated B cells (plasmablasts) homing back to the&#xD;
           genital tract. IgG antibodies may be transudated from the blood but local mucosal IgG&#xD;
           may also be produced. In contrast, mucosal IgA is most likely to be locally produced and&#xD;
           may therefore be preferentially affected by targeted immunisation. However as individual&#xD;
           levels of mucosal antibody vary widely between subjects, especially with IgA, the&#xD;
           investigators will set primary endpoints on the basis of a fold-increase in antibody&#xD;
           levels from baseline, rather than concentration. As mucosal IgG responses are generally&#xD;
           more reliable and of greater magnitude the investigators have set the primary objective&#xD;
           as vaccine-specific mucosal IgG after all three immunisations. Vaccine-specific mucosal&#xD;
           IgA responses after all three immunisations are the secondary objective. The study has&#xD;
           been powered on the basis of the investigators limited experience with similar vaccines&#xD;
           to detect a doubling of proportions of responders for IgG and IgA. The investigators&#xD;
           have based the fold-increase in vaccine-specific mucosal IgG and IgA on the&#xD;
           investigators limited experience with a similar vaccine injected into the arm(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the investigators will measure changes in other variables that are&#xD;
           exploratory in nature as assays and quantification are less well established:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By detecting a &quot;mucosal&quot; pattern of B cell responses in the blood with increased numbers&#xD;
           of vaccine-specific B cells after genital targeted immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. By detecting differences in the cell surface phenotypic markers on vaccine-specific&#xD;
           lymphocytes indicating a mucosal origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive the vaccine in the right deltoid muscle (upper arm) which drains to&#xD;
           unrelated lymph nodes in the axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive the vaccine in the upper anterolateral right thigh, from which&#xD;
           antigens will be expected to drain to the inguinal lymph nodes that also drain the&#xD;
           cervix/vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure complete disconnection of draining lymph nodes it will always be the RIGHT arm or&#xD;
      RIGHT leg that is immunised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that targeting the internal iliac nodes will lead to an enhanced mucosal&#xD;
      antibody response in the cervix/vagina, which will be detected by increased vaccine-specific&#xD;
      IgA in cervico-vaginal secretions collected in a Softcup. In addition, lymphocytes (B and T&#xD;
      cells) from external iliac lymph nodes may carry surface markers associated with mucosal&#xD;
      homing and secrete different combinations of cytokines (Th17) than those emanating from&#xD;
      axillary nodes which will express a systemic phenotype. This can be detected by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, ELISPOT after bead separation using phenotypic markers, and other immunological&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune response readouts will be IgG and IgA antibodies against the TBEV antigens in the&#xD;
      vaccine, comparing the two groups at the time point when the peak response is expected (28&#xD;
      days after third immunisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigators wish to investigate the ability of the vaccine to specifically prime&#xD;
      subjects in a targeted way, participants must be naive to the vaccine antigens and so must&#xD;
      not have had the vaccine or TBEV infection before. Therefore the investigators will use&#xD;
      TicoVac - a TBEV vaccine licenced in the UK that UK adults have not generally received, as&#xD;
      TBEV infection is not endemic in the UK. TicoVac is widely used in central and eastern Europe&#xD;
      where TBEV is endemic but extremely uncommon, and is offered to travellers from UK to endemic&#xD;
      areas who are likely to engage in high risk activity (hiking, trekking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal responses against TBEV are not relevant as TBEV is transmitted by tick bites. Immune&#xD;
      responses to TicoVac will act as a model for other vaccines in which the mucosal antibody&#xD;
      response in the vagina is of relevance to block infection (e.g. HIV, HPV, HSV) and in which&#xD;
      targeted immunisation may increase efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although strictly speaking the induction of anti-TBEV antibodies in cervico-vaginal&#xD;
      secretions is of no relevance to the efficacy of the TicoVac vaccine against a blood-injected&#xD;
      virus, the investigators have designated them as parameters of efficacy in this model of&#xD;
      targeted immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this human immune physiology study is to use TBEV vaccine as a model&#xD;
      neoantigen to investigate immune readouts after antigen targeting. The collection of adverse&#xD;
      event or safety data is therefore not relevant to the study objectives and there will be no&#xD;
      systematic collection of safety data, other than those required for a Risk Assessed &quot;Type A&quot;&#xD;
      CTIMP (SUSAR reporting to MHRA/REC/Concerned Investigators, Annual List of Suspected Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Reactions as part of the Annual Safety Report/Development Safety Update Report).&#xD;
