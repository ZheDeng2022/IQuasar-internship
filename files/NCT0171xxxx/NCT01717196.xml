      BACKGROUND: EUS-FNA has a central role in the diagnostic algorithm of solid pancreatic&#xD;
      masses. Different needle diameters and the use of stylet are not associated with differences&#xD;
      in terms of diagnostic yield for malignancy. Preliminary studies showed that using suction&#xD;
      (10ml) is associated with a higher sensitivity for cancer diagnosis. We aim to compare&#xD;
      EUS-FNA in the same solid pancreatic mass performed with the 22 gauge needle with different&#xD;
      aspiration volumes (10, 20, 0ml), looking for adequacy, diagnostic accuracy and&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Prospective clinical study at four referral Centers: ISMETT Palermo;&#xD;
      Bellaria-Maggiore, Bologna; Civico-A.R.N.A.S, Palermo; Humanitas-IRCCS, Rozzano. EUS was&#xD;
      performed by five experienced echo-endoscopist. The needle system was in all cases the 22&#xD;
      gauge EUS-FNA(Expect). We performed three punctures with a 22 G needle with both volume&#xD;
      aspiration 10 and 20 cc and without syringe for each lesion. The sequence (10cc, 20cc, no&#xD;
      aspiration) was randomly assigned by sealed envelope system. For each pass tissue samples&#xD;
      were smeared into slides for ROSE(Rapid-On-Site-Evaluation); after smearing sample into the&#xD;
      slides, the material was fixed in formalin for cyto-histological evaluation. The&#xD;
      cyto-pathologist was always blinded as to which aspiration was used for which specimen. After&#xD;
      EUS-FNA the patients were monitored for at least six hour to detect immediately&#xD;
      post-procedural complication and were followed up during the 30 days post-procedure in order&#xD;
      to detect late complications.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-FNA has a central role in the diagnostic algorithm of solid pancreatic masses [ASGE&#xD;
      Practice Committee] with high sensitivity and specificity (75-92% - 82-100%), [1-2-3] and low&#xD;
      complication rate (1-2%) [4-5-6]. In the clinical setting of solid pancreatic mass a&#xD;
      histological diagnosis appears highly relevant both for differential diagnosis&#xD;
      (adenocarcinoma, lymphoma or neuroendocrine tumour) and for optimal therapeutic decision. For&#xD;
      the cythopathologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, sensitivity increased with the operator's&#xD;
      experience and reached 80% after 20 to 30 EUS-FNA. Furthermore it well demonstrated that&#xD;
      on-site cytopathology interpretation during the procedure increase the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      EUS-FNA [7-8]. ROSE (Rapid On -Site Evaluation) may be useful to guide the number of FNA&#xD;
      passes, learn which parts of the lesion may be targeted for increased diagnostic yield, and&#xD;
      correct technical errors (e. g. bloody or paucicellular material) [9, 10]. The diagnostic&#xD;
      yield of EUS-guided biopsies depends on size, location and characteristics of target tissues&#xD;
      as well as on technical and procedural factors (type of needle, biopsy technique and material&#xD;
      processing) [11-20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise and training of endosonographer and interaction with the cytopathologist have also&#xD;
      an important role [7-14-15]. Up to now three different sizes of needle are available for&#xD;
      collecting cytological material: 25 - 22 and 19 gauge with an aspiration volume syringe of&#xD;
      10ml. Most of the studies on EUS-FNA have been conducted using 22G needles. Data on thinner&#xD;
      (25G) or larger (19G) needles are limited. A number of recent studies, including two RCTs,&#xD;
      compared results obtained with needles of various diameters. All these studies were performed&#xD;
      in the setting of pancreatic masses [18-20]. Although thinner needles provide less cellular&#xD;
      material than do larger needles, the specimens from the former are less contaminated by&#xD;
      blood, and thus easier to interpret. In addition, thinner needles may be easier to use&#xD;
      because of greater flexibility, particularly for locations requiring important scope bending&#xD;
      [18, 19]. An RCT in 131 patients found no significant differences between 22G and 25G needles&#xD;
      in terms of diagnostic yield for malignancy [17]. Finally another RCT compared EUS-FNA&#xD;
      without ROSE using 19G or 22G needles in 117 patients [18] showed a similar diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy for both needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the diameter of the needle used does not appear to affect the diagnostic accuracy of FNA&#xD;
      on solid pancreatic lesions, preliminary studies show that using suction during EUS FNA of&#xD;
      solid masses is associated with a significantly higher sensitivity for cancer diagnosis (86%&#xD;
      vs. 67%; P=0.05) [20]. A pilot trial suggested that applying continuous high pressure suction&#xD;
      (using a balloon inflation device) allowed retrieval of tissue samples for histopathological&#xD;
      examination in most cases [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new needle Expect by Boston Scientific are available with an aspiration syringe with&#xD;
      variable volume of 5-10-15-20cc. No studies were performed comparing the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      FNA on solid pancreatic masses performed with different aspiration volume (10 and 20ml) and&#xD;
      without aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our prospective study are to compare EUS-FNA in the same solid pancreatic mass&#xD;
      performed with the 22 gauge needle with aspiration volume syringe of 10ml, 20ml and without&#xD;
      aspiration, looking for: sample adequacy, diagnostic accuracy, complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients This was a prospective clinical study at four referral center for EUS: ISMETT/UPMC&#xD;
      (Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies/University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Medical Center in Italy), Palermo; AUSL Bologna, Bellaria-Maggiore Hospital;&#xD;
      Civico-A.R.N.A.S. Hospital, Palermo; Humanitas IRCCS, Rozzano, Milano. We planned to collect&#xD;
      at least 100 cases in 3 months. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the&#xD;
      1975 Declaration of Helsinki (6th revision, 2008) as reflected in a priori approval by the&#xD;
      institution's human research committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the study were: diagnosed or suspected solid pancreatic lesions&#xD;
      according to imaging (CT-scan or/and MRI); no contraindications for FNA (see exclusion&#xD;
      criteria). The exclusion criteria were: age &lt; 18 years; cystic pancreatic lesions; history of&#xD;
      previous gastrectomy; patients hemodynamically unstable or with severe coagulopathy&#xD;
      (international normalized ratio [INR] &gt; 1.5 or platelet count &lt; 60.000 cells/cubic millimetre&#xD;
      [cmm3]); patients unable to suspend anticoagulant therapy; pregnancy; inability to give&#xD;
      informed consent; refusal to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on comorbidity and chronic treatment were recorded as well as data on possible&#xD;
      complications related to the procedure. Patients undergoing anticoagulant or antiaggregant&#xD;
      therapy for noncritical problems discontinued the treatment at least 5 days before the&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure or until INR normalization, starting low dose heparin. Written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients for the procedures performed. All procedures were&#xD;
      performed under conscious sedation with meperidine ± midazolam or deep sedation with propofol&#xD;
      according to each center guideline and patient clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed using a linear echo-endoscope by five&#xD;
      experienced echo-endoscopist with a current case volume of at list 500 per year (200 FNA).&#xD;
      The standard technique for FNA was adopted: the needle is advanced under real-time EUS&#xD;
      guidance into the target lesion by using a quick, strong thrust of the handle. The stylet is&#xD;
      completely withdrawn and a syringe attached to the end of the needle device. Once inside the&#xD;
      lesion, after applying negative pressure suction by opening the lock device of the syringe,&#xD;
      the needle is moved back and forth 15 times under EUS guidance. The suction syringe is then&#xD;
      released, the needle withdrawn into the catheter, and the whole system removed from the&#xD;
      echoendoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle system was in all cases the 22 gauge EUS-FNA (Expect needle). After the puncture&#xD;
      the stylet was removed, and we performed three punctures with a 22 G needle with both volume&#xD;
      aspiration 10 and 20 cc and without syringe for each lesion. The sequence (10cc, 20cc, no&#xD;
      aspiration) was randomly assigned by sealed envelope system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success was defined as puncturing the target tissue properly without technical&#xD;
      difficulties (inability of the needle to exit from the channel of the scope) or mechanical&#xD;
      rupture and obtaining some visible tissue specimens or fragments with each puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples was immediately smeared into slides after each puncture, fixed and all the&#xD;
      prepared slides will be viewed by experienced pathologists for ROSE (Rapid On Site&#xD;
      Evaluation). For each pass, after smearing sample into the slides, the material was fixed in&#xD;
      formalin for cyto histological evaluation. The cytopathologist was always blinded as to which&#xD;
      aspiration was used for which specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cases will be stratified into 4 diagnostic categories applied for ROSE and for&#xD;
      histological evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Positive for malignancy, b) Suspicious for malignancy, c) Negative for malignancy, d) Non&#xD;
      diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each aspiration two fundamental parameters will be evaluated on slides and formalin fixed&#xD;
      sample: sample adequacy intended as overall cellularity (including normal, neoplastic,&#xD;
      non-epithelial cells) and diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedural follow-up After EUS-FNA the patients were monitored for at least six hour to&#xD;
      detect immediately post-procedural complication and were followed up with a scheduled&#xD;
      protocol during the 30 days post-procedure in order to evaluate clinical status, blood&#xD;
      chemistry, and to detect late complications. All patients were followed up for at least 1&#xD;
      month. All adverse events were evaluated and related or not to the procedure. All data were&#xD;
      recorded electronically on excel database for the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data were analyzed using the SPSS 15 software package (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, Illinois, USA). Continuous variables were summarized as means ± SD, or range, when&#xD;
      appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as frequency and percentage. For&#xD;
      comparison of qualitative variables, a chi-squared test was calculated. For comparison of&#xD;
      quantitative variables, Students t test was used. Sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy for each arm&#xD;
      was investigated. Differences were considered significant at a P value of &lt;0.05 (two-sided).&#xD;
