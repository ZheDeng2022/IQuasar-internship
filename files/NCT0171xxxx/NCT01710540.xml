      A randomized, balanced, open label, crossover, two period, two treatment, two sequence,&#xD;
      single dose, oral bioequivalence study under fasting condition. It is a pivotal study to&#xD;
      demonstrate the bioequivalence of Metformin 850 mg tablets manufactured by Savipharm J.S.C,&#xD;
      Vietnam and Glucophage® 850 mg tablets of Merck Sante, France, in healthy adult human male&#xD;
      subjects under fasting condition.&#xD;

      Sample Size Estimation Assuming the formulation ratio (T/R) 95-105% and with the maximum&#xD;
      observable intra subject variability for Metformin is 22% (based on literature), a sample&#xD;
      size of 29 subjects would be sufficient to prove bioequivalence between the two formulations&#xD;
      with power of at least 90%. Hence, total 32 subjects will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      considering withdrawal and dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures: Demographic data, medical and medication histories, complete physical&#xD;
      examination, height, weight and BMI as well as 12 lead ECG, chest X-ray [PA view], vital&#xD;
      signs [blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature], hematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, HIV 1 &amp; 2, Hepatitis B and C, RPR test for Syphilis and urine analysis will be&#xD;
      done at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine drug screen, Liver chemistry test and breath alcohol test to be done prior to each&#xD;
      check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath alcohol test to be done prior to each ambulatory visit blood collection. Liver&#xD;
      chemistry test to be done at the end of each period. Housing: The study subjects will be&#xD;
      housed at least 11 h prior to drug administration until after the 24 h blood sampling in each&#xD;
      study period. The housing will be followed by one ambulatory visits [36.0 hr post dose] for&#xD;
      each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Washout: At least 7 days, but not exceeding 14 days between two dosing days. Treatment arms:&#xD;
      Test: A single dose of Metformin 500 mg tablet manufactured by Savipharm J.S.C, Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference: A single dose of Glucophage® 500 mg tablet of Merck Sante, France Drug&#xD;
      administration: As per the randomization schedule, one tablet of either test or reference&#xD;
      product will be orally administered to each subject in each period in sitting posture, after&#xD;
      an overnight fast of at least 10 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid hypoglycemic episodes, the investigational products will be administered with 240 mL&#xD;
      of a 20% glucose solution in water, followed by 60 mL of the glucose solution administered&#xD;
      every 15 min for up to 4 h after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed not to chew or crush the tablet but should be swallowed.&#xD;
      Compliance for dosing will be assessed by identification of subjects with subject ID card,&#xD;
      identification of label on investigational product to confirm correct allocation of treatment&#xD;
      and checking the oral cavity immediately after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions: Subjects will remain in upright position [sitting or ambulatory] for two hours&#xD;
      after dosing in each period except when clinically indicated to change the posture. The&#xD;
      subjects will fast for at least 10 h prior to dosing and 4 h post-dose. Water will be&#xD;
      permitted ad libitum except for 1 h before and until 1 h after post dose. During 1 hr post&#xD;
      dose water restriction a, 60 mL of 20% glucose solution will be administered every 15 min to&#xD;
      the study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each period of the study, 18 blood samples of 6 mL each will be collected in K2EDTA&#xD;
      vacutainers via an indwelling catheter placed in one of the forearm veins. Heparin-lock&#xD;
      technique will be used to prevent clotting of blood in the indwelling catheter. Before each&#xD;
      in-house blood sample is drawn through catheter, 0.5 mL of blood will be discarded so as to&#xD;
      purge the heparin containing blood sample in the catheter. Blood can also be collected by&#xD;
      direct venipuncture in case of cannula blockage, during ambulatory visits or for any other&#xD;
      practical reasons. The two pre-dose blood samples will be collected within a period of 1 h&#xD;
      before the drug administration. The post-dose blood samples will be collected at 0.5, 1.0,&#xD;
      1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0 and 36.0 h. The 36.0 h&#xD;
      post dose blood samples will be collected during ambulatory visits by direct venipuncture.&#xD;
      Immediately after collection of blood, the sample will be kept in ice bath. After collecting&#xD;
      the blood samples from all the subjects at each sampling time point, samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 4oC with 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The plasma samples will be separated and&#xD;
      stored in pre-labeled polypropylene tubes at -70 ± 10°C pending assay. The time interval&#xD;
      between sample collection and the start of centrifugation should not exceed more than 45&#xD;
      minutes. The blood sample collection, processing and analysis will be done under sodium&#xD;
      monochromatic light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total volume of blood drawn including the volume necessary for the laboratory tests, PK&#xD;
      sample analysis and the volume of blood discarded before each in house blood draw will be&#xD;
      about 250 mL per subject for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects monitoring: Brief physical examination and vital signs [blood pressure, pulse rate&#xD;
      and oral temperature] will be carried out and recorded at each check-in and at check-out.&#xD;
      Vital signs [blood pressure and pulse rate] will also be recorded before dosing of&#xD;
      investigational products, between 2 - 3, 9 - 10 and 36.0 h post dose. Vital signs should be&#xD;
      done in sitting position after rest of at least 5 minutes. Physical examination and&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs can also be carried out at any time during the conduct of the&#xD;
      study if the Investigator/Doctor feels it necessary. In case of abnormality in pre-dose vital&#xD;
      signs, Investigator based on his medical judgement will take the decision whether to dose the&#xD;
      subject or not. During vitals recording each subject will be asked about his well-being. Also&#xD;
      subject well-being questionnaire will be performed at 1.0 and 5.0 h post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-study Procedures: Safety evaluation [complete physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      hematology [except blood grouping &amp; Rh typing] and biochemistry] will be done at the end of&#xD;
      the clinical part of the study. In case of any withdrawals during the study safety assessment&#xD;
      will be done at the time of withdrawal. In case of dropouts subjects will be asked to visit&#xD;
      the facility to undergo safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC%_Extrap, Kel and t1/2 Analytical&#xD;
      Methods: Metformin in plasma will be estimated using validated LC-MS/MS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Statistical analyses will be done using SAS® version 9.2 or higher.&#xD;
      Analysis of variance [ANOVA] for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters [Cmax, AUC0-t and&#xD;
      AUC0-∞], two one-sided tests [Schuirmann] for bioequivalence, power, ratio and 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standards for Bioequivalence: The calculated 90% Confidence Interval for the test to&#xD;
      reference ratio of Metformin should fall within the range of 80%-125% for log transformed&#xD;
      Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for the conclusion of bioequivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and&#xD;
      reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment and until the follow-up contact.&#xD;
      Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. However, any SAEs&#xD;
      assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol-mandated&#xD;
      procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK concomitant&#xD;
      medication will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up&#xD;
      to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor&#xD;
      within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants.&#xD;
      However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a&#xD;
      subject has been discharged from the study, and he considers the event reasonably related to&#xD;
      the study treatment or study participation, the investigator would promptly notify the&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events will be informed to the sponsor within 24 hrs and to the IEC&#xD;
      within 7 working days. Any unexpected serious adverse event (SAE) occurring during a clinical&#xD;
      trial should be communicated promptly (within 14 calendar days) by the Sponsor/CRO to the&#xD;
      Licensing Authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reported to the sponsor&#xD;
      within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to&#xD;
      receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event and completing the&#xD;
      appropriate data collection tool. The investigator will always provide an assessment of&#xD;
      causality at the time of the initial report.&#xD;
