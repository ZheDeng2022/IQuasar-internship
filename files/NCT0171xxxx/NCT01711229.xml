    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a drug that is used commonly for relief of mild to moderate pain.&#xD;
      It is found in many pain medicines that people take after having surgery. Narcotics are other&#xD;
      drugs also used for pain (examples of narcotics are morphine and related pain medications).&#xD;
      Medical science knows for a fact that acetaminophen works well when taken with narcotics for&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain. Recently, acetaminophen has become available in an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      form called Ofirmev®. The IV form means that acetaminophen can be given into a vein. The&#xD;
      benefits of getting medicine from an IV include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  making the medicine work quickly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  less medicine having to pass through the liver to be changed into a form that your body&#xD;
           can process The investigators know that acetaminophen is helpful for pain relief at the&#xD;
           time of surgery and after surgery. Acetaminophen is a very popular drug in outpatient&#xD;
           surgery for pain control when patients go home. The patient's surgeon uses it to control&#xD;
           pain after surgery at home in the form of Lortab or Percocet (Lortab and Percocet also&#xD;
           have a narcotic medicine that mixes with acetaminophen). Also, currently at Surgicare,&#xD;
           some anesthesiologists give intravenous acetaminophen while the patient is waiting to go&#xD;
           to surgery. The investigators currently do not give any patient acetaminophen by mouth&#xD;
           BEFORE surgery. However, since the addition of the IV form to the drug market, there has&#xD;
           been interest to see if the oral form is just as good or better in reducing pain after&#xD;
           surgery. This is why we are asking patients to join our study. The goal of this study is&#xD;
           to find out if the oral form (by mouth) or the IV form (given into a vein) of&#xD;
           acetaminophen controls pain after surgery better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends acetaminophen, NSAIDS, or COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitors as part of a multimodal pain management strategy to limit opioid usage (1). As the&#xD;
      surgical patient population becomes more complex with comorbidities ranging from obesity,&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea , and asthma becoming more common, the medical community continues to&#xD;
      search for efficacious analgesics with a high safety profile. While non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs play an important role in multi-modal analgesia, their use is limited&#xD;
      based on concerns for platelet inhibition, asthma exacerbation, and renal artery perfusion in&#xD;
      patients of advanced age or reduced creatinine clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetaminophen has proven to be an important analgesic in the perioperative setting. It is&#xD;
      frequently combined with opiates to allow for synergism, or it can be used as a sole&#xD;
      analgesic to provide up to 4 hours of relief for moderate pain. While acetaminophen's main&#xD;
      role as a multimodal analgesic regimen has been in tablet form as an opioid/acetaminophen&#xD;
      combination in the post- anesthesia care unit (PACU), acetaminophen has emerged as an&#xD;
      important perioperative analgesic due to FDA approval of an intravenous (IV) formulation&#xD;
      (Ofirmev®) in the United States in 2010. While the new intravenous formulation was approved&#xD;
      based upon its postoperative effectiveness and safety, there is also an interest in its&#xD;
      preoperative use. [12, 13] The benefit IV acetaminophen claims over the oral modality is a&#xD;
      70% higher blood concentration than a single similar dose (1 gram) of oral acetaminophen and&#xD;
      a rapid onset with peak blood concentration within 15 minutes of infusion while similar oral&#xD;
      doses may take 90 minutes to reach peak plasma concentrations. Many studies have compared the&#xD;
      IV formulation of acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) with the oral formulation at the same dose of 1&#xD;
      gram. However, this does not take into account the difference in pharmacokinetics of oral and&#xD;
      intravenous formulations. A 15-minute constant infusion of 1 gram acetaminophen resulted in&#xD;
      an average plasma concentration of 25.02 μg/ml at the end of the infusion with subsequent&#xD;
      decline to approximately 11 μg/ml at 1 hour and 7 μg/ml at 3 hour after the start of&#xD;
      infusion. Pain scores were lowest at one hour but remained significantly low for at least&#xD;
      three hours. [FDA med review] Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of the immediate release oral&#xD;
      formulation of acetaminophen are well-known. The absorption half life for acetaminophen in&#xD;
      healthy subjects ranges from 0.06-0.7 hours (8). The relative bioavailability ranges from 85%&#xD;
      to 98%. Moreover, it has a low first pass metabolism with a hepatic extraction ratio of 0.11&#xD;
      to 0.37 (9). After oral administration of 1 gram acetaminophen in the immediate release&#xD;
      formulation (IR), peak concentrations of acetaminophen in adults ranged from 7.7 to 17.6&#xD;
      μg/mL within 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the therapeutic range for acetaminophen is not well established, plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of 10-20 mcg/ml are associated with antipyretic activity, and previous work&#xD;
      has assumed that antipyretic and analgesic doses will be similar. (3-4). However, another&#xD;
      study developed two compartmental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models to relate plasma&#xD;
      concentration to pain score relationship in children who received oral acetaminophen 30&#xD;
      minutes before outpatient tonsillectomy. The model demonstrated only a one point decrease in&#xD;
      pain score when the concentration increased from 10 μg/mL to 20 μg/mL and a steep loss of&#xD;
      pain protection when the concentration fell below 6 - 7 μg/mL. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      indicates a saturation of the analgesic effect of acetaminophen at a threshold plasma&#xD;
      concentration of as low as 7 μg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis for our proposal stems from a recent study by J Van Der Westhuizen, et al. They set&#xD;
      out to determine if the traditional one gram unit dose reached adequate serum concentrations&#xD;
      of greater than 10 mcg/ml. They compared 1 gram each of intravenous (IV) and oral&#xD;
      acetaminophen to see if one or both achieved therapeutic plasma concentrations&#xD;
      peri-operatively and for how long. This study questioned the use of oral acetaminophen at 1&#xD;
      gram because if it was not achieving therapeutic concentrations, the patients were not&#xD;
      getting optimal care (5). From this study, they were able to extrapolate oral doses of 20&#xD;
      mg/kg that would achieve a maximum concentration of 19 mcg/ml (which is the median maximum&#xD;
      concentration achieved by IV acetaminophen). The study concluded that for subjects over 75&#xD;
      kg, an effective IV equivalent oral acetaminophen dose would be 1.5 grams or even 2 grams if&#xD;
      the subject exceeded 100 kg (5). This study further recommended a follow up study to evaluate&#xD;
      these higher doses of oral acetaminophen as it relates to pain scores and rescue medications&#xD;
      postoperatively compared to the IV dose of 1 gram. The current unit dose of oral&#xD;
      acetaminophen is 1 gram every 6 hours. However, many studies have evaluated the effects of&#xD;
      higher doses of oral acetaminophen as well (10, 11). One study supported the use of 5-6 grams&#xD;
      of acetaminophen in a 24- hour period in order to reduce requirements for postoperative&#xD;
      morphine. requirements (6). Another study measured serum and CSF concentrations one hour&#xD;
      after administration of 500 mg, 1 gm, 1.5 gm, or 2 gm of oral acetaminophen (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the investigator's hypothesis is that while a similar dose is less effective, a&#xD;
      1.5 gram dose of oral acetaminophen (as determined by the extrapolation of maximum serum&#xD;
      concentrations from the Van Der Westhuizen, et al. study (5)) may be as effective as 1.0 gram&#xD;
      of IV acetaminophen in reducing postoperative pain scores and total opioid consumption, thus&#xD;
      resulting in lower cost to the patient and provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's aim is to compare the effects of a 1.5 gram oral acetaminophen to 1 gram&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen when given preoperatively to patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair by a single surgeon at a single facility. The primary outcomes will evaluate total&#xD;
      opioid consumption in the post anesthesia care unit PACU and nominal pain scores. The&#xD;
      investigators theorize that 1.5 grams of oral acetaminophen will be as efficacious as 1 gram&#xD;
      IV acetaminophen resulting in lower costs to the patient and provider.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Acetaminophen allergy (avoids risk of allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver disease as determined by anesthesiologist by history (acetaminophen involves the&#xD;
             liver for metabolism, therefore, if the liver is not functioning appropriately, doses&#xD;
             could accumulate and cause damage.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Daily alcohol consumption (same explanation as for liver disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal failure (patient on dialysis or health history indicates renal dysfunction)&#xD;
             (acetaminophen has some renal excretion)&#xD;

          -  Asthma (recent concerns for acetaminophen leading to asthma exacerbations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other contraindication to taking acetaminophen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgeon requested pre-operative Interscalene block (this will cause the patient to&#xD;
             cease having pain, therefore the effects of acetaminophen reducing pain scores will&#xD;
             not be able to be evaluated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current warfarin, carbamazepine, or phenytoin use (these medications can accumulate in&#xD;
             the presence of excessive acetaminophen use or may harm the liver and affect&#xD;
             acetaminophen use or may harm the liver and affect acetaminophen concentrations).&#xD;

          -  Patients scheduled for &quot;possible rotator cuff repair&quot; (including these patients in our&#xD;
             studies could skew enrollment numbers should a rotator cuff repair not be done, so&#xD;
             these patients will be screened and excluded prior to enrollments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any consumption of acetaminophen containing products in the 24 hour period prior to&#xD;
             surgery (excluded because acetaminophen can induce its own metabolism, therefore&#xD;
             reducing serum concentrations)&#xD;

             the Investigator's judgment could compromise the subject's welfare, ability to&#xD;
             communicate with the study staff, complete study activities, or would otherwise&#xD;
             contraindicate study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to consent for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant patients (All female patients of childbearing potential are given a pregnancy&#xD;
             test prior to any elective surgery at Surgicare. Though acetaminophen is NOT harmful&#xD;
             to these patients, they will be excluded given the fact that elective surgery in&#xD;
