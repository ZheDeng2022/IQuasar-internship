      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Oxytocin is a chemical that the brain normally produces. It plays an important part in the&#xD;
      way humans and other animals act in social and emotional situations. Adults with&#xD;
      schizophrenia have been studied to see if oxytocin can reduce some symptoms of schizophrenia,&#xD;
      such as hearing voices, feeling suspicious, and not feeling interested in daily life. These&#xD;
      studies show that oxytocin may help. However, it has not been studied in children who develop&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Researchers want to see if oxytocin, given as a nasal spray, is safe and can&#xD;
      reduce schizophrenia symptoms in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if an oxytocin nasal spray can reduce schizophrenia symptoms in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children above 10 years of age who have childhood-onset schizophrenia, and have&#xD;
      schizophrenia symptoms in spite of taking medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will last 4 weeks. Participants will stay in the hospital for the entire&#xD;
           period of the study. Participants may also have an extra 2 weeks of study medication and&#xD;
           1 week of testing immediately following the initial 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical and psychiatric history.&#xD;
           They will provide blood and urine samples, and have imaging studies of the brain. They&#xD;
           will also have tests to look at their social and emotional functioning. These tests will&#xD;
           take 1 week to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have either oxytocin or placebo nasal spray twice daily for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the 2-week period with nasal spray, there will be 1 week with no nasal&#xD;
           spray. All the tests of week 1 will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The optional extra 3 weeks (2 weeks with oxytocin and one week for testing) will be&#xD;
           similar to the second, third, and fourth weeks of the study. All participants will have&#xD;
           oxytocin during this period.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies with intranasal oxytocin administration indicate moderate efficacy in symptom&#xD;
      reduction in adult patients with schizophrenia, and moderate to good response in improving&#xD;
      social cognition in patients with autism. The majority (about 75%) of patients with&#xD;
      childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) continue to show impairing social and psychotic symptoms&#xD;
      after drug treatment optimization, and almost 30% of children with COS have co-morbid autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD). Oxytocin may be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment to improve&#xD;
      social cognition, reduce anxiety, and indirectly reduce psychotic symptoms in&#xD;
      medication-stable COS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study whether intranasal oxytocin (study medication) would be safe, improve&#xD;
      emotional/social cognition, and reduce symptom severity in clinically stable COS children and&#xD;
      whether the study medication would also result in specific neurocircuitry changes, as&#xD;
      measured by multimodal neuroimaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 patients (36 per group) with COS, ages 10 and above will be recruited. All patients will&#xD;
      be on stable medications for at least one month prior to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of daily intranasal&#xD;
      oxytocin. Subsequent to the study period, a two-week extension of open label study medication&#xD;
      will be offered to all participants, regardless of study group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of intranasal oxytocin in COS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether intranasal administration of oxytocin will improve both positive and&#xD;
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to placebo, as measured by PANSS, SAPS, SANS, and&#xD;
      BPRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether intranasal oxytocin has significant effects on the social and emotional&#xD;
      processing and behavior of children with COS, as measured by the Diagnostic Analysis of&#xD;
      Nonverbal Behavior (DANVA-2), Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-2)&#xD;
      standardized social perception battery, Brune Theory of Mind Pictures Stories Task, Reading&#xD;
      the Mind in the Eyes Test. Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure alterations in neurocircuitry after oxytocin administration, as measured by fMRI,&#xD;
      DTI, and MEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate changes in blood plasma oxytocin levels measured over the course of the study.&#xD;
