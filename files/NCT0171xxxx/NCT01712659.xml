  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Infection&#xD;
           does not immediately cause ATL, but it can develop over time. ATL is a rare and&#xD;
           aggressive type of cancer that disrupts the body s ability to control the HTLV-1 virus.&#xD;
           It also affects the growth and reproduction of cells infected with the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ruxolitinib is a drug that has been approved to treat bone marrow disorders. It can&#xD;
           interfere with the proteins that are important to the development and growth of ATL&#xD;
           cells. Drugs like ruxolitinib may be able to interrupt important activity in ATL cells.&#xD;
           Researchers want to see if ruxolitinib can be a safe and effective treatment for ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib for adult T-cell leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have ATL caused by HTLV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take ruxolitinib twice a day for 28 days. They will have blood tests&#xD;
           on days 1, 14, and 28. These tests will look at the levels of HTLV-1 in the blood.&#xD;
           Participants will have a final blood test about 2 weeks later. Treatment will also be&#xD;
           monitored with imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have a partial response during treatment may be able to start taking&#xD;
           ruxolitinib again after the final blood test. They will continue to take ruxolitinib for&#xD;
           as long as it is effective and the side effects are not severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have a full response during treatment will take ruxolitinib for 56 more&#xD;
           days, and then stop treatment. If ATL returns, they may restart treatment and continue&#xD;
           it for as long as it is effective.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult T-cell leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of&#xD;
           CD4/CD25 expressing T cells (IL-2R alpha expressing) in the peripheral blood, in&#xD;
           lymphoid and other tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In smoldering and chronic ATL the HTLV-1 encoded protein, Tax constitutively activates&#xD;
           interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-9 and IL-15 autocrine/paracrine systems that in turn activate&#xD;
           the Janus kinase (JAK)-1/3/STAT5 pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ruxolitinib a therapeutic agent inhibits cytokine mediated JAK1/2 activation and ex vivo&#xD;
           proliferation of malignant T cells from patients with ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ruxolitinib is a potent orally bioavailable JAK1/2 inhibitor not licensed for the&#xD;
           treatment of ATL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose and clinical response rate for ruxolitinib given at&#xD;
      doses of 30, 40 or 50 mg orally twice daily in patients with smoldering, chronic and&#xD;
      biologically indolent acute or lymphomatous subtype of ATL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with pathologically confirmed adult&#xD;
           T-cell leukemia: smoldering or chronic or previously treated lymphomatous or acute&#xD;
           subtypes with clinically indolent behavior indicated by lack of significant symptoms and&#xD;
           treatment free interval of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. Patients with &gt; 10% of their PBMCs&#xD;
           having the characteristic abnormal (i.e., CD3dim, CD4 plus CD25 plus expressing) FACS&#xD;
           profile for circulating ATL cells will be considered to have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with symptomatic leukemic meningitis, bony or GI tract involvement, serum&#xD;
           calcium or LDH &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be excluded. However patients&#xD;
           that have both ATL and another HTLV-1 associated disease such as tropical spastic&#xD;
           paraparesis (HAM/TSP) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior treatment with another JAK inhibitor; patients previously treated in this&#xD;
           protocol at the lower dose are eligible to restart treatment at the higher dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This is a pilot open-label, trial with off label-use of oral ruxolitinib that will enroll&#xD;
      27 to 33 patients with smoldering or chronic or clinically indolent ATL. Groups of 3 to 6&#xD;
      newly enrolled or reenrolled patients will begin treatment at a dose of 30 mg orally given&#xD;
      twice daily. If this dose is tolerated without exceeding the criteria for dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment, the tolerability of treatment at 40 mg&#xD;
      and then 50 mg twice daily will be evaluated.&#xD;
