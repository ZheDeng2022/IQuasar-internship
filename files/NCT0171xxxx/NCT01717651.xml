      This study is being done to help determine whether patients with severe sepsis (overwhelming&#xD;
      inflammation in the body as a result of an infection) lose muscle and become weak more&#xD;
      rapidly than patients with other severe illnesses. Weakness and muscle loss that develops&#xD;
      after a severe illness is a serious problem. Patients who develop weakness and have a&#xD;
      decrease in muscle size often have to stay in the hospital longer and have a higher chance of&#xD;
      dying. At the current time, it is not clear whether certain severe illnesses are more likely&#xD;
      to cause weakness and muscle loss. This study will be done to measure the changes in muscle&#xD;
      size and strength as a result of each patient's illness&#xD;

      An optional portion of the study is available to help determine if moving the leg repeatedly&#xD;
      with a mechanical device helps prevent muscle loss and weakness. In this optional portion of&#xD;
      the study, the subject would have a CPM (continuous passive motion) device attached to one of&#xD;
      the subject's legs intermittently over the next three days. Without any effort from the&#xD;
      subject , the machine would move the subjects leg back and forth (flexing at the hip and the&#xD;
      knee) repeatedly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This machine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      patients after they have knee replacement surgery to help preserve the range of motion of the&#xD;
      joint while minimizing risk of damage to the joint from more intensive exercise. The use of&#xD;
      the device for this study is investigational.&#xD;

        A) Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Required mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ventilator liberation anticipated in the next 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: short duration of illness anticipated, preventing achievement of primary&#xD;
             endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known or suspected acute diagnosis of neuromuscular disease causing diffuse or lower&#xD;
             extremity weakness (e.g. CVA, spinal cord injury or lesion, Muscular dystrophy,&#xD;
             Myasthenia Gravis, GBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: chronic lower extremity weakness will impact anticipated physical&#xD;
             recovery and relevance of atrophy observations&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pre-existing lower extremity weakness caused by prior injury, neuromuscular or joint&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: Inability to participate in usual care therapy and CPM. Impacts&#xD;
             functional recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Wounds, dressings or injuries of the lower extremities or pelvis that prevent muscle&#xD;
             testing or CPM&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: Inability to participate in US, exam or CPM&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient's family, physician, or both not in favor of aggressive treatment of patient&#xD;
             that includes life-sustaining treatments or the presence of an advance directive&#xD;
             indicating the same a. Rationale: Unlikely to survive to seven day endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. More than seventy-two hours of continuous mechanical ventilation previously during&#xD;
             this hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: Atrophy mechanisms already active and may degrade ability to detect&#xD;
             early changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Non-English speaking subject or legally authorized representative&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Rationale: This study does not have the funding necessary to translate consents and&#xD;
             inability to ensure cooperation with testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject and/or Legally authorized representative unavailable to provide informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is a Prisoner&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy (excluded from CPM portion only) a. Rationale: Pregnant patients can develop&#xD;
             the supine hypotensive syndrome (where the uterus compromises venous return due to&#xD;
             compression of the IVC). This typically occurs only after 20 weeks gestation. To&#xD;
             assure safety, any patient who self identifies as pregnant or has a positive urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test on admission will not be offered CPM since it requires extended periods&#xD;
             in the supine position.&#xD;
