  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      metronomic oral cyclophosphamide in elderly and/or pre-treated patients with advanced&#xD;
      sarcomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive continuous metronomic oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 50mg&#xD;
      daily. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter to assess&#xD;
      response and disease progression. Toxicity will be monitored throughout treatment. The&#xD;
      study's primary end point is defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 12 weeks as a measure&#xD;
      of disease control. The study is designed to distinguish a favorable true PFR of 40% from a&#xD;
      null rate of 20% [Van Glabbeke et al. EJC 2002]. With a CBR of 40%, metronomic oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide at this dose and schedule in this patient population will be considered&#xD;
      worthy of further evaluation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic and/or&#xD;
             unresectable high grade sarcoma for which standard multi-modality curative therapies&#xD;
             do not exist or are no longer effective. Patients with low grade sarcoma need to&#xD;
             additionally demonstrate disease progression in the last 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt; 21 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior anti-sarcoma chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who are 21 to 64 years of age at the time of study entry must have&#xD;
                  received at least one line of established chemotherapy, if such treatment exists;&#xD;
                  or refused such treatment, which includes either an anthracycline and/or&#xD;
                  ifosfamide. Patients whose sarcomas do not have known established therapy are&#xD;
                  eligible for this study without the requirement of a prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants &gt; 65 years of age at the time of study entry are eligible for this&#xD;
                  study without the requirement for prior treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status 0-3 (see Annex A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measurable disease outside of a prior irradiated area as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             guidelines. A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible for measurable&#xD;
             disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No limit to number of prior chemotherapies or biologics&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants must have normal organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limits or normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT &lt; 3 times ULN (&lt; 5 times ULN if hepatic involvement is present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 times ULN. If creatinine is &gt; 1.5 times ULN, a calculated&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance time (CCT) should be performed and patient would be eligible&#xD;
                  for study if the calculated CCT is &gt; 10 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
             [NB: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) = [(140 - age) x weight [kg] x 1.22 ] / (serum&#xD;
             creatinine [umol/L]. In women, multiply this result by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Resolution, or return to baseline of all clinically significant toxicities related to&#xD;
             prior therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be suitable for oral drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness to use effective means of birth control throughout the duration of&#xD;
             clinical study and for at least 3 months after completion of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test performed within 7&#xD;
             days of the start of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible&#xD;
        for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who have had systemic anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks of study entry&#xD;
             (8 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Palliative radiotherapy or major surgery within 3 weeks of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer therapies or study agents&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Individuals with a history of a different malignancy, other than cervical cancer in&#xD;
             situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, are ineligible, except if&#xD;
             they have been disease-free for at least 5 years, and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy OR other primary malignancy is&#xD;
             neither currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention.&#xD;
