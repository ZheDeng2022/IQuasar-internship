    <textblock>
      Following a recent publication by the authors [1], there is no standardized treatment regime&#xD;
      for the treatment of lacerations of the olecranon or prepatellar bursa, although primary&#xD;
      bursectomy seems to be the most common treatment regime in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively follow patients who suffered from an acute&#xD;
      traumatic laceration of the OB or PB treated, according to the local standards, either by&#xD;
      bursectomy (Vie, AT) or bursal reconstruction and direct wound closure (Muc, GER).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fall onto the elbow or knee often results in a laceration of the olecranon (OB) and&#xD;
      prepatellar bursa (PB), due to their exposed and superficial location. Although a common&#xD;
      injury, the authors are not aware of any study dealing with this entity. In order to get a&#xD;
      first idea on the treatment concepts currently used, the authors conducted a international&#xD;
      online survey among orthopaedic and trauma surgeons in Germany, Austria and Switzerland [1].&#xD;
      The primary treatment approach of more than 70% of Austrian and German surgeons was&#xD;
      bursectomy and immobilization, which was performed by less than 50% of Swiss physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Departments of Trauma Surgery of the Medical University of Vienna and of the Medical&#xD;
      University of Munich, two opposing treatment concepts are being practised. Whereas in Vienna&#xD;
      a bursectomy is performed in case of traumatic laceration of the OB and PB, a primary bursal&#xD;
      reconstruction is performed at the Medical University of Munich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively follow patients who suffered from an acute&#xD;
      traumatic laceration of the OB or PB treated, according to the local standards, either by&#xD;
      bursectomy (Vie, AT) or bursal reconstruction and direct wound closure (Muc, GER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypothesis of this study is, that there is no difference with respect to complications&#xD;
      between bursectomy and bursal reconstruction in case of acute traumatic laceration of the OB&#xD;
      and PB.&#xD;

    <description>Bursectomy of the OB and PB are performed in the operation theatre under sterile conditions. In case of a laceration of the OB a leash, in case of PB a redon drainage (Charr. 10) is inserted. After application of a sterile bandage a cast is applied in both cases. Patient will receive AB for 5 days, the affected limb will be immobilized until removal of the stiches after 12-14 days.</description>

    <description>The bursal laceration is treated within in ER setting. The wound is cleaned and thoroughly washed, if needed the wound margins are excised. The wound is then closed using simple suture and a plaster applied and removed 5 days later. Antibiotics are be administered for 5 days</description>
