  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission of SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma through integrated study&#xD;
      of its clinical and biological features and to evaluate their changes over time. The ultimate&#xD;
      goal of these efforts is to promote better treatments for severe asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mission of the SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma to develop better&#xD;
      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in&#xD;
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the&#xD;
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP&#xD;
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)&#xD;
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and&#xD;
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and&#xD;
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating&#xD;
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, the SARP-SF&#xD;
      has identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the shared longitudinal&#xD;
      protocol. This will be explored through additional sample collections of sputum and fluids&#xD;
      and biopsied tissue collected by bronchoscopy. Together, these longitudinal and mechanistic&#xD;
      approaches will enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and pharmacologic&#xD;
      responses and identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.&#xD;

        A diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain better understanding of asthma&#xD;
        and its endotypes. SARP will therefore enroll subjects 6 years and older with a physician&#xD;
        diagnosis of asthma. The target recruitment goal for each center is 75% adults (age 18 and&#xD;
        older) and 25% children age 6-17 years. Within the pediatric age group, an attempt will be&#xD;
        made to enroll equal numbers of children 6-11 and 12-17 years of age. Similarly, an attempt&#xD;
        will be made to enroll at least 50% females and 30% minorities.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥12% or airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by a&#xD;
             methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An exception will be made for enrollees whose FEV1 is &lt; 50% predicted (&lt;70% in&#xD;
             children aged 6 to 17 years), precluding methacholine challenge testing. If&#xD;
             bronchodilator reversibility is &lt;12% in these participants, a diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
             acceptable to the investigator is sufficient for inclusion in SARP.&#xD;
