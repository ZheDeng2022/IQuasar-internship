      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with dinutuximab with or without isotretinoin in treating younger patients with neuroblastoma&#xD;
      that does not respond to treatment or that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide and isotretinoin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together&#xD;
      with dinutuximab therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      lenalidomide in combination with fixed doses of dinutuximab (ch14.18) and isotretinoin given&#xD;
      to children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the toxicities of lenalidomide administered in combination with ch14.18 and&#xD;
      isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the differences in immune function modulation between &quot;low&quot; versus &quot;high&quot;&#xD;
      dose lenalidomide given with ch14.18 and isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide given in this combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin (day 28, course one) given&#xD;
      in combination with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure peak and trough levels of ch14.18 in patients receiving lenalidomide and to&#xD;
      compare to historical controls of patients receiving ch14.18 in combination with interleukin&#xD;
      2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the immunological effects of lenalidomide (T cells, natural killer [NK]&#xD;
      cells, monocytes, cytokines, chemokines) within this three drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To define the incidence and titers of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) on this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe, within the context of a phase I study, the response rate to lenalidomide&#xD;
      combined with ch14.18 and isotretinoin in patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To summarize, within the context of a phase I study, the event-free survival of patients&#xD;
      with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma or in complete response (CR) after progressing, and&#xD;
      who are treated with lenalidomide combined with ch14.18 and isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine, within the context of a phase I study, if killer-cell immunoglobulin-like&#xD;
      receptor (KIR) receptor-ligand mismatch or specific Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma R) alleles&#xD;
      are associated with anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To quantify neuroblastoma tumor cell &quot;load&quot; using a 5-gene TaqMan Low Density Array&#xD;
      (TLDA) assay in peripheral blood at study entry, following, with each disease evaluation and&#xD;
      at end of therapy and bone marrow at study entry, with each response evaluation when bone&#xD;
      marrow is sampled, and at end of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To compare the toxicities of this regimen with the historical toxicity data from the&#xD;
      Children's Oncology Group (COG) ANBL0032 and ANBL0931 studies of ch14.18 with IL-2, GM-CSF&#xD;
      and isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To describe the tolerability and ability to give full doses of ch14.18 and lenalidomide&#xD;
      over extended periods of time, i.e. in courses 6-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, dinutuximab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 10 hours on days 8-11, and isotretinoin PO twice daily (BID) on days&#xD;
      15-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
