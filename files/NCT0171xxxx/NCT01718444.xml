  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progestin-induced endometrial shedding (PIES) followed by clomiphene citrate is fertility&#xD;
      treatment of choice in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, some&#xD;
      preliminary data suggest that skipping PIES could result in a higher live birth rate. The&#xD;
      investigators are performing the first randomized controlled trial to find out if skipping&#xD;
      the use of progestin during fertility treatment of anovulatory PCOS women is associated with&#xD;
      improved pregnancy and live birth rates compared to the traditional approach of using&#xD;
      progestin prior to use of clomiphene citrate.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial of clomiphene citrate (CC) preceded by&#xD;
      progestin-induced endometrial shedding (PIES) vs CC without PIES in the treatment of&#xD;
      infertility in patients with PCOS, for up to 5 treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either progestin followed by CC starting on day 3&#xD;
      of the induced menses, or CC without induced menses. Study participants will be monitored at&#xD;
      regular 2 to 4 wks intervals for response to medication using ultrasound and hormonal&#xD;
      parameters. The maximum dose of CC will not exceed 750 mg/cycle. Treatment will not exceed 5&#xD;
      ovulatory cycles. Participants who are resistant to 150 mg of CC will exit the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      170 anovulatory PCOS women actively seeking pregnancy, aged 18 through 40 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 treatment ratio into the two study arms. Anovulation will be&#xD;
      the only infertility factor in all patients.&#xD;
