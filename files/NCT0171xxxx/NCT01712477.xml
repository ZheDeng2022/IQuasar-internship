  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled pilot study in traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      patients who are sedated with either propofol or midazolam to compare the cytokine response&#xD;
      and neuropsychological outcomes with and without elevated blood alcohol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation is part of the standard treatment in patients with a TBI and has been proposed as a&#xD;
      neuroprotective intervention in head-injured patients. Sedative regimens, such as midazolam&#xD;
      and propofol, are not standardized and it is unclear whether sedation has a significant&#xD;
      impact on recovery and outcome. A review of propofol versus midazolam in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients shows evidence that both provide effective sedation but there is lack of&#xD;
      data to support one sedative over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are released in response to tissue injury and act to generate a variety of&#xD;
      physiologic responses. The cytokine elevation has been correlated with the extent of tissue&#xD;
      injury. This study will compare the cytokine distribution patterns at specific posttraumatic&#xD;
      time points in patients with a TBI sedated with either propofol or midazolam. Additional&#xD;
      analysis will compare the cytokine response in patients whom had elevated blood alcohol&#xD;
      levels with those with normal levels. Neuropsychological testing will also be performed to&#xD;
      determine the extent of brain injury and recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness, length of time from cessation&#xD;
      of sedation till extubation, recovery time, duration of admission to the ICU, recovery of&#xD;
      brain function, cytokine response, and complication rate of propofol versus midazolam when&#xD;
      used for sedation in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with or without elevated&#xD;
      blood alcohol levels. Since this type of trauma patient will require significant medical care&#xD;
      upon admission to the emergency room (ER) and the family will be concerned about the&#xD;
      injuries, the patient and/or family will not be approached about the research study during&#xD;
      this time. At the earliest possible time following neurointensive (NICU) or intensive care&#xD;
      (ICU) admission, an informed consent will be obtained from the patient. Depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the head injury, the patients may not be able to sign an informed consent. In&#xD;
      this case, the consent will be obtained from next-of-kin or a legal guardian. No&#xD;
      interventions or study research will be conducted on the patient until the consent is&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard blood panels are drawn for every trauma patient regardless of whether or not the&#xD;
      patient is a participant of the research protocol, including blood alcohol levels. During the&#xD;
      trauma workup in ER, it is standard of care to draw an extra vial in case additional lab&#xD;
      tests are needed. After consent is obtained, the research team will obtain the extra vial&#xD;
      from the Sparrow Lab to perform cytokine and blood cell phenotype measurements for the&#xD;
      research study. Typically 0.5-1.0 ml of whole blood is needed for these measurements and that&#xD;
      can be taken from the standardized EDTA tube that is drawn on admission. This small amount of&#xD;
      blood sample would otherwise be discarded. Plasma cytokines and cell phenobype IL-1, IL-3,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-¦Á, TGF-¦Â, G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, FGF, and IGF-II will be&#xD;
      performed by Luminex-based mutiplex assay and ELISA. In addition to the ER analysis, left&#xD;
      over blood will be used from the EDTA tubes at 24 hours, day 3 and day 7 after admission.&#xD;
      These additional measurements will be taken from the routine morning laboratory blood draws&#xD;
      which are done on all intubated patients to evaluate electrolytes. No additional blood will&#xD;
      be drawn for the research and the study will only be using left over blood already drawn for&#xD;
      standard of care labs that are done on all intubated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, the patients will be randomized to treatment group by random allocation&#xD;
      process using Research Randomizer (Urbaniak, G. C., &amp; Plous, S. Version 3.0 Computer&#xD;
      software]. The patient and family will be blinded to which sedation is given. Nurses and&#xD;
      physicians will not be blinded as they will be administering the sedatives. Although the&#xD;
      patients will receive randomized sedation, these patients would be administered either&#xD;
      propofol or midazolam even if they were not included in this research. The only modification&#xD;
      for research purposes is the randomization of sedation medication by the randomizer rather&#xD;
      than the physician. Currently, the providers in the research team do not have a preference of&#xD;
      one type of sedation medication over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, patients allocated to the propofol group will be initiated with a 0.5-1&#xD;
      mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by repeated 10-20 mg doses at variable intervals (approximately 15&#xD;
      s, at the discretion of the physician/nurse) until an appropriate level of sedation will be&#xD;
      achieved (NICU protocol), which will be subsequently titrated to achieve a target Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation-Sedation Scale (+4 = combative to -5 = unarousable) (Sessler et al. The Richmond&#xD;
      Agitation-Sedation Scale.Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002; 166:1338-1344). Nurses will note&#xD;
      pre-sedation levels based on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. While undergoing&#xD;
      sedation, target sedation will be defined when the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale meets a&#xD;
      score of -4 to -5. Patients randomized to the midazolam group will be initiated with 0.5-1.0&#xD;
      mg with incremental dosing at intervals of approximately 1-3 min until a level of sedation&#xD;
      will be achieved at a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation scale sedation score (per NICU&#xD;
      protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of all trauma patients include a careful history taking for alcoholism with&#xD;
      referral for further evaluation or treatment when indicated, and determination whether other&#xD;
      drugs are also being used. All patients with an elevated alcohol level require a medical&#xD;
      social service consultation and all patients with a TBI require a neuropsychology&#xD;
      consultation, both consultations are standard of care. The neuropsychological testing&#xD;
      conducted after extubation is also standard of care. The neuropsychological evaluations will&#xD;
      be measured based on the following assessments: intellectual functioning, language&#xD;
      processing, visuospatial processing, attention, concentration, verbal learning, memory,&#xD;
      executive functioning, sensory, perception, motor, strength, and personal assessment. The&#xD;
      level of impairment will be based on a scale from zero to seven. Data will be collected until&#xD;
      the patient is discharged from the hospital. The clinical records from the neuropsychologist&#xD;
      will be reviewed to analyze the progression of the patient's outcome. Similar to all trauma&#xD;
      patients, the patients enrolled in this study will be offered continued care with&#xD;
      neuropsychology as well as the option to withdrawal all care if competent to make independent&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study consciousness will be measured using the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) from&#xD;
      the time of presentation to the ER and two times each day until the patient is discharged&#xD;
      from the NICU or ICU (routinely done on TBI patients). The Injury severity scores (ISS) will&#xD;
      be recorded from admission (done on all trauma patients). Recovery of consciousness will be&#xD;
      determined by measurement of the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III&#xD;
      modification of the Glasgow coma score to allow for scoring of the verbal component in&#xD;
      intubated patients. Patients will be judged to be awake when the Glasgow coma score was &gt; or&#xD;
      = 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded from the Sparrow medical record for each patient: gender, age,&#xD;
      sex, weight, primary diagnosis, significant co morbidities, blood alcohol level at admission,&#xD;
      intracranial pressure measurements (standard of care for TBI patients), time of starting and&#xD;
      finishing of the sedation, total amount of medications given, any restraint required,&#xD;
      additional oxygen required, resuscitative measures required, time of transfer out of the&#xD;
      unit, and time of discharge.&#xD;
