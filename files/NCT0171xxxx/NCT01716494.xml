      severe asthma and how remodeling changes over time. The investigators propose to study a&#xD;

      The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the molecular basis and structural&#xD;
      and physiologic consequences of airway remodeling in severe asthma and how remodeling changes&#xD;
      over time. In that context, the investigators propose to study a well-characterized cohort of&#xD;
      adult and pediatric subjects with severe asthma using a multidisciplinary approach that&#xD;
      includes state-of-the-art morphometric, imaging, and physiologic measurements of airways. The&#xD;
      investigators will contrast these findings to those in groups with well-controlled asthma,&#xD;
      normal controls, and diseased controls (chronic bronchitis) to identify features that can&#xD;
      provide biologic targets unique to severe asthma. The investigators have demonstrated that&#xD;
      epithelial hyperplasia, goblet cell metaplasia and mucin production are features of airway&#xD;
      remodeling in subjects with severe asthma, and that epithelial remodeling was due to&#xD;
      increased epithelial proliferation and decreased cell death. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      individuals with severe asthma, in comparison to well controlled asthma, have: (I) increased&#xD;
      airway remodeling as evidenced by goblet cell metaplasia and mucin production, (II) greater&#xD;
      airway thickness by multidetector-row CT of the chest (MDCT) leading to ventilation defects&#xD;
      demonstrated by hyperpolarized helium (3He) MRI and air trapping demonstrated by MDCT, and&#xD;
      (III) airway remodeling associated with more severe and progressive airflow obstruction. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the goblet cell metaplasia and increased mucin The&#xD;
      investigators have observed in severe asthma are being driven by an IL-13- and EGFR-dependent&#xD;
      mechanism that inhibits epithelial cell apoptosis and allows IL-13 differentiation of the&#xD;
      airway epithelium into goblet cells (Aim I). The investigators further hypothesize that this&#xD;
      remodeling of segmental airways in severe asthma leads to distal ventilation defects and air&#xD;
      trapping (Aim II). In an effort to define potential predictors of subsequent decline in lung&#xD;
      function in severe asthma, the investigators hypothesize that baseline airway remodeling as&#xD;
      reflected by MDCT airway wall area (AWA%) is predictive of FEV1&#xD;
      (post-corticosteroid/bronchodilator FEV1) decline (Aim III). The identification of potential&#xD;
      variables associated with remodeling and severe asthma will help identify individuals at risk&#xD;
      whom would benefit from specific targeted therapy. The concerted efforts of this project&#xD;
      together with the SARP will lead to new insights on the mechanistic basis for severe asthma,&#xD;
      further elucidate how it differs from mild-moderate asthma, identify potential targets for&#xD;
      intervention, and will provide imaging metrics to objectively evaluate outcomes for new&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
