  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of malaria is greatest in children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
      Malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases in the world. Uganda reports among&#xD;
      the highest transmission intensities in the world. Children and pregnant women are the most&#xD;
      vulnerable populations. HIV is also reported at high rates for these populations. If malaria&#xD;
      and HIV require treatment at the same time, there is a high risk for drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
      This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if the use of anti-HIV medications including lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r),&#xD;
           nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV) will affect the pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of&#xD;
           antimalarial medications (specifically artemether-lumefantrine, AL) during the treatment&#xD;
           for uncomplicated malaria in HIV-infected children and pregnant women, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impact of age and pregnancy on the PK exposure of AL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to directly address antimalarial PK and pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      objectives in children and pregnant women, the populations most vulnerable to malaria. This&#xD;
      study will focus on the pharmacology of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the most commonly&#xD;
      prescribed anti-malarial drug in sub-Saharan Africa and inform specific dosing guidelines for&#xD;
      AL treatment of uncomplicated malaria for these populations. Traditionally, studies have&#xD;
      focused on non-pregnant adults, largely ignoring the effects of childhood maturation and&#xD;
      pregnancy on drug disposition. This gap in research is specified as a top priority by the&#xD;
      WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN), who emphasize the importance of proper PK&#xD;
      and PD study in relevant populations to reduce the threat of ACT drug resistance and&#xD;
      treatment failure. This study will allow optimization of ACT regimens, especially in the&#xD;
      setting of HIV co-infection and inform use of ART, specifically for the nucleoside analogues,&#xD;
      in the setting of malaria and ACT, with the goal of reducing toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study complements ongoing PROMOTE trials and provides valuable PK and PD data leveraged&#xD;
      to the existing trials, greatly decreasing research costs. This study involves co-enrollment&#xD;
      of HIV-infected children and pregnant women already enrolled in PROMOTE which is&#xD;
      investigating PI- vs NNRTI-based ART treatment strategies for reducing malaria-related&#xD;
      morbidity in HIV and malaria co-infected children and pregnant women. PROMOTE trials were&#xD;
      designed in collaboration with Ugandan health care experts and officials and results are&#xD;
      expected to rapidly impact Ugandan health policy. This study builds on knowledge gained&#xD;
      through PROMOTE. The study also permits enrollment of HIV infected children and pregnant&#xD;
      women not in PROMOTE but managed through TDH or other referral site in the Tororo area.&#xD;
      Lastly this study will enroll HIV uninfected children, pregnant women and non-pregnant&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes state-of-the-art PK designs and drug assay methods relying on a&#xD;
      combination of intensive and population models to optimize PK/PD analysis. Intensive studies&#xD;
      using serial sampling in a relatively small number of subjects will address focused questions&#xD;
      on PK exposure while population studies using less frequent sampling in large numbers of&#xD;
      subjects will study relationships between PK exposure, clinical response (treatment failure,&#xD;
      new infection, and placental malaria), and toxicity (neutropenia) while considering multiple&#xD;
      potential covariates. This study includes development and utilization of small volume assay&#xD;
      methods for ACT and ART to optimize PK/PD study in children and pregnant women and will be a&#xD;
      useful tool for future research trials in resource limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study is summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosing guidelines for children and pregnant women have relied on studies carried out in&#xD;
           non-pregnant adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and pregnant women exhibit distinct physiological characteristics that impact&#xD;
           how drugs are handled by the body and thus are likely treated improperly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This gap in research has been deemed an area of high priority by WWARN • Improper dosing&#xD;
           may compromise care of acute infection but more importantly contribute to develop of&#xD;
           resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACT therapies must be protected from factors contributing to resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug-drug interactions between anti-malarial treatment and ART must be evaluated to&#xD;
           assure optimized dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug toxicity, in particular neutropenia, in the setting of HIV-malaria co-infection may&#xD;
           be due to important drug-drug interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensive PK design resulting in determination of a precise area under the concentration&#xD;
           versus time curve (AUC) will permit robust comparisons so that results will inform&#xD;
           treatment guidelines and policy for HIV-infected children and pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once optimized dosing is determined, the PK of this new dosing will be confirmed through&#xD;
           follow-up (F/U) studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We need state of the art analytical tools to quantitate key drugs in small volume&#xD;
           samples collected from vulnerable populations including young children&#xD;
