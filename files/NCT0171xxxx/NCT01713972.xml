    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dabrafenib and pazopanib&#xD;
      hydrochloride when given together in treating patients with advanced malignant tumors.&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) given with pazopanib&#xD;
      (pazopanib hydrochloride) as well as determining the maximum tolerated dosing regimen in&#xD;
      patients with BRAF mutated advanced malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics of the two study drugs and identify potential drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine pharmacogenomics with microarray testing. III. Perform genotyping of tumors and&#xD;
      if objective tumor response rates are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess objective tumor response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (once daily on day 1&#xD;
      and BID on days 3-28 of course 1), and pazopanib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days&#xD;
      1-28 (days 2-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= institutional lower limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of dabrafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown; pazopanib belongs&#xD;
             to the pregnancy risk factor group D (adverse effects were observed in animal&#xD;
             studies); for these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             dabrafenib and pazopanib administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow oral medication and keep a pill diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic, untreated brain metastases; patients who are on a stable&#xD;
             dose of corticosteroids for more than 1 month or off corticosteroids for 2 weeks can&#xD;
             be enrolled; enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs are not permitted; screening with&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) imaging (computerized tomography [CT] or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging [MRI]) is required only if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency;&#xD;
             patients with G6PD deficiency are excluded from clinical trials because they may&#xD;
             develop nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to dabafenib, which contains a&#xD;
             sulfonamide, a potential risk factor for subjects with this deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking prohibited medications within 7 days of entering study will be&#xD;
             excluded due to potential serious interactions with dabafenib; patients taking&#xD;
             therapeutic doses of warfarin will not be allowed on the study due to potential drug&#xD;
             interactions (patient on prophylactic low dose warfarin are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib is an investigational&#xD;
             agent with unknown teratogenicity and because pazopanib belongs to pregnancy risk&#xD;
             factor group D (adverse effects were observed in animal studies); because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with dabrafenib and pazopanib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are excluded because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions of highly active&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) with dabrafenib and pazopanib; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;= 140 and/or&#xD;
             diastolic BP &gt;= 90) measured on more than one occasion and not responsive to&#xD;
             antihypertensives; Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is&#xD;
             permitted prior to study entry and during study if required; BP must be re-assessed on&#xD;
             two occasions separated by a minimum of 1 hour; on each of these occasions, the mean&#xD;
             systolic (S)BP/diastolic (D)BP values (of 3 readings) must be &lt; 140/90 mmHg in order&#xD;
             for a subject to be eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msecs (using Bazett's&#xD;
             formula)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack (TIA),&#xD;

             patients who are being treated for pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or DVT diagnosed within&#xD;
             the past 6 months with agents other than warfarin are allowed to enter the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days before first dose of study drug and/or&#xD;
