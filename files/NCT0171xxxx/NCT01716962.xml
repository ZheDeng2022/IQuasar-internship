    <textblock>
      Fluid responsiveness (FR)refers to the ability of heart to increase its stroke volume in&#xD;
      response to volume load.Low tidal volume and high PEEP exerts contrast effect on the&#xD;
      prediction of fluid responsiveness, the aim of this study is to compare the relative&#xD;
      predicting power of the dynamic preload indicator (PPV, SVV), passive leg raising test, and&#xD;
      pleth variability index (PVI) on the fluid responsiveness of acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome ventilated with various PEEP levels or various tidal volumes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In septic critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure,&#xD;
      inadequate volume resuscitation leads to multiple organ failure. Early goal-directed therapy&#xD;
      emphasizes early and aggressive hemodynamic support in patients with severe sepsis and septic&#xD;
      shock. On the other hand, because of increased microvascular permeability and capillary&#xD;
      leakage, conservative fluid management and more aggressive restriction in fluid accumulation&#xD;
      to reduce lung water and tissue edema has been suggested by acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome net. Fluid responsiveness refers to the ability of the heart to increase its stroke&#xD;
      volume in response to volume load. Accurately predicting volume responsiveness will be&#xD;
      beneficial in obviating the need for unnecessary fluid loading, and in detecting patients who&#xD;
      may benefit from a volume load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inducing cyclic changes in pleural and transpulmonary pressure, mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      results in cyclic changes in the preload and afterload, and therefore, the cyclic variation&#xD;
      in systolic and pulse pressure. Recently, a systemic review concluded that dynamic preload&#xD;
      indicator [pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV)] are highly accurate&#xD;
      in predicting volume responsiveness in critically ill patients. However, this technique is&#xD;
      limited to patients who receive controlled ventilation with adequate tidal volume (&gt; 8 ml/Kg)&#xD;
      and sedation or paralysis is needed to abolish the spontaneous ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, protective ventilatory strategy suggested&#xD;
      low tidal volume to 6 ml/Kg. On the contrary, high PEEP needed for acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome to prevent VALI induces a leftward shift to the steep pat of the Frank-Starling&#xD;
      curve and increase the fluid responsiveness. Whether the dynamic preload indicators (PPV and&#xD;
      SVV) are still effective in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients for predicting fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness remain controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive leg raising (PLR), by inducing a gravitational transfer of blood from the lower part&#xD;
      of the body toward the central circulatory compartment, can be considered as a brief &quot;self&#xD;
      volume challenge&quot;. Recently, a systemic review and meta-analysis concluded that PLR-induced&#xD;
      changes in cardiac output reliably predict fluid responsiveness regardless of ventilation&#xD;
      mode, underlying cardiac rhythm and technique of measurement and can be recommended for&#xD;
      routine assessment of fluid responsiveness in the majority of ICU population. More&#xD;
      importantly, this prediction remains very valuable in patients with cardiac arrhythmias or&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory variations in the pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform amplitude (ΔPOP) have&#xD;
      been shown to be able to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
      The main advantage of this index is that it is noninvasive, widely available, and&#xD;
      inexpensive. Perfusion index (PI), the percentage between the infrared pulsatile and&#xD;
      nonpulsatile signal, reflects the amplitude of the pulse oximeter waveform. Recently, Pleth&#xD;
      Variability Index (PVI), derived from perfusion index, affords a continuous monitoring of&#xD;
      ΔPOP. PVI has been shown to be correlated to ΔPOP and PPV and has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      equivalent to SVV as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients during major&#xD;
      surgery. However, whether the PVI can predict the fluid responsiveness in acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome necessitating low tidal volume and high PEEP is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the aforementioned contrasting effects of low tidal volume and high PEEP on the&#xD;
      prediction of fluid responsiveness, the aim of this study is to compare the relative&#xD;
      predicting power of the dynamic preload indicator (PPV, SVV), passive leg raising test, and&#xD;
      PVI on the fluid responsiveness of acute respiratory distress syndrome ventilated with&#xD;
      various PEEP levels or various tidal volumes.&#xD;
