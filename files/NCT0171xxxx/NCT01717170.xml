      In the STOP-UVEITIS study, we propose to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and bioactivity&#xD;
      of two doses of Tocilizumab (4mg/kg and 8mg/kg), administered monthly, in patients with&#xD;
      non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis.&#xD;

             malignancy, infection or fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening. In addition, sexually active females of childbearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use TWO of the following adequate forms of contraception while on study medication:&#xD;

             device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must agree to use barrier contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity while on study medication and for 28 days after taking the last dose of study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a documented history of non-infectious intermediate-, anterior and&#xD;

             retinochoroidopathy, retinal vasculitis, sympathetic ophthalmia, multifocal&#xD;
             choroiditis with panuveitis. Prior to study screening, potential subjects must have&#xD;
             been evaluated and screened for infectious etiologies by the investigators, possibly&#xD;
             as part of standard clinical acre; all testing to rule out infectious causes must be&#xD;
             performed within 3 months of screening for the STOP-UVEITIS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active and uncontrolled uveitis (of the types mentioned above) that at the&#xD;
             determination of the investigator, requires the initiation of corticosteroid&#xD;
             monotherapy at a dose of ≥ 10 mg/day (or equivalent) or prednisone therapy and&#xD;
             immunomodulatory therapy or injections of corticosteroid (intravitreal or periocular);&#xD;

             photography, or ancillary testing (e.g. fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green&#xD;
             (ICG), optical coherence tomography). As long as the investigator determines that the&#xD;
             degree of inflammation can be monitored for regression or progression, the&#xD;
             inflammation criterion can be met.&#xD;
