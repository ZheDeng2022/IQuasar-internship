      In general anesthetic the patient is deprived of his awareness and ability to breathe. It is&#xD;
      therefore one of the most important tasks in anesthesia to ensure the patient's airway and&#xD;
      breathing. It has been shown both in Denmark and internationally that failed management of&#xD;
      the patient's airway is the main anesthesia-related cause of death and brain damage.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is very important and highly prioritized among anesthesia personal, to be able&#xD;
      to identify patients with a difficult airway. The aim of &quot;The DIFFICAIR Trial&quot; is to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of UNEXPECTED difficult airway management by optimizing assessment of the&#xD;
      patient's airway before anesthesia. There is an international consensus on the importance of&#xD;
      proper identification of patients with a difficult airway prior to anesthesia. Enabling&#xD;
      optimal preparation and thus reducing mortality and complications. The DIFFICAIR Trial is a&#xD;
      nationwide multicentre trial with approx. 70,000 patients. 28 of the country's anesthesia&#xD;
      departments is randomized either to airway assessment based on the physicians' clinical&#xD;
      judgment (current practice) or to use an objective risk score for airway evaluations&#xD;
      including anatomical conditions known to be associated with difficult airway management. Data&#xD;
      from The Danish Anesthesia Database is used to compare the success rates of the two methods.&#xD;
      We hope that by using a systematic airway assessment we may reduce the number of unexpected&#xD;
      difficult airway managements and thereby reducing the associated complications and death.&#xD;
      Based on data we will contribute to a national recommendation for airway assessment before&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

      Detailed statistical analysis plan for the difficult airway management (DIFFICAIR) trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction The difficult airway management trial (DIFFICAIR) is a stratified, parallel&#xD;
      group, cluster (cluster = department) randomized and multicentre trial involving 28&#xD;
      departments of anaesthesia in Denmark. The DIFFICAIR trial compares the effect of two&#xD;
      regimens of preoperative airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of difficult airway management remains a pivotal challenge in anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Difficult tracheal intubation and difficult mask ventilation may cause serious patient&#xD;
      complications [1-6]. By allocating experienced personnel and relevant equipment, better&#xD;
      prediction of difficult airway management may reduce complications and thereby associated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. There is no single predictor that is sufficiently valid in&#xD;
      predicting difficult tracheal intubation[7-12]. However, several studies show that by&#xD;
      combining multiple predictors of difficult tracheal intubation, the positive and the negative&#xD;
      predictive value of the assessment increases[12]. In Denmark as well as internationally,&#xD;
      there is no clear recommendation on how to perform airway assessment. Consequently, airway&#xD;
      assessment in Denmark is based exclusively on the individual anaesthesiologist's preoperative&#xD;
      clinical assessment. It is poorly documented how accurately this preoperative clinical&#xD;
      assessment predicts actual airway management conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Simplified Airway Risk Index&quot; (SARI)[13] is based on a multivariate model for airway&#xD;
      assessment described by El-Ganzouri and colleagues enabling an estimation of the likelihood&#xD;
      of a difficult direct laryngoscopy. The SARI contains seven individual predictors for a&#xD;
      difficult direct laryngoscopy, each given a weighted score of 0-1 or 0-2. A summarized value&#xD;
      of the SARI score &gt; 3 indicate that a future direct laryngoscopy will be difficult. It is&#xD;
      unknown, whether the SARI score predicts difficult intubation better or worse than a clinical&#xD;
      assessment. The rationale for this trial was to prospectively compare the effect of the SARI&#xD;
      with an unspecified clinical airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult&#xD;
      airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population was adult patients undergoing anaesthesia. Twenty-eight departments of&#xD;
      anaesthesia were randomized to one of two groups. Intervention departments used the SARI&#xD;
      score for preoperative airway assessment. The intervention group additionally did an&#xD;
      assessment of risk factors for difficult mask ventilation as described by Kheterpal and&#xD;
      colleagues[14-16]. Departments in the control group continued normal practice of preoperative&#xD;
      airway assessment. All data were registered in the DAD. A more detailed trial protocol&#xD;
      describing background, design and rationale has been published in TRIALS[17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent outcome reporting bias and results based on data driven analysis it has&#xD;
      been increasingly encouraged to prospectively publish a trial protocol [18, 19]. The same&#xD;
      argument applies for a prospective publication of a statistical analysis plan. Concordantly,&#xD;
      the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      recommends that clinical trials are analysed according to a pre-specified plan[19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis plan has been written while the data collection from the DIFFICAIR trial was&#xD;
      still on-going and trial data not accessible. The data analysis of the main publication will&#xD;
      follow this plan. The statistical analysis was approved by the DIFFICAIR steering committee&#xD;
      on 29 December 2013. The last day of data collection was 31 December 2013. The involved&#xD;
      departments were given one additional month to ensure registration of all patients in the&#xD;
      Danish Anaesthesia Database. On 31 January 2014 the database was locked and data extracted.&#xD;
      The statistical analysis plan was published on www.clinicaltrials.gov before the last data&#xD;
      entry and before data was extracted and data management commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DIFFICAIR trial protocol has been written according to the SPIRIT guidelines and has been&#xD;
      public on www.difficair.com since the beginning of the trial and is registered at&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01718561). The Danish Anaesthesia Database and the Danish Society&#xD;
      of Anaesthesiology and Intensive care Medicine (DASAIM) endorsed the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is carried out in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. The Scientific Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Copenhagen County has declared that it is regarded as a quality assurance&#xD;
      project and thus should not be reported to the committee system (Journal No.: H-3-2012-FSP2).&#xD;
      The trial is approved by The Danish Data Protection Agency (J.No.: 2007-58- 0015/HIH-2011-10,&#xD;
      I-Suite nr: 02079)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The primary aim of the DIFFICAIR trial is to compare the effect of using a&#xD;
      systematic airway assessment with a standard clinical airway assessment on the frequency of&#xD;
      unanticipated difficult airway management. Both are registered in the database. The primary&#xD;
      null hypothesis is • There is no difference in the proportion of unanticipated difficult&#xD;
      intubations when the preoperative airway assessment is based on the SARI score compared with&#xD;
      a preoperative airway assessment based on the individual anaesthesiologist's assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative hypothesis is&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The use of a systematic SARI airway assessment, registration of the SARI and risk factors&#xD;
      for difficult mask ventilation, and continuous education in airway assessment will decrease&#xD;
      the relative risk of a difficult intubation with 30%, corresponding to a NNT of 180 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Randomisation and sample size Our sample size calculation was based on an adjustment&#xD;
      for the stratification and the cluster randomized design [20, 21]. Since there are no&#xD;
      previous records of the trial's primary outcome measure, &quot;unanticipated difficult intubation&quot;&#xD;
      a baseline study was conducted based on data from the Danish Anaesthesia Database (DAD). In&#xD;
      order to reject or detect a 30 % relative risk reduction in the proportions of unanticipated&#xD;
      difficult intubation between the intervention group and the control group approximately 30&#xD;
      departments were required in a 15 months period. Calculations were based on a maximum risk of&#xD;
      type 1 error of 5% and risk of type 2 error of maximum 20 % (80 % power).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 28 departments were included and randomized 1:1 using a computer generated list.&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was based on an average cluster size of 1,611 patients. We&#xD;
      estimated the average cluster size in the DIFFICAIR trial to approximately 2,500 patients,&#xD;
      giving a total of 70,000 included patients during the trial period. The enhanced sample size&#xD;
      allows for a potentially slight loss of clusters according to the power calculation, from 30&#xD;
      to potentially 26. Our sample size estimation might be of a conservative nature, calling for&#xD;
      more clusters than necessary[22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations The DIFFICAIR trial focuses on two essential elements of airway management i.e.&#xD;
      tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and mask ventilation. This statistical analysis&#xD;
      plan will address analysis of the data regarding tracheal intubation. Data analysis regarding&#xD;
      prediction of difficult mask ventilation will be handled in an analogous way, but will not be&#xD;
      further elaborated in the present paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The part of the DIFFICAIR trial regarding prediction of difficult intubation comprises two&#xD;
      populations; 1) patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy; 2)&#xD;
      patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy (population 1) plus&#xD;
      patients anticipated to be difficult to intubate and therefore scheduled for and intubated&#xD;
      with an advanced method (e.g. video laryngoscopic or fibre optic intubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of population 1 and 2 will be presented in one publication. Due to the extent of&#xD;
      data, further publications presenting data from the DIFFICAIR trial will follow, but further&#xD;
      elaboration on data analysis exceeds the content frame of this paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusting and stratification variables Each cluster (department) was randomized to a control&#xD;
      or intervention group, making this the intervention group indicator. The trial site may&#xD;
      account for further intervention heterogeneity and will be used for adjustment in the&#xD;
      analysis of the intervention effect. Further, a stratification variable that grouped the&#xD;
      departments according to whether the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubation at&#xD;
      baseline was ≥ or &lt; 2% will be used for adjustment according to recent evidence of increased&#xD;
      power in the analysis of stratified trials[21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumed confounding covariates We define age; gender; ASA classification; emergency/elective&#xD;
      procedure; Body Mass Index (BMI); and use of neuromuscular blocking agents as covariates that&#xD;
      are possible confounders, necessitating adjusted analyses of the primary outcome and&#xD;
      pre-defined subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fraction of unanticipated difficult intubations = all intubations with unanticipated&#xD;
           difficulties [False negative] / all patients primarily (attempted) intubated by direct&#xD;
           laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fraction of unanticipated easy intubations = all intubations with anticipated&#xD;
           difficulties that were easy [False Positive] / all patients primarily (attempted)&#xD;
           intubated by direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The two primary outcomes are linked and simultaneous low fractions are desirable for the&#xD;
      optimal prediction of a difficult intubation.&#xD;

           method / all patients (attempted) intubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fraction = unanticipated difficult intubations [False Negative] / all difficult&#xD;
           intubations ([False negative] + [True Positive])&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Specificity&#xD;

      Definition of difficult intubation In the DAD an intubation score is programmed based on&#xD;
      numbers of intubation attempts and use of equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A maximum of two intubation attempts - Only by direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A maximum of two intubation attempts in which other intubation equipment or assistive&#xD;
           devices for direct laryngoscopy is used (e.g. videolaryngoscope)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Three intubation attempts or more - Regardless of intubation method&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intubation failed despite attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy is pre-defined in the DAD as unproblematic by a&#xD;
      score = 1 and difficult by a score ≥ 2. In our primary analyses and sample size calculation&#xD;
      we will use the same definition as DAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General analysis principles&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unless otherwise stated, all main analyses will compare the two intervention groups&#xD;
           using intention-to-treat (ITT) [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In order to ensure a correct type 1 error rate, all main analyses will account for the&#xD;
           clustered design of the trial and the stratification variable [24-26]. Analyses will be&#xD;
           based on individual patient level data but clustering of patients and the stratification&#xD;
           variable will be accounted for in a mixed effects model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In all analyses a maximum level of 5 % (two sided) type 1 error will be regarded as&#xD;
           statistically significant unless otherwise stated&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Main analyses will be according to ITT adjusted for cluster and stratification&#xD;
           variables. Sensitivity analyses will be performed adjusted and unadjusted for the prior&#xD;
           listed potential confounding covariates. We will discuss if results differ from the main&#xD;
           analyses. The conclusion of the trial will be based on the primary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Test of interaction will be applied for subgroup analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Risks are reported as relative risks. When relative risks are calculated from odds&#xD;
           ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) it will be done according to Zhang et Yu[27].&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. For missing data exceeding a rate of 5 %, and with a statistical significant Little's&#xD;
           test, indicating that the missing data is not a completely random sample of the total&#xD;
           data, point estimates with 95 % CI will be calculated using a worst/best case scenario&#xD;
           imputation on the missing values. If the imputation of a worst/best case scenario&#xD;
           implies different conclusions, multiple imputations will be performed on the missing&#xD;
           values assuming missingness at random[28]. Unadjusted and complete case analyses will&#xD;
           also be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In order to avoid rejecting a true null hypothesis we will address the problem of&#xD;
           multiplicity by Bonferroni adjustments on the secondary outcome measures. If unadjusted&#xD;
           analyses are insignificant (P&gt;0,05), Bonferroni adjustments will not be applied. In case&#xD;
           the adjustment changes an unadjusted significant P-value to a non-significant P-value,&#xD;
           this will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To ensure complete objectivity, the statistician will be blinded for the intervention&#xD;
           group in the primary outcome analysis. After data collection, a third party data manager&#xD;
           will generate a complete data set with blinded coding of the intervention groups and&#xD;
           other variables possibly revealing the intervention. The statistician performs the&#xD;
           primary outcome analysis on this data set. If the primary outcome differs between groups&#xD;
           we will construct different conclusions reflecting the results, considering that&#xD;
           significant differences of the intervention could be both of benefit or harm. After&#xD;
           writing the conclusions, we will uncover the code of the blinding, and subsequently the&#xD;
           correct conclusion will be employed[29].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Trial profile The flow of study participants will be displayed in a&#xD;
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram at a cluster level and at&#xD;
      individual level. The number of clusters fulfilling the inclusion criterion and the number of&#xD;
      clusters included in primary and secondary analyses will be presented. The number of patients&#xD;
      who fulfilled study inclusion criteria as well as the number included in the primary and&#xD;
      secondary analyses will be reported. Reasons for exclusions of clusters and patients in the&#xD;
      primary and secondary analyses will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Frequencies and percentages per group will be reported with 95 % CI. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is presented as odds ratios and relative risk ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first analysis of the primary outcome will be adjusted for the stratification- and the&#xD;
      cluster-variable performed according to the ITT principle including patients that met the&#xD;
      inclusion- and not the exclusion-criteria. A logistic regression including a mixed effect&#xD;
      model will be used. Intervention group and stratification variable are regarded as fixed&#xD;
      effects and trial site is regarded as random effects in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second analysis of the primary outcome will be adjusted for the stratification- and&#xD;
      cluster-variables as well as baseline covariates assumed as confounders incorporated in a&#xD;
      mixed effect model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third analysis of the primary outcome will compare the patients in the control group that&#xD;
      met the inclusion- and not the exclusion-criteria with patients in the intervention group who&#xD;
      received the protocoled intervention. That is, a per protocol analysis of control group vs.&#xD;
      the subgroup in the intervention group that had a sufficiently registered SARI. Interaction&#xD;
      test will be performed in the intervention group between patients receiving&#xD;
      sufficient/insufficient SARI registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an alternative sensitivity analysis of the first analysis of the primary outcome we will&#xD;
      employ a different cut-off value for difficult intubation using ≥ 3 instead of ≥ 2 as the&#xD;
      definition of difficult intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Frequencies, proportions, percentages, odds and risk ratios are presented&#xD;
      with 95 % CI for each group. A chi- squared test is used to assess the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on binary outcomes. For categorical outcomes and the adjusted analyses logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline comparisons of patient characteristics Baseline characteristics are presented for&#xD;
      each intervention group. Frequencies, proportions and percentages will be used to summarize&#xD;
      discrete variables. In case of missing values, percentages are presented with the actual&#xD;
      denominator and otherwise calculated according to the number of participating patients.&#xD;
      Continuous variables are summarized using standard measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion using either mean ± SD for data with normal distribution or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline comparisons of cluster characteristics Cluster characteristics are presented for&#xD;
      each group, control and intervention. Unless otherwise stated, data will be presented as&#xD;
      means with SD for data with normal distribution or median and interquartile range for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of figures and tables The first figure will be a CONSORT flow chart on individual&#xD;
      patient level and cluster level. The second figure will illustrate the SARI score and&#xD;
      tutorial instruments. The third figure will demonstrate the registration in the DAD,&#xD;
      including the intubation score. The fourth figure will present baseline data from each&#xD;
      intervention group on individual and cluster level and the fifth figure will be outlining the&#xD;
      main outcome results for each intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion In order to avoid outcome reporting bias and data driven results this paper&#xD;
      presents the detailed statistical analysis plan for the main publication of the DIFFICAIR&#xD;
      trial. The DIFFICAIR trial raises two important questions i.e. is it possible via the&#xD;
      intervention to reduce the frequency of difficult intubation and/or difficult mask&#xD;
      ventilation? This plan only addresses the statistical analysis of the population of intubated&#xD;
      patients. This is because our sample size calculations were based on the same population; the&#xD;
      SARI was developed as a prediction tool for difficult intubation; and due to the extent of&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By adjusting our primary outcome analysis for different design variables, such as clustering&#xD;
      and stratification we strive to eliminate inflated type 1 error rates as a consequence of the&#xD;
      trial design. A mixed effect model is applied based on an evaluation of each variable as&#xD;
      having random or fixed effects[30, 31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When multiple comparisons are performed between two groups, you may risk accepting an&#xD;
      intervention effect erroneously (Type 1 error). There are several approaches that deal with&#xD;
      multiple testing. We chose to employ a Bonferroni adjustment on the secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures in order to evaluate, identify and discuss dubious significant outcomes that may be&#xD;
      due to statistical multiplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of a diagnostic test is usually presented as sensitivity and specificity. We have&#xD;
      chosen (1 - total accuracy) i.e. the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubations (False&#xD;
      Negative, FN) and the proportion of unanticipated easy intubations (False Positive, FP). Both&#xD;
      scenarios are of clinical relevance since the FN are at risk of hypoxia, increased morbidity&#xD;
      and even death, while the FP are at risk of being imposed unnecessary discomfort by e.g.&#xD;
      awake intubation. At the same time, both the FN and FP can take up unnecessary resources.&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity are more difficult to interpret intuitively. Consequently, we&#xD;
      chose to present more transparent primary outcomes. Using proportions of unanticipated&#xD;
      difficult intubation allowed us to perform a baseline cohort study, on which we based our&#xD;
      sample size and power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By publishing this paper where we pre-specify our methods and analyses, it is our hope that&#xD;
      the results from the DIFFICAIR trial will be as transparent and robust as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion This paper presents the principles of analyses used in the DIFFICAIR trial for the&#xD;
      first publication of the main outcomes for the population of intubated patients. Our approach&#xD;
      aims to minimize the risk of data-driven results and outcome reporting bias.&#xD;
