  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules generic drug&#xD;
      companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, the&#xD;
      FDA approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy&#xD;
      and who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some&#xD;
      people with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of&#xD;
      seizure control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly&#xD;
      because of problems with the generic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the FDA tests generic copies of lamotrigine (LTG), the blood levels measured after&#xD;
      volunteers receive the generic lamotrigine tablets are allowed to fall within a specific&#xD;
      range. This research will test whether two different manufacturer's generic lamotrigine, that&#xD;
      fall in different parts of that range, perform in a similar way when given to people with&#xD;
      epilepsy every day over a several week period. The two products will be called GENERIC A and&#xD;
      GENERIC B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generic forms of the study drug lamotrigine to be tested in this study are approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of seizures.&#xD;

      Qualified subjects will be screened and upon fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      signing the informed consent will be enrolled into the study and enter the randomization&#xD;
      phase (2-30 days). Subjects will be randomized according to a sealed allocation list that&#xD;
      will be balanced for sequence and provided to each site prior to the first subject&#xD;
      enrollment. Subjects that withdraw prior to completing the second period will be replaced in&#xD;
      a randomized manner. The randomization list will be generated by the study statistical group.&#xD;
      There are four test periods in two sequences for a sequence-randomized study. During two test&#xD;
      periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the &quot;low&quot; generic product and during the&#xD;
      other two periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the &quot;high&quot; generic product.&#xD;
      Each subject will return at the end of the 14+/-1 day stable dosing period for an in-facility&#xD;
      12-hour pharmacokinetic (PK) session to collect samples to determine Cmax and AUCs (area&#xD;
      under curve). Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing will be separated by a 14+/-1 day&#xD;
      stable dosing period. A final follow-up phone evaluation will be conducted 12-16 days (target&#xD;
      14 days) after the last dose of study medication. A single make-up period will be permitted&#xD;
      if there are issues during any single period. During the study the subjects will continue&#xD;
      their usual concomitant medications, including AEDs (anti epilepsy drugs), without change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the AED levels as measured by Cmax and AUC in each group using&#xD;
      average bioequivalence (ABE) and individual bioequivalence (IBE) criteria. Average&#xD;
      bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of&#xD;
      Cmax and AUCs for the most disparate generic products compared to each other are entirely&#xD;
      within the 80%-125% range (the FDA criteria for bioequivalence) using the two one-sided&#xD;
      standard analyses. Otherwise the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Approximately 36 subjects (30 subjects to completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: 3 sites enrolling approximately 12 subjects each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: Approximately 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Not donated blood within 56 days of the first pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agrees not to donate blood at any time during the trial and for 56 days after the&#xD;
             final PK in-facility admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has had epilepsy for at least one year based on site PIs assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receiving conventional (not extended release) lamotrigine as an antiepileptic drug in&#xD;
             twice daily dosing at either 100 mg twice per day, 200 mg twice per day, 300 mg twice&#xD;
             per day, or 400 mg twice per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No changes in AED regimen (lamotrigine or concomitant AED) for at least 28 days prior&#xD;
             to first pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have the ability to understand the informed consent form and be willing to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing to remain on same AED regimen through entire study. Subjects will be&#xD;
             responsible to supply all of their concomitant medications (except for the study&#xD;
             medication, lamotrigine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willing to stay approximately 14 hours in the research facility on four separate&#xD;
             occasions for pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willing to fast overnight and the morning of each of the four pharmacokinetic testing&#xD;
             sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willing to have at least 21 blood samples collected during the pharmacokinetic testing&#xD;
             including the in-facility session and outpatient portion for each period. The&#xD;
             in-facility blood collections will mainly be performed using an inserted catheter. In&#xD;
             the event of difficulty with the catheter or by subject preference, samples may be&#xD;
             drawn by venipuncture. The outpatient portion consists of morning trough levels within&#xD;
             +/-1 hour of the morning scheduled dose time on the 2 days prior to each research&#xD;
             facility PK admission drawn by venipuncture for each of the 4 periods. The total&#xD;
             amount of blood during each PK session will be equal to about 12 teaspoons (58.5&#xD;
             milliliters). The total amount of blood drawn throughout the entire study will be&#xD;
             about 62 teaspoons (309.5 milliliters) or less. For reference, this amount is&#xD;
             approximately two-thirds of the quantity of blood drawn during a standard blood&#xD;
             donation by the Red Cross.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willing to completely abstain from alcohol consumption for at least 72-hours prior to&#xD;
             each PK in-facility admission (that is from 1 day prior to the first outpatient steady&#xD;
             state level) until after the last sample is drawn for each period. Investigators&#xD;
             encourage no or minimal alcohol use throughout the study, but alcohol is not&#xD;
             restricted at other times.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Willing to remain on a consistent regimen of concomitant medications including&#xD;
             over-the-counter drugs and herbal drugs, if they are being used and deemed to possibly&#xD;
             affect the metabolism of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Willing to not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice through the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. If a tobacco user, willing to continue with the same pattern of tobacco use except&#xD;
             that no tobacco use is permitted during the PK facility admissions of approximately 14&#xD;
             hours (includes all tobacco products).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Willing to complete the subject diary as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Willing to adhere to all other protocol requirements as outlined in the informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;

               1. Double-barrier method (e.g. condom plus spermicide, condom plus diaphragm with&#xD;
                  spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hormonal contraceptive treatment (progesterone only agents - use of any agents&#xD;
                  containing estrogen are an exclusion for the lamotrigine testing)&#xD;
