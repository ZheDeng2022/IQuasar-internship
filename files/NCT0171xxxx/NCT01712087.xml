  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-approval study will primarily evaluate the long-term safety of the MedStream&#xD;
      Programmable Infusion System when used in combination with Baclofen for the treatment of&#xD;
      severe spasticity. A secondary objective, to assess long-term effectiveness, based on the&#xD;
      observed scores on the Ashworth Scale (rigidity for the lower extremities) and their Spasm&#xD;
      Scores over the 36-month follow-up period will also be described.&#xD;

        All subjects presenting for a de novo programmable pump implant or replacement of an&#xD;
        implantable, programmable infusion pump for the treatment of severe spasticity with&#xD;
        intrathecal Baclofen are potential study candidates and will be screened for study&#xD;
        eligibility. Subjects who do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will not be enrolled&#xD;
        into this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a viable candidate for &quot;de novo&quot; or continued (pump replacement)&#xD;
