    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to conduct a human trial of [C-11]OMAR, a new PET imaging&#xD;
      agent for the brain cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1), to determine its pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      binding characteristics.&#xD;

      This is a pilot, 2-part study to assess the kinetics of radioactivity in medically healthy&#xD;
      subjects, subjects with alcohol dependency (AD), and obese subjects following the intravenous&#xD;
      administration of the imaging agent [C-11]OMAR.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are overtly healthy males or females (other than AD or obesity), as determined by&#xD;
             medical history and physical examination. Males and females with stable medical&#xD;
             problems that, in the investigator's opinion, will not significantly alter the&#xD;
             disposition of the drug, will not place the subject at increased risk by participating&#xD;
             in the study, and will not interfere with interpretation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population&#xD;
             or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant by the investigator. (Note: specific laboratory tests are&#xD;
             listed in section 3.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have arterial access sufficient to allow blood sampling as per the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and are willing to follow study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have given written informed consent approved by the ethical review board governing the&#xD;
             site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last [30 days] from, a clinical&#xD;
             trial involving an off-label use of an investigational drug or device, or are&#xD;
             concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be&#xD;
             scientifically or medically compatible with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current substance abuse (other than AD) including marijuana use, or severe systemic&#xD;
             disease based on history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities or positive urine&#xD;
             toxicology screen. (Note: specific laboratory tests are listed in section 3.4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior participation in other research protocols in the last year such that radiation&#xD;
             exposure would exceed the annual limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of ferromagnetic metal in the body or heart pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other&#xD;
             study investigating [C-11]OMAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Regularly use known drugs of abuse (other than alcohol) within 30 days of the study&#xD;
             and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or positive human HIV&#xD;
             antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Are women with a positive pregnancy test or women who are lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have a history of head trauma with prolonged loss of consciousness (&gt;10 minutes), or&#xD;
             any neurological condition including stroke or seizure (excluding a single childhood&#xD;
             febrile seizure) or a history of migraine headaches&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of adverse drug reactions or intolerance to more than three types of&#xD;
             systemically administered medications&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have used any prescription medication (except for oral contraceptives or hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy) or over-the-counter medication (including herbal remedies or diet&#xD;
             aids) within 14 days of the imaging session. Multiple vitamins are specifically&#xD;
             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have implanted or embedded metal objects or fragments in the head or body that would&#xD;
             present a risk during the MRI scanning procedure, or have worked with ferrous metals&#xD;
             either as a vocation or hobby (for example, as a sheet metal worker, welder, or&#xD;
             machinist) in such a way that might have led to unknown, indwelling metal fragments&#xD;
             that could cause injury if they moved in response to placement in the magnetic field&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have had exposure to ionizing radiation that in combination with the study tracer&#xD;
             would result in a cumulative exposure that exceeds recommended exposure limits&#xD;
