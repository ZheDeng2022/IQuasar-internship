    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing, on-label Efficacy, Effectiveness and Safety Study designed in a&#xD;
      Multicenter, Randomized, Prospective format. This study compares two spinal fusion&#xD;
      procedures, Transacral Interbody Fusion and Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF).&#xD;
      Enrollment period will be approximately 12-18 months; each Principal Investigator/Study&#xD;
      Center will be expected to enroll up to 20 subjects. The protocol requires approximately 7&#xD;
      subject visits to the study center from screening through the final follow-up visit.&#xD;

      Study Treatment Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transacral lumbar interbody fusion (including 1L+ and 2L+) is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique that uses a transacral approach to achieve fusion at the L5-S1 or L4-L5-S1 spinal&#xD;
      levels. The transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is performed by using a posterior&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral incision in which the lumbar spine is accessed. Both study procedures&#xD;
      are approved for use and conform to US regulatory requirements. The study employs these&#xD;
      procedures and devices for uses that are consistent with their 510(k), legally cleared,&#xD;
      labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design, Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority between the transacral lumbar interbody&#xD;
      fusion procedure and the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion procedure (TLIF) by meeting&#xD;
      the primary and secondary study endpoints as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Fusion of the targeted vertebral bodies (L4-L5 or L5-S1) by 24 months as determined&#xD;
      by Central Radiographic Reviewer's interpretation of high resolution Computed Tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Incidence of major device-related adverse events and/or failures by 24 months,&#xD;
      defined as those requiring revision surgery or a secondary operation, or events resulting in&#xD;
      permanent disability or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Effectiveness: A 20% decrease in back pain compared to baseline by 24 months as&#xD;
      measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Effectiveness: A 20% decrease in disability compared to baseline by 24 months as&#xD;
      measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design, Enrollment and Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study and will receive one of two study&#xD;
      treatments in the study. The enrollment period is expected to last approximately 18 months,&#xD;
      with a 24 month follow up period. Approximately 15-20 sites will participate, and&#xD;
      Investigators must be proficient in both of the lumbar fusion procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight evaluations: Pre-Operative, Operative, Discharge, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 Months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy analyses will be performed at all follow-up points during the study as&#xD;
      well as a final analysis when all subjects have completed the study.&#xD;
