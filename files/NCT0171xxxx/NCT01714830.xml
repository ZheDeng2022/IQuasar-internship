  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) can affect both sexes and lasts at least for 3 months. CPP in women&#xD;
      could be due to endometrioses, ovarian cyst, colitis, etc, making the correct diagnosis&#xD;
      important (1-3). The most prevalent reason for CPP in men is non-bacterial chronic&#xD;
      prostatitis and in many cases they are considered equivalent to each other (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is associated with pain in pelvic region and could be&#xD;
      associated with other symptoms such as dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, burning&#xD;
      sensation in the urethra, abdominal, urine frequency, and pain after ejaculation (4-6).&#xD;
      Chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is devided into two groups: III&#xD;
      A Type (inflammatory) and III B (Non-inflammatory). The difference between the two groups is&#xD;
      the presence of leukocytes in prostatic secretions after prostate massage, urine and semen&#xD;
      (7,8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general population, the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome is about 0.5 percent&#xD;
      because many patients do not consider their symptoms as disease, while 6.3% of people may&#xD;
      show symptoms (9-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most important challenges in the treatment of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain syndrome, is that its etiology is obscure and it is known as a multi-factorial syndrome.&#xD;
      The proposed explanations are infection, psychological reasons, autoimmunity and&#xD;
      neuro-myospasm. Hypotheses about endothelial cells defect and cardio vascular disease have&#xD;
      also been proposed, upon which the new therapies have been based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In duplex mapping study of prostatic vessels in two groups of healthy and chronic&#xD;
      non-bacterial prostatitis people, it was shown that there was a significant reduction in&#xD;
      systolic flow in prostatic arteries in people who had chronic non-bacterial prostatitis, and&#xD;
      there was a direct association between pain and blood flow intensity, suggesting chronic&#xD;
      ischemia as a possible cause for pain (13). Pain in prostate without significant infection is&#xD;
      the hallmark of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (5). In physical exam,&#xD;
      prostate or pelvic tenderness may be observed in half of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome is challenging. No&#xD;
      specific lab test exists for its detection. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, which is&#xD;
      typically increased in acute infection, is usually normal in this condition. The diagnostic&#xD;
      approach in these patients is based on ruling out other curable causes such as benign&#xD;
      prostatic hyperplasia or bladder cancer (14-20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) is used to evaluate symptom severity and&#xD;
      response to treatment in these patients. A reduction of 4-6 points in the score is considered&#xD;
      significant response to the treatment (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no first line treatment for patients of chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The use of&#xD;
      anti-bacterial, alpha-blockers or anti-inflammatory drug is logical. However, if the patient&#xD;
      does not respond, further administration is not helpful. In non-responders, combination of&#xD;
      drugs or other non-medical methods should be considered (23-26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As discussed earlier, blood flow reduction, ischemia and disorders in endothelium of vessels&#xD;
      may cause pain in these patients and methods to improve blow flow may help(13,27). One of&#xD;
      these methods is extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) which is typically used for&#xD;
      tendonitis, acceleration in bone reunion and wound healing, improvement in muscle movements&#xD;
      through a reduction in passive muscular tonus, increasing muscular range of motion after&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident (CVA), treatment of Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      (28-30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoskes et al compared 24 chronic prostatitis patients with 11 controls in terms of vascular&#xD;
      stiffness, indexes of increased blood flow, vasodilation and reactive vascular hyperemia,&#xD;
      using Endo-PAT Â® 2000-Machine. They showed that endothelial disorder and stiffness along with&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular disorders are increased in CP/CPPS (31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ESWT for the treatment of CP/CPPS has been evaluated in a few studies. In a&#xD;
      double-blind randomized control trial, Zimmermann et al placed 60 patients with chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain syndrome from chronic non-bacterial prostatitis into two groups and treated one&#xD;
      of them in 4 sessions with a frequency of 3000 per session. The treatment group showed&#xD;
      superior results in terms of symptom improvement(32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, Zimmermann et al followed 34 patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome,&#xD;
      after one, four and twelve weeks post ESWT in terms of quality of life and pain reduction.&#xD;
      They showed that this method is useful and without any complications (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the promising results of the cited articles along with the paucity of data in&#xD;
      this regard we decided to perform a double-blind sham-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ESWT in CP/CPPS.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will sign an informed consent. Bacterial prostatitis will be ruled out by a&#xD;
      2-glass test (In this method a mid-stream urine sample is collected (10 ml of urine is&#xD;
      discarded and the second 10 ml of urine is collected) and then prostate massage is done for a&#xD;
      minute by Digital Rectal Exam and then another 10 ml of urine is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After briefing the patients about the method and obtaining written consent from, he will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into either the treatment or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first group patients will be treated by ESWT once a week for 4 weeks. (Each time 3000&#xD;
      impulses, with 0.25 mJouls/M2 and 3 Hertz of frequency. After each 500 pulses, the probe&#xD;
      position will be corrected, using trans-perineal ultrasound. The used device in this study is&#xD;
      the standars electromagnetic DUOLITH SD1- shock waves against erectile dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, the same protocol is applied but with the probe being turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination is performed in supine position for patient. For each patient, pelvic pain&#xD;
      intensity considering is performed at the beginning and end of study, by VAS. Patients are&#xD;
      considered by doctor for NIH index at the beginning and end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, obtained data about pain relief and change in NIH-CPSI are recorded in special&#xD;
      profile for each patient and finally are analyzed.&#xD;
