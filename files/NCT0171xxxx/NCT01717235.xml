  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects were screened and enrolled for the study. Subjects were housed in the clinical&#xD;
      facility from not less than 12 hours pre-dose till at least 30 hours post-dose in each&#xD;
      period. After maintaining at least 10 hours of overnight fast Test or Reference product was&#xD;
      administered orally (as per the randomization schedule) to each subject with about 240 mL of&#xD;
      water at ambient temperature in each period by trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-dose (0.00 hours) blood sample was collected before dosing and post-dose samples were&#xD;
      collected at 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 6.50, 7.00, 7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50,&#xD;
      10.00, 10.50, 11.00, 12.00, 14.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 30.00 hours in each study period&#xD;
      with a washout period of 7 days between the dosing of two periods. Subjects were continuously&#xD;
      monitored for well being i.e., blood pressure, radial pulse and oral temperature before&#xD;
      check-in, prior to drug administration and at regular intervals post dose in each period. The&#xD;
      concentration of Ropinirole in plasma samples obtained from study subjects was determined&#xD;
      using validated LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed on&#xD;
      obtained drug concentration data, using appropriate software.&#xD;
