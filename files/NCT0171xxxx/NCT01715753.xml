    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess the effects of weight loss on functional status and&#xD;
      lean muscle mass in frail, obese older adults (&gt;/= 60) who participate in a 6 month weight&#xD;
      reduction intervention. Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms: Weight&#xD;
      Loss Control: (n = 25) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of ≥10%; or&#xD;
      Weight Loss-High Protein: (n = 50) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss&#xD;
      of ≥10%, with a high proportion of high quality protein at each meal. Intakes of &gt; 30g of&#xD;
      high quality protein will be achieved three times a day by subjects in this group,&#xD;
      predominantly all from animal sources and 60-70% of animal protein from beef. Subject&#xD;
      criteria will include obese (&gt;30 kg/m2) older adults (&gt;60 yrs.) with mild to moderate&#xD;
      functional impairment (by Short Physical Performance Battery; SPPB score &gt;/= 4)&#xD;

    <description>Concentrations for lipoprotein classes (VLDL, LDL and HDL particle numbers) and subclasses (small, medium and large) were calculated using the LP3 deconvolution algorithm. Mean VLDL, LDL and HDL particle sizes were weighted averages derived from the sum of the diameter of each subclass multiplied by its relative mass percentage.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>NMR MetaboProfile analysis, which reports concentrations of several metabolites [ the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine, and isoleucine] was performed using the recently developed LP3 deconvolution algorithm.</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline Lipoprotein Insulin Resistance Index (LP-IR) scores at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>LP-IR is a composite metabolomic biomarker that captures the multidimensional effects of insulin resistance on the lipoprotein metabolic chain. It is measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a weighted score of VLDL, LDL and HDL particle sizes, and their subsets concentrations.</description>
