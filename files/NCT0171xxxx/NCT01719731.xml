    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that BPD is a common, serious but treatable disorder with a better&#xD;
      than previously recognized prognosis. Despite these findings, many patients with BPD are not&#xD;
      given the borderline diagnosis by the mental health professionals treating them. It is also&#xD;
      true that many newly diagnosed borderline patients are not provided with up-to-date&#xD;
      information on the disorder even though psychoeducation has been found to be a useful form of&#xD;
      treatment for other serious psychiatric illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted a preliminary randomized trial of psychoeducation for BPD&#xD;
      that found that those provided with immediate psychoeducation had a significantly greater&#xD;
      reduction in two core symptoms of BPD--general impulsivity and stormy relationships--than&#xD;
      those with delayed psychoeducation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, both instruction and assessment of change over time were conducted in person by&#xD;
      paraprofessionals. The importance of the current study is that it will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to develop and test the efficacy of an internet-based program of&#xD;
      psychoeducation for BPD that will be both cost efficient and easy to disseminate widely,&#xD;
      particularly to underserved populations.&#xD;

      Clinical experience suggests that many people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are&#xD;
      not told of their borderline diagnosis by those treating them. Clinical experience also&#xD;
      suggests that many people with newly diagnosed BPD are not provided with up-to-date&#xD;
      information on the disorder. These practices are unfortunate as the results of a preliminary,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial of psychoeducation for BPD conducted by the investigators&#xD;
      suggest that informing patients about BPD soon after diagnostic disclosure may be an&#xD;
      effective form of early treatment for BPD as it significantly reduced the severity of two of&#xD;
      the core symptoms of borderline psychopathology-general impulsivity and unstable&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application proposes building on the PI's prior work in this area by developing a&#xD;
      web-based program for the education of those with BPD and the assessment of three key&#xD;
      outcomes; psychoeducation and assessment of outcome that had previously been provided by a&#xD;
      team of clinically experienced research assistants. Both of these initiatives would allow for&#xD;
      the widespread, cost-efficient dissemination of this early form of treatment for BPD-a form&#xD;
      of treatment that has proven effective for other serious psychiatric illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators first aim is to update our curriculum for teaching individuals with BPD the&#xD;
      latest information concerning the disorder. This information will be organized into seven&#xD;
      modules: introductory information (history of diagnosis, stigma associated with disorder, and&#xD;
      demographic characteristics associated with BPD), symptoms of BPD, co-occurring disorders,&#xD;
      etiology, longitudinal course, psychosocial treatments, and psychotropic medications. Some&#xD;
      modules will be divided into sub-modules. For example, etiology will encompass childhood&#xD;
      adversity, family history of psychiatric disorder, temperament, genetics, and other&#xD;
      biological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators second aim is to develop a website for teaching the most up-to-date&#xD;
      information about BPD and assessing three key outcomes: the severity of borderline&#xD;
      psychopathology, psychosocial impairment, and treatment utilization over time. These outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed using self-report measures with proven psychometric properties. Symptom&#xD;
      severity will be accomplished through the internet-based administration of the self-report&#xD;
      version of the already widely used Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder&#xD;
      (ZAN-BPD)-a dimensional measure of the nine Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders, fourth edition(DSM-IV) symptoms of BPD. The investigators will also use the&#xD;
      Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST) developed by Pfohl and Blum as a secondary&#xD;
      measure of change in severity of borderline psychopathology. Two other self-report measures&#xD;
      will be used to assess psychosocial impairment (Sheehan Disability Scale and Weissman's&#xD;
      Social Adjustment Scale). The use of nine forms of psychiatric treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      using a self-report version of the treatment section of the Background Information Schedule&#xD;
      and its follow-up analog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators third aim is to conduct a small-scale randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      psychoeducation for BPD using this set of web-based instructional and assessment tools. Half&#xD;
      of the 80 subjects will be randomized to the investigators web-based intervention, which will&#xD;
      occur a week after diagnostic disclosure, and half will not. The investigators plan to assess&#xD;
      symptom severity, psychosocial impairment, and treatment utilization each week for 12 weeks&#xD;
      (as the investigators did in our prior study) using the web-based self-report measures&#xD;
      described above to determine its immediate effects. The investigators also plan to assess&#xD;
      these outcomes using these measures at six months, nine months, and 12 months after&#xD;
      randomization to determine if these effects are long lasting. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that two of the nine symptoms of DSM-IV BPD will decline significantly more in the subjects&#xD;
      who receive psychoeducation than those who do not-general impulsivity and unstable&#xD;
      relationships. The investigators further hypothesize that those in the treatment group will&#xD;
      have more improved functioning in the social and vocational (but not family realm) than those&#xD;
      in the non-treatment group. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that those receiving&#xD;
      psychoeducation will be more likely to seek out ongoing psychiatric treatment and less likely&#xD;
      to use emergency psychiatric services, such as hospitalizations, than those who do not&#xD;
      receive psychoeducation concerning BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the results of this trial would provide further evidence that psychoeducation&#xD;
      is a useful form of early treatment for BPD. These results would also suggest that our&#xD;
      web-based platform is an effective and cost efficient method for delivering such a program.&#xD;
      Finally, these results would pave the way for a large-scale, multi-site randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of this web-based program in community settings.&#xD;
