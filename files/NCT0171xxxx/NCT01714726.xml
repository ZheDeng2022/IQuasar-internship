  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of MEDI2070 as compared to&#xD;
      placebo. Investigational product will be administered as intravenous infusion in double-blind&#xD;
      period, and as a subcutaneous injection in open-label period&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase 2a study compromising a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      treatment period followed by a 100-week, open label, treatment period to evaluate short-term&#xD;
      efficacy, and the short- and long-term safety of MEDI2070 in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe, active CD who have failed or are intolerant to anti-TNFα therapy as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator. Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to initially&#xD;
      receive a fixed IV dose of MEDI2070 or placebo on Week 0(Day1) and Week 4 (Day 29) during the&#xD;
      12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period. At the completion of the&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment period (Week 12), subjects will have the option&#xD;
      to enter a 100-week, open-label, treatment period where they will receive open-label MEDI2070&#xD;
      (SC) Q4W (Week 12 through Week 112). Subjects will be followed for safety at 3 visits over 28&#xD;
      weeks after their last dose of IP. Subjects will also be contacted by phone 36 weeks after&#xD;
      their last dose of IP for safety.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Response at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days includes subject reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. CDAI score = Sum of weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid/soft stools, degree of abdominal pain, general well-being); and objective items (associated signs, use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, daily morning temperature, body weight). CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, higher scores indicating greater disease activity. The CDAI response at Week 8 is defined as either CDAI score of less than (&lt;)150 or CDAI reduction from baseline of at least 100 points, where baseline was last non-missing observation prior to first administration of the study drug. Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT)population was analysed for this end point, which included all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug in double-blind period.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days and includes subject reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. The CDAI score is calculated by summing weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid or very soft stools, the degree of abdominal pain over a week and general well-being; and objective items (associated signs, use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, daily morning temperature, and body weight). The CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. CDAI 70-point improvement is defined as a reduction from baseline in CDAI score of at least 70 points/scores, where baseline was the latest nonmissing observation prior to first administration of the study drug. Subjects in the mITT population were analysed for this end point.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, lifethreatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. The TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug (Day 1) to 36 weeks post treatment (approximately 48 weeks).

      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 174 screened subjects, 53 were considered screen failures. A total of 121 subjects were randomized, of which 2 did not receive study drug. Those 2 subjects were not included in the mITT population; therefore, those subjects are not counted in the participant flow.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With CDAI-70 Point Improvement at Week 8</title>
        <description>The CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days and includes subject reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. The CDAI score is calculated by summing weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid or very soft stools, the degree of abdominal pain over a week and general well-being; and objective items (associated signs, use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, daily morning temperature, and body weight). The CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. CDAI 70-point improvement is defined as a reduction from baseline in CDAI score of at least 70 points/scores, where baseline was the latest nonmissing observation prior to first administration of the study drug. Subjects in the mITT population were analysed for this end point.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With CDAI Response at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days and includes subject reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. The CDAI score is calculated by summing weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid or very soft stools, the degree of abdominal pain over a week and general well-being; and objective items (associated signs, use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, daily morning temperature, and body weight). The CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. CDAI response is defined by either a CDAI score of &lt; 150 or a CDAI reduction from baseline of at least 100 points, where baseline was the latest non-missing observation prior to first administration of the study drug. Subjects in the mITT population were analysed for this end point.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CDAI Total Score at Week 8</title>
          <description>The CDAI is a multi-item instrument which measures severity of active Crohn's Disease monitored over 7 days and includes subject reported symptoms, physician-assessed signs, and laboratory markers. The CDAI score is calculated by summing weighted scores for subjective items (number of liquid or very soft stools, the degree of abdominal pain over a week and general well-being; and objective items (associated signs, use of anti-diarrhoeal medication, abdominal mass, haematocrit, daily morning temperature, and body weight). The CDAI scores range approximately from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. Subjects in the mITT population were analysed for this end point.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, lifethreatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. The TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug (Day 1) to 36 weeks post treatment (approximately 48 weeks). The safety population was analysed for this end point, which included all subjects who received any amount of study drug.</description>
