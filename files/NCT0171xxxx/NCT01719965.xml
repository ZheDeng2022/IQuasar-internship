      A popular form of community engagement is for the researchers to interact with a Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board. The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit has been working on the Thai-Burmese border&#xD;
      for many years and has been informally engaging with the community for its healthcare and&#xD;
      research initiatives, especially in the area of ethics and consent. In January 2009,&#xD;
      community engagement was formalised with the establishment of the Tak Province Border&#xD;
      Community Ethics Advisory Board (T-CAB). The T-CAB is the first of its kind as the&#xD;
      investigators have not come across any set up of similar nature involving mobile and unstable&#xD;
      populations residing along a porous border.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three years on, SMRU questions if the T-CAB has been &quot;successful&quot; and if the current T-CAB&#xD;
      model is the best model for this community. In order to evaluate the T-CAB, first an&#xD;
      evaluation tool has to be developed as there are no off-the-shelf evaluation tools for CABs,&#xD;
      then the evaluation will be carried out.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on the Thai-Myanmar border&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1986, the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) has provided basic healthcare and carried&#xD;
      out research aimed at reducing the impact of multi-drug resistant malaria and other&#xD;
      infectious diseases in the area on the border between Thailand and Myanmar. SMRU's main area&#xD;
      of interest is in malaria, with special interest in children and pregnant women - the groups&#xD;
      most at risk from malaria - and it has combined this research with the operation of antenatal&#xD;
      clinics along the border. SMRU currently runs multiple free clinics for the Karen and Burman&#xD;
      border population that would otherwise lack access to health care. The most distant clinic is&#xD;
      about 120 km from the SMRU office in Mae Sot. Carrying out research and providing care along&#xD;
      the border presents a range of unique practical and ethical challenges. This in part because&#xD;
      the people who live near the border are mostly migrants or refugees from elsewhere in Myanmar&#xD;
      who have, since the 1980s, moved to the border area to escape economic hardship and sometimes&#xD;
      conflict and persecution. There are currently thought to be two million migrants from Myanmar&#xD;
      living in Thailand (about 150 000 in refugee camps) and a further million 'internally&#xD;
      displaced' people living near the border inside Myanmar, although numbers are difficult to&#xD;
      verify. The vast majority of these people, who come from a very diverse range of different&#xD;
      ethnic, religious, political and language groups, live in insecure, unsafe conditions and&#xD;
      face a number of serious health difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until 1995, SMRU focused its activities primarily in the refugee camps in the border area and&#xD;
      a strong collaboration was established with non-govermental organisations (NGOs) to control&#xD;
      malaria in the refugee population through the operation of &quot;the Malaria Task Force&quot; (MTF).&#xD;
      This was largely successful and malaria is now a minor problem within the camps. As a&#xD;
      consequence, whilst SMRU remains responsible for antenatal and obstetric care and the&#xD;
      treatment of malaria patients in refugee camps such as Mae La, since 1995 it has increasingly&#xD;
      extended its activities to reach out to the wider displaced populations who have little&#xD;
      alternative access to malaria diagnosis and treatment or antenatal care. This is done in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and in close collaboration with&#xD;
      the district hospitals and the Tak provincial health authorities. In 2001-2003 the Tak&#xD;
      Malaria Initiative, supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation deployed the malaria&#xD;
      control strategy developed by SMRU in the refugee camps to all 200 affected villages in the&#xD;
      province's border districts with substantial success. When the funding from the Gates&#xD;
      Foundation came to an end, the MOPH took over the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The border between Thailand and Myanmar is at the forefront of the global fight against&#xD;
      malaria because it is on the frontline in the battle against the development and spread of&#xD;
      resistance to anti-malarial drugs. Malaria parasites found here are some of the most&#xD;
      drug-resistant on earth and their expansion and spread is a very real global threat (research&#xD;
      has already demonstrated that the most drug-resistant malaria parasites found in Africa&#xD;
      originated in South East Asia) . This is particularly urgent and important in the populations&#xD;
      living along the border because there is published evidence that the malaria parasites may&#xD;
      become tolerant even to the most advanced artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) now at the&#xD;
      forefront of global malaria treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the establishment of the community advisory board&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is widespread agreement on the need for community engagement in clinical research,&#xD;
      particularly where the research involves minority groups and other vulnerable populations.&#xD;
      However there has been little research on the effectiveness and challenges associated with&#xD;
      different forms of engagement, and little or no evidence base on which to base engagement&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A popular form of community engagement is for the researchers to interact with a Community&#xD;
      Advisory Board. The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit has been working on the Thai-Burmese border&#xD;
      for many years and has been informally engaging with the community for its healthcare and&#xD;
      research initiatives, especially in the area of ethics and consent. In January 2009,&#xD;
      community engagement was formalised with the establishment of the Tak Province Border&#xD;
      Community Ethics Advisory Board (T-CAB). The T-CAB is the first of its kind as the&#xD;
      investigators have not come across any set up of similar nature involving mobile and unstable&#xD;
      populations residing along a porous border.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of its establishment, the T-CAB had three main goals. The first of these was&#xD;
      that, after a period of training - about diseases such as malaria and the nature and goals of&#xD;
      research - it's members would be able to advise on whether a study is acceptable to and&#xD;
      perceived as beneficial by, the communities in the region. The second was that, the T-CAB&#xD;
      would play a key role in advising researchers on the ethical and operational aspects of&#xD;
      proposed studies such as: informed consent procedures, fair compensation, risks and benefits,&#xD;
      how to protect the confidentiality of research subjects, and so on. The third, aim was that&#xD;
      the T-CAB would act as a 'bridge' between the communities and researchers. It would on the&#xD;
      one hand, provide communities with an opportunity to express views on proposed research and&#xD;
      to influence and direct research aims, and on the other, provide a means by which the&#xD;
      researchers might feedback the results of the research to the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three years on, SMRU questions if the T-CAB has been &quot;successful&quot; and if the current T-CAB&#xD;
      model is the best model for this community. In order to evaluate the T-CAB, first an&#xD;
      evaluation tool has to be developed as there are no off-the-shelf evaluation tools for CABs,&#xD;
      then the evaluation will be carried out.&#xD;
