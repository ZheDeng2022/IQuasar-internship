  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of treatment of post-op wound infection in&#xD;
      long bones after fracture fixation or joint fusion and either: (Group 1) operative&#xD;
      debridement and PO antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks; or (Group 2) operative debridement and&#xD;
      IV antibiotics for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis 1: The rate of study injury related surgical interventions by one year in&#xD;
      Group 1 will be non-inferior to the rate in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 1: The rate of treatment failure by one year in Group 1 will be&#xD;
      non-inferior to the rate in Group 2. Treatment failure is defined as wound problems that&#xD;
      require surgery &gt;2 weeks after initial debridement, infection recurrence, infection with a&#xD;
      new pathogen, joint erosion, implant failure, medical problems related to the treatment&#xD;
      administration which necessitates a switch from one arm to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 2: The rate of re-hospitalization for complications, infection,&#xD;
      non-union and amputation by one year in Group 1 will be non-inferior to the rate in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Following discharge for treatment of infection, per patient treatment&#xD;
      costs at 1 year will be lower in Group 1 than in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 4: Adherence in Group 1 will be non-inferior to adherence in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 5: Patient satisfaction with treatment in Group 1 will be non-inferior&#xD;
      to adherence in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To build and validate a risk prediction model for failure of treatment of&#xD;
      early post-op wound infections after fixation of fractures and joint fusions.&#xD;

    <description>This is a study of oral (per os, (PO)) antibiotic therapy versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the treatment of acute infection after fixation of fractures and joint fusions. This is not a study of an experimental drug but a study of route of administration of standard use antibiotics. Antibiotic regimen options decision will be made by the Study Surgeon at each site in consult with local Infectious Disease experts based on local standard practices and bacterial susceptibilities.</description>
