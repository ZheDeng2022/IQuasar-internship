  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a life-threatening cancer which poses a significant health burden, especially&#xD;
      when metastatic or spreading to areas other than the original tumor growth. Although various&#xD;
      treatment options are currently available for melanoma, melanomas that have metastasized&#xD;
      widely to the skin pose a significant clinical challenge as the available therapies have&#xD;
      limited effect. This study proposes the use of a topically applied compound named&#xD;
      diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) which has been shown to be effective in treating melanoma&#xD;
      patients whose diseases have spread widely throughout the skin. DPCP works by having a&#xD;
      patient's own immune system, which is usually used to fight infections, attack cancerous&#xD;
      cells. This compound has commonly been used to treat other conditions such as warts and hair&#xD;
      loss throughout the world for many years and is known to cause limited side effects. Altering&#xD;
      a patient's own immune system through topical treatments has also been shown to benefit&#xD;
      patients with other cancers that have metastasized to skin such as breast cancer. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will use DPCP to treat cutaneous metastases of various cancers&#xD;
      including melanoma. Our overall intention is to get a better understanding of effective&#xD;
      immune responses in the skin that may mediate metastatic cancer regression or cure.&#xD;

      This is an open label study to determine the efficacy and mechanism(s) of the proprietary&#xD;
      DPCP gel composition as a topical immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      metastases. This study is investigator initiated, carried out only at Rockefeller University&#xD;
      and the Sponsor holds the IND and is providing the test agent. The products to be evaluated&#xD;
      are 0.4% DPCP, in a non-volatile gel vehicle, and 0.04% DPCP in the same gel vehicle applied&#xD;
      to the target lesions biweekly for 14 weeks. It is our goal to apply the study drug to all&#xD;
      cutaneous metastatic lesions, but at the Investigator's discretion, certain lesions will be&#xD;
      avoided if they are in particularly difficult locations such as around the eyes or on the&#xD;
      lips. The estimated duration of the study is 142 days with 112 days of treatment followed by&#xD;
      subject examination on Day 142. If DPCP is shown to cause resolution of lesions by this&#xD;
      visit, there will be the possibility of continuing DPCP use as long as study medication&#xD;
      continues to be provided to The Rockefeller University.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  able to give verbal and written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinically diagnosed cancer with multiple cutaneous metastases that are able to be&#xD;
             biopsied. The subject may or may not be on concomitant cancer treatments/have internal&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
