  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ways in which influenza is transmitted between people are uncertain; for example, we do&#xD;
      not know if large droplets or fine particles (aerosols) matter most; both are produced by&#xD;
      coughing and sneezing. This means we cannot say what precautions work best in real life.&#xD;
      Improving our understanding is vital to allow the development of guidelines and policies to&#xD;
      help reduce the transmission of both pandemic and seasonal flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore how influenza is spread, specifically by looking at the&#xD;
      importance of spread via small particles (aerosols/droplet nuclei) that are carried in&#xD;
      respiratory sprays e.g. produced by coughing and sneezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the contribution of aerosols/droplet nuclei to influenza transmission by&#xD;
      determining the secondary attack rate (SAR) of influenza in Recipients randomised to a&#xD;
      control arm (no intervention - allowing all modes of transmission) compared to Recipients&#xD;
      randomised to an intervention arm (face shield and hand hygiene - allowing only transmission&#xD;
      by aerosols/droplet nuclei) when both groups of Recipients are exposed to Donor volunteers&#xD;
      infected with influenza via intranasal drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAR will be lower in Recipients exposed only to aerosols/droplet nuclei (intervention&#xD;
      arm) compared to those exposed to all modes of transmission (the control arm):&#xD;
      aerosols/droplet nuclei, droplet spray (larger respiratory droplets) and transmission through&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place in a quarantine facility. Some volunteers (Donors) will be infected&#xD;
      with the influenza virus via droplets into the nose. Other volunteers (Recipients) will then&#xD;
      be exposed to them by occupying the same room (in the day time) and taking part in certain&#xD;
      activities e.g. playing card games. Some of the Recipients will wear face shields and clean&#xD;
      their hands regularly during the times they are with the Donors. The wearing of face shields&#xD;
      together with good hand hygiene should reduce the spread of infection through large&#xD;
      respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces but will not prevent infection&#xD;
      that occurs through aerosols in the air. Use of symptom diaries and diagnostic tests for&#xD;
      influenza will allow the presence of subsequent illness to be identified. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      required to participate in the quarantine facility for up to approximately 13 days (typically&#xD;
      9 for Donors and 13 days for Recipients), plus study screening clinics and followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, during the study, environmental sampling will be performed looking for the&#xD;
      presence of influenza virus. Air sampling and swabbing of surfaces and objects may provide&#xD;
      information enabling us to better understand the routes of transmission.&#xD;
