  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events are the leading non-cancer cause of mortality after childhood cancer,&#xD;
      occurring at a significantly younger age than in the general population. The increased&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular events adversely impacts the functional capacity, morbidity, and&#xD;
      mortality of otherwise relatively healthy 20 to 40 year old individuals. Moreover,&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms by which cancer treatment could influence the occurrence of&#xD;
      latent cardiovascular events is unavailable. Our group and others have established&#xD;
      independent, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      middle aged and elderly individuals. Cardiovascular risk include, acute coronary syndromes,&#xD;
      cardiac death, and congestive heart failure. The goal of this application is to show that&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivors at risk for impaired cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health&#xD;
      have increased aortic stiffness, when compared to healthy adolescent and young adult age&#xD;
      mate. Studies are designed to determine if MRI measures of cardiovascular function differ&#xD;
      between adolescent/adult childhood cancer survivors (n=60), age matched controls (n=30), and&#xD;
      adolescents/young adults with planned treatment with chemo- and radiation therapy (n=25). The&#xD;
      investigators propose that MRI markers responsible for cardiovascular events represent new&#xD;
      clinical indicators that could be targeted to treat asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
