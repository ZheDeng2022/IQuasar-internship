      Diabesity (Diabetes accompanied by obesity) is a prevalent condition many times complicated&#xD;
      by micro- and macrovascular disease. Many treatments for Diabesity paradoxically cause&#xD;
      further weight gain and hypoglycemia. The Endobarrier enables diabetes control along with&#xD;
      weight loss as an alternative to bariatric surgery for patients who are not interested or not&#xD;
      qualified for surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      Endobarrier Diabesity patients in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 45 men and women between the ages of 18-65 with HbA1c level of 8% and&#xD;
      above and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: use of anti-coagulant, use of steroids or inability to discontinue these&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be followed for two years during which the patients will be monitored for&#xD;
      diabetes control (by using a continuous glucose monitor), weight, blood pressure, lipid&#xD;
      profile, fatty liver (by Ultrasound and blood markers for inflammation and fibrosis) and&#xD;
      change in plasma gut peptide levels. The Endobarrier will be explanted after one year,&#xD;
      however the monitoring of the patients will continue for another year.&#xD;

      Current therapies including diet, exercise, behavior modifications, oral diabetes agents, and&#xD;
      insulin, are employed to control Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but rarely return subjects&#xD;
      to euglycemia, require dose escalation over time and can be associated with hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      weight gain. Obesity is a well-established risk for both the development of diabetes as well&#xD;
      as for increased mortality. The majority of individuals with T2DM are overweight or obese.&#xD;
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are common and well documented risk factors for&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). For some patients NAFLD disease is a relatively&#xD;
      benign condition, for others NAFLD will progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease&#xD;
      with associated complications including hepatocellular carcino.The current treatment for&#xD;
      NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is weight reduction which can be achieved by&#xD;
      life style modifications, drug therapy or bariatric surgery. The Fibro Test and Fibro Max&#xD;
      have proven their efficacy as noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH in large scale&#xD;
      studies. Transient Elastography which measures liver stiffness non-invasively has been&#xD;
      successful in identifying fibrosis in NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, designated sonography is a sensitive noninvasive method for steatosis&#xD;
      quantification which can diagnose small amounts of liver fat that would be missed by&#xD;
      conventional sonography and is not affected by fibrosis or steatohepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery for T2DM In light of this, bariatric surgery has recently emerged as one of&#xD;
      the most effective means of providing durable, clinically-significant resolution of diabetes.&#xD;
      The majority of subjects with T2DM who undergo these procedures have remission of this&#xD;
      disorder. In a large bariatric surgery meta-analysis published in Journal of the American&#xD;
      Medical Association in 2004, within studies reporting resolution of diabetes, 76.8% of&#xD;
      subjects experienced complete resolution; within studies reporting both resolution and&#xD;
      improvement or only improvement of diabetes, 85.4% of subjects experienced resolution or&#xD;
      improvement of diabetes. All bariatric operations result in remarkable improvement in T2DM&#xD;
      although with varying degrees of efficacy. Resolution of diabetes often occurs within days&#xD;
      following bariatric surgery, even before marked weight loss is achieved. Resolution of&#xD;
      diabetes is more prevalent following the more &quot;malabsorptive&quot; procedures (BPD or duodenal&#xD;
      switch) and the mixed malabsorptive/restrictive Roux-en-y (RYGB) in contrast to the purely&#xD;
      restrictive vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding&#xD;
      (LAGB) procedures. In addition, there appears to be a gradation of diabetes resolution as a&#xD;
      function of the operative procedure: 98.9% for BPD, 83.7% for RYGB, 71.6% for VBG, and 47.9%&#xD;
      for LAGB. Subjects with the shortest duration and mildest form of T2DM had a higher rate of&#xD;
      T2DM resolution after surgery, suggesting that early surgical intervention is warranted to&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of rendering subjects euglycemic. Recently, it has been published&#xD;
      that subjects with long-standing uncontrolled diabetes and non-morbid obesity have a high&#xD;
      remission rate (88%) of their diabetes following RYGB surgery. However, despite the&#xD;
      considerable effectiveness shown by bariatric surgery in resolving diabetes, surgery has not&#xD;
      yet become a standard of care for subjects who are obese with diabetes. In part because of an&#xD;
      incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action, this concept of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      surgery as an endocrine modifier is not yet fully embraced by the clinical community and has&#xD;
      yet to be incorporated into care strategies.12 But perhaps more importantly, some clinicians&#xD;
      evoke the irreversibility of gastric bypass and the occasional reports of poor outcomes to&#xD;
      label this approach &quot;extreme&quot; - to be reserved as a treatment of last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery for NAFLD Weight loss following bariatric surgery results in a marked&#xD;
      improvement in hepatic steatosis. An analysis of numerous paired biopsy studies reveals&#xD;
      convincing evidence that significant improvement in steatosis and inflammation occurs in&#xD;
      NAFLD patients after weight loss surgery. Regression and histologic improvement of NASH has&#xD;
      been documented after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;EndoBarrier&quot; Gastrointestinal Liner System is an endoscopically-delivered device that&#xD;
      offers an alternative to gastric bypass surgery. The device shields the duodenum and upper&#xD;
      jejunum from contact with chyme, thereby mimicking the foregut bypass effect of a RYGB&#xD;
      procedure without altering the subject's anatomy. Pancreatic and biliary secretions pass&#xD;
      along the outside of the device and then mix with chyme in the upper jejunum. Based on animal&#xD;
      experiments and clinical observations, the EndoBarrier device may provide a useful&#xD;
      non-surgical intervention for treating T2DM, with an added benefit of weight loss. To date,&#xD;
      over 13 studies enrolling over 500 subjects were performed with the EndoBarrier device. In&#xD;
      one study, at 12 months 23/32 uncontrolled T2DM subjects (71.9%), were able to achieve an&#xD;
      HbA1c value less than or equal to 7.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product offers a minimally invasive reversible alternative to a fully surgical approach.&#xD;
      Since it is delivered and retrieved endoscopically, the device has the option of being&#xD;
      removed if necessary and without changing a subject's anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraging early clinical trial results, support continued investigating of the device for a&#xD;
      T2DM indication. To date, there are over 400,000 diabetic subjects in Israel and in 90% of&#xD;
      the cases the diabetes can be related to overweight. Over 50% of these patients are not well&#xD;
      controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description - ENDOBARRIER The EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner system received&#xD;
      European Community mark (CE) on 11 December 2009 and is indicated for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The implant is indicated for a maximum implant duration period&#xD;
      of twelve months. The intent of the EndoBarrier is to facilitate glycemic control and weight&#xD;
      loss by mimicking portions of the Roux-en-Y bypass procedure. The device consists of 3&#xD;
      components: the implant, the delivery system, and the removal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure entails bypassing the duodenum and the proximal jejunum with a 60 cm&#xD;
      non-permeable polymeric sleeve which is attached to the duodenal wall. This sleeve prevents&#xD;
      the contact of food with the duodenal wall, thereby re-capitulating one of the major&#xD;
      properties of the Roux-en-Y (RYGB) operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this technique, control of diabetes is accompanied by weight loss, with no need for&#xD;
      medications that may cause weight gain / hypoglycemia and may serve to replace or postpone&#xD;
      surgery. In a recent paper by de Moura et al, Twenty-two subjects with uncontrolled type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and a body mass index between 40- 60 kg/m ² were implanted with the EndoBarrier and&#xD;
      followed prospectively for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors found statistically significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (- 30.3 ±&#xD;
      10.2 mg/dL), fasting insulin (- 7.3 ± 2.6 units/mL), and HbA1c ( -2.1±0.3%) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing the procedure. The study conclusions were that EndoBarrier improves glycemic&#xD;
      status in obese subjects with diabetes and therefore represents a non-surgical, reversible&#xD;
      alternative to bariatric surgery. Internal data from GI Dynamics reveals that obese subject&#xD;
      (average BMI of 44 kg/m²) and uncontrolled diabetes (average A1c of 8.4 %) who were implanted&#xD;
      with EndoBarrier for one year showed: a reduction of 2.1% of the A1c level, with a value of&#xD;
      less than 7% in 80% of the subjects, an average reduction of 20 Kg (representing 16% of the&#xD;
      excess weight), a 29% reduction in the triglyceride level and a 14% reduction in LDL-c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 months the EndoBarrier was removed and the subjects remained in follow up for&#xD;
      additional 18 months. During this period, the achievement was maintained This is an&#xD;
      open-label two phase trail investigating the effect of an EndoBarrier sleeve on diabetes&#xD;
      control and body weight in diabetic obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EndoBarrier in treatment&#xD;
      of diabetes and obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effect of the EndoBarrier as a model for the proximal effects of the RYGB&#xD;
           surgery in terms of diabetes control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the weight independent mechanisms by which the Endobarrier improves diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the effect of Endobarrier implantation on liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and&#xD;
           fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

      conducted. Fasting Laboratory measurements will be performed visit 2 - gastro screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will arrive at the site fasted. The following activities will occur on Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroscopy will be performed. 40 mg of Omeprazole twice daily 3 days prior to visit 4 will&#xD;
      be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - sensor insertion &amp; Liver tests Patient will arrive at the site fasted. Patients&#xD;
      will arrive at the site 2 days before the planned device implantation. The patient should be&#xD;
      fasting in visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities will occur on Visit 3: Fasting Laboratory measurements will be&#xD;
      performed. Ultrasound for elastography and hepatic fat content will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor insertion will be performed. The patient will be asked to answer the &quot;Visual analog&#xD;
      scale&quot; (VAS) questionnaire. Dietary consultation will be performed Visit 4 - Endobarrier&#xD;
      implantation: The patient will arrive in a fasting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under full anesthesia, gastroscopy will be performed and a guide wire will be inserted to the&#xD;
      jejunum. The Endobarrirer device will be inserted over the guide wire and introduced into the&#xD;
      duodenal bulb. Under fluoroscopy the device will be operated and the sleeve will be released&#xD;
      from its capsule. Contrast material will be injected thorough the sleeve to insure full&#xD;
      opening. After full expansion of the sleeve, the anchoring mechanism will be operated and the&#xD;
      sleeve will be anchored by small hooks to the duodenal bulb. Correct hooking will be&#xD;
      visualized endoscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      visits 5-17: Vital signs, weight, waist circumferences will be measured. Fasting Laboratory&#xD;
      measurements will be performed. Diabetes and diet consultation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      visit 18: Endobarrier retrieval: Vital signs, weight, waist circumferences will be measured.&#xD;
      Fasting Laboratory measurements will be performed. Patient will be asked to answer the VAS&#xD;
      questionnaire. Diabetes and diet consultation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrieval procedure will be performed after sedation: A retrieval hood will be connected&#xD;
      to the endoscope tip, a scope will be introduced to the duodenum, a retrieval grasper will be&#xD;
      inserted through the scope, by pulling the drawstring the anchoring hook will collapse and&#xD;
      when all hooks are within the plastic retrieval hood the endoscope will be withdrawn safely&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      visit 19-22: follow up : Vital signs, weight, waist circumferences will be measured. Fasting&#xD;
      Laboratory measurements will be performed Diabetes and diet consultation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator due to a&#xD;
      safety concern, such as: Intractable abdominal pain ,Intractable vomiting, Upper GI bleeding,&#xD;
      the need for initiation of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Aspirin or any&#xD;
      other drugs with bleeding as a potential side effect (i.e. Coumadin).&#xD;
