  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with some forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM) are not&#xD;
      cured with conventional therapy and new approaches are needed. For the last 15 years we have&#xD;
      investigated the potential of using a patient's own T cells (a type of white blood cell&#xD;
      [WBC]) to eradicate the tumor. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in cell&#xD;
      culture and animal models of AML and MM. Over the last 5 years we have been preparing to&#xD;
      treat patients as part of a Phase I (first in human) clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial treatment involves collecting the patient's own WBCs from the blood by a standard&#xD;
      well established and safe process called apheresis. The cells are then cultured in a&#xD;
      specialized laboratory (under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions, similar to standards&#xD;
      under which pharmaceuticals are produced) over 12 days to convert the cells to specialized&#xD;
      tumor-attacking T cells. Early in that culture process the cells are exposed to a virus (that&#xD;
      is modified so that it cannot infect or replicate outside the special culture conditions)&#xD;
      that contains a special gene. Via the virus, this gene inserts into the patient's T cells in&#xD;
      culture and gets incorporated into the T cell's genetic machinery. As the T cells replicate,&#xD;
      the new gene produces a protein receptor that becomes part of the patient's T cells. This&#xD;
      protein receptor on the T cells has the capacity to specifically recognize and bind to a&#xD;
      protein on the leukemia or myeloma cells called the &quot;Lewis Y&quot; antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the modified T cells are infused into the patient, they home into the bone marrow (this&#xD;
      tracking is monitored by special radiological techniques) where the new protein receptor on&#xD;
      the T cell surface can recognize and bind to the cancer cells (which express Lewis Y). Once&#xD;
      bound onto the cancer cells, the T cells get activated and subsequently replicate and kill&#xD;
      the cancer cells. The novelty of this approach is that the T-cells will only kill cells that&#xD;
      have the Lewis Y on their surface - the cancer cells. Moreover, because there are few normal&#xD;
      cells in a person's body that carry Lewis Y, this treatment is likely to only have minor side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This gene therapy trial is unique and although the primary purpose is to test the safety of&#xD;
      this approach, patients will be monitored closely for anti-tumor responses. As the trial&#xD;
      progresses, the dose of T cells infused will increase, in the hope that this will result in a&#xD;
      better and stronger immune response to the leukemia or myeloma.&#xD;
