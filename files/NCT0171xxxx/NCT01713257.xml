      This study intends to investigate the clinical outcomes of a new immunoenhancing formula&#xD;
      which composed arginine free compare to isonitrogenous, isocaloric standard formula in ICU&#xD;
      patients.The study design is multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study with 3&#xD;
      periods of Screening, Run-in and Randomization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of immunoenhancing diet (IED) arginine&#xD;
      free in medical-surgical ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the immunologic effects and safety of IED arginine free&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;

      It is accepted that nutrition support is essential in the treatment of critically ill&#xD;
      patients. It is also reasonable to initiate nutrition support therapy as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Although malnutrition is most frequently associated with a risk for immune dysfunction, it&#xD;
      can affect all organ systems. Thus, ICU patients are in need of immunonutrients&#xD;
      supplementation. An additional strategy to maximize the benefits is to consider using&#xD;
      products supplemented with specific nutrients that modulate the immune system, improve wound&#xD;
      healing, and reduce oxidative stress. The lower incidence of infectious complications may&#xD;
      follow in shorter lengths of both intensive care units (ICU) and hospital stays. Many studies&#xD;
      have concentrated on nutrients to stimulate the function of cellular immunity in these&#xD;
      patients. These nutrients include arginine, glutamine and omega-3 fatty acid which has direct&#xD;
      effect on T lymphocytes and macrophage. Enteral formulas designed as immune-enhancing diets&#xD;
      (IED) contain supplemental amounts of L-arginine, L-glutamine, nucleotides and the long chain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and&#xD;
      arachidonic acid (ARA) in addition to nutrient substrates essential for general nutrition and&#xD;
      metabolism. These formulas vary considerably in composition of these four primary substrates.&#xD;
      They introduce the immune cell function augmentation, inflammation regulation and infections&#xD;
      minimization. Glutamine, a conditional-essential amino acid, an essential energy source, a&#xD;
      precursor for protein synthesis and donates nitrogen for the synthesis of purines,&#xD;
      pyrimidines, nucleotides, amino sugars, and glutathione antioxidant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamine also plays an important role in enhancing immune cell function with no elevation in&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokine production. The lower levels of glutamine have been associated with&#xD;
      impaired tissue healing, immune dysfunction and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 fatty acid or omega-3 fatty acid) directly affects the function of&#xD;
      monocyte by membrane characteristic alteration, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis that has&#xD;
      the action of macrophage phagocytosis, IL-1 and superoxide synthesis. Moreover, omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acid reduces cellular immune response reaction by compete arachidonic acid resulting in less&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arginine is considered a nutrient that enhances the immune response. Studies have shown&#xD;
      arginine-supplemented immune formulas in helping decrease protein catabolism, improve&#xD;
      nitrogen balance, enhance wound healing and wound strength resulted in less infection and&#xD;
      shorter hospitalization days. Arginine has also been shown to support the immune system by&#xD;
      enhancing lymphocyte proliferation and phagocytosis. Arginine may provide some benefits.&#xD;
      However, recent meta-analysis conducted in a subgroup of critically ill patients by Heyland&#xD;
      and colleagues revealed that arginine may be harmful to some group especially septic patients&#xD;
      by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these scientific rationales, it is recommended that arginine should not be used in&#xD;
      critically ill patients who are clearly septic. And many evidences exist for supplementation&#xD;
      with antioxidant and immunonutrition in the critically ill. Glutamine and fish oil/borage oil&#xD;
      should be considered. These result in the development of immune-enhancing diet (IED) without&#xD;
      arginine. In addition, two types of lipids are added into the formula to further modulate&#xD;
      immune response. First, fish oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids and borage oil as a&#xD;
      source of docosahexanoic acid (DHA), a unique omega-6 fatty acid (n-6 fatty acid). Both n-3&#xD;
      and n-6 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and are essential fatty acids&#xD;
      (EFA). Therefore, immune-enhancing diet composes of L-glutamine, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),&#xD;
      docosahexanoic acid (DHA), antioxidant vitamins and trace minerals such as vitamin A, vitamin&#xD;
      E, vitamin C, selenium and betacarotene.&#xD;
