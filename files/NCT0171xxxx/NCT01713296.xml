  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to study the single agent activity of pazopanib in a Phase II trial of&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. Because these patients have very&#xD;
      limited treatment options, use of an investigational agent in this patient population is&#xD;
      supported by current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Using correlative&#xD;
      biologic studies to evaluate the anti angiogenic activity of pazopanib in the absence of&#xD;
      concomitant chemotherapy will allow us to delineate the responses due to this drug and the&#xD;
      effect on angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib dose has been determined to 800 mg once daily per the initial recommended dose&#xD;
      approved by FDA and EMA, as monotherapy in advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer is a tumor that initially responds to chemotherapy and radiotherapy,&#xD;
      however, it is associated with very poor prognosis since the initial response is nearly&#xD;
      always followed by relapse and metastasis. The response to subsequent therapy is very limited&#xD;
      as is the duration of response in these patients. Patients with SCLC have high rates of&#xD;
      metastases at presentation suggesting that angiogenesis is particularly important in this&#xD;
      cancer, furthermore studies have shown that microvessel density and VEGF expression in SCLC&#xD;
      tumor samples correlate with development of metastases and poor prognosis. Furthermore VEGF&#xD;
      expression was the only factor that retained a significant inverse correlation with survival&#xD;
      when assessed in a multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is a potent, small molecule competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity&#xD;
      of (VEGFR 1), VEGFR 2, VEGFR 3, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c kit, capable of&#xD;
      inhibiting downstream signalling from these receptors. The IC50 of pazopanib against VEGFR 2&#xD;
      is 10nm, and the IC50 against VEGFR 1 is &lt;50nm. Currently a number of studies is underway for&#xD;
      the evaluation of pazopanib in the treatment NSCLC. Administering pazopanib to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed SCLC offers an attractive choice in patients with very limited therapeutic choices.&#xD;
      The high rate of metastasis highlights the need for alternative treatments that act directly&#xD;
      on the growth and invasion of tumors and subsequent development of metastases, rather than&#xD;
      solely on cell proliferation.&#xD;
