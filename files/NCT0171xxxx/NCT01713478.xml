  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hepatic cirrhosis in Romania is very high, with a 10-year mortality of&#xD;
      34-66%. Upward trend of mortality is observed. It is known that cirrhosis is associated with&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities. These can induce several complications of cirrhosis, and increase&#xD;
      postoperative mortality. Therefore, it is a major public health issue and research in this&#xD;
      field should be a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated the cardiac function in cirrhotic patients, using only conventional&#xD;
      echocardiography. However, this allows only the late diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, which&#xD;
      might be already irreversible. Consequently, description of new parameters, which could&#xD;
      detect early dysfunction, becomes essential. There is no study designed to estimate intrinsic&#xD;
      myocardial properties in cirrhosis. New methods (Tissue Doppler and Speckle-tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography) could be essential to detect early cardiac dysfunction. The exact role of&#xD;
      biological markers in the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction remains to be clarified. Impaired&#xD;
      cardiac function coupled with augmented vascular function could be the model for cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients. This type of ventriculo-arterial interaction has never been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of our project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the mechanisms which lead to cardiac dysfunction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to describe new parameters for the early diagnosis of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to describe the type of ventriculo-arterial interaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the association between biological markers and echo parameters.&#xD;

      Scientific context and motivation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis is the end stage of chronic damage to the liver. The prevalence is estimated to be&#xD;
      very high in Romania, more than 1000/100.000 inhabitants, with 10-year mortality of 34-66%.&#xD;
      Upward trends of mortality are observed in a few countries, including Romania, which had&#xD;
      extremely high mortality rates. The cost in terms of hospital costs and lost productivity is&#xD;
      high. Therefore, hepatic cirrhosis represents a major public health in Romania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that hepatic cirrhosis is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. These&#xD;
      abnormalities have been suggested to induce/aggravate several complications of cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      also to increase postoperative mortality after major surgery or liver transplantation. Few&#xD;
      studies documented the existence of a hyperdynamic circulation, with increased cardiac output&#xD;
      and reduced systemic vascular resistance. Despite this hyperkinetic circulation, some&#xD;
      patients have abnormal ventricular function unmasked by physiologic/pharmacologic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies of cardiac function in cirrhosis, although contractile function&#xD;
      disorders found in nonalcoholic cirrhosis in animal models suggested that this is independent&#xD;
      from alcohol intake. These issues are complicated by the fact that, alcohol use represents&#xD;
      one of the commonest causes of both cirrhosis and cardiomyopathy. There are reasons to&#xD;
      believe that cirrhosis per se may be associated with subtle contractile dysfunction. First,&#xD;
      hyperkinetic circulatory changes may induce a high-output cardiac failure resembling a&#xD;
      chronic volume overload of the heart. Second, cirrhosis is associated with high serum&#xD;
      catecholamine levels, and long-term exposure to elevated catecholamines results in&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Third, necropsy series of patients with alcoholic/nonalcoholic cirrhosis show&#xD;
      similar cardiac pathologic findings: diffuse fibrosis, subendocardial edema, nuclear and&#xD;
      cytoplasmic vacuolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the increased cardiac output, ventricular inotropic and chronotropic responses to&#xD;
      stimuli are blunted, a condition known as &quot;cirrhotic cardiomyopathy&quot;. These include systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic dysfunction, electrophysiological changes, and structural changes. There are no&#xD;
      clear consensus definition for this condition. Cardiac function was evaluated by classic&#xD;
      echocardiography, 2D and color/spectral Doppler: cardiac dimensions, left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF), systolic and diastolic timings. All of these changes are dependent&#xD;
      on load conditions, and cirrhosis has major variability of preload conditions. However, these&#xD;
      conventional measurements allow only the late diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, which might&#xD;
      be already irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the cardiac dysfunction is very frequently subclinical and it can appear from early&#xD;
      stages (even in chronic hepatitis). Consequently, early diagnosis of subclinical cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction are essential in the management of such patients. There is no study designed to&#xD;
      estimate intrinsic myocardial properties in cirrhosis. Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) and&#xD;
      speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) could be very useful in this field, and this is the&#xD;
      major point of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cirrhosis, different humoral substances enter directly in the systemic circulation. The&#xD;
      following factors are involved as possible mediators for cardiac dysfunction and vascular&#xD;
      changes: increased NO and CO production, endocannabinoids, TNF-Î±, IL-1, IL-6. Increased NO&#xD;
      production is the major factor involved in the peripheral arterial vasodilation in cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, impaired cardiac function coupled with augmented vascular function could be&#xD;
      the model for cirrhotic patients. This type of ventriculo-arterial interaction has never been&#xD;
      described. This could be the second important point of our research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unresolved questions: Consensus definition criteria, specific diagnostic tests, the exact&#xD;
      prevalence of this syndrome, and appropriate management strategies are all unresolved&#xD;
      questions. To date, there is no single diagnostic test that can identify cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      with cardiac dysfunction. Level of natriuretic peptide (proBNP) is elevated due to increased&#xD;
      cardiac release and not because of impaired hepatic extraction. Similarly, troponin I was&#xD;
      reported to be elevated. The exact role of these markers in the diagnosis of cirrhotic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, remains to be clarified. We intend to analyze all these markers, in order to&#xD;
      describe the existence of pro-inflammatory status, impairment of oxidative stress and&#xD;
      presence of myocardial fibrosis. The association between these markers and different&#xD;
      parameters of cardiac dysfunction will also be described in our study, for the first time.&#xD;
      The optimum management of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has not been established since there are&#xD;
      neither &quot;gold standard&quot; diagnostic criteria nor specific treatments at present. We consider&#xD;
      that our research could make progress in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives are to detect, by new echocardiographic methods, early cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction in cirrhotic patients, and to establish usefulness of different biomarkers in&#xD;
      diagnosis of this condition. This information will be coupled with data regarding endothelial&#xD;
      function, in order to describe new type of ventriculo-arterial interaction (intrinsic&#xD;
      myocardial dysfunction - augmented vascular function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to create a gold standard protocol of the early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction, by&#xD;
           using new echocardiographic methods, and therefore to identify cirrhotic patients at&#xD;
           risk for developing heart failure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the effect of alcoholic vs. nonalcoholic cirrhosis on cardiac and vascular&#xD;
           function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the chronology of the cardiac abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to define the type of ventriculo-arterial interaction in these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to analyze different mechanisms involved in cardiac dysfunction, biological markers&#xD;
           (brain natriuretic peptide, troponins, markers of inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and&#xD;
           oxidative stress);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to correlate the severity of hepatic disease (Child-Pugh score) with different&#xD;
           parameters of cardiac dysfunction and biological markers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to test implication of some genetic disorders in the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
           in our patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. to generate new research, by using stress echocardiography in cirrhotic patients in&#xD;
           order to find stress-induced subtle cardiac dysfunction, which can be absent at rest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. to create new opportunities for research in the management strategies of cirrhotic&#xD;
           patients with secondary cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. All patients and normal individuals will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General data: age, sex, IMC, blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac risk factors, clinical&#xD;
           stage of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, date of diagnosis and complications, previous&#xD;
           investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrocardiogram (12 leads) and routine blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific biomarkers: proBNP, troponin, myocardial fibrosis (Î² cross laps and procollagen&#xD;
           type-1 amino terminal), and markers of inflammation (PCR-hs, IL1, IL6, IL 10, TNFÎ±);&#xD;
           oxidative stress: carbonyl in plasmatic proteins, and the antioxidant capacity of&#xD;
           plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comprehensive Echocardiography: VIVID 9 GE echo machine, with dedicated software ECHOPAC&#xD;
           BT11:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conventional echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Structural parameters: thickness of the cardiac walls; diameters and volumes of the&#xD;
                cardiac cavities, aorta, and pulmonary artery; left ventricular (LV) mass; wall&#xD;
                stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional parameters of systolic and diastolic function: LVEF, LV shortening&#xD;
                fraction, left/right cardiac output and index, tricuspid and mitral annular&#xD;
                excursions; parameters derived from the transmitral, transtricuspid, aortic or&#xD;
                pulmonary flow, different systolic/diastolic timings and ratios (LV/RV TEI index,&#xD;
                pre-ejection/ejection ratio, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Q analysis by TDI: measurements of isovolumic accelerations, systolic and diastolic&#xD;
                myocardial velocities and derived times, strain at the level of basal and mid,&#xD;
                LV/RV myocardial segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  STE - This method offers an alternative to techniques such as TDI (angle&#xD;
                dependent!!) for myocardial deformation (measured as strain and strain rate) in&#xD;
                radial, longitudinal, and circumferential directions, in order to assess LV/RV&#xD;
                systolic and diastolic function, LV torsion, and left and right atrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3D echocardiography - precise evaluation of the cardiac chamber anatomy and volume.&#xD;
                4D analysis enables post-processing of multi-plane imaging datasets, allows&#xD;
                multidimensional imaging acquired in parasternal bi-plane and apical tri-plane&#xD;
                views, and supports 2D, color, as well as, tissue Doppler modes (including tissue&#xD;
                synchronization imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of endothelial function, parameters of arterial remodeling, and arterial&#xD;
           stiffness at the level of the common carotid artery (vascular remodeling and arterial&#xD;
           stiffness indices), and at the level of the brachial artery (endothelial function).&#xD;
           Assessment will be done using an ALOKA Î±10 ultrasound machine, equipped with an&#xD;
           &quot;echo-tracking&quot; system. Meanwhile, a dedicated new software (wave intensity analysis)&#xD;
           will be used to assess ventriculo-arterial coupling. Another system (Complior) will be&#xD;
           used in order to measure the pulse wave velocity between 2 arterial sites&#xD;
           (carotid-femoral and carotid-radial), as a measure of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of the proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators known that hepatic cirrhosis represents a major public health in Romania.&#xD;
      Because cardiac dysfunction induces/aggravates several complications of cirrhosis, it leads&#xD;
      to a significant increase in morbidity, mortality, and economical costs. Thus, by creation of&#xD;
      a gold standard protocol for detection of the early cardiac dysfunction, investigators will&#xD;
      be able to identify cirrhotic patients at risk for developing heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe that the early identification of cardiac dysfunction is a health&#xD;
      problem of major interest. New imagistic and laboratory parameters might be essential to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk and to find treatment strategies in these patients. This could&#xD;
      generate new research projects in the treatment field, which is now an untouched field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal will create knowledge in the medical field and generate important scientific&#xD;
      results, nationally and internationally competitive. It could define mechanisms of cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction induced by cirrhosis, and describe new type of arterial-ventriculo interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it might be able to introduce into clinical practice a &quot;gold standard&quot; evaluation&#xD;
      for patients at risk for developing cardiac dysfunction, consequently leading to an&#xD;
      optimization of therapy. Therefore, the results of the project could be applicative also from&#xD;
      social and economic purposes.&#xD;
