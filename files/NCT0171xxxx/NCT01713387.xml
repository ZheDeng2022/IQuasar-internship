  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery currently remains the only potentially curative treatment for biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      (BTC), and most patients develop recurrence. Therefore, effective adjuvant chemotherapy is&#xD;
      required to increase the curability of surgery and to prolong the survival in these patients.&#xD;
      However, to date, no standard adjuvant chemotherapy has been established, and a guideline for&#xD;
      BTC treatment recommends that trials of adjuvant chemotherapy be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there are two reports about gemcitabine (GEM) + S-1 combination (GS)chemotherapy&#xD;
      after surgical resection for patients with BTC. At Iwate Medical University, Takahara, et&#xD;
      al., performed a phase I study using a regimen of repeating 28 days as 1 course. Patients&#xD;
      received GEM on day 1 and day 15, and S-1 from day 1 to day 14. The recommended dose is 1,000&#xD;
      mg/m² of GEM and S-1 80 mg/m² after a pancreatoduodenectomy. The 2-year survival rate of the&#xD;
      34 patients that received the GS therapy was 78.6% (Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012&#xD;
      May;69(5):1127-33). At Hiroshima University, a cycle of chemotherapy consisted of intravenous&#xD;
      GEM of 700 mg/m² on day 1 and oral S-1 of 50 mg/m² for 7 consecutive days, followed by a&#xD;
      1-week break from chemotherapy (14days as 1 course). Fifty patients received GS therapy and&#xD;
      had a significantly better 3-year survival rate (57%) compared with 53 cases of surgery alone&#xD;
      (30%). The GS adjuvant chemotherapy was feasible and the adverse event was minimal (Ann Surg.&#xD;
      2009 Dec;250(6):950-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the regimens of these two studies were 14 or 28 days as 1 course. There was no regimen&#xD;
      that consisted of GEM on day 1, 8 and S-1 for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 1-week break&#xD;
      from chemotherapy (21days as 1 course), which is frequently used for unresectable BTC and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though a hepatectomy is frequently performed during surgery for BTC, it is unclear if the&#xD;
      effect of the anticancer agent is affected by a hepatectomy. Because GEM is metabolized by&#xD;
      cytidine deaminase primarily in the liver, the ability to metabolize GEM after a hepatectomy&#xD;
      is thought to decrease. Some clinical studies demonstrated that patients who had undergone a&#xD;
      hepatectomy could not tolerate the standard dose and schedule of GEM. For adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with GEM, it is necessary to separately examine whether or not the patient has&#xD;
      undergone a hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these present conditions, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of GEM + S-1&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy (21days as 1 course regimen, which is frequently used for&#xD;
      unresectable BTC) for BTC with the patients undergoing curative resection without a&#xD;
      hepatectomy.&#xD;
