    <textblock>
      In this study, fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI) in different dose combinations&#xD;
      (50/25mcg, 100/25mcg and 200/25mcg) will be administered from a single dry powder device to&#xD;
      evaluate the PD, PK, safety and tolerability of the combination in healthy Chinese subjects.&#xD;
      The information gathered will be used as a support of the clinical development program of the&#xD;
      fixed dose combination of FF/VI inhalation powder in Chinese population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross over, randomized,&#xD;
      single and repeat dose study. A total of 16 healthy subjects aged 18-45 years will be&#xD;
      randomised with the aim of achieving at least 10 evaluable subjects to each treatment period.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the systemic steroid PD effects (serum cortisol 24 hour&#xD;
      weighted mean on Day 7) of FF and systemic ß-adrenergic PD effects (ECG maximum QTcF 0-4h and&#xD;
      whole blood potassium 0-4h in Day 1 and Day 7) of VI; the secondary objectives are aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of FF/VI inhalation powder after a single and repeat&#xD;
      dose administration.&#xD;

        follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from&#xD;
