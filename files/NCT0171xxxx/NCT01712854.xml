    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate&#xD;
      (Symbicort Â©) affects dynamic hyperinflation in patients with obstructive disease using&#xD;
      Optoelectronic Plethysmography (OEP). This study is unique as it will be the first&#xD;
      randomized, doubleblind, crossover study with a placebo inhaler and budesonide/formoterol&#xD;
      fumarate dihydrate as the intervention which will evaluate the effects on ventilatory&#xD;
      mechanics through the use of OEP. The investigators plan to demonstrate that&#xD;
      budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate impacts dynamic hyperinflation which can be detected&#xD;
      with OEP, and that budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate may have an effect in the short&#xD;
      term on exercise capacity during a constant load exercise test. The changes in ventilatory&#xD;
      mechanics measured after budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate by OEP will provide a&#xD;
      unique evaluation of budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate in a controlled setting also&#xD;
      demonstrating the utility of OEP in evaluating of the effects of a medical treatment on&#xD;
      hyperinflation in individuals with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective/Hypothesis: Our objective is to measure baseline, post treatment and&#xD;
           post exercise spirometry and evaluate exercise dynamic hyperinflation before and after&#xD;
           treatment using OEP. The investigators hypothesize that budesonide/formoterol fumarate&#xD;
           dihydrate will decrease dynamic hyperinflation as measured by OEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Endpoint: Our primary endpoint is the change in dynamic hyperinflation,&#xD;
           specifically end expiratory volumes, dynamic lung volumes and diaphragmatic paradoxical&#xD;
           breathing as measured by OEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Secondary Objective: Our secondary objective is to evaluate duration of steady state&#xD;
           exercise and exercise capacity before and after treatment. Our secondary hypothesis is&#xD;
           that decreases in dynamic hyperinflation during exercise will lead to improvements in&#xD;
           dyspnea with exercise, and allow for increases in exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary endpoint: Exercise time, change in Borg scale at rest vs. Borg scale at steady&#xD;
           state vs. Borg at end exercise.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover interventional design.&#xD;
      The crossover allows for equality in number of subjects assigned to each treatment and for&#xD;
      subjects to be their own controls. Baseline spirometry will be taken prior to exercise test.&#xD;
      Subjects will be prepared for OEP. All exercise will take place on an electromagnetically&#xD;
      braked cycle ergometer. Throughout the protocol heart rate, blood pressure, O2 saturation,&#xD;
      ventilation, and metabolic data will be recorded. A modified exercise induced asthma protocol&#xD;
      will be used. Unlike prior studies, ventilatory kinematics (with isolated diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function) will be monitored throughout exercise using biomechanical motion analysis (OEP).&#xD;
      This OEP analysis involves compartmentalization of the chest into three sections; 1)&#xD;
      pulmonary rib cage, 2) diaphragmatic rib cage, and 3) abdomen to determine the contribution&#xD;
      of each component to total lung volume. By measuring the percent contribution of compartment,&#xD;
      we are able to better understand its impact on respiration. OEP will be able to quantify and&#xD;
      assess the distortion effects of dynamic hyperinflation and obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty moderate to severe COPD patients will be recruited. Subjects will refrain from their&#xD;
      usual inhaled medications for 24 hours prior to the testing session. All subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to verify that this is acceptable with their pulmonologist prior to participation.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to have their short acting bronchodilators and other regular&#xD;
      medications available to be taken if symptoms should occur. During the initial screening,&#xD;
      subjects will be familiarized with all procedures. Then baseline pulmonary function testing,&#xD;
      and baseline resting OEP measurements will be performed. The subjects will then be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (Symbicort) or a placebo of&#xD;
      budesonide only (Entocort EC). At that time, they will receive treatment with either placebo&#xD;
      or budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate and after 45 minutes, they will repeat spirometry&#xD;
      and OEP and submaximal exercise testing with OEP. After one week, subjects will be tested&#xD;
      again and switched to the opposite treatment (i.e. if on budesonide/formoterol fumarate&#xD;
      dihydrate initially then switch to placebo and vice versa). The one week washout period&#xD;
      between tests will include a resumption of the usual medications. The subjects will refrain&#xD;
      from their inhaled medications for 24 hours before the second testing session, but use all of&#xD;
      their other usual medications.&#xD;
