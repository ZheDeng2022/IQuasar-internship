  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years medicine has been enhanced by the incorporation of technological innovations&#xD;
      from areas as diverse as cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, biophysics and bioengineering.&#xD;
      One of the few exceptions in this rapid process of implementing technological advances occurs&#xD;
      in clinical medicine, where its penetration is much less effective than in other scientific&#xD;
      and professional fields, or even in everyday life. Attempts to tackle this problem have given&#xD;
      rise to various initiatives in the US and Europe, including Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a surprising paucity of telemedicine systems in clinical practice, especially with&#xD;
      respect to sleep-related breathing disorders, and most particularly obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA), where protocols are urgently needed to alleviate this healthcare problem represented&#xD;
      by its under-diagnosis and comorbidity, as well as the long waiting lists for treatment. In&#xD;
      others words, the growing awareness of sleep disorders, especially OSA, has not been&#xD;
      accompanied by strategic changes in the cost-effective diagnosis and/or treatment of these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP therapy compliance is not always appropriate. Helping patients during the first two&#xD;
      months usually determines compliance. Therefore, the development of strategies to support the&#xD;
      patient during the first weeks is essential. However, this &quot;collides&quot; with reality, where it&#xD;
      is difficult to properly care all patients because of congested sleep units. It is therefore&#xD;
      necessary to implement new and imaginative control schemes especially at the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment. Patients' follow-up performed by telemedicine technology is an option that aims to&#xD;
      substitute the face-to-face visits or at least reduce them considerably. In a future context,&#xD;
      the idea is that the professional in charge of CPAP patients monitoring has on his/her agenda&#xD;
      face-to-face visits and televisits (at distance) and information which patient will provide&#xD;
      through online questionnaires with a certain frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, this project aims to analyze whether CPAP treatment compliance of OSA patients&#xD;
      monitored by telemedicine techniques (website and televisits) is similar to that achieved by&#xD;
      standard monitoring but more cost-effective. The study design is a multicenter randomized&#xD;
      trial with parallel groups and blind final evaluation after CPAP treatment following two&#xD;
      different strategies: one through conventional monitoring in the hospital (face-to-face&#xD;
      visiting) and another by telemedicine monitoring (non-contact visiting and website).&#xD;
