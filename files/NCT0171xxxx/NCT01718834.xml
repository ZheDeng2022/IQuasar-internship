      Description: A randomized Placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy of Cenv3&#xD;
      peptide vaccine in normal volunteers. This study is designed to test safety of 3 consecutive&#xD;
      monthly escalating doses of the immunogen ( 0.324 mg, 0.648 and 3.240 mg / 70 kgm body&#xD;
      weight) in 40 healthy male subjects (15,15 and10 subjects respectively) plus 10 subjects on&#xD;
      placebo. Bioavailability of Cenv3 will be tested throughout the duration of the experiment.&#xD;
      In the study hyperimmune state will be achieved via 3 subcutaneous injections (0.648 mg&#xD;
      each), once every 4 weeks. A placebo treated healthy subjects ( n= 10) will serve as&#xD;
      controls. Chronic HCV patients ( n=50) who did not respond to IFN + RBV combined therapy will&#xD;
      be recruited to test therapeutic efficacy of the compound via 6 consecutive injections (&#xD;
      0.648 mg each ) every 2 weeks. ( NB : this group of patients has been already recruited in&#xD;
      the first part of this project where evaluation of the compound is currently underway).&#xD;
      Immunized healthy volunteers will be followed for a year compared with placebo group, where&#xD;
      all biochemical, hematological, immunological and allergic parameters are recorded. Treated&#xD;
      CHC patients will be evaluated for virological, hematological, biochemical and immunological&#xD;
      states at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject : Cenv3 potential prophylactic and therapeutic immunogens in healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      against chronic HCV infection respectively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the present work, we plan to study the safety and efficacy of a peptide vaccine termed&#xD;
      Cenv3 ( C for HCV, en for envelop, v for vaccine, 3 for 3 epitopes). The main outlines of the&#xD;
      current study include: 1) Examining the safety parameters throughout the vaccination period&#xD;
      including acute and chronic reactions if present in a phase 1 clinical study ( i.e. in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers). The vaccine will be administered sc at 3 escalating doses in presence&#xD;
      and absence of adjuvant. Bioavailability of the vaccine throughout the experiment duration&#xD;
      will also be determined. 2) Assessment of the humoral and cellular immune responses towards&#xD;
      Cenv3 in healthy volunteers ( higher risk for acquiring HCV infection). 3) Evaluation of the&#xD;
      neutralizing capacity of the generated Abs to interfere with intracellular replication of HCV&#xD;
      in permissive cell lines&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Objective The present proposal aims at:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examining safety and tolerability towards the candidate HCV peptide vaccine in healthy&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing cell mediated immunity via cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vaccinated&#xD;
           healthy subjects ( CMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determining epitope specific B cell response and antibody titers in vaccinated&#xD;
           individuals (humoral Immunogenicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Testing the viral neutralization by antibodies against the vaccine epitopes. (Efficacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Studying the bioavailability of the peptides in subjects' circulation throughout the&#xD;
           vaccination time and 90 days post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with any cardiovascular problems, asthma, or allergies, should be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Also, any subject who has participated in any experimental medicine clinical trial in&#xD;
      the past 3 months will be excluded. Healthy volunteers including subjects from both sexes,&#xD;
      18-55 years of age will be enrolled. All subjects had to fulfill all inclusion criteria as&#xD;
      follows: mentally and physically healthy, no clinically relevant pathological findings in any&#xD;
      of the investigations of the pre-study examination including blood chemistry ( liver and&#xD;
      kidney function tests), differential blood counts, coagulation test, ultrasensitive&#xD;
      C-reactive protein levels. Subjects should be able to provide written informed consents. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria included pregnant or breast feeding women, patients with chronic&#xD;
      viral-infections (e.g., HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, HSV), evidence of decompensated liver disease,&#xD;
      pre-existing hematuria, or proteinuria, cryoglobulin levels &gt;1% or other immunologically&#xD;
      driven diseases, schistosomiasis, acute infectious illness, severe psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
      current or past history of malignancy and patients who received treatment with interferon or&#xD;
      any investigational therapy for hepatitis during the 3 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Consent The volunteers will be provided with a written information sheet on the vaccine&#xD;
      and the requirements of this trial. They will&#xD;
&#xD;
      , in return, give written consent to participate in the study. Subjects will be paid an&#xD;
      honorarium for their participation. They will also be provided with transport money to and&#xD;
      from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Outlines of the study : In the proposed study, we aim at evaluating tolerability, safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and efficacy of Cenv3 peptide vaccine in 112 healthy volunteers as a placebo&#xD;
      controlled open labeled phase 1 clinical trial. Tolerability and safety parameters include&#xD;
      clinical signs ( acute and chronic), biochemical assays ( hepatic and renal functions as well&#xD;
      as other metabolic parameters) and hematological tests ( all blood cell parameters). Both&#xD;
      humoral and cellular responses to the immunization protocols will be evaluated. Neutralizing&#xD;
      capacities of specific Abs generated in response to the vaccine will also be determined after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) Vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of vaccine will be performed under the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice.&#xD;
      The lyophilized peptides are manufactured in an eight arm multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) in&#xD;
      a commercial facility specialized in peptide synthesis and structure modification ( .e.g&#xD;
      AnaSpec USA). Peptides will be dissolved in PBS made for human use. The whole procedure will&#xD;
      be done in sterilized areas of drug/vaccine industry ( e.g. VACSERA, MOH Wezaret Al Zera'a&#xD;
      street Agouza). The lyophilized peptides will be stored in regular fridge, while dissolved&#xD;
      peptides will be stored at -80 0 C as aliquots ( in sealed ampoules each contains 1X dose)&#xD;
      ready for injection and transported to the hospital in dry ice just before use. Note : These&#xD;
      storage and transportation precautions are followed during these early stages of the study.&#xD;
      While the strategy would be modified at a commercial scale when the current product proves&#xD;
      effective. In this later case a lyophilized powder with the recommended dose will be packaged&#xD;
      in a sealed ampoules and dissolved just before use. HCV peptide vaccine Cenv3 will be&#xD;
      injected subcutaneously in 3 different doses ( 1x i.e. 324 ug , 2x i.e. 648 ug or 3x 1296 ug/&#xD;
      70 kgm body weight adult). It should be noted here, that dose 1X equals to the calculated&#xD;
      pharmaceutical dose from mice experiments, therefore 324 ug/ 70 kg body weight is the Minimum&#xD;
      Available Biologically Effective dose Level (MABEL). Based on other laboratories experience&#xD;
      with peptide vaccine administration to man ( Tanaka and Manns) who used up to 5000 ug of&#xD;
      peptide vaccine for their immunization experiments. The highest dose used in our protocol is&#xD;
      4X ( 1296 ug/ 70 kg bw) and therefore considered the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (&#xD;
      NOAEL) in this protocol. The vaccine will be administered either as a MAP form ( self&#xD;
      adjuvanted) or supplemented with adjuvant ( MF59) in a common protocol of monthly injection&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii) Sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      All immunization and sampling procedures will be performed in Ahmed Maher Educational&#xD;
      Hospital ( MOH). Subject enrollment, consenting, vaccination, sampling and clinical&#xD;
      observation post vaccination will be done under close medical supervision by trained&#xD;
      clinicians in the hospital. Seven blood samples will be taken from subjects prior to the&#xD;
      first immunization and at days 30, 60, 90 ( during vaccination period) and days 135, 180 and&#xD;
      360 thereafter. At day 360 subjects will be immunized with a booster dose equal to the&#xD;
      original dose given to the same subject and an 8th blood sample will be collected 30 days&#xD;
      after the booster dose. Each time 15 ml venous blood will be withdrawn. Eight ml will be used&#xD;
      for serum separation for humoral response determination, neutralization assays and&#xD;
      biochemical testing. Seven ml on EDTA for CBC and lymphocyte separation for EliSpot assay.&#xD;
