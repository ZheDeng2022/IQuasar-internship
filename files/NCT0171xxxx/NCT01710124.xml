  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity among older adults has reached an all-time high,&#xD;
      which puts this age group at high risk for associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Confronted with declining incomes and&#xD;
      economic uncertainty, many middle-aged and older Americans tried to save on their food&#xD;
      purchases during the 2007-2009 recession. Grocery coupons, available through newspapers,&#xD;
      mail, and increasingly online, are one of several promotional tools that supermarkets and&#xD;
      warehouse clubs use to promote sales. It is estimated that nationally 27% of households are&#xD;
      frequent grocery coupon users who shop at a variety of retailers. Despite the increasing&#xD;
      popularity of grocery coupons, little is known about the extent to which they may promote&#xD;
      obesogenic home food environments and eating behaviors. Many coupons advertise the purchase&#xD;
      of large quantities of prepackaged and processed foods and often reward shoppers by adding&#xD;
      'free' products if they purchase certain quantities. Availability and easy accessibility of&#xD;
      large portions of energy dense foods in the home has been shown to promote increased intake.&#xD;
      The proposed study seeks to examine the effects of frequent grocery coupon usage on dietary&#xD;
      intake, weight status, and home food availability among middle-aged and older adults. A&#xD;
      second aim of this study is to test, in a randomized-controlled trial, the effects of&#xD;
      incentivizing grocery coupon use for the purchase of healthy foods on 3-month changes in&#xD;
      dietary intake, body mass index/waist circumference, home food availability, and grocery&#xD;
      coupon use among frequent coupon users and non-coupon users.&#xD;
