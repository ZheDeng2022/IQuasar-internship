  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide after stem cell&#xD;
      transplant work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Ixazomib citrate&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving ixazomib citrate together with lenalidomide may be&#xD;
      effective in treating multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish safety and efficacy of oral ixazomib citrate (MLN 9708) and lenalidomide in the&#xD;
      maintenance setting post autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Incidence of secondary primary malignancy. II. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent&#xD;
      complete response [sCR]/near complete response [nCR]/very good partial response&#xD;
      [VGPR]/partial response [PR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate time to progression. IV. Evaluate time to next therapy. V. Evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and toxicity. VI. Evaluate M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-myeloma&#xD;
      symptom evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 60-180 days post-transplant, patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
