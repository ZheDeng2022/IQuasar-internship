  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatitis is one of the major complications of ERCP. It has been shown that NSAIDs are&#xD;
      potent inhibitors of phospholipase A2, activity which is increased in pancreatitis. The only&#xD;
      one study with IM diclofenac showed reduction of post-ERCP pancreatitis without SOD&#xD;
      (sphincter of Oddi dysfunction) by subgroup analysis in small study population. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators must need large scaled randomized control study including of SOD.&#xD;

      The study described in this report will be approved by the ethics committee of Yonsei&#xD;
      University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. Between July 2012 and February 2013, 380&#xD;
      patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 380 of whom were included in the final analysis.&#xD;
      Consecutive patients were recruited for the study who presented to the Yonsei University&#xD;
      Medical Center with variable symptom or cause for ERCP older than 20years. Patients were&#xD;
      excluded from study participation if they had a contraindication for diclofenac, including&#xD;
      patients with recently diagnosed peptic ulcer disease or active/recent gastrointestinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage within 4 weeks, renal failure(Cr &gt; 1.4), those who had taken an NSAID during the&#xD;
      preceding week(ASA 325 mg daily or less acceptable), those who developed acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      during the 2 weeks before ERCP, those with a history of chronic calcific pancreatitis or&#xD;
      allergy to aspirin or NSAID, and those who did not agree to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Additionally, if state of patients was intrauterine pregnancy or breast feeding mother, they&#xD;
      were excluded. Entry to the study was restricted to patients advised to have endoscopic&#xD;
      retrograde cholangiography with or without pancreatography for extrahepatic cholestasis&#xD;
      and/or impaired liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients received 90 mg IM diclofenac available in our hospital immediately after ERCP at&#xD;
      recovery room. Patients were observed in the recovery room for at least 90 minutes after the&#xD;
      procedure. Patients in whom abdominal pain developed during this observation period were&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital (or for current inpatients, kept in the hospital). Decisions&#xD;
      regarding evaluation of complications after the procedure and in-hospital care were left to&#xD;
      the discretion of the endoscopist and clinical-service staff members, who were unaware of&#xD;
      study-group assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were discharged after an uneventful ERCP were contacted by telephone within 5&#xD;
      days to capture delayed occurrence of the primary end point. Patient demographics, risk&#xD;
      factors, ERCP procedural elements, and follow-up data were recorded on standardized&#xD;
      data-collection forms by an investigator or coordinator who was unaware of study-group&#xD;
      assignments. The intramuscular route was selected on the basis of available small sized data&#xD;
      suggesting that intramuscular NSAIDs are effective in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis,&#xD;
      perhaps owing to more rapid and complete bioavailability than with oral administration. (1)&#xD;
      At the end of each procedure, the researchers recorded the details of the maneuvers&#xD;
      performed, including the total time of the procedure, the number of attempts at cannulation,&#xD;
      the number of pancreatic duct cannulations, the final diagnosis, and whether a&#xD;
      sphincterotomy, a needle-knife papillotomy, or stent placement were performed. We did not use&#xD;
      pancreatic duct stenting for prevention of pancreatitis. Patients were sedated with IV&#xD;
      midazolam and IV continuous infusion of propofol under monitoring by anesthesiologist during&#xD;
      whole time of procedure. Xylocaine spray was used as a local anesthetic. Serum amylase was&#xD;
      determined 4 hours after ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the 4-hours serum amylase level was &lt; 3 times the upper normal limit and there was no&#xD;
      clinical evidence of acute pancreatitis at that time, patients were allowed free oral fluids&#xD;
      and a diet. If the 4- hours serum amylase level was &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit and the&#xD;
      patient exhibited pain or nausea and vomiting, then the patient was kept fasting and IV&#xD;
      crystalloid fluids with opiate analgesics were prescribed. The following 24 hours blood tests&#xD;
      were repeated for serum amylase and the patients were interviewed and examined for clinical&#xD;
      evidence of acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pancreatitis was defined as serum amylase at least three times the upper limit of&#xD;
      normal range 24hours after the procedure associated with new or increased upper abdomen or&#xD;
      epigastric pain, back pain, and epigastric tenderness and hospitalization or prolongation of&#xD;
      existing hospitalization for at least 2 nights. Patients with persistent signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of pancreatitis after 48 hours underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatitis was graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The severity was determined according&#xD;
      to consensus guidelines, with mild post-ERCP pancreatitis resulting in a hospitalization of&#xD;
      â‰¤3 days, moderate post-ERCP pancreatitis resulting in a hospitalization of 4-10 days, and&#xD;
      severe post-ERCP pancreatitis resulting in a hospitalization of &gt; 10 days, or leading to the&#xD;
      development of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst, or requiring percutaneous or surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) was defined according following Classification. Biliary&#xD;
      type I SOD was defined as biliary-type abdominal pain, liver enzyme elevation, and common&#xD;
      bile duct dilation &gt; 9mm. Biliary type II SOD was defined as biliary-type abdominal pain and&#xD;
      either abnormal liver enzymes or a dilated bile duct. Biliary type III SOD was defined as&#xD;
      biliary-type pain without any other objective findings. Pancreatic type I SOD was defined as&#xD;
      pancreatic-type pain and a dilated pancreatic duct and elevated pancreatic enzymes, or&#xD;
      recurrent acute pancreatitis. Type II pancreatic SOD was defined as pancreatic-type pain and&#xD;
      a dilated pancreatic duct or elevated pancreatic enzymes. Type III pancreatic SOD was defined&#xD;
      as pancreatic-type pain alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruments used were cannula, sphincterotome, guidewire, and stone basket (Olympus,&#xD;
      Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were defined as reported previously. Any cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis,&#xD;
      other complications of the procedure, and adverse events that were potentially attributable&#xD;
      to the study drug were reported to the local institutional review board and the data and&#xD;
      safety monitoring board. These reportable adverse events were gastrointestinal bleeding,&#xD;
      perforation, infection, renal failure, allergic reaction, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident, and death.&#xD;
