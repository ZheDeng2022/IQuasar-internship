      Background: Falls are the leading cause of injury among older adults in Singapore, but falls&#xD;
      among the elderly can be preventable and the risks are predictable. Translating this&#xD;
      understanding of falls etiology into an integrated clinical and public health program that is&#xD;
      accessible to the elderly is a critical health services delivery challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An evidence-based program of screening, risk modification and physical therapy&#xD;
      delivered in a community setting will reduce recurrent falls incidence among a high-risk&#xD;
      group of elderly recently discharged to the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This randomized controlled trial targets patients seen at Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED) for a fall or fall-related injuries who are at least 65 years old and will be discharged&#xD;
      to home. Upon signing the informed consent form, the participants will be followed up for&#xD;
      nine months from the baseline assessment during which the participants are randomized into&#xD;
      either a control or the intervention group. The participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      be provided with a multifactorial program of screening, risk modification and physical&#xD;
      therapy focused on progressive strength, balance, and gait training either as an&#xD;
      individualized program or a group setting in the community for the first three months from&#xD;
      the date of randomization. The number of recurrent falls will be monitored via a falls&#xD;
      prevention diary maintained by (or for) each participant.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a multifactorial,&#xD;
      community-based falls prevention program of screening, risk modification, and progressive&#xD;
      physical therapy that targets vulnerable elderly Singaporeans at high-risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-year, multi-center, two-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      divided into three phases: (1) pre-study, (2) intervention, and (3) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-study phase, overseas experts will train local physiotherapists and community&#xD;
      health workers on how to administer and deliver the falls prevention program. Engaging&#xD;
      hospital-based physiotherapists to deliver the home-based assessments and exercise programs&#xD;
      will maximize the likelihood of long-term sustainability of the intervention program. In&#xD;
      addition, manuals will be developed for physiotherapists to guide the evaluation risk factor&#xD;
      assessments, home environment assessments, appropriate referrals to different health care&#xD;
      providers, and selection of exercise programs that will be progressive, challenging and of&#xD;
      optimal intensity and durations. Manuals for risk factor assessments will be shared with the&#xD;
      blinded assessors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention phase will be divided into two phases: a three-month &quot;Active Intervention&#xD;
      Phase&quot; and a six-month &quot;Maintenance Phase.&quot; In the beginning of the active intervention&#xD;
      phase, the participants in the intervention group will receive a detailed falls risk&#xD;
      assessment at the baseline assessment by a physiotherapist. The risk factors that will be&#xD;
      assessed are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Poor vision: Referral to ophthalmologist for correction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Polypharmacy: Referral to AIC for management of medications if use of five or more&#xD;
           medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Environmental Hazards: Caregiver education and suitable recommendations according to the&#xD;
           CDC guidelines to modify risk such as removal of rugs, change to safer footwear, use of&#xD;
           non-slip bath mats, additional lighting at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Deficiencies in gait, balance or mobility: Physiotherapist-supervised program of gait&#xD;
           training, balance and strengthening exercises In the analysis phase, the collected data&#xD;
           will be analyzed. The primary outcome measure of the study is the number of fallers over&#xD;
           the entire study period. The number of falls will be captured by a falls prevention&#xD;
           diary maintained by (or for) each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly seen at ED for a fall or fall-related injury will be screened for participation&#xD;
      of the study. Once the consent is taken, all study participants will be given an assessment&#xD;
      by a physiotherapist at baseline which assesses sociodemographic characteristics, functional&#xD;
      status measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), two-minute walk test,&#xD;
      history of falls, cognitive impairment measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),&#xD;
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS), health care utilization, and medical history&#xD;
      (polypharmacy, orthostatic vital signs, and self-reporting eyesight and hearing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of baseline assessment, the participants will be assigned either a control or the&#xD;
      intervention group. Before the start of the exercise sessions, the participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will. Need to complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)&#xD;
      and a medical evaluation by a physician to ensure that the participants are fit for physical&#xD;
      activity. Based on the SPPB score at baseline assessment, participants will be categorized as&#xD;
      either high-risk (SPPB&lt;6) or low-to-moderate-risk (SPPB&gt;6) for falls. High-risk patients will&#xD;
      be given an individualized PT-supervised program of physical therapy that specifically&#xD;
      targets impairments that interfere with engaging in exercise in group setting. The goal of&#xD;
      the tailored physical therapy sessions is to modify impairments and transition these patients&#xD;
      to an evidence-based exercise program. Low-to-moderate-risk patients will be directly&#xD;
      enrolled into an evidence-based group exercise program. The group exercise programs will be&#xD;
      offered as one-hour sessions, twice weekly over the intervention period. At the end of the&#xD;
      active intervention phase, these participants will transition to a maintenance phase in which&#xD;
      they will be encouraged to continue with the exercise on their own and will also be referred&#xD;
      to the Health Promotion Board's STEP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked at the end of the active intervention phase (three months from&#xD;
      the date of randomization) and at the end of the study period (nine months from the date of&#xD;
      randomization) about their functional status, history of falls, cognitive impairment, quality&#xD;
      of life, health care utilization, and medical history by the blinded assessors. Recurrent&#xD;
      falls incidence will be monitored by participants' self-reporting monthly falls diary as well&#xD;
      as monthly phone calls conducted by the study coordinator during the entire study period.&#xD;
