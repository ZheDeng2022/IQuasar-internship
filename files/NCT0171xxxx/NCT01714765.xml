  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When kidney cancer spreads beyond the kidney, it is known as metastatic kidney cancer. This&#xD;
      is very difficult to treat and almost all patients will die of their disease within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib has become standard therapy for untreated patients with metastatic clear cell renal&#xD;
      (kidney) cancer. It targets a growth factor known as VEGF which is important in treating&#xD;
      renal cancer. Although the results with this drug are impressive, patients develop resistance&#xD;
      to the drug, relapse and die of renal cancer. It is currently standard practice is to treat&#xD;
      patients with everolimus when resistance to sunitinib occurs; this is associated with clear&#xD;
      clinical benefit. However the median time to progression with everolimus is 4.9 months in&#xD;
      previously treated patients, therefore further improvement in treating patients is required.&#xD;
      The optimal way of achieving this is to increase the efficacy of everolimus by adding agents&#xD;
      which directly target the cause of resistance to sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dovitinib is a promising new drug in renal cancer. Dovitinib blocks cellular functions such&#xD;
      as activation of downstream signalling molecules, cell proliferation and survival. Combining&#xD;
      dovitinib and everolimus is very attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is aimed to establish the maximum tolerated dose for the combination of dovitinib&#xD;
      and everolimus in clear call renal cancer, which can then be taken into a randomised phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 30 patients will be recruited into this multi centre national trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has established the MAD and the MTD. The MTD was Cohort 0 (Everolimus 5mg and&#xD;
      Dovitinib 200mg). 6 patients were recruited in this cohort with only 1 patient experiencing a&#xD;
      DLT. A further 3 patients were recruited into Cohort 1 (Everolimus 5mg and Dovitinib 300mg),&#xD;
      where 2 patients experienced a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 7 assessable patients will be recruited during the expansion phase at the MTD&#xD;
      (Cohort 0: Everolimus 5mg and Dovitinib 200mg) to further define the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      efficacy, PK and biological end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessable patients for the expansion cohort are defined as being on the study for a minimum&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Any patients enrolled who are not assessable will be replaced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell cancer, also referred to as kidney cancer, is diagnosed in approximately 170,000&#xD;
      people worldwide annually, resulting in 82,000 deaths. Treatment for metastatic kidney cancer&#xD;
      is difficult. Almost all of the patients die from their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006 a new drug called sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, transformed treatment&#xD;
      options. It targets the development of new blood vessels within the cancer. Although the&#xD;
      results with this drug are impressive, patients develop resistance a median after 11 months&#xD;
      to the drug, relapse and die of renal cancer. It is currently standard practice to switch to&#xD;
      everolimus when resistance to sunitinib occurs; this is associated with clear clinical&#xD;
      benefit. However the median time to progression with everolimus is 4 months in previously&#xD;
      treated patients, therefore further improvement in treating patients is required. The optimal&#xD;
      way of achieving this is to increase the efficacy of everolimus by adding agents which&#xD;
      directly target the cause of resistance to sunitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      dovitnib is a promising new drug the pharmacology data from a variety of in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      studies with dovitnib provided preclinical rationale for clinical evaluation of dovitinib in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of everolimus with dovitnib will target 3 major protagonists associated with&#xD;
      tumour growth The main risks and burdens to the patients participating in the study are the&#xD;
      potential for side effects of the trial medicines, these two drugs have not been used in&#xD;
      combination together and although there is safety data on each drug, there is no known safety&#xD;
      data on the drugs when used in combination. The first cohort of patients will receive 200mg&#xD;
      of dovitnib and 5mg of everolimus. In previous studies these drugs have been administered&#xD;
      separately and at higher doses. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dovitnib for the 5-day&#xD;
      on/ 2-day off dosing schedule has been defined as 500mg/day in a previous Phase I studies. In&#xD;
      the RECORD-1 study (a Phase III double blind randomised trial investigating everolimus) a&#xD;
      dose of 10mg was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of three patients will be treated in each dose level. A minimum of 14 days will&#xD;
      elapse between the first patient being treated in each cohort and entering the next patient.&#xD;
      Further patients may be entered concurrently. Toxicity will be assessed according to NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE v4.0; if no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs dose escalation will be undertaken for&#xD;
      the next cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of DLT in 1out of the 3 patients the cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6&#xD;
      patients. If more than or equal to 2 out of 6 patients experience DLT dose escalation will be&#xD;
      halted and the maximum administered dose (MAD) has been reached. If less than or equal to 1&#xD;
      out of 6 patients had DLT dose escalation may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may not personally benefit from being in this study. However the information we gain&#xD;
      from this study might help to treat future patients who have metastatic kidney cancer.&#xD;
