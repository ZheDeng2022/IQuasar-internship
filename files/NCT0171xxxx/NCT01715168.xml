  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research question(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Is the study drug equivalent to the approved drug, Doxil/Caelyx, and does it act the same&#xD;
      way in the body as the approved drug?&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATI-0918 is believed to be a generic of Doxil/Caelyx and this is what the study is trying to&#xD;
      prove. All people who participate in this study will receive the research study medication&#xD;
      (ATI-0918) and Doxil/Caelyx in addition to best supportive care (treatment for symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug being tested in this study works the same as the FDA (government) approved&#xD;
      drug doxorubicin HCl. ATI-0918 is a generic (the same) formulation of doxorubicin HCl being&#xD;
      delivered (given to the patient).&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic equivalence of ATI-0918 and DOXIL/CAELYX as a single dose in patients with ovarian cancer. The outcome measure will be determined by analyzing PK data from drawn from each patient at pre-specified time points and calculating Area under the curve (AUC) and Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)to determine % variability between ATI0918 and Doxil/Caelyx within each patient.</description>
