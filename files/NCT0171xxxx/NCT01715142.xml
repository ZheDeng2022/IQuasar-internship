  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease with conventional&#xD;
      treatments having little impact on disease course. Novel approaches are urgently needed to&#xD;
      address inherent resistance to the current therapies and to identify new drugs or&#xD;
      combinations that will have a high chance of success in pancreatic cancer patients. This&#xD;
      proof-of-concept trial is studying the &quot;dynamic&quot; tumor response after the administration of a&#xD;
      short course of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) (a) during a window interval (4&#xD;
      weeks= 1 cycle) before surgery in resectable pancreatic cancer (cohort 1 = 21 patients) and&#xD;
      (b) during at least 8 weeks (2 cycles) in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (cohort 2 = 10 patients).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a hypoperfused tumor, characterized by a high stroma density precluding&#xD;
      cytotoxics delivery to the epithelial tumoral compartment. There is thus a rationale for&#xD;
      combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), a solvent&#xD;
      (CremophorÂ® EL)-free, albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that has been initially developed to&#xD;
      reduce the toxicities associated with Taxol injection while maintaining or improving its&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic effect. This unique protein formulation provides a novel approach of&#xD;
      increasing intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process&#xD;
      allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane has been approved for commercialization in 38 countries, including the US, Canada,&#xD;
      the EU, Australia, China, India and Korea for the treatment of women with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer. Abraxane alone and in combination is being evaluated in a number of cancers,&#xD;
      including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and other solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

    <description>In order to detect changes in the tumor microenvironment and to monitor treatment efficacy, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) and Diffusion Weighted-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) constitute tools more and more used. The acquired data can be analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model to obtain quantitative parameters relative to tissue perfusion and vascular permeability (Ktrans, a volume transfer constant of contrast agent between blood plasma and the extravascular extracellular space; Apparent Coefficient Diffusion as a surrogate marker of tissue cellularity). DCE/DW-MRI will be achieved before each chemotherapy treatment (and also before surgery for resectable patients). Each patient will be his/her own control by comparing serial imaging results with those of the baseline MRI.</description>
