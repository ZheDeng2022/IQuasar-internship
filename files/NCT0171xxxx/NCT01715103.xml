      Current knowledge on mucosa, especially genitals in women, however, remain inadequate,&#xD;
      especially regarding defense mechanisms and possibilities for a vaccine to induce an active&#xD;
      immune response at mucosal front door of the most pathogens. Induction of mucosal immune&#xD;
      response has emerged as a research priority research prophylactic vaccine.The development of&#xD;
      strategies to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1 depends in part on an understanding of&#xD;
      specific and innate immune mechanisms involved in this transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MUCOVAC is a feasibility study of the immunological and transcriptomic analysis of&#xD;
      cervicovaginal samples of women infected or not infected with HIV-1. We also assess tolerance&#xD;
      samples taken by cytobrush and cervicovaginal washings, efficiency and reproducibility of the&#xD;
      sample by cytobrush and cervicovaginal lavage for transcriptomic analysis, measurement of&#xD;
      cytokines by Luminex technology, quantification of IgG and IgA. In blood we will determine&#xD;
      the phenotype of B cells and Tfh cell frequency (T follicular helper) and quantification of&#xD;
      serum immunoglobulins and will perform a transcriptomic analysis of blood cells. Finally we&#xD;
      will make correlations with the observed responses at the genital mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pathophysiological exploratory study will be performed in 20 women infected with HIV-1&#xD;
      and 20 healthy women recruited from two centers in France and will include a screening visit&#xD;
      and two visits M0 and M1 during which mucous and blood samples will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will capitalize skills in biology mucosa, using powerful tools to&#xD;
      assess mucosal immunological parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty-five percent of new cases of HIV infection involve the South and the mode of&#xD;
      transmission is predominantly heterosexual. In northern countries, sexual transmission is&#xD;
      also majority. These epidemiological considerations clearly indicate that HIV is mainly&#xD;
      transmitted mucosally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical observations show that some people are &quot;resistant&quot; to HIV, ie they do not become&#xD;
      infected despite repeated sexual exposure to the virus. The &quot;resistance&quot; to HIV exposed but&#xD;
      uninfected partners may be due to the absence of infection of target cells in the mucosa of&#xD;
      the host, or to elimination of HIV or of infected cell during effective infection. Biological&#xD;
      factors that govern individual resistance to HIV remain poorly understood. An immune response&#xD;
      directed against cervicovaginal HIV antigens, including viral envelope glycoproteins has been&#xD;
      described in a small number of HIV-negative women sexually exposed to the virus and resistant&#xD;
      to infection. These observations demonstrate that there is a compartmentalization of the&#xD;
      mucosal immune response of women, which can be induced against HIV antigens independently of&#xD;
      systemic humoral immunity. In addition, a cytotoxic cervicovaginal immunity against HIV has&#xD;
      been shown in some women, suggesting that viral antigens are presented to the immune system&#xD;
      in a HLA-I, and therefore that HIV antigens were able to cross the mucosal barrier. A second&#xD;
      hypothesis, which does not exclude the first, is that an immune response can be induced by&#xD;
      repeated deposition of viral antigens on the cervicovaginal mucosa. It has been shown in HEPS&#xD;
      women (Highly sexually exposed to HIV-1 persistently IgG seronegative purpose) the existence&#xD;
      of IgA antibodies directed against gp41 can inhibit both the transcytosis of the virus&#xD;
      through a monolayer epithelial cells and to neutralize the infection of CD4 T cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble factors also play an important role in mucosal transmission of HIV. Indeed,&#xD;
      lymphokines RANTES, MIP-1a and MIP-1b, SDF-1 natural ligands of HIV co-receptors are found in&#xD;
      varying concentrations in vaginal secretions. More recently, it has been shown that the&#xD;
      CCL20/MIP3alpha, which is produced by epithelial cells genital HIV could interact with X4-and&#xD;
      R5-tropic to inhibit infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common techniques used to study the immunological and microbiological factors of&#xD;
      female genital tract are cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and swabbing the cervix. As part of a&#xD;
      comprehensive approach to different aspects of mucosal immunity, it is necessary to use&#xD;
      techniques for the acquisition of a large number of information while using small amounts of&#xD;
      samples. Thus, techniques such as transcriptomic analysis on microarrays, which can tell us&#xD;
      about changes in thousands of genes, and the use of techniques for multiplex quantification&#xD;
      of soluble factors (cytokines and soluble factors of immunity innate mucosal) must be&#xD;
      adapted, tested and validated before the start of a vaccine trial so that the samples needed&#xD;
      for immunological assessment be exploited optimally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first phase I trial (ANRS VAC14) evaluating the safety and immunogenicity in mucosal and&#xD;
      systemic recombinant gp160 protein oligomeric administered nasally or vaginally with or&#xD;
      without adjuvant (DC-Chol), was performed in women seronegative for HIV. The goal was to&#xD;
      induce secretory IgA (SIgA) level specific genital mucosa. In this study, the storage&#xD;
      conditions of the supernatants of cervicovaginal secretions and cells were not optimal for a&#xD;
      study of the transcriptome. However, on a few samples we have shown the feasibility of&#xD;
      transcriptomic analysis using Illumina technology. We were able on these samples to determine&#xD;
      the profiles of mRNA expression and cytokine profiles. These preliminary results led us to&#xD;
      propose for the new study, to preserve RNA, cell pellets treated with buffer RLT+ Qiagen&#xD;
      before freezing at -80 °C. In addition, protease inhibitors are added directly into the&#xD;
      washing liquid to preserve cervicovaginal immunoglobulins and cytokines degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose here a feasibility study of the immunological and transcriptomic analysis of&#xD;
      cervicovaginal samples of women infected or not infected with HIV-1. Secondarily we assess&#xD;
      tolerance samples taken by cytobrush and cervicovaginal washings, efficiency and&#xD;
      reproducibility of the sample by cytobrush and cervicovaginal lavage for transcriptomic&#xD;
      analysis, measurement of cytokines by Luminex technology, quantification of IgG and IgA. In&#xD;
      blood we will determine the phenotype of B cells and Tfh cell frequency (T follicular helper)&#xD;
      and quantification of serum immunoglobulins and will perform a transcriptomic analysis of&#xD;
      blood cells. Finally we will make correlations with the observed responses at the genital&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pathophysiological exploratory study will be performed in 20 women infected with HIV-1&#xD;
      and 20 healthy women recruited from two centers in France and will include a screening visit&#xD;
      and two visits M0 and M1 during which mucous and blood samples will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will capitalize skills in biology mucosa, using powerful tools to&#xD;
      assess mucosal immunological parameters. These standardized tools can be used both for the&#xD;
      evaluation of mucosal immune response induced by prototype vaccines, and cohort studies to&#xD;
      search for correlates of protection. These tools can also be used in the evaluation of the&#xD;
      local tolerance to the application of molecules with microbicides.&#xD;
