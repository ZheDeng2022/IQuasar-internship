      Rationale: Plant stanols are well known for their effects on lowering intestinal cholesterol&#xD;
      absorption ultimately resulting in 10-15% reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations in&#xD;
      humans. In addition we have also shown that serum triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations may be&#xD;
      lowered in subjects with elevated baseline concentrations. Till now, there is little evidence&#xD;
      for plant stanol effects other than improving lipid profiles. However, we have very recently&#xD;
      found strong indications in ex vivo models using isolated human peripheral mononuclear blood&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers that plant stanols have the capacity to improve immune&#xD;
      function. More into detail, plant stanols shifted the differentiation of naive T-cells into&#xD;
      the Th1 direction by activating a specific receptor present on the Antigen presenting cells&#xD;
      (APCs) and T-cells. This effect might ultimately be helpful in situations in which the&#xD;
      Th1/Th2 cell balance is disturbed into a Th2 over-responsiveness. By activating the Th1&#xD;
      response, the disturbed balance may be restored. This is for example a possibility in the&#xD;
      treatment or prevention of asthma, food allergies or HIV in susceptible subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, very recently (MEC 08-3-051) in a pilot study we also showed these ex vivo Th1&#xD;
      stimulating effects of plant stanols specifically in PBMCs isolated from asthma patients, as&#xD;
      said, a condition characterized by a Th2 dominant immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The major research objective is to prove that the consumption of plant stanol&#xD;
      ester enriched yogurts can improve immune function in vivo in asthma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled human intervention study in which&#xD;
      90 patients with clinically proven asthma will participate: 45 in the intervention group&#xD;
      receiving plant stanol yoghurt and 45 in the control group receiving a control yoghurt&#xD;
      without added plant stanols. At the end of the run-in period as well as at the end of the&#xD;
      experimental period blood will be sampled to isolate PBMCs. These cells are used to evaluate&#xD;
      effects on cytokine production, phagocytic capacity of neutrophils, and the activity of NK&#xD;
      cells. In addition, the golden standard to show improvements in immune function is by showing&#xD;
      an elevated Immunoglobulin response to a vaccine. Therefore, during the experimental period&#xD;
      all subjects receive a vaccination against Hepatitis A Virus. After 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks&#xD;
      blood will be sampled to monitor specific immunoglobulin titers to HAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 90 people with clinically proven asthma, who are not carrier of hepatitis&#xD;
      A, B or C and have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A in the past. Also, these&#xD;
      participants do not have any other immune-related pathology Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
      primary: Specific anti-HAV antibody titers after vaccination; secondary: Phagocytic capacity&#xD;
      of neutrophils; NK-cell activity; Th1 and Th2 cytokine production profiles by PHA stimulated&#xD;
      PMBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: During the study, 9 blood samples (each 20 or 50 mL) will be taken. Total time&#xD;
      investment for the subjects will be 160 min. Occasionally, a heamatoma or bruise can occur&#xD;
      during venipuncture. After the vaccination a heamatoma or a sore arm can occur. These side&#xD;
      effects should disappear within 4-5 days. Other common side effects related to the&#xD;
      vaccination are headache, loss of appetite, and fatigue, which usually will disappear within&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will show whether consumption of plant stanol enriched yogurts is&#xD;
      able to restore the disturbed th1/Th2 balance in asthma patients. Ultimately, this is&#xD;
      expected to reduce asthmatic exacerbations, as the Th2 dominant immune response seems causal&#xD;
      to asthmatic symptoms, however these clinical improvements are not verified in this&#xD;
      relatively short term intervention study.&#xD;
