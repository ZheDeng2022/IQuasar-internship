      Many methods have been used to reduce bleeding during sinus surgery (FESS) in order to allow&#xD;
      for the best surgical view and to reduce risk while in surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warm irrigation fluid is believed to accelerate the clotting mechanism in the human body. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to determine if hot saline irrigation (HSI) compared to room&#xD;
      temperature saline irrigation (RTSI) can control bleeding during FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that HSI is more effective than RTSI in reducing intraoperative bleeding&#xD;
      during FESS.&#xD;

      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive surgery to relieve&#xD;
      obstruction and to facilitate drainage and ventilation of the paranasal sinuses. It is a&#xD;
      common rhinologic procedure that is safe, comfortable and allows quick patient recovery. As&#xD;
      the paranasal sinuses have complex anatomy and are surrounded by important structures, there&#xD;
      are risks of serious orbital and intracranial injuries. These risks are increased if&#xD;
      visualization during surgery is impaired with bleeding. The endoscopically magnified&#xD;
      operative field in sinus surgery makes even a small amount of bleeding a potentially&#xD;
      significant hindrance. Hence, numerous methods to reduce intraoperative bleeding during FESS&#xD;
      have been described. These include the use of preoperative nasal decongestion (such as&#xD;
      topical oxymetazoline, cocaine and adrenaline), preoperative oral tranexamic acid,&#xD;
      intraoperative injection of the lateral nasal wall with lidocaine and adrenaline and&#xD;
      intraoperative controlled hypotension (using total intravenous anaesthesia and B-blockers) as&#xD;
      well as the head up position during surgery. The success rates of these methods have been&#xD;
      variable and some of these techniques are associated with adverse cardiopulmonary events.1-7&#xD;
      Visual compromise secondary to bleeding remains a problem during FESS and the ideal method to&#xD;
      reduce intraoperative bleeding remains elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hot water irrigation (HWI) was first used by obstetricians in controlling postpartum bleeding&#xD;
      over a hundred years ago.8 Its use in the control of intractable epistaxis was first&#xD;
      described by Guice in 1878.9 In a histological study of nasal mucosa of rabbits irrigated&#xD;
      with hot water, Stangerup and Thomsen found that temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      produces vasodilation and edema of the nasal mucosa without necrosis. They postulated that&#xD;
      mucosal edema leads to compression of the bleeding vessels and may trigger and accelerate the&#xD;
      clotting cascade.10 Stangerup et al found that in their series of 122 patients, posterior&#xD;
      epistaxis was controlled in 55% of patients treated with HWI compared to 44% in the group&#xD;
      treated with nasal packing.11 Novoa and Schlegel-Wagner subsequently showed that 82% of&#xD;
      patients with intractable posterior epistaxis can be arrested with HWI.12 HWI has also led to&#xD;
      reduced hospital stay, reduced number of surgical procedures, less pain and less nasal&#xD;
      trauma. As continuous exposure of the nasal mucosa to pure water for 30 minutes has been&#xD;
      shown by an in-vitro study to cause severe damage to the epithelial cells, we have decided to&#xD;
      use hot normal saline in our study.13 Although hot saline irrigation (HSI) has been used in&#xD;
      FESS and endoscopic skull base surgery, there are currently no reports in the English&#xD;
      literature on its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of hot saline irrigation (HSI) compared to room temperature&#xD;
      saline irrigation (RTSI) in the control of intraoperative bleeding during FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSI is more effective than RTSI in reducing intraoperative bleeding during FESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are recruited from the St. Paul's Sinus Centre at St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver,&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 60 patients (30 patients in each arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data is collected preoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's demographics (age, sex, race)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative Lund and Mackay Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of polyps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blind randomized control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are treated with a one-week course of prednisone 20mg once a day and oral&#xD;
      antibiotics (clavulin or clindamycin if penicillin) prior to surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a closed envelope system, patients enrolled in the study are randomized to receive&#xD;
      either HSI (defined as temperatures of 45-50 degrees Celsius) or RTSI (defined as temperature&#xD;
      of the operating room). Both the patient and the surgeon are blinded to the temperature of&#xD;
      the irrigation fluid used during surgery. After randomization, a nominated research assistant&#xD;
      will receive instructions to prepare the hot or room temperature saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hot saline is prepared by first placing 2 litres of sterile normal saline (0.9%) into a basin&#xD;
      (IntraTemp Therma BasinTM) that is wrapped in a sterile disposable drape (IntraTemp Therma&#xD;
      Basin DrapeTM). The basin is then placed in a medical grade warmer (IntraTemp Fluid Warming&#xD;
      SystemTM). The warmer is set to heat the saline up to a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. An&#xD;
      external digital thermometer is placed in the saline at all times to ensure that the&#xD;
      temperature is between 45-50 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Room temperature saline is prepared in the same manner except that the warmer is switched off&#xD;
      and the temperature of the saline in the basin is left to equilibrate to the temperature of&#xD;
      the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, a 60 cc syringe attached to an olive tip long curve suction is used to draw the&#xD;
      irrigation fluid from the basin. The surgical field is flushed with 20 cc of hot or room&#xD;
      temperature saline at five minutes intervals by a research assistant. Additional flushes with&#xD;
      hot or room temperature saline can be administered in between the five-minute intervals upon&#xD;
      request by the surgeon. The degree of bleeding in the surgical field is scored by the&#xD;
      operating surgeon using the validated Boezaart and van der Merwe Grading System14. This 0 to&#xD;
      5-point scale will be used to outline the amount of suction required to rid the area of blood&#xD;
      disrupting vision. A score of 0 is given for an area with no bleeding, 1 for slight bleeding&#xD;
      with no suction required, 2 for slight bleeding requiring suction, 3 for moderate bleeding&#xD;
      which improves for several seconds once suction has occurred, 4 for moderate bleeding which&#xD;
      restarts directly after suctioning and 5 for severe bleeding which occurs faster then can be&#xD;
      removed14. Surgical field of view will be assessed and scored every 15 minutes for the&#xD;
      duration of the surgery. At the end of the procedure, the estimated blood loss is calculated&#xD;
      by subtracting the total amount of irrigation fluid used from the fluid in the suction&#xD;
      bottle. The total amount of HSI or RTSI administered and time of surgery are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are placed under general anesthesia and intubated with endotracheal tubes.&#xD;
      Immediately after general anesthesia, both nasal cavities are packed with neuropatties soaked&#xD;
      with Otrivin (xylometazolin 0.05%). The patients' heads are elevated 15 degrees up. The image&#xD;
      guided system is set up and each nasal cavity is examined with a 0 degree endoscope. A 10 cm&#xD;
      merocel is cut into a third of its normal size and inserted to the back of the nasopharynx,&#xD;
      to prevent blood from flowing into the oropharynx and larynx. An artery forceps is clipped&#xD;
      onto the merocel string to prevent dislodgement of the merocel into the larynx or oropharynx.&#xD;
      FESS is performed using the technique described by Messerklinger15 and with a microdebrider&#xD;
      when deemed necessary. The extent of the operation depends on the severity of the disease&#xD;
      seen on the pre-operative CT scan of the paranasal sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study; hence the statistical analysis will be completed at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically significant change in intra-operative bleeding will be defined as a change in&#xD;
      Boezaart scoring by 20%, or one point in relation to the scale. All data collected for this&#xD;
      study will be gathered in a password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file. Each patient&#xD;
      will be assigned unique identification allowing for no patient data to be recorded. The&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel database will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing health conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lund-Kennedy CT score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRS with or without polyposis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary or revision surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAP (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse rate (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic surgical field scores (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdebrider usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total saline irrigation used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of nasal irrigation of up to 50 degrees Celsius have been shown to be safe on the&#xD;
      epithelium of rabbit nasal mucosa studied in-vitro.10 In addition, studies have shown that&#xD;
      irrigation of the human nasal mucosa with temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius did not&#xD;
      result in any complications.11,12 Hot saline irrigation has been widely used for skull base&#xD;
      and endoscopic sinus surgery for many years with no known reported complication in the&#xD;
      English literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties and limitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the surgical volume at St Paul's Sinus Centre, we do not foresee any difficulties in&#xD;
      achieving the target sample size. The St Paul's Sinus Centre is actively involved in&#xD;
      research. Many of our patients are aware of this and are keen to participate in and&#xD;
      contribute to medical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving the desired temperature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact temperature of 50 degrees Celsius is difficult to achieve. Hence we defined our HSI&#xD;
      with a range of temperature of 45-50 degrees Celsius&#xD;
