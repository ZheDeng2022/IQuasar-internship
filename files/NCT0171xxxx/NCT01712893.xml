      The present study is a randomized open-label -phase III study that aims to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous or sequential application&#xD;
      of Zoladex up to 2-3 years for ≤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Data showed that ovarian suppression therapy may protect the ovarian function in&#xD;
      premenopausal patients received chemotherapy for breast cancer. However this is still a&#xD;
      controversial issue. Sequential use of GnRHa (Zoladex) as ovarian suppression treatment after&#xD;
      chemotherapy has been established as an effective endocrine therapy for ER positive&#xD;
      premenopausal breast cancer. The present study is a randomized open-label phase III study&#xD;
      that aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous&#xD;
      combination of Zoladex up to 2-3years and chemotherapy compared with the sequential schedule&#xD;
      in ≤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients.&#xD;
