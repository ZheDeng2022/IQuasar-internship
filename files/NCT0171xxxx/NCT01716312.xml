      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune disease, which means the&#xD;
           body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue resulting in inflammation and&#xD;
           tissue damage. SLE can involve almost any organ and its symptoms can range in severity&#xD;
           from mild to life-threatening; symptoms also vary from person to person. Current&#xD;
           treatments for lupus are not effective for some people. Medications used to treat lupus&#xD;
           can have serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omalizumab is a drug that has been used to treat severe allergic asthma. It helps to&#xD;
           prevent allergic reactions by reducing some antibodies in the blood. These antibodies&#xD;
           are also present in some people with Lupus. Researchers want to see if omalizumab is a&#xD;
           safe and effective treatment for people with Lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety of omalizumab for people with lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have moderately active Lupus even with standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject screening will take place at the NIH Clinical Center and will include a medical&#xD;
           history, a physical exam, blood and urine laboratory tests, an assessment of Lupus&#xD;
           disease activity. Some participants may require some additional testing. All eligible&#xD;
           persons who are interested in enrolling will be asked to come back to the NIH within 2&#xD;
           weeks to begin the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in three phases, with a total of 15 study visits over 38&#xD;
           weeks. Two visits will be overnight hospital stays. The rest will be outpatient visits.&#xD;
           During each visit the participants will be monitored by doing a physical exam,&#xD;
           assessment of their lupus disease activity, review of any treatment related side&#xD;
           effects, blood and urine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first phase, participants will have infusions (under their skin) of either&#xD;
           omalizumab or a placebo. They will have an overnight hospital stay for the first&#xD;
           infusion and then an outpatient safety monitor visit 2 weeks after. If subjects safety&#xD;
           measures are good they will return in 2 weeks and receive the second dose. They will&#xD;
           then get three more doses every 4 weeks which will be given during outpatient visits to&#xD;
           the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second phase, which begins at the 16th week of the study, all participants will&#xD;
           receive omalizumab. This means that subjects who had been getting omalizumab will&#xD;
           continue receiving it and subjects who had been receiving the placebo will now begin&#xD;
           getting omalizumab. They will have an overnight hospital stay for this infusion and will&#xD;
           return in 2 weeks for a safety monitor visit. If subjects safety measures are good they&#xD;
           will return in 2 weeks and receive the next dose. They will then get three more doses&#xD;
           every 4 weeks which will be given during outpatient visits to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third phase will be a final series of visits which will take place at week 32 and&#xD;
           week 36. During these visits subjects will have a physical exam which includes disease&#xD;
           activity assessment, blood and urine tests. No medication will be given during these&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will be given information, instruction and medications for possible&#xD;
           allergic reactions to omalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout the study other tests and procedures will be performed as needed.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system in systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by abnormal activation of&#xD;
      various cell types, such as T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and the&#xD;
      production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. Until recently most of the pathogenic&#xD;
      autoantibodies were thought to be IgG antibodies. We have recently shown that Lyn deficient&#xD;
      mice develop a lupus nephritis-like disease which is mediated by basophils activated by IgE&#xD;
      autoantibodies. Moreover, SLE patients also have elevated serum self reactive IgEs, and&#xD;
      activated basophils that express the lymph node homing molecule CD62L and the MHC Class II&#xD;
      molecule, HLA-DR; markers that are associated with increased disease activity. Follow up&#xD;
      studies confirmed an association of IgE anti-dsDNA antibodies with active SLE using a SLEDAI&#xD;
      score of 4 as a cutoff (unpublished). In addition, we have also observed a strong correlation&#xD;
      of IgE dsDNA antibodies with hypocomplementemia strongly suggesting that these autoantibodies&#xD;
      are serologic markers of immune activation in SLE. Based on these observations we propose&#xD;
      that depleting IgE (including IgE autoantibodies) may lead to improvement in SLE by reducing&#xD;
      IgE-induced basophil activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omalizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human IgE. It is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for the treatment of asthma. Omalizumab was shown to effectively deplete circulating IgE&#xD;
      and decrease basophil action. In this study we propose to assess the safety of omalizumab in&#xD;
      moderately active lupus patients and to assess its effect on circulating IgE autoantibodies&#xD;
      and basophil activation. We will also collect preliminary data about its clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if omalizumab is tolerated in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the use of omalizumab in a subset of SLE patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      disease and elevated IgE autoantibody levels leads to clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 years or older diagnosed with SLE attending NIAMS outpatient clinic (OP-9) as well&#xD;
      as other rheumatology outpatient clinics and private rheumatologist offices around the&#xD;
      country with moderately active lupus (SLEDAI 2K score between 4-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active lupus: Assess study eligibility (week -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If fulfills the criteria randomize at 2:1 ratio of omalizumab vs. placebo respectively&#xD;
           within 2 weeks (week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Omalizumab loading dose (600 mg) or placebo by subcutaneous injection on day 0, followed&#xD;
           by omalizumab (300 mg) or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks (weeks 4, 8,&#xD;
           12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patients at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. Preliminary analysis of the available&#xD;
           data will be done when the last subject completed the blinded phase (week 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open label phase: On week 16 subjects who were randomized to the placebo arm originally&#xD;
           will receive 600 mg omalizumab by subcutaneous injection whereas those in the omalizumab&#xD;
           arm will receive 300 mg omalizumab by subcutaneous injection in a blinded fashion. After&#xD;
           that all subjects will receive omalizumab 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4&#xD;
           weeks, on weeks 20, 24, 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patients at weeks 18, 20, 24, 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up phase: Subjects will have a follow up evaluation 4 and 8 weeks after the last&#xD;
           dose (weeks 32 and 36).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow one time intra-muscular injection of methylprednisolone 0.4 0.75 mg/kg for&#xD;
           continued disease activity/flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of omalizumab in patients with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced free IgE autoantibody levels: a statistical significant difference in the change in&#xD;
      IgE autoantibody levels between the placebo and omalizumab groups at 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased basophil activation: a statistically significant difference in the change in the&#xD;
      proportion of activated basophils between the placebo and omalizumab groups at 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced IgG autoantibody levels: a statistically significant difference in the change in IgG&#xD;
      autoantibody levels between the placebo and omalizumab group at 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics as measured by total and free IgE and FcepsilonR levels with associated PK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical efficacy: the difference in clinical responders at 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be defined as an improvement in SLEDAI 2K scores of 4 or more without&#xD;
      a worsening in PGA (physician s global assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide important preliminary information about the safety and possible&#xD;
      effect of IgE depletion in SLE patients. If omalizumab is well tolerated and shows&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of efficacy, follow up studies testing its clinical usefulness are&#xD;
      planned. This agent is expected to be devoid of the most common toxicities of therapies&#xD;
      commonly used in the treatment of SLE, such as myelosuppression, amenorrhea and osteoporosis.&#xD;
