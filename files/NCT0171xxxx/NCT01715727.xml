  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that the dopaminergic cell death located in the basal ganglia&#xD;
      of the brain in patients with Parkinson's Disease can be detected by diffusion Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging, specifically by diffusion kurtosis imaging. The preliminary result was&#xD;
      published in Radiology 2011. The current study proposed to investigate the following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  validation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  differential diagnosis capability between PD and PD+ syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prognosis capability&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first year, patients with Parkinson's disease will be recruited from the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics of movement disorders in ChangGung memorial hospital Linkou, Taiwan. The diffusion&#xD;
      parameters in basal ganglia will be compared with a group of healthy controls. In the second&#xD;
      year, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and patients with multiple system atrophy&#xD;
      will be recruited for assessment of differential diagnosis. The patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease will return for assessment of disease severity and in the third year, for the outcome&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there existed no specific diagnostic test of Parkinson's Disease. Accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis is of great interest because of the reduction in health cost and disease&#xD;
      co-morbidity, improvement in effective treatment course and avoidance of un-necessary&#xD;
      intervention. Our preliminary result showed superior performance from diffusion kurtosis&#xD;
      imaging, a new development in MRI since 2007, on the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease when&#xD;
      compared to conventional diffusion MRI. The study proposes to validate the diagnostic value&#xD;
      of diffusion kurtosis in major basal ganglia regions using a cross-sectional study and to&#xD;
      assess the prognostic value through 3-year longitudinal follow-up. Furthermore, the iron&#xD;
      content as well as global white matter involvement in both PD and PD plus syndrome patients&#xD;
      will be assessed. The difference in MRI information between PD and PD plus syndrome patients&#xD;
      will then be addressed in a comprehensive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twelve patients with Parkinson's Disease will be recruited in the first year&#xD;
      and followed up for 3 years. Another 112 healthy controls will be included. This is to&#xD;
      validate the diagnosis and assess the prognosis. Another 30 patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease, 15 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 15 patients with multiple system&#xD;
      atrophy will be recruited in the 2nd year for differential diagnosis. The imaging protocol&#xD;
      will include both diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis imaging. Susceptibility weighted&#xD;
      imaging will be included for iron content estimation. The targeted anatomy will include&#xD;
      regional changes in basal ganglia, midbrain as well as thalamus, and global white matter&#xD;
      changes using tract based spatial statistics. The statistical analysis will use receiver&#xD;
      operative characteristics to assess the diagnostic performance, Spearman's ranked correlation&#xD;
      for correlation with disease severity and net reclassification improvement for differential&#xD;
      diagnosis. The prognostic value will be determined by the decline rate and the quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points of the project are to differentiate patients of PD from PD plus syndrome, and&#xD;
      to predict the clinical outcomes using diffusion MRI. Patent application will be filed in the&#xD;
      first year. The analysis of medical device software and software life cycle processes and the&#xD;
      evaluation of risk management to medical devices will be filed at the end of the third year.&#xD;
