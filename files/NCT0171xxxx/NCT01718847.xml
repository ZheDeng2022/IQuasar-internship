  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase II trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of novel pan-HER inhibitor, NOV120101 (Poziotinib), as a 2nd line&#xD;
      monotherapy agent in lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKIs is considered as &quot;unmet medical need&quot; in clinical&#xD;
      practice. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a second-line monotherapeutic&#xD;
      agent, patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 16 mg PO once daily until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Progression free survival (PFS) will be&#xD;
      analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS rate at 16&#xD;
      weeks, ORR and DCR will also be analyzed.&#xD;
