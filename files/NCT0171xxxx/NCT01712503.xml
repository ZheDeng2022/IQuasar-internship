  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial that formally compares intra-ocular lenses, which can&#xD;
      be used in cataract surgery, one of which is the standard 'monofocal' lens, and the other is&#xD;
      the newer toric lens which can correct astgimatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that both intra-ocular lenses give the same visual outcome in cataract&#xD;
      surgery. The alternative hypothesis is that the toric lens, provides a better unaided&#xD;
      (without glasses) vision, by correcting the participant's astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been decided to conduct a randomised controlled trial of the two lenses, as although&#xD;
      the toric lenses are endorsed by many case series (which show a reduction in astigmatism),&#xD;
      they have not been formally compared to the standard lens. An RCT will enable the formal&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that this trial will take approximately a year to conduct: six months of&#xD;
      recruitment and six months of follow-up. A further six months will be required to analyse the&#xD;
      data and prepare a manuscript for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not plan to conduct an interim analysis or report as this is a&#xD;
      short-trial (six months follow-up) using two alternative lens that are CE marked and already&#xD;
      widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have both cataract and astigmatism will be identified from the&#xD;
      GP/optometrist referral letter. They will be seen in specially designated clinics for this&#xD;
      research study, which will run alongside the routine cataract 'one' stop clinics at St&#xD;
      Richard's Hospital and Worthing Hospital. This will allow for those patients who wish to be&#xD;
      part of the study to have all the necessary examination done in one visit and for those who&#xD;
      decline participation to be seen in the regular cataract clinic. Potential participants will&#xD;
      be sent the research trial information (appendix A) with their appointment letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After introducing himself the researcher (who is also a senior cataract surgeon at Western&#xD;
      Sussex Hospital Trust), will check if potential participants have had the opportunity to read&#xD;
      the trial information that they were sent, or give participants a further copy as required.&#xD;
      The key points of the trial will be re-iterated by the researcher and they will be invited to&#xD;
      ask any questions about the trialThe researcher will check that the potential participant has&#xD;
      read and understood the participant information leaflet. They will answer any questions that&#xD;
      the potential participant has and will then take signed consent from those willing to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one eye (the 'trial eye') from each patient will be used in the trial. In patients with&#xD;
      bilateral cataract, one eye will be selected as the trial eye. This will be the eye that the&#xD;
      participant prefers, after consultation with the researcher or surgeon, to have operated&#xD;
      first. The participant will be allocated a unique study reference number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who decline to take part in the trial will be offered cataract surgery as per usual&#xD;
      WSHT/NHS procedure.&#xD;
