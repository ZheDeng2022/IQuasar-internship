  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two gold standard for cardiac output (CO) measurements, i.e., the Fick method and&#xD;
      pulmonary artery thermodilution , are both invasive methods, requiring the use of central&#xD;
      venous catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to reduce the risks for the patient, a big research effort has been made to&#xD;
      investigate minimally invasive or non-invasive methods. Investigators sought to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a non invasive method to estimate CO in mechanically ventilated patients.The&#xD;
      method is based on prolonged expiration, and relies on measurement of gas concentrations and&#xD;
      flow rate. Investigators designed, realized, and characterized a system to induce passive&#xD;
      prolonged expirations when connected to the patient circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO is then calculated using an algorithm based a modified version of the Fick equation and&#xD;
      the results are compared with the ones obtained by thermodilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several advantages can be introduced by the prolonged expiration technique: non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement, easy implementation, independency from operator ability among others.&#xD;

      This prospective trial was designed to assess the performance of a non invasive method to&#xD;
      estimate cardiac output in mechanically ventilated cardiac surgery patients and its outcome&#xD;
      is compared to the values obtained from the invasive measurement system based on&#xD;
      thermodilution. The pulmonary blood flow (PBF), which is the volume of blood that actively&#xD;
      participates in the gas exchange per unit of time, is the directly estimated variable that&#xD;
      this technique employ to calculate cardiac output. The method investigators studied is&#xD;
      theoretically based on the application of an algorithm which derives from a modified version&#xD;
      of the Fick equation in two different phases; the former involves measurements during the&#xD;
      steady state, whilst the second starts when a sudden perturbation into the carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2) elimination process is introduced. The algorithms investigated in this work requires&#xD;
      the analysis of the expired gas content during both normal breathing and prolonged&#xD;
      expiration, providing a non-invasive estimation of the artero-venous content of CO2, and&#xD;
      consequently allows the calculation of PBF according to the Fick method. At this purpose, a&#xD;
      metabolic monitor was used; it sampled gas from the &quot;Y&quot; piece of the mechanical ventilator's&#xD;
      breathing circuit through a suction pump. In order to obtain the prolonged expiration, a&#xD;
      pneumatic system, with an ad hoc designed orifice resistance (5 cmH2O•L-1•min),has been made&#xD;
      and experimentally characterized to adapt the breathing circuit to this application.&#xD;
      Experimental data of CO2 and O2 concentrations were recorded and processed after the&#xD;
      measurement session thanks to an ad hoc developed LabView application. This application&#xD;
      performs the following tasks: it converts the gas fractions into partial pressures, segments&#xD;
      the trends of partial pressures, executes the data-reduction and, after obtaining the values&#xD;
      of venous carbon dioxide tension (PvCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2)&#xD;
      obtained, it calculates the CO value using the above mentioned algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The values calculated with non invasive method showed good agreement with ones obtained by&#xD;
      thermodilution and a precision comparable to those of other minimally invasive techniques.&#xD;
