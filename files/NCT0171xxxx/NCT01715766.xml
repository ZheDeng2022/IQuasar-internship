      The purpose of the study is to learn about the causes of different types of pain that can&#xD;
      occur in people who have had an amputation. By gathering information through blood tests,&#xD;
      photographs, a nerve test, and questionnaires, we hope to de-code how each individual's&#xD;
      special characteristics affect the type and amount of pain they experience in their amputated&#xD;
      limb.&#xD;

      Studies have already shown that pain following amputation might be caused by differences in a&#xD;
      person's genes. This study may help us find out how genes affect the way you feel pain and&#xD;
      why you may feel more or less or different kinds of pain than another person with a similar&#xD;
      amputation. What we learn in this research study may lead to discoveries as to why some&#xD;
      painkillers work better for some people than others.&#xD;

      Blood draw will consist of, two BD™ P100 tubes (2x8.5mL=17mL) where the plasma will be&#xD;
      separated by centrifuge then placed in a -80ºC freezer. Two RNA tubes (2 x 2.5mL=5mL) and one&#xD;
      DNA tube (8.5mL) will be place first, in a -20ºC freezer for 24-36 hours then moved to a&#xD;
      -80ºC freezer. All the blood samples will remain in a -80ºC freezer at the Department of&#xD;
      Clinical Investigation(DCI) laboratory until they are sent to Duke University after every 8&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male and female active duty military personnel age 18 years and older undergoing&#xD;
             treatment at WRAMC and future WRNMMC with the diagnosis of post injury amputation of 1&#xD;
             limb, more than 3 but less than 18 months prior to enrollment. In particular, phantom&#xD;
             limb pain patients will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (Primary major head trauma and diagnosis of traumatic&#xD;
             brain injury resulting in documented, permanent or prolonged cognitive deficits that&#xD;
             would preclude participation in the study (i.e. decreased intellectual capacity,&#xD;
             marked memory deficits, or inability to communicate verbally or in writing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cognitive deficits that would preclude participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial hearing loss without alternative means of communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented spinal cord injury with permanent or persistent deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of fibromyalgia or other chronic pain syndrome such as chronic headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of ongoing tissue damage pain, infection, bone spur, or poorly fitting&#xD;
             prosthesis.&#xD;
