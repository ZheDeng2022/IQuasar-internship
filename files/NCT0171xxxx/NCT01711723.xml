  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with the recently revised FDA draft renal impairment guidance (March 2010)&#xD;
      which advises the conduct of renal impairment study in drugs that are not predominately&#xD;
      eliminated through the renal route, the proposed study will be conducted to formally assess&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of darapladib in severely renally impaired subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this is an open-label, non-randomized study eight subjects with severe renal impairment&#xD;
      will be recruited along with 8 healthy control subjects matched to the severe renal&#xD;
      impairment subjects based on gender, body mass index (plus or minus 20%) and age (plus or&#xD;
      minus 10 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive repeat oral doses of darapladib 160 milligram (mg) for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of darapladib and its metabolites; and safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the evening of Day -1. Subjects may check&#xD;
      out of the clinic on Day 2 after all assessments are complete, but must return to the clinic&#xD;
      each day (Days 3-8) for dosing and assessments. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic again&#xD;
      on the evening of Day 9. After the last dose of the study drug, there will be a follow-up&#xD;
      period which will include 2 visits (Day 20-24 and Day 38-52). The total study duration for&#xD;
      each subject including the screening, treatment and follow-up periods will be approximately&#xD;
      11 weeks.&#xD;
