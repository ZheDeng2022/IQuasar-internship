      Introduction: The military population is at high-risk for injury with by painful sprains,&#xD;
      especially of the ankle. The referenced treatment method for pain is the cryotherapy,&#xD;
      consisting in applying cold-packs to the injured ankle several times a day. However, another&#xD;
      pain treatment has been developed and is commonly used by high-level sports teams and&#xD;
      rheumatologists but its efficacy has never been assessed within a military population, i.e.&#xD;
      the hyperbaric CO2 cryotherapy, also called the neurocryostimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: This study was carried out on a French multicenter basis, the study&#xD;
      consisting in a randomized controlled superiority trial and open-label prospective analysis&#xD;
      in the treatment of 40-year-old military patients or younger suffering from acute ankle&#xD;
      sprains. Two groups were made: patients were treated either by neurocryostimulation or by the&#xD;
      referenced cryotherapy (cold-packs). The care protocol for both groups consisted in six&#xD;
      supervised 30 minute-sessions within a period of three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Neurocryostimulation is more effective in the treatment of pain severity&#xD;
      resulting from an ankle sprain than the referenced treatment by cold-packs. Moreover, we&#xD;
      theorized that the total consumption of paracetamol and the number of days of temporary&#xD;
      inaptitude and of work exemption were lower in patients treated by neurocryostimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each session, pain severity is assessed on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of session 20 minutes later after a four-step walk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, there is one ankle sprain per 10,000 person/day mainly as a result of athletic&#xD;
      practice. The military population is one of the most physically active populations due to&#xD;
      taking part in sports exercise, scheduled sports periods and leisure sports , or required&#xD;
      military exercise which increase the soldiers' risk for injury to the lower extremity,&#xD;
      especially the ankle. The incidence rate for ankle sprain injuries among all -active-duty US&#xD;
      service members was 34.95 per 1000 person/year , thus more than 5 times greater than&#xD;
      previously reported in civilian studies reported in the literature. These are among the two&#xD;
      first leading causes of sports and physical training related hospitalizations among the U.S.&#xD;
      Army population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sprains can lead to numerous consequences in the long-term in physical restrictions such as,&#xD;
      ankle instability, risk of recurrence, but also absenteeism from work and/or participation in&#xD;
      sports and chronic pain. A more efficient treatment seems to be necessary in preventing such&#xD;
      troubles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care protocol for ankle sprains (RICE protocol) involve the cryotherapy (usually a&#xD;
      cold-pack (R) applied directly to the injury several times a day with no existing undesirable&#xD;
      effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An innovative treatment method, the neurocryostimulation, developed by Cluzeau and a French&#xD;
      Company in 1993, gained rapid and wide-spread use among physiotherapists, rheumatologists,&#xD;
      and athletes.It would provide a powerfull anti-inflammatory, myorelaxant and analgesic effect&#xD;
      but contradictory results are shown in literature. Demoulin et al. aimed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of neurocryostimulation following total knee arthroplasty compared to routinely used&#xD;
      strategies for applying cold therapy, but didn't show significant differences regarding pain&#xD;
      severity, mobility and perimetric measures. However, a pilot study led in Switzerland,&#xD;
      comparing the pain reported by patients after an acute post-operative knee arthroscopy, has&#xD;
      shown a pain differential higher in the neurocryostimulation than in the referenced&#xD;
      cryotherapy (2.2 versus 0.5). And, Chatap et al. showed in a prospective study that pain&#xD;
      scores decreased significantly after four sessions in elderly patients with acute or chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this day, No study has proved the efficacy of neurocryostimulation versus cold packs in&#xD;
      pain resulting from an ankle sprain . A better treatment of the ankle sprain could reduce&#xD;
      pain and , in the same time, also reduce the consumption of analgesics, the time of temporary&#xD;
      inaptitudes and of work exemptions.&#xD;
