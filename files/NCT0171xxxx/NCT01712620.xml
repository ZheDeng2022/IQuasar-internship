      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - High blood pressure in the lungs, known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a rare&#xD;
      disorder. In spite of recent advances in treatment, the death rate remains unacceptably high.&#xD;
      Lung blood vessel function can be harmed by progressive injuries, such as inflammation,&#xD;
      leading to worsening of the disease. A drug called spironolactone has been known to improve&#xD;
      blood vessel function and reduce inflammation. Some people with PAH take spironolactone to&#xD;
      help treat fluid retention. However, its effect on inflammation and blood vessel function in&#xD;
      patients withPAH is not known. Researchers want to see if spironolactone can help these&#xD;
      conditions in people with PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effectiveness of spironolactone in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will last for 24 weeks. Participants will be screened with a physical exam&#xD;
           and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take either spironolactone or a placebo. They will take their study&#xD;
           drug or placebo for 7 weeks. Treatment will be monitored with regular blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Week 8, participants who have had no reaction to the treatment will receive a higher&#xD;
           dose of the drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Week 12, participants will have a study visit with heart and lung function tests.&#xD;
           They will also have a 6-minute walk test, and provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After additional study visits for blood samples, participants will have a final visit in&#xD;
           Week 24. The tests from Week 12 will be repeated at this visit.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder associated with poor survival.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering&#xD;
      stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a&#xD;
      central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH. Inflammation appears to drive&#xD;
      this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in&#xD;
      genetically susceptible patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and patients with&#xD;
      disease-associated PAH. Therapy targeting pulmonary vascular inflammation to interrupt cycles&#xD;
      of injury and repair and thereby delay or prevent RV failure and death has not been tested.&#xD;
      Spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, has&#xD;
      been shown to improve endothelial function and reduce inflammation. Current management of&#xD;
      patients with severe PAH and NYHA/WHO class IV symptoms includes use of MR antagonists for&#xD;
      their diuretic and natriuretic effects once clinical right heart failure has developed. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that initiating therapy with spironolactone at an earlier stage of disease in&#xD;
      subjects with PAH could provide additional benefits through anti-inflammatory effects and&#xD;
      improvements in pulmonary artery endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IPAH and disease-associated PAH will be recruited to the NIH and enrolled in a&#xD;
      randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study of early treatment with spironolactone&#xD;
      to investigate its effects on exercise capacity, clinical worsening, and vascular&#xD;
      inflammation in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of PAH subjects enrolled will be up to 70. Subjects will undergo 1) standard&#xD;
      clinical examinations including 6-minute walk distance and echocardiography; 2)&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing; 3) plasma profiling of inflammatory and neurohormonal&#xD;
      markers; 4) gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); and 5)&#xD;
      high-resolution MRI-based determination of pulmonary vascular and RV structure and function.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of spironolactone in PAH will be assessed with periodic monitoring&#xD;
      for hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency as well as the incidence of drug discontinuation for&#xD;
      untoward effects.&#xD;
