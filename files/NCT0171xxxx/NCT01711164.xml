  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral hepatitis is a serious world health problem affecting over 1 billion people worldwide.&#xD;
      Presently the lack of highly effective treatments results in many patients requiring liver&#xD;
      transplantation or death. The investigators have defined the role of a unique molecule FGL2&#xD;
      and its receptor fc-gammaR and its role in the pathogenesis of both experimental and human&#xD;
      hepatitis. The studies proposed in the present proposal will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      measuring levels of fgl2 in plasma will identify individuals that will go on to develop&#xD;
      chronic disease and inhibition of binding of fgl2 to its receptor will allow the host with&#xD;
      both acute and chronic disease to develop an appropriate immune response and clear the virus.&#xD;
      The studies will provide rationale for generation of new therapies to improve the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with acute and chronic viral hepatitis by targeting fgl2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection affects more than 200 million individuals worldwide. Only a&#xD;
      fraction of infected individuals clear the virus, whereas the majority (70%) develops chronic&#xD;
      infection. The current standard of care, pegylated interferon/ ribavirin (pegIFN/rib) is&#xD;
      effective in only 50% of patients. Patients who fail anti-viral therapy gradually progress to&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular cancer; which can only be cured by a liver&#xD;
      transplant. The reasons for treatment failure are unclear but involve both viral and host&#xD;
      factors. One significant factor may be impaired T cell function. Chronic HCV infection is&#xD;
      associated with functionally impaired or exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), with&#xD;
      decreased anti-viral cytokine production, cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity. The&#xD;
      investigators recently showed that many patients who fail treatment have elevated frequencies&#xD;
      of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cells (Tregs) producing the novel fibrinogen-like-protein 2&#xD;
      (FGL2/fibroleukin) which appears to impair HCV specific immune responses. Binding of FGL2 to&#xD;
      the FcγRIIB receptor leads to inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, B cell apoptosis&#xD;
      and inhibition of development of effective CD4+and CD8+T and B cell anti-viral responses. In&#xD;
      HCV, increased levels of secreted FGL2 may suppress anti-viral immune responses and promote&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: HCV suppresses innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses through the&#xD;
      FGL2-FcγRIIB inhibitory pathway. Inhibition of this pathway will restore effective&#xD;
      virus-specific immunity and lead to successful viral eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: These studies will establish the importance of FGL2-FcγRIIB inhibitory pathway&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of HCV chronic infection and provide a novel therapeutic approach to&#xD;
      improve virus eradication and long term patient outcomes.&#xD;
