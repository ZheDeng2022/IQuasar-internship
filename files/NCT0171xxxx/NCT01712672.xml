      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Dental plaque is a coating of bacteria on the teeth. It contributes to poor dental health&#xD;
      and diseases such as gingivitis, cavities and periodontal disease. Researchers who study&#xD;
      plaque know that many different types of oral bacteria stick to each other in test-tube&#xD;
      experiments. However, it is not clear if these interactions occur in natural dental plaque.&#xD;
      By studying how bacteria interact, researchers can better understand how bacteria come&#xD;
      together and grow to form plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at how bacteria interact with one another to form dental plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy nonsmoking volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and dental exam. They will also&#xD;
           have dental impressions taken for a stent (a device similar to Invisalign(SqrRoot)&#xD;
           braces).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear the stent for up to 8 hours a day on selected study visit days.&#xD;
           It will contain enamel chips made from sterilized human teeth. The mouth bacteria will&#xD;
           stick to the chips and grow. Chips will be taken out of the stent twice during these&#xD;
           study visit days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have other study visits to provide saliva and plaque samples. They&#xD;
           will also have gum swabs to collect bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may have a second set of study visits. At these visits, they will chew&#xD;
           gum to increase their saliva production. Afterwards, they will wear the stent with the&#xD;
           enamel chips for 4 hours. Samples from the stent will be taken once on these study visit&#xD;
           days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dental caries and periodontal disease are closely associated with the oral biofilm known as&#xD;
      dental plaque. Much is known about the makeup of this biofilm, especially at its early stage&#xD;
      of development (i.e. up to 12 hrs following tooth cleaning). The primary initial colonizers&#xD;
      are streptococci, and actinomyces. These bacteria coaggregate frequently with one another by&#xD;
      a mechanism that involves binding of protein adhesins on the surface of one cell to&#xD;
      complementary cell surface receptor polysaccharides (RPS) on streptococci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaggregation profiles are known for a wide range of oral actinomyces and streptococci.&#xD;
      However, despite the potential significance of these interactions in biofilm formation,&#xD;
      little is known about their occurrence within oral biofilms in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine and compare the influence of coaggregation on the&#xD;
      spatial organization of bacteria in supragingival dental plaque formed under conditions of&#xD;
      normal salivary flow (Arm 1 of the protocol) or increased salivary flow (Arm 2 of the&#xD;
      protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of up to twenty-five (25) healthy adult subjects 18 years&#xD;
      of age and older. All subjects will participate in Arm 1 of the protocol. In addition, at&#xD;
      least three volunteers from Arm 1 will participate in Arm 2 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational, longitudinal protocol to determine the spatial organization of&#xD;
      bacteria found within dental plaque of normal healthy subjects. Enrolled subjects will have a&#xD;
      standard oral examination (including oral cancer screening) performed in the NIDCR clinic by&#xD;
      protocol-listed dental clinicians. A mandibular stent will be custom fabricated based on&#xD;
      impressions taken during the exam. Enamel chips cut from previously extracted third molars&#xD;
      will be sterilized by ethylene oxide then inserted into the stent on each side over the molar&#xD;
      area. We currently have enough extracted third molars in storage to accommodate tooth chips&#xD;
      for the entire protocol if four subjects complete the study as projected. If additional chips&#xD;
      are needed, the NIDCR is currently in the process of preparing a protocol that will provide&#xD;
      extracted teeth, if needed, for this and other protocols. In Arm 1 of the study, a&#xD;
      custom-fitted stent will be worn in the mouth of each subject, and chips removed for analysis&#xD;
      after 4 or 8 hours of wearing. The bacterial biofilm on the chips will be stained with&#xD;
      fluorescent antibodies against specific microbial adhesins or receptors, after which the&#xD;
      spatial organization of labeled cells within the biofilm will be documented by laser confocal&#xD;
      microscopy. Chips may be used for bacterial isolation and subjects will be asked to provide&#xD;
      saliva samples, and site-specific plaque samples (curette scrapings, gum swabs) for molecular&#xD;
      taxonomic analysis. Decisions on which subjects will have these samples taken will be based&#xD;
      on the reactivity of available antibodies with bacterial communities. Subjects from Arm 1 of&#xD;
      the study who are chosen to participate in Arm 2, will chew a gum base for 10 minutes to&#xD;
      increase salivary flow while wearing their stent. The stent from these individuals will be&#xD;
      removed after 4 hours of additional wear and analyzed as above. Prior to participation in Arm&#xD;
      2 of the protocol, subjects will be advised that the experiments are supported by a CRADA&#xD;
      agreement. Through this agreement, only coded research information will be exchanged. The&#xD;
      samples will remain with the NIH research team. Individuals may participate in the first arm&#xD;
      only, or in both arms of the study, as indicated in their consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures for this protocol will be the qualitative and quantitative description of&#xD;
      the oral bacterial community during development of initial plaque.&#xD;
