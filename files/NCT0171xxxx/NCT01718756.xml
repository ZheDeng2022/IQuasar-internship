  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative continuous infusion of lornoxicam would be an effective and safe regimen to&#xD;
      reduce the patient controlled morphine consumption after orthopaedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical approval, 96 patients scheduled for elective orthopaedic fracture surgery under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive placebo, 12-hourly iv lornoxicam 16 mg&#xD;
      or lornoxicam 16 mg followed with continuous infusion of 1.3 mg/hr., for 48 hours after&#xD;
      surgery (n=32 per group). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol, sufentanil and rocuronium,&#xD;
      and was maintained with 0.5-1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane, sufentanil and&#xD;
      rocuronium. Postoperative patient controlled morphine analgesia was used. Changes in heart&#xD;
      rate, mean blood pressure and sevoflurane minimum alveolar concentration, visual analogue&#xD;
      pain scores, and cumulative patient controlled morphine consumptions and blood loss for 48&#xD;
      hours, platelet functions, bone non-union and the presence of adverse effects were recorded.&#xD;

      An independent investigator who was not involved in the study instructed the patients&#xD;
      preoperatively about the use of visual analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative&#xD;
      pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst imaginable pain) and about the use of PCA for&#xD;
      their postoperative pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic management was standardized. Oral lorazepam 2 mg was given the night before&#xD;
      surgery. Subjects were allocated randomly into three groups (n = 32 for each) by drawing&#xD;
      sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software-generated randomization&#xD;
      code (Random Allocation Software, version 1.0.0, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,&#xD;
      Isfahan, Iran)into the placebo, scheduled, and continuous infusion groups. The syringes&#xD;
      containing placebo and lornoxicam solutions were masked by identical opaque identical cover&#xD;
      sheets. The test solution was prepared by one anaesthesiologist before induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Another anaesthesiologist, who was blinded to the study solution, gave the&#xD;
      anaesthetic and was instructed to avoid using local anaesthetics, and a third&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist collected perioperative data. All staff in the operating room were unaware&#xD;
      of patient allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient monitoring included electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      end-tidal sevoflurane and carbon dioxide (ETCO2) concentrations, response entropy (RE) and&#xD;
      state entropy (SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoxygenation for 3 min, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1 - 3 µg/kg, propofol&#xD;
      1.5-2.5 mg/kg (to achieve an SE &lt;50 and a difference&lt;10 between RE and SE; RE-SE) and&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation or slipping of laryngeal mask appropriate for body&#xD;
      weight were used according to the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. Anaesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained with a 0.6-1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane (MAC-Sevo) with air in&#xD;
      40% oxygen and fentanyl 1 µg/kg boluses to maintain SE &lt;50 and RE-SE &lt;10 and heart rate and&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure within 20% of their baseline values. Rocuronium 0.1 mg/kg was&#xD;
      given to maintain suppression of the second twitch using a train-of-four stimulation. The&#xD;
      patients' lungs were ventilated to maintain an ETCO2 of 30-35 mmHg. Sevoflurane were&#xD;
      discontinued at the start of skin closure, residual neuromuscular block was antagonized and&#xD;
      the trachea extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia was achieved according to the hospital protocol with patient&#xD;
      controlled morphine analgesia (1 mg/ml), 1 mg, with a lockout interval of 8 minutes and a&#xD;
      maximum 24-hourly limit of 180 mg. respiratory depression defined as the decrease in&#xD;
      respiratory rate below 8/min was treated with i.v naloxone 0.2 mg. Nausea and vomiting were&#xD;
      treated with i.v granisetron 1 mg and pruritus was treated with i.m promethazine 25 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded before (baseline) and 10 min after&#xD;
      the start of infusion; every 30 min during surgery; every 15 min during the stay in post&#xD;
      anaesthesia care unit (PACU), and 8 hourly for the following 48 hours. MAC-Sevo was recorded&#xD;
      every 15 min after intubation until the end of surgery. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption&#xD;
      was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS pain scores, the presence and intensity of postoperative sedation (four-point verbal&#xD;
      rating scores (VRS): awake, drowsy, rousable or deep sleep), nausea and vomiting (0: no&#xD;
      nausea; 1: nausea no vomiting; 2: nausea and vomiting), were reported every 15 min for the&#xD;
      first postoperative hour and two-hourly thereafter for the first 48 postoperative hours. The&#xD;
      cumulative morphine consumption during the first 24 and 48 postoperative hours were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet function assay was performed before and every 24 hrs. for the first three days after&#xD;
      surgery. Cumulative intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and the number of transfused&#xD;
      blood units were recorded. The presence of fracture non-union was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were observed by an independent investigator during the study period for the&#xD;
      presence of nausea, vomiting, gastritis, reflux esophagitis, headache, bleeding,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, sweating, allergy, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, ecchymosis, or increases in&#xD;
      liver transaminases.&#xD;
