      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies considered the comparison of preemptive vs. post-surgery Pregabalin (PGL) only&#xD;
      administration. The investigators believe that the administration of PGL preemptively would&#xD;
      diminish pain sensation and therefore the need for opioids administration in&#xD;
      orthopedic-oncologic patients more effectively than if administered starting postoperatively.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper pain relief is a major concern of patients worldwide. Pain concerns the surgical team&#xD;
      as well, because of its correlation with clinical outcomes and patients' satisfaction rate.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that negative clinical outcome with regard to pain control includes&#xD;
      decreases in vital capacity and alveolar ventilation, pneumonia, tachycardia, hypertension,&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia, transition into chronic pain, poor wound healing, and psychological&#xD;
      sequelae. Pain has been found to be one of the three most common medical causes of&#xD;
      delayed/aborted discharge after ambulatory surgery, the other two being drowsiness and&#xD;
      postoperative nausea/vomiting. Despite progress that has been made with regard to&#xD;
      postoperative pain control, and the development of new standards for pain control, many&#xD;
      patients continue to experience intense pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in the understanding of the particularities of central sensitization indicate&#xD;
      that it plays an important role in post surgical and post traumatic pain and therefore should&#xD;
      be avoided. We now distinguish postoperative pain, which is mostly nociceptive, and which&#xD;
      perceives pain following surgical insult, from the exacerbation of acute nociceptive pain&#xD;
      that leads to neural sensitization, when sensations that are not normally painful, are&#xD;
      perceived as painful, as in hyperalgesia and allodynia. Thus, acute pain may transform into&#xD;
      subacute or chronic pain, conditions that are harder to control when more persistent&#xD;
      (chronic) they become. Better pain control, possibly using drugs that affect both acute and&#xD;
      chronic pains, seems therefore the current optimal choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia Advances in knowledge of the neuropharmacological molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      of pain have led to the development of &quot;multimodal analgesia&quot; practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of multimodal analgesia is now a well established clinical practice. For example,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications combined with intravenous patient-controlled&#xD;
      morphine administration, may decrease nausea and sedation in patients when compared with that&#xD;
      using patient-controlled morphine analgesia alone. Multimodal analgesia also can produce&#xD;
      opioid sparing effects. Our group has shown repeatedly, that multimodal analgesia spares&#xD;
      postoperative morphine consumption and increases level of patients' satisfaction. However,&#xD;
      they may not improve postoperative outcome in terms of faster recovery, reduced hospital&#xD;
      stay, and decreased length of convalescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic adjuvant Adjuvants are compounds, which by themselves may have undesirable side&#xD;
      effects or low potency but in combination with opioids allow a reduction of narcotic dosing&#xD;
      for postoperative pain control. They are needed due to side effects of opioid analgesics,&#xD;
      which hinder recovery, especially when increasingly utilizing ambulatory surgical procedures.&#xD;
      One of the newer groups of products that are non-analgesic substances, therefore named&#xD;
      &quot;adjuvants&quot;, are anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin (PGL) Interest has been focused on the analgesic, sedative, anxiolytic, and&#xD;
      opioid-sparing effects of pregabalin (PGL) (S+ 3-isobutyl GABA), a structural analog of GABA&#xD;
      (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) and a derivative of gabapentin in various pain settings, including&#xD;
      postoperative pain. Of a similar mechanism of action, it is thought to possess a superior&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile than gabapentin. Pregabalin has a variable role in neuropathic pain&#xD;
      conditions, such as post-herpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic&#xD;
      pain, and fibromyalgia. Some studies had not demonstrated a significant analgesic effect in&#xD;
      the acute, postoperative pain; others propose PGL to have effective sedative and&#xD;
      opioid-sparing effects , both useful characteristics for the control of acute pain. Opioid&#xD;
      sparing effects and improved pain scores have been seen after abdominal and pelvic surgery.&#xD;
      Its many potential actions such as reducing opioid requirements, prevention and reduction of&#xD;
      opioid tolerance, improvement of the quality of opioid analgesia, decreased respiratory&#xD;
      depression, relief of anxiety, and gastric sparing, make it an attractive drug to consider&#xD;
      for control of pain in the post operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population characteristics The orthopedic oncological patients are a specific group of&#xD;
      individuals whose demand for antinociception starts rather before surgery because of the bone&#xD;
      tumor-generated pain that usually signals the first existence of pathology. Subsequently,&#xD;
      these patients would require postoperatively more analgesics than after general surgery and&#xD;
      for a longer period of time. We have demonstrated previously that acute pain that is&#xD;
      superimposed on an already aroused CNS (central nervous system), i.e., the presence of&#xD;
      central sensitization, would create a situation where complete antinociception is hard to&#xD;
      obtain, as in these patients, and therefore the efficacy of the antinociceptive protocol is&#xD;
      best tested, comprised the possible transformation of acute into chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      preemptive drug has been pointed out as a beneficial tool for reducing perioperative pain.&#xD;
      Various techniques have been employed for this purpose; different drugs were used as well.&#xD;
      The beneficial effects of preemptive PGL were documented in patients who had undergone lumbar&#xD;
      discectomy, both immediately and 1 and 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
