  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contraception after abortion is an important public health issue, as women who have an&#xD;
      abortion are at high risk for additional unintended pregnancy. In the context of first&#xD;
      trimester medical abortion, the standard of care is to administer long-acting reversible&#xD;
      contraception, including the etonogestrel implant (Implanon) and depot medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate (DMPA), at a follow-up appointment after the abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a prospective observational pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      satisfaction of subjects who have selected either the contraceptive implant or DMPA given on&#xD;
      the first day of medical abortion, as opposed to at a follow-up appointment. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the continuation of DMPA and Implanon at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months after the initial date of administration. In addition, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the total days of bleeding after the abortion, follow-up rate for evaluation of completion of&#xD;
      medical abortion, and efficacy of medical abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 participants will be recruited, 20 who choose Implanon and 20 who choose DMPA.&#xD;
      They will be asked to fill out questionnaires during the course of the study, and will be&#xD;
      followed for one year. The study duration including data analysis will be two years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational pilot study of administration of either Implanon or DMPA&#xD;
      on the first day of medication abortion. Subjects in this two cohorts will be followed for&#xD;
      one year, with questionnaires administered at intake, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months after recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of recruitment, after the patient has consented both to medication abortion and&#xD;
      contraceptive method (Implanon or DMPA), the provider will ask the patient if they are&#xD;
      interested in participation in the study. If the patient is interested, a research assistant&#xD;
      or investigator will be called to discuss the study in private with the potential subject.&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained by the investigator, and the intake questionnaire with baseline&#xD;
      contraceptive and demographic data will be administered. Mifepristone for medication abortion&#xD;
      will be administered per protocol by the provider, and then Implanon or DMPA will be&#xD;
      administered. The clinician who provides the medication abortion will not be the same person&#xD;
      as the investigator who is consenting for research. A bleeding diary card will be given to&#xD;
      the subject to record daily bleeding. The subject will be requested to return this card by&#xD;
      mail in 4 weeks, and will be given an addressed and stamped envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled for a 7-day follow-up appointment as per medication abortion&#xD;
      protocol, and at that visit, a short questionnaire regarding the satisfaction with timing of&#xD;
      contraceptive method, and number of days of bleeding will be administered. Subjects will then&#xD;
      be contacted by their preferred modality (phone, email, or text message) at 2 weeks, to&#xD;
      assess for total days of bleeding. If the subject is continuing to have bleeding, they will&#xD;
      be contacted again at 4 weeks to assess for total days of bleeding. At each of these contact&#xD;
      points, satisfaction with timing of placement, and satisfaction with contraceptive method&#xD;
      will be assessed via a Likert scale. Additional contact will be made at 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months for all subjects to assess continuation of the contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If unable to contact the subject or listed emergency contacts a total of five times by their&#xD;
      preferred or alternate modalities of contact, a letter will be sent along with a&#xD;
      self-addressed stamped envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes (Indicate anticipated primary and any secondary outcomes and how they will be&#xD;
      measured):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives are to assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject satisfaction with timing of placement as determined by questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continuation of contraceptive method at 3, 6, 9, and 12 month as determined by&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study objectives are to assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total days of bleeding after the abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up rate for evaluation of completion of medication abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Failure rate of medication abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of women screened for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reasons for refusal to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Reasons for ineligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The number of women who change their contraceptive method during the year of follow-up.&#xD;
