  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major purpose of this study is to determine whether psychotherapeutic contacts for&#xD;
      surgical patients with psychological distress are an effective treatment during the&#xD;
      postoperative period to improve the rate of treatment participation in subsequent&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      contacts that aim at motivating and supporting surgical patients with psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      in participating in subsequent psychosocial treatment options like psycho- and addiction&#xD;
      therapy (RCT). The secondary objective is to investigate whether preoperatively assessed&#xD;
      psychosocial factors are associated with surgical outcomes (preoperative computer-assisted&#xD;
      self assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology (BRIA) has been designed as a feasible treatment&#xD;
      option to reach patients from all surgical fields. Implemented in the preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesiological assessment clinic this therapy program comprises two major elements: (1) A&#xD;
      computer assisted self assessment of social, lifestyle and psychological factors including a&#xD;
      comprehensive battery of psychiatric screening tests; (2) Psychotherapeutic contacts with the&#xD;
      objective to motivate patients with psychiatric disorders and support them in participating&#xD;
      in subsequent psychosocial treatment programs. The self assessment will be offered to all&#xD;
      adult surgical patients of the preoperative anesthesiological assessment clinic during&#xD;
      inclusion period (current 5104 patients). Data on surgical outcomes will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively during a 6-month-follow-up, and regression analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the extent of associations between psychosocial factors and outcomes. Patients with&#xD;
      clinically relevant psychological distress (i.e. scoring above the cut-off of one of applied&#xD;
      standardized screening questionnaires) will be offered to participate in the RCT on the&#xD;
      psychotherapy part of BRIA (220 patients). Data on primary and secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected 6 months and 24 months, respectively, after baseline assessment.&#xD;
