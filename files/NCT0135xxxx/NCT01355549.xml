  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is common in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). It is most often caused by&#xD;
      overuse injuries to the muscles and tendons that can occur during wheelchair propulsion,&#xD;
      transfers, and other activities of daily living. Normally, shoulder pain resolves with&#xD;
      conservative treatments such non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen,&#xD;
      naproxen, etc.) and physical therapy. However, when these treatments fail, shoulder surgery&#xD;
      may be the only option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Plasma therapy, or PRP, is a treatment option for non-healing muscle and tendon&#xD;
      injuries such as those that cause shoulder pain in persons with SCI. Using one's own blood,&#xD;
      cells within the blood called &quot;platelets&quot; are concentrated and then re-injected into the&#xD;
      muscle and tendon of the shoulder. These platelets release substances known as &quot;growth&#xD;
      factors&quot; that lead to tissue healing. By concentrating the platelets we increase the growth&#xD;
      factors up to eight times which will promote the healing of tendons. PRP therapy has shown&#xD;
      promise in treating tendon and muscle injuries in able-bodied persons; however, its&#xD;
      effectiveness in persons with SCI is unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, and efficacy of PRP therapy for chronic shoulder pain in persons with&#xD;
      SCI. The human body has a remarkable ability to heal itself and we hypothesize that&#xD;
      re-injecting concentrated platelets will facilitate the natural healing process and will&#xD;
      reduce shoulder pain in persons with SCI.&#xD;

    <description>Shoulder pain intensity will also be assessed weekly using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Subjects will be asked to rate their average pain, most severe pain, and least severe pain during the past week using an 11-point scale (i.e. 0-10) anchored at the ends by &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; An 11-point NRS measure of pain intensity allows for comparison across clinical trials of chronic pain treatment and is recommended as a core outcome measure for chronic pain clinical trials.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The WUSPI is a 15-item self-report instrument that measures shoulder pain intensity in wheelchair users during various ADLs, such as transfers, loading a wheelchair into a car, wheelchair mobility, dressing, bathing, overhead lifting, driving, performing household chores, and sleeping. Each item is scored using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS) which is anchored at the ends with &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; Individual item scores are summed to arrive at a total index score, which ranges from 0 to 150.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to rate on a 7-point scale overall impression following treatment as compared to the previous measurement interval. The 7-point PGIC scale (anchored by &quot;very much improved&quot; and &quot;very much worse&quot;) is used to measure global treatment effect.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory interference items (BPI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was developed by Cleeland, and has been used in a number of investigations of chronic pain. Its pain interference subscale has been used in several investigations of pain in SCI. In its original version the subscale (BPI-I7) consisted of 7 items measuring interference with general activity, sleep, mood, relationships, etc.). For uses with an SCI sample, in item 3 of BPI-I7, ''walking ability'' is replaced by &quot;ability to get around.&quot;</description>
