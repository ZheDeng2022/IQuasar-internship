  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has three parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ASP9521. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and tolerability and initial&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of ASP9521. Part 3 of the study will be a Food Effect study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first study part is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ASP9521&#xD;
      in patients with Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer. This will be done at different doses,&#xD;
      starting at the lowest dose up to higher doses to find the maximum dose that is tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will investigate the safety and tolerability and evaluate initial anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of ASP9521. This will be done at multiple doses which are identified in part 1 to&#xD;
      potentially be effective. The number of patients in part 2 will be higher number compared to&#xD;
      part I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third part of the study will investigate the effect of food on the drug in patients; this&#xD;
      will be a crossover design fed to fasted and vice versa.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine&#xD;
             differentiation or small cell features&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease documented by 2 or more bone lesions on bone scan or by soft tissue&#xD;
             disease observed by Computed tomography/Magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing androgen deprivation with Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)&#xD;
             agonist/antagonist therapy or bilateral orchiectomy. For patients who have not had an&#xD;
             orchiectomy, there must be a plan to maintain effective LHRH agonist/antagonist&#xD;
             therapy for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum testosterone &lt;1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving bisphosphonates or other approved bone targeting therapy must have&#xD;
             been on stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following 3 criteria&#xD;
             occurring in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA&#xD;
                  levels with an interval of &gt;1 week between each determination. The PSA value at&#xD;
                  screening should be &gt;2 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Soft tissue disease progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
                  Tumors (RECIST). Measurable disease is not required for entry. Lymph nodes &gt;20 mm&#xD;
                  are considered measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone disease progression defined by at least 2 new lesions on bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt;6 months according to the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Bicalutamide or nilutamide within 6 weeks prior to screening&#xD;

             metastases within 4 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected intracerebral disease or brain metastasis&#xD;

          -  Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to treatment allocation or a&#xD;
             period required by local regulation, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use, or participation in a clinical study, of an investigational agent that&#xD;
             blocks androgen synthesis or targets the androgen receptor&#xD;
