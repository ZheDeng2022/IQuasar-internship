    <textblock>
      This is a two-year double blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial, which is&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the effects of Chinese medical treatment on leucopenia after chemotherapy&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the Department of Breast Surgery in China Medical University&#xD;
      Hospital, Taichung. One hundred newly diagnosed breast cancer patient (age ≧18, Stage I, II,&#xD;
      IIIa) will be included. After the diagnosis, the patients will undergo operation. Then, each&#xD;
      patient will receive one of the following protocol of chemotherapy according to her pathology&#xD;
      report and overall evaluation: &quot;FEC*6&quot;, &quot;FEC*4+Taxotere*4&quot;, and &quot;FEC*3+Taxotere*3&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participator will start to take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 after her receiving&#xD;
      first time of chemotherapy until she receives the next cycle.(While receiving &quot;FEC&quot;, it will&#xD;
      be 3 weeks. While receiving &quot;Taxotere&quot;, it will be 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just before receiving the next cycle of chemotherapy, the blood of the participator will be&#xD;
      sampled to check her CBC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr and tumor maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also adopt the body constitution questionnaire (BCQ) to evaluate the&#xD;
      Chinese medical constitutional status, the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23, and Karnofsky score&#xD;
      to evaluate the quality of life, and to evaluate the adverse effects of the adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy with the NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participator will take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 from her first chemotherapy till&#xD;
      3 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Over all, it will take about 18 weeks (FEC*6)&#xD;
      to 28 weeks (FEC*4+Taxotere*4) to complete the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate the influence of the chemotherapy on the Chinese medical&#xD;
      constitutional status, and in order to provide the basis for the complementary treatment for&#xD;
      the breast cancer by adjusting and balancing the constitutional status of the patients.&#xD;

If the participator receives the protocol &quot;FEC*6&quot;, her WBC will be checked every 3 weeks for 7 times. It will takes 21 weeks to get the values of WBC at 7 different time point.
