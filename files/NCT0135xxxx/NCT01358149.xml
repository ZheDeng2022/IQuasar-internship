    <textblock>
      Today, there is an important lack of knowledge on child metabolism and the effects of&#xD;
      phytochemical-rich foods, which includes fruits and vegetables and plant-derived foods. Here,&#xD;
      the investigators will monitor the metabolism of children using minimally invasive techniques&#xD;
      at rest, and with physical/mental activities and assess the changes associated with the&#xD;
      intake of cocoa-based food.&#xD;
