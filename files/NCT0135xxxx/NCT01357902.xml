  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an open-label, randomised, single dose, two-sequence cross-over study. Twenty-four&#xD;
      eligible, healthy, Chinese male subjects will be enrolled after providing written informed&#xD;
      consent. Subjects will be randomised into two treatment groups 1 day prior to the first&#xD;
      dosing day and will be assigned to regimen sequences (AB or BA) in a balanced fashion in&#xD;
      accordance with the randomisation schedule. Regimen A is five lamotrigine 5 mg&#xD;
      chewable/dispersible tablets and Regimen B is one lamotrigine 25 mg standard/compressed&#xD;
      tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive their allocated regimen on the morning of Day 1 and will undergo study&#xD;
      assessments for 7 days (until Day 8). Subjects will receive their alternate randomised&#xD;
      treatment after a washout period of 14-21 days from Day 1. Subjects will undergo a further&#xD;
      assessment period of 7 days and will attend a follow-up visit during 8-12 days after the&#xD;
      second treatment. The total observation period in this study will be 23~34 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive at the research unit on the evening before each lamotrigine dosing&#xD;
      occasion and will remain in the unit until the 24-h post-dose evaluations have been completed&#xD;
      (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h). After this, subjects will return&#xD;
      home but must return to the unit for further assessments to be made at 36, 48, 72, 96, 120,&#xD;
      144 and 168 h after dosing Study Endpoints/Assessments A total of 19 serial blood samples (5&#xD;
      mL each) will be collected for the measurement of plasma lamotrigine concentrations at each&#xD;
      study assessment. Safety and tolerability assessments (monitoring of adverse events and&#xD;
      serious adverse events, routine laboratory determinations, vital sign measurements and&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram) will be conducted throughout the study.&#xD;
