      Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was previously the standard axillary staging procedure&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients. However, ALND is accompanied by a considerable morbidity, and&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) evolved as a mean to decrease this morbidity. Between&#xD;
      September 2000 and January 2004 breast cancer patients were included in the Swedish Sentinel&#xD;
      Node Multicenter Cohort Study with the intent of studying axillary recurrence after negative&#xD;
      SLNB for patients in which completion ALND were omitted. The patients were followed&#xD;
      prospectively and events (local, regional and distant recurrences and deaths) were&#xD;
      registered. The primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were&#xD;
      disease-free, cancer-specific and overall survival.&#xD;

      Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was previously the standard axillary staging procedure&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients. However, ALND is accompanied by a considerable morbidity,&#xD;
      including seroma formation, lymphedema, neuropathy of the arm with numbness, stiffness,&#xD;
      impaired shoulder movement and pain. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has evolved as a mean&#xD;
      to decrease this morbidity, and validation studies have demonstrated the accuracy of the&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the intent of studying axillary recurrence after negative SLNB for patients in which&#xD;
      completion ALND were omitted, consecutive breast cancer patients were included in the Swedish&#xD;
      Sentinel Node Multicenter Cohort Study between September 2000 and January 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a unifocal, invasive breast cancer less than 3 cm in diameter were eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment. Exclusion criteria were palpable regional lymph nodes, neoadjuvant chemo- or&#xD;
      radiotherapy, pregnancy, known allergic reactions to blue dye or isotope, previous surgery in&#xD;
      the ipsilateral breast, and preoperatively diagnosed tumor multifocality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the preoperative injection of 40-60 mBq Technetium-99 nanocolloid (Solco Nanocoll®) and&#xD;
      1 ml blue dye (Patent Blue V®), sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was performed. If no&#xD;
      sentinel node could be identified, ALND of levels I and II was performed. A completion ALND&#xD;
      was also performed in the event of a positive SLN biopsy, if lymph nodes clearly suspicious&#xD;
      of metastasis were detected during surgery, or if the primary tumor in the breast was found&#xD;
      to be multifocal on pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen sections were obtained from each SLN and examined peroperatively. If a sentinel lymph&#xD;
      node was smaller than 4 mm, two sections were analyzed separately. Nodes larger than 4 mm&#xD;
      were bisected, and two sections from each half analyzed. According to the study protocol, at&#xD;
      least three sections were prepared from the sentinel node or each part of a bisected node for&#xD;
      definitive histopathology. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). If no&#xD;
      cancer cells were detected, immunohistochemistry (IHC) with cytokeratin antibodies was also&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-sentinel lymph nodes were examined by routine staining (HE) according to the protocol of&#xD;
      each pathology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant treatment combinations were given according to national and regional treatment&#xD;
      guidelines, based on tumor characteristics, lymph node status, and surgical treatment.&#xD;
      Patients with isolated tumor cells were regarded as lymph node-negative. If breast-conserving&#xD;
      surgery had been performed, radiation therapy to the breast was given, which was extended to&#xD;
      include the regional lymph nodes in case of axillary lymph node metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy was offered to all patients with lymph node metastases or those with a&#xD;
      combination of unfavorable primary tumor characteristics (large tumor, high Elston score,&#xD;
      progesterone receptor negativity), after consideration of their general health. Endocrine&#xD;
      therapy was offered to all patients with estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive tumors&#xD;
      larger than 10 mm. The actual reported adjuvant treatment is controlled for in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed prospectively. The research protocol postulated an annual follow-up&#xD;
      with mammography and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, data sheets, including information on primary tumor characteristics, number&#xD;
      of sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes with and without metastasis, and given adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, were computerized. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Karolinska&#xD;
      Institutet, Stockholm, and each region's local ethics committee. All patients gave written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
