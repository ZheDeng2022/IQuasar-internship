  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesothelioma is a relatively rare cancer which is becoming more common. It can affect one of&#xD;
      two areas; the pleura (the lining of the lung) or the peritoneum (the lining of the abdomen).&#xD;
      Cancer affecting the pleura is the more common of these and is called Pleural Mesothelioma.&#xD;
      This is most commonly caused by exposure to asbestos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately mesothelioma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and so treatment is&#xD;
      based around controlling the disease and managing the symptoms, rather than curing the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma is a combination of two&#xD;
      anticancer drugs; Pemetrexed and Cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will look into whether there are benefits of adding a third drug called Vorinostat&#xD;
      to the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesothelioma is a rapidly lethal cancer which is increasing in incidence year on year. A&#xD;
      projected doubling of cases has been predicted within the next two decades in Europe and the&#xD;
      disease is usually diagnosed only after it has become advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As yet the standard treatment for advanced mesothelioma, chemotherapy (cytotoxic drugs), is&#xD;
      only for disease control and symptom management. A Phase I study of a drug called Vorinostat&#xD;
      recently looked in to its effect, when given with standard cytotoxic drugs, on advanced solid&#xD;
      tumours. The data for this study showed that this treatment caused a response in the tumours&#xD;
      of patients with mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of first-line vorinostat when used&#xD;
      concurrently with cisplatin/pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed trial, we will initially conduct an initial run-in phase I study, to find the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose, before embarking on the randomised phase II trial. The study is&#xD;
      therefore in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I study: to find the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in this patient group. Both&#xD;
      safety (ie the observed number of Dose Limiting Toxicities per cohort and the overall&#xD;
      toxicity profile) and the number of chemotherapy cycles administered will be used to&#xD;
      determine the final dose of vorinostat to be used in the subsequent phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised Phase II study: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vorinostat (using the dose&#xD;
      from the phase I study) versus placebo in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed. The&#xD;
      Phase II study will use a placebo and double-blinding to ensure that neither the patient nor&#xD;
      the research team are aware of the allocated treatment, which should allow for accurate&#xD;
      comparison of the two treatment arms and reduce the potential for researcher bias. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to the two treatment arms.&#xD;
