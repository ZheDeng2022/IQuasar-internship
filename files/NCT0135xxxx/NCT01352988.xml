    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of fumaric acid esters&#xD;
      (Fumaderm®) in the treatment of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus with respect to proportion of&#xD;
      responders based on the Revised Cutaneous Lupus Disease Area and Severity Index (RCLASI)&#xD;
      activity score for skin lesions at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment or at the latest&#xD;
      assessment for patients who withdrew prematurely (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF).&#xD;

      At screening, patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent. Male patients and female patients without childbearing potential&#xD;
      will also complete other screening procedures including vital signs, physical examination,&#xD;
      and patients and physicians efficacy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be started as soon as possible after screening and not later than 1 month&#xD;
      after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive a treatment either with Fumaderm® initial and/or Fumaderm®&#xD;
      enteric-coated tablets. Fumaderm® initial will be usually administered during the first three&#xD;
      weeks of treatment and / or during the trial when adaptation of the daily dosage will be&#xD;
      required due to the occurrence of adverse reactions, e.g gastrointestinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the trial, daily use of sunscreens (sun protection factor, SPF≥50) will be&#xD;
      recommended to all patients. The management of CLE may also involve the use of topical&#xD;
      medications, such as topical steroids, or systemic rescue medications, such as antimalarials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated with the RCLASI, PAGI and VAS after 12 weeks and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. Adverse Events (AE) will be recorded at each visit until 4 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      therapy. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) must be reported if they occur up to 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      end of therapy.&#xD;
