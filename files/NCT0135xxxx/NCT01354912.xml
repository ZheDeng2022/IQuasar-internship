  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms in the environment and are now&#xD;
      increasingly being recognized as significant causes of chronic pulmonary infection in&#xD;
      immunocompetent individuals (1). The most frequently encountered NTM lung disease worldwide&#xD;
      is caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC) (2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several studies with chest computed tomography (CT), researchers have demonstrated that&#xD;
      the presence of bilateral multifocal bronchiolitis (well-defined small nodules and branching&#xD;
      centrilobular nodules, or tree-in-bud pattern) and bronchiectasis distributed mainly in the&#xD;
      right middle lobe and lingular segment are indicative of NTM pulmonary infection (7-11).&#xD;
      Accordingly, it is believed that radiologic findings of bilateral bronchiolitis and&#xD;
      bronchiectasis on chest CT scans specifically suggest NTM pulmonary infection (1). These CT&#xD;
      findings, however, may not be specific for NTM pulmonary infection. CT patterns of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis in the pulmonary infections caused by various NTM organisms&#xD;
      have been reported, and these organisms include Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium xenopi,&#xD;
      and rapidly growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium fortuitum,&#xD;
      and Mycobacterium chelonae (12-14). In addition, not all patients with bronchiectasis and&#xD;
      bronchiolitis have NTM pulmonary infection. Two recent studies showed that only about 50% of&#xD;
      patients with such CT features have MAC pulmonary infection (9,15). To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, however, there is no report about the incidence of NTM in patients with&#xD;
      bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis in countries with low incidence of TB. Thus, the purpose of&#xD;
      our study was to determine the frequency of NTM pulmonary infection in patients with&#xD;
      bilateral bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis at chest CT and to investigate whether these CT&#xD;
      findings are specifically indicative of MAC infection or other specific pathogen.&#xD;

      Study Population During the study period helical thin-section thoracic CT scans will obtained&#xD;
      in patients in whom a diagnosis of bronchiectasis was known or who were suspected of having&#xD;
      bronchiectasis on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs of a chronic cough and sputum&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One chest radiologist will review consecutive patients with bilateral multifocal&#xD;
      bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis (well-defined small nodules and branching centrilobular&#xD;
      nodules), regardless of the presence of cavitary lesions, who were suspected of having NTM&#xD;
      pulmonary infection on the basis of these chest CT findings. Those patients with unilateral&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, although the bronchiectasis was combined with bronchiolitis, will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Those with isolated findings of bilateral bronchiectasis or bilateral&#xD;
      bronchiolitis will also also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo a diagnostic work-up for NTM pulmonary infection. For a diagnosis&#xD;
      of NTM infection, sputum AFB (Ziehl-Neelsen method) staining and culture examinations for&#xD;
      mycobacteria will be performed at least three times. Bronchoscopy also will be performed for&#xD;
      bronchial washing or transbronchial lung biopsy in patients with no sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation and Identification of Mycobacteria Expectorated sputum and samples that will be&#xD;
      obtained with bronchoscopy will be examined after AFB staining and will be cultured for&#xD;
      mycobacteria. Colony numbers will be counted after incubation for as long as 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates will be identified (Gen-Probe Amplified Mycobacterium&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Direct Test; Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif), and NTM species identification will&#xD;
      be confirmed by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism&#xD;
      method based on the rpoB gene (16). In all cases, sputum examinations and bronchoscopic&#xD;
      samples will be obtained within 6 months after CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria The diagnosis of definite NTM pulmonary infection will be determined when&#xD;
      patients fulfilled the 1997 American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria, which include&#xD;
      clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic criteria (1). Probable NTM pulmonary infection will&#xD;
      be diagnosed if the patients will be satisfied the clinical and radiologic criteria of the&#xD;
      1997 American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria but will not fully satisfy the&#xD;
      microbiologic criteria. Namely, the patients either will have only one or two cultures&#xD;
      positive for organisms specifically identified as NTM with smear results negative for AFB or&#xD;
      had more than three cultures positive for NTM without precise species identification; in&#xD;
      addition, the patients will have symptoms and radiologic evidence of disease, which consisted&#xD;
      of bilateral bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis will be&#xD;
      made when patients will have a culture positive for M tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical diagnostic criteria for diffuse panbronchiolitis will be as follows (17): (a)&#xD;
      symptoms-chronic cough, sputum, and dyspnea on exertion; (b) physical signs-crackles and&#xD;
      rhonchi; (c) chest radiographs-diffusely disseminated fine nodular opacities, mainly in the&#xD;
      lower zones of the lung, with hyperinflation of the lungs; (d) lung function studies, with at&#xD;
      least three of the following four abnormalities-forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less&#xD;
      than 70%, vital capacity of less than 80% of the predicted value, residual volume of more&#xD;
      than 150% of the predicted value, and partial pressure of oxygen (arterial) of less than 80&#xD;
      mm Hg. When no definite cause will be identified after evaluation of the causative factors,&#xD;
      patients will received a diagnosis of bronchiectasis or nonspecific bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart Review The medical records of all patients will be reviewed by one of the authors for&#xD;
      the following information, if available: height, body weight, history of tobacco use, history&#xD;
      of previous antituberculous treatment, results of AFB staining, isolation and identification&#xD;
      of mycobacteria, and the number of NTM-positive isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Evaluation Chest radiologists will retrospectively evaluate the chest CT scans. The&#xD;
      observer will be unaware of the microbiologic test results and final diagnoses;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of six lung lobes in each patient (the lingular segment will be considered a separate&#xD;
      lobe) will be assessed for the presence of lung lesions and other abnormal findings. Each&#xD;
      lobe in the lungs will be evaluated with regard to the presence or absence of bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      well-defined small nodules (&lt;10 mm in diameter), and branching centrilobular nodules (ie,&#xD;
      tree-in-bud pattern). Bronchiolitis will be defined as the presence of well-defined small&#xD;
      nodules and branching centrilobular nodules on chest CT scans. The extents of involvement of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis will be estimated by counting the number of involved lobes.&#xD;
      The presence of other abnormalities, including nodules (10-30 mm in diameter), lobular&#xD;
      consolidation (consolidation of 10-20 mm in diameter with a polygonal shape), segmental&#xD;
      consolidation, cavities, and volume reduction, will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between Patients with NTM Disease and Patients with Non-NTM Disease After&#xD;
      classification of patients according to the previously mentioned diagnostic criteria, the&#xD;
      patients will be categorized into two groups: the NTM pulmonary infection group, including&#xD;
      the patients with definite or probable NTM pulmonary infection, and the non-NTM pulmonary&#xD;
      infection group. Comparisons of the clinical and chest CT findings in patients with NTM&#xD;
      diseases with those in patients with other airway diseases will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. By stratifying&#xD;
      the age distribution of included patients according to birth sex and decades of patients'&#xD;
      ages, the investigators will be tested whether there will be statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between the distributions by using the χ2 test. All continuous variables will be&#xD;
      tested for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and all had a Gaussian distribution.&#xD;
      To statistically evaluate differences in continuous variables between the two groups, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the unpaired t test. Frequencies will be analyzed by using the χ2 test&#xD;
      or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. A difference with a P value of less than .05 will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant. Statistical software (SPSS 11.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill)&#xD;
      will be used throughout.&#xD;
