    <textblock>
      Because the artemisinins are the most potent antimalarial drugs, the reduction in parasite&#xD;
      numbers is rapid. Therefore, early measures of reducing parasite counts are needed. This&#xD;
      study will look at conventional markers of parasite reduction e.g. parasite clearance time,&#xD;
      parasite reduction ratio, and the time to achieve a fall of 50%, 90% and 99% of the&#xD;
      pre-treatment parasitaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining artemisinin resistance requires the use of artesunate (AS) alone because it is now&#xD;
      appreciated that the partner drug in a combination treatment has a significant impact on the&#xD;
      rate of parasite clearance. This study will dose patients for 3 days with AS alone (or longer&#xD;
      until parasites clear) and measure the parasite count frequently in order to be able to&#xD;
      define an accurate regression line of a graph of the natural logarithm of the parasite count&#xD;
      (Y axis) versus time (X axis). This will be followed by a full course of an artemisinin&#xD;
      combination therapy (ACT). Two different dose regimens of artesunate will be compared at all&#xD;
      sites except those in western Cambodia, as unpublished observations from the Thai-Myanmar&#xD;
      border suggest the standard lower daily dose of 2mg/kg may enable the earlier detection of&#xD;
      low level resistance than a 4mg/kg daily dose.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artemisinins are the cornerstone of current antimalarial treatment. Evidence of reduced&#xD;
      susceptibility to artemisinins in Western Cambodia was first presented in January 2007 and&#xD;
      confirmed in a subsequent detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study conducted by our&#xD;
      group. Artemisinin resistance was manifest by a marked slowing of parasite clearance. The&#xD;
      spread of highly artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria would have devastating consequences&#xD;
      for malaria control and elimination. The response to artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum&#xD;
      depends critically upon answering one pivotal question: how far has it spread? This research&#xD;
      proposal focuses on filling critical gaps in knowledge that are essential to planning an&#xD;
      effective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Hypothesis/Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre study with the primary objective of comparing the P. falciparum&#xD;
      parasite clearance compared to a reference parasite clearance rate obtained from historical&#xD;
      data in artemisinin sensitive falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this large scale study is to determine if artemisinin resistance has spread and if&#xD;
      so, how far it has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, open-label randomised trial to assess the clearance rates of&#xD;
      peripheral blood P. falciparum parasitaemias in patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum&#xD;
      malaria treated with two different doses of artesunate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The total&#xD;
      number of patients for this study is expected to be 1800.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AS2: Artesunate 2 mg/kg/day for 3 days OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AS4: Artesunate 4 mg/kg/day for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  followed by a full course of Artesunate- mefloquine (MAS3) Patients will be hospitalised&#xD;
           for at least the 1st three days. During hospitalisation, patients will have malaria&#xD;
           parasite count done at 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, then every 6 hours until parasite clearance. The&#xD;
           weekly follow up is until day 14 (on Day 7 and Day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Value and significance of the research The study aims to address a simple but crucial&#xD;
      question regarding artemisinin resistance for which currently there is no answer: has&#xD;
      artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum spread from Western Cambodia? The results will&#xD;
      determine how to approach the subsequent efforts; strengthening of strategies for eliminating&#xD;
      the resistant parasites in Western Cambodia if the resistance is confined to this area, or&#xD;
      for containment and malaria control if the resistant parasites have already spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential outcomes Within one year we expect to produce a map of the geographical extent,&#xD;
      prevalence and severity of artemisinin resistance.&#xD;
