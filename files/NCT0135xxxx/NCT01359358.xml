      This project has as general objective to determine if there is any Methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain disseminating in the hospital of Belo Horizonte. If this&#xD;
      is the case, the investigators will determine if this is an international known strain by&#xD;
      typing it by PFGE and MLST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of mecA gene will be performed by PCR. Their susceptibility profile to several&#xD;
      drugs will also be accessed and it will be possible to compare the response to those drugs&#xD;
      commonly in use to that of Daptomycin, a new drug available in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be screened for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin by Macromethod Etest (MET) in&#xD;
      order to search for VISA or hetero-VISA. Also, due to the discussions at the literature about&#xD;
      mutations in genes that are said to be responsible for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin,&#xD;
      the investigators will sequence these genes in all PFGE type strain of this study looking for&#xD;
      mutations already described to compare to the screening results.&#xD;

      Multidrug resistant and virulent MRSA strains have been disseminating worldwide and few&#xD;
      alternatives of treatment for diseases caused by this pathogen are available. In this study,&#xD;
      36 isolates from colonization or different clinical specimens from infected patients of the&#xD;
      Hospital Rizoleta Tolentino Neves will be analyzed. These results will provide important data&#xD;
      for doctors and nurses, such as whether there is any strain dissemination or not in the&#xD;
      hospital what could suggest an outbreak. It will be performed molecular typing by pulsed&#xD;
      field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficiency of several antimicrobials and the frequency of h-VISA and VISA&#xD;
      among the Brazilian MRSA. Besides, the investigators will verify the presence of mutation in&#xD;
      genes that are involved in resistance mechanisms of VISA. According to the strains profile&#xD;
      present in the hospital, if this is suggested that there is a dissemination of some strain,&#xD;
      the health professionals can start a more rigid infection control measures in order to&#xD;
      decrease the number of cases of nosocomial infection, decreasing the time of hospitalization&#xD;
      of patients and, consequently the cost for the hospital.&#xD;
