  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, dose escalation study&#xD;
      of anti-botulinum toxin monoclonal antibodies in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      hospitalized in the Johns Hopkins Phase 1 unit during the infusion and until after the&#xD;
      24-hour blood draw. Three escalating dose cohorts of a combination of three anti-botulinum&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies will be evaluated. Each cohort will consist of eight volunteers in&#xD;
      which they will receive a single intravenous infusion of active drug or placebo. Placebo will&#xD;
      be normal saline. Volunteers will be followed for safety for up to 120 days after infusion&#xD;
      depending on dose cohort.&#xD;
