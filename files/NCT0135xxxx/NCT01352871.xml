    <textblock>
      The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Ideally,&#xD;
      the inflammatory response is tightly regulated leading to both adequate protection to&#xD;
      invading pathogens as well as limitation of an exuberant or unwanted immune response such as&#xD;
      seen in sepsis or auto-immune diseases. It has become increasingly clear that the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system (ANS) and the innate immune response are intimately linked. Activation of the&#xD;
      sympathetic division of ANS dampens inflammation via β2-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, in&#xD;
      some cases, sympathetic drive can also stimulate the inflammatory response via&#xD;
      α2-adrenoceptors. The parasympathetic branch of the ANS modulates the inflammatory response&#xD;
      as well, since it was discovered that electrical stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve in&#xD;
      rats greatly inhibits the innate immune response. Generally, the ANS is regarded as pure&#xD;
      autonomic which can not be influenced by behavior. However, trough special&#xD;
      concentration/mediation techniques mastered by certain individuals, it might be possible to&#xD;
      modulate ANS activity. In addition, recent unpublished findings indicate that these&#xD;
      concentration/meditation techniques can also influence the inflammatory response ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators wish to investigate the effect of concentration/meditation on&#xD;
      the innate immune response in vivo. In addition the investigators wish to elucidate the&#xD;
      mechanism via which this effect is mediated. The investigators aim to use the so called human&#xD;
      endotoxemia model. This model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a&#xD;
      gram negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential&#xD;
      novel therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      concentration/meditation on the innate immune response induced by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effects of concentration/meditation on ANS activity.&#xD;
           Electroencephalography (EEG), heart-rate variability (HRV), muscle sympathetic nerve&#xD;
           activity and plasma concentrations of catecholamines will be measured for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if concentration/meditation can attenuate (subclinical) renal damage known&#xD;
           to occur during human endotoxemia, markers of proximal and distal tubular damage will be&#xD;
           measured at various time points.&#xD;
