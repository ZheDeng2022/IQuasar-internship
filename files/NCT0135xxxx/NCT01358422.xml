      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the absolute risk reduction for in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE)&#xD;
           associated with the use of dual anti-platelet therapy as compared with aspirin alone in&#xD;
           this population?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the absolute risk increase for clinically significant bleeding during the same&#xD;
           period associated with the use of dual anti-platelet therapy as compared with aspirin&#xD;
           alone in this population?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief the design of the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will study patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery within four years of coronary&#xD;
           stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will record the anti-platelet agents taken by patients before, during and after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will record cardiac and bleeding events that occur whilst the patient is in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will use the statistical technique of propensity scoring to match patients who have&#xD;
           similar risk factors and who received different anti-platelet regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will compare the incidence of cardiac events and bleeding in the matched groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will compare the use of aspirin alone with dual antiplatelet therapy (i.e. aspirin&#xD;
      and clopidogrel) in patients presenting for elective non-cardiac surgery who have undergone&#xD;
      PCI with either bare metal stent or drug eluting stent placement in the four years prior to&#xD;
      surgery. The absolute risk reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy and the absolute risk increase for clinically significant bleeding&#xD;
      events with dual therapy will be determined. This will allow the number needed to treat (NNT)&#xD;
      for the prevention of MACE and the number needed to harm (NNH) for bleeding to be determined&#xD;
      and the optimal antiplatelet therapy in this setting to be identified.&#xD;

    <description>This study will record and analyse in-hospital adverse cardiac events. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) will be defined as a composite of:&#xD;
Myocardial infarction as defined by the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction(including cardiac arrest and cardiac death as described in this definition).&#xD;
PCI for a cardiac event occurring following surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>In-hospital stay up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This study will record and analyse in-hospital clinically significant bleeding.&#xD;
Clinically Significant Bleeding Events will be defined as:&#xD;
Reoperation for bleeding.&#xD;
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage&#xD;
Intracranial haemorrhage&#xD;
Spinal/epidural haematoma. The transfusion of blood and blood products will also be recorded and compared between patients on dual antiplatelet therapy and aspirin alone.</description>
