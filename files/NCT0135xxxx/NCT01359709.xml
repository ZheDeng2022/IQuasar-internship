  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is an important public health concern, and it is most often initiated in&#xD;
      adolescence. Despite substantial research on smoking cessation in adults, however, relatively&#xD;
      little effort has focused on therapeutic approaches to reduce adolescent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions, such as contingency management (CM), and pharmacotherapies, such as&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), each have some efficacy in reducing adolescent smoking,&#xD;
      and in adults, combination of behavioral and pharmacological approaches is more effective in&#xD;
      reducing smoking than either one alone. Little is known about combining these therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches in adolescent smokers, and research in this area has been hindered, in part, by&#xD;
      the expense and complexity of large-scale clinical trials of the combined treatments and the&#xD;
      relative dearth of a cost-effective laboratory procedure. Developing and validating a&#xD;
      laboratory model to evaluate the combined effects of CM and pharmacological adjuncts for&#xD;
      adolescent smoking is important because such studies can be conducted more rapidly and&#xD;
      efficiently, and could provide information on the optimal conditions (e.g., dose) under which&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies might augment the positive effects of CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,&#xD;
      between-groups, 2-week laboratory study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      following four groups: CM+nicotine patches, CM+placebo patches, noncontingent control&#xD;
      (NC)+nicotine patches and NC+placebo patches. Fifteen participants will be enrolled in each&#xD;
      of the four groups, totaling 60 participants. On day 1, participants will arrive to the&#xD;
      laboratory for a 1-h session. During this session, breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, saliva&#xD;
      or urinary cotinine levels will be evaluated. Participants will also complete questionnaires&#xD;
      on craving, withdrawal and cigarette dependence. Participants will then receive seven&#xD;
      patches, to wear for seven days, one patch daily. Five sessions during the days 8 to 12 will&#xD;
      serve as CM or noncontingent sessions, and participants will continue wearing patch daily. On&#xD;
      these sessions, breath CO levels will be evaluated, and participants will have opportunity to&#xD;
      receive payments based on their CO levels, according to the group assignment. If successful,&#xD;
      the proposed study will provide a human laboratory model for use in studies of the combined&#xD;
      CM and pharmacological approaches for modifying adolescent smoking behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence typically emerges during adolescence. As almost 90% of adult smokers&#xD;
      begin during adolescence (Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, 2008), it is critical to develop&#xD;
      effective treatments for reducing smoking in adolescents. Despite substantial research in&#xD;
      adults, relatively little effort has focused on treatments to reduce adolescent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for adolescent smoking can be broadly categorized into behavioral&#xD;
      and pharmacological approaches. Behavioral treatments, such contingency management, reduce&#xD;
      adolescent smoking significantly more than control conditions (Grim Shaw and Stanton, 2006;&#xD;
      Sussman et al., 2006). Notably, pharmacotherapies, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)&#xD;
      are also safe and efficacious in reducing smoking in adolescents (Upadhyaya et al., 2004;&#xD;
      Killen et al., 2004; Hurt et al., 2000; Smith et al., 1996). However, there is limited&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the combination of behavioral interventions with pharmacotherapies for&#xD;
      reducing adolescent smoking (Hanson et al., 2003; Mollohan et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of behavioral and pharmacological treatments are more efficacious and&#xD;
      cost-effective in reducing smoking in adults than either approach alone (Roving et al., 2009;&#xD;
      Reus and Smith, 2008; see review in Ingersoll &amp; Cohen's, 2005). For example, combined&#xD;
      treatment with nicotine patches and an &quot;Progressive-Reinforcement Reset&quot; contingency&#xD;
      management (CM) paradigm (smokers received escalating monetary rewards according to duration&#xD;
      of abstinence) increased abstinence from smoking significantly more than nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy alone in adults (Shoptaw et al., 2002). Such combination therapy could also be more&#xD;
      effective in reducing adolescent smoking than individual treatments. Research efforts in this&#xD;
      regard have been hindered, in part, by the expense and complexity of outpatient trials and&#xD;
      the relative dearth of a less expensive laboratory procedure assessing adolescent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing and validating a laboratory procedure to evaluate the combined effects of CM and&#xD;
      pharmacological adjuncts for adolescent smoking is important because human laboratory studies&#xD;
      can be conducted more rapidly and efficiently than clinical trials. Randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trials tend to be costly, lengthy and labor-intensive, and should&#xD;
      be reserved for only the most promising medications that show at least some level of efficacy&#xD;
      in enhancing CM effectiveness in controlled laboratory conditions. Laboratory studies using&#xD;
      adolescent smokers might also identify the optimal conditions (e.g., dose, duration of&#xD;
      treatment) under which pharmacotherapies might be expected to be synergistic with CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal has one specific aim: to evaluate combined effects of CM and NRT treatments for&#xD;
      assessing smoking in adolescents. Such a laboratory paradigm could be useful in evaluating&#xD;
      potential pharmacotherapies in augmenting the effects of CM in adolescent smokers. We propose&#xD;
      to conduct a proof-of-concept study in which 60 adolescent smokers (ages 13-21) will&#xD;
      participate in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-groups, 2-week&#xD;
      laboratory study. After intake screening, eligible adolescent smokers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the following four groups: CM+nicotine patches, CM+placebo patches,&#xD;
      noncontingent control (NC)+nicotine patches and NC+placebo patches. Fifteen participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled in each of the four groups, totaling 60 participants. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to wear one patch daily for the duration of the study. On day 1, participants will arrive to&#xD;
      the laboratory for a 1-h session. During this session, breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels,&#xD;
      saliva or urinary cotinine levels will be evaluated. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on craving, withdrawal and cigarette dependence. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive seven patches, to wear for seven days, one patch daily, beginning that day. Everyday&#xD;
      between days 8 to 12, participants will arrive to the laboratory for one hour each, and at&#xD;
      the end of the session, they will apply a new patch. Five sessions during the days 8 to 12&#xD;
      will serve as CM or noncontingent sessions. On these sessions, breath CO levels, saliva or&#xD;
      urinary cotinine levels will be evaluated, and participants will complete questionnaires on&#xD;
      craving, withdrawal and cigarette dependence. On these sessions, participants will have&#xD;
      opportunity to receive payments based on their CO levels, according to the group assignment.&#xD;
      If successful, the proposed study will provide a human laboratory model for use in studies of&#xD;
      the combined CM and pharmacological approaches for modifying adolescent smoking behavior.&#xD;
