  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study subjects will be administered a single oral dose of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA)&#xD;
      prior to surgical resection of their brain tumor. The ALA ultimately causes brain tumor&#xD;
      tissue to fluoresce or light up under ultraviolet light. During surgery an ultraviolet light&#xD;
      in the microscope chain will be turned on. The tumor tissue will fluoresce bright pink&#xD;
      allowing the surgeon to more easily differentiate tumor tissue from normal brain tissue. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to determine whether ALA and fluorescent visualization of tumor tissue&#xD;
      improves the surgeon's ability to completely resect or remove the brain tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study and all subjects will receive open label Aminolevulinic Acid in a&#xD;
      dose of 20mg/kg given orally 3 hours prior to surgery. Brain tumors will be resected with the&#xD;
      aid of ultraviolet light to visualize the tumor. After surgery an MRI will be done to&#xD;
      determine whether the tumor has been completely or partially resected. All subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for safety. All subjects will be followed closely by clinical examination and by MRI&#xD;
      to monitor for disease recurrence.&#xD;
