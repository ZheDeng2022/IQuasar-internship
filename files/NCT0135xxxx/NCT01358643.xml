      The purpose of this pilot is to assess the feasibility and potential effectiveness of three&#xD;
      specific e-health approaches. One approach, SparkPeople.com, involves the use of social media&#xD;
      and can be accessed through a free website. This approach has the potential to provide&#xD;
      support through an on-line community as well as a number of diet/weight and physical activity&#xD;
      related tools. A mobile phone application is also available for those with smart phones. The&#xD;
      second approach, BodyMedia, involves the use of an objective monitoring device that tracks&#xD;
      all activity. This information can be uploaded to a website to provide ongoing monitoring and&#xD;
      feedback about activity and energy expenditure. The third approach, P90X, involves a DVD&#xD;
      based resistance focused exercise program. While DVD programs are not necessarily considered&#xD;
      e-health, participants will be encouraged to participate in online community forums&#xD;
      associated with the program. All participants, regardless of randomization, will be given 4&#xD;
      point of decision prompts that are laminated 8.5x11 posters encouraging healthier behaviors&#xD;
      to display in various areas of their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effect of the intervention on weight, activity levels, depression, and&#xD;
           adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine level of interest, perceptions, feasibility and satisfaction of the&#xD;
           proposed interventions (i.e. SparkPeople.com vs. BodyMedia vs. P90X) with particular&#xD;
           attention to: 1) social media; 2) food logs; 3) objective monitoring of physical&#xD;
           activity; 4) use of point systems&#xD;

      This is a pilot study designed to better understand what elements/strategies help to engage&#xD;
      Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans in an e-health program for&#xD;
      promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity. These data will be used as pilot&#xD;
      information for a larger study to assess the effectiveness of using an e-health approach to&#xD;
      promote weight loss and increase physical activity among post-deployment OEF/OIF veterans who&#xD;
      are at risk for developing diabetes. Additionally, we seek to recognize any effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on other health-related outcomes, such as stress, depression or other mental&#xD;
      health measures, chronic pain, sleep, quality of life, satisfaction with care/ Veteran&#xD;
      Affairs Health system, employment status, social support/connectedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-deployment OEF/OIF veterans worry about gaining weight and believe regular physical&#xD;
      activity is beneficial, yet many don't exercise due to health problems and/or chronic pain.&#xD;
      Healthy eating combined with physical activity are key strategies in maintaining or losing&#xD;
      weight and is important in preventing diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other preventable&#xD;
      illnesses as well as managing many mental health conditions and reducing chronic pain&#xD;
      symptoms. In addition, maintaining or improving physical activity/exercise may be an&#xD;
      effective strategy for addressing other post-deployment issues: stress, social issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-health strategies may be an effective and potentially preferred as well as efficient&#xD;
      (cost-effective) way to deliver or assist OEF/OIF veterans with health and lifestyle related&#xD;
      health behaviors. There is a growing array of e-health tools, technologies and approaches to&#xD;
      assist people with diet-related issues (for weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight) and&#xD;
      to encourage physical activity. This includes cell phone applications, objective monitoring&#xD;
      devices such as pedometers and web-based programs (as well as combination of these different&#xD;
      strategies). However, the most effective and efficient way to encourage healthy eating and&#xD;
      weight loss/maintenance or promote physical activity remains an open question and which tools&#xD;
      and technologies might best engage the OEF/OIF veteran population in addressing these&#xD;
      lifestyle issues is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OEF/OIF Coordinators will include the study recruitment flyer in their initial informational&#xD;
      mailing to new OEF/OIF veterans and publish the flyer in their monthly newsletter. The&#xD;
      recruitment flyer will encourage interested veterans to contact study staff via a toll free&#xD;
      number (where they will leave a message) or email. During one-on-one meetings, Coordinators&#xD;
      will identify overweight and obese OEF/OIF veterans who are interested in losing weight with&#xD;
      physical activity and with the veterans permission will forward the veterans name and phone&#xD;
      number to the research study staff by leaving a voice mail on the study phone line. During&#xD;
      these meetings, the OEF/OIF Coordinators will also provide basic information regarding the&#xD;
      program and provide the Veteran a recruitment flyer. Recruitment flyers will also be posted&#xD;
      at strategic locations around the VA with the approval of Public Affairs. Should study staff&#xD;
      fail to meet recruitment goals through the assistance of the OEF/OIF Coordinators and posted&#xD;
      flyers, primary care physicians (PCPs) will also be educated on the study and given study&#xD;
      recruitment flyers to give to potentially eligible patients. With the permission of the&#xD;
      veteran, PCPs will forward the veterans name and phone number to the research study staff by&#xD;
      leaving a voicemail on the study phone line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be contacted by phone to be screened for eligibility. If&#xD;
      eligible, participant will be asked to come to the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Healthsystem&#xD;
      (VA) for a 1 Â½ to 2 hour enrollment session. Patients will be consented at the start of this&#xD;
      enrollment visit, prior to the commencement of any research activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research activities are outpatient. This pilot study will be a crossover study of two&#xD;
      6-week programs. The participant will be involved for 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three home base diet and exercise programs we are testing are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A web based diet and exercise program in which you can track your diet and exercise&#xD;
           progress and read and post messages to a large online community of others who are also&#xD;
           trying to lose weight. (Sparkpeople.com)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A program in which you wear a small device on your arm that measures your physical&#xD;
           activity and allows you to upload detailed physical activity data to a web site to help&#xD;
           you track your progress. (Bodymedia Fit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A DVD based home exercise program that guides you through a daily exercise routine.&#xD;
           (P90X)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty OEF/OIF veterans with body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 will be recruited to test the diet&#xD;
      and exercise programs. Each veteran will test only two of the three programs described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed about the study by OEF/OIF coordinators, medical providers or&#xD;
      by reading posters about the study posted in outpatient areas in the Ann Arbor VA Medical&#xD;
      Center. Contact information for veterans who express an interest and give permission will be&#xD;
      forwarded to the research staff. Research staff will call the potential participant on the&#xD;
      phone, briefly describe the study and then complete a short eligibility screening&#xD;
      questionnaire. Eligible and interested participants will schedule an initial in person study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial study visit, participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the informed consent process and sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive instructions for completing an online survey to be completed during the visit or&#xD;
           at home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have height and weight recorded by the research coordinator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be randomly assigned to test two of the three diet and exercise programs described above&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive instructions and related equipment or materials for the first program to test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedule a follow up visit to cross over to the second program after 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then test the diet and exercise program at home for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . At this second visit, the cross over visit, participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return the materials from the first program they tested&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have weight rechecked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive instructions on filling out a second online survey asking about experience with&#xD;
           program 1 to be completed during the visit or at home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a 30 minute interview or schedule a time to complete the interview by phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive instructions and related equipment or materials for the second program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then test the second program at home for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then arrange with the study coordinator to return the equipment and&#xD;
      materials for the second intervention tested, complete a third online survey and a second&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may choose to complete the study without a third VA visit. They would return&#xD;
      equipment and materials by mail at the VA's expense, complete the final survey online from&#xD;
      home and complete the final interview by phone. Study staff will ask participant for&#xD;
      self-reported weight measurement if the final visit is done remotely. For participants who do&#xD;
      come to the VA for the final assessment, we will also recheck their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff may contact participants by email or phone to remind participants to complete&#xD;
      surveys, upcoming phone interviews, and upcoming research visits. If participant does not&#xD;
      complete survey online, study staff will offer to mail the survey for participant to complete&#xD;
      at home (including a return envelope), or doing the survey by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants test the SparkPeople.com website, they will receive an email from study staff&#xD;
      with video clips that describe the website in further detail. The will also receive emails&#xD;
      directly from Sparkpeople.com depending on how they set their profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants test the BodyMedia fit device, BodyMedia will send an email directly to the&#xD;
      participant with directions on setting up their account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three of the diet and exercise programs we are testing in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available home exercise programs and they are not programs developed by or delivered by the&#xD;
      VA or VA staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note: At initial study visit, participant is randomized to 2 of the 3 possible&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BodyMedia Fit device has nickel contacts on the device. These contacts will be&#xD;
           directly next to skin. If participant has known nickel allergy and randomized to&#xD;
           BodyMedia Fit group, they will not participate in Body Media Fit intervention.&#xD;
           Participant will be given the intervention they were not selected for and given&#xD;
           necessary instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant has an unknown nickel allergy and they have a reaction to the BodyMedia&#xD;
           Fit device, study staff will document in file on I: drive and tell the participant to&#xD;
           stop wearing the device. The participant will wait until the end of the 6 weeks without&#xD;
           an intervention.&#xD;
