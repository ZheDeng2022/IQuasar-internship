  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the majority of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee the disease originates in the&#xD;
      medial compartment. There are two different approaches to replacing this arthritic area. Some&#xD;
      surgeons feel that it is always best to replace both the knee compartments with a Total Knee&#xD;
      Replacement (TKR). Others feel it is best to replace just the damaged component of the knee&#xD;
      with a Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR). There is little agreement amongst knee&#xD;
      surgeons. Both interventions are established and well documented procedures, yet little&#xD;
      evidence exists to support either practice. Each intervention is considered standard care.&#xD;
      There exists little evidence, however, to prove the clinical and cost effectiveness of either&#xD;
      management option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT) will be to assess the&#xD;
      clinical and cost effectiveness of Total Knee Replacements versus Unicompartmental Knee&#xD;
      Replacements in patients with medial osteoarthritis. This will be examined using an&#xD;
      appropriate patient base and long term assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has a combined device/expertise based allocation depending on the local situation.&#xD;
      Surgeons who are in equipoise and have sufficient experience to perform both TKR and UKR,&#xD;
      randomisation and allocation can be based on &quot;device&quot; (UKR or TKR). The same surgeon will&#xD;
      perform the operation for both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For surgeons who hold a preference for one treatment over the other, an &quot;expertise&quot; based&#xD;
      randomisation will then occur. UKR surgeons will work alongside TKR surgeons. Patients&#xD;
      recruited to the study from these sites will be randomised to one of the treatment options&#xD;
      and treated by the appropriate surgeon. In such cases the patient is internally referred to&#xD;
      the other surgeon's operating list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by their consultant knee surgeons in collaboration with the local&#xD;
      research team. TOPKAT are hoping to recruit 500 patients altogether, with 250 per arm of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study is a single layer multicentre superiority type randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial of unilateral knee replacement patients. The randomised controlled trial design will&#xD;
      help reduce and prevent potential bias influencing the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to either UKR or TKR. The trial has a combined&#xD;
      equipoise/expertise approach. It enables surgeons who are not in equipoise to deliver only&#xD;
      one of the two operations while also allowing surgeons in equipoise to provide both&#xD;
      operations. A surgeon who is in equipoise ('equipoise surgeon') and has sufficient experience&#xD;
      to perform both TKR and UKR will deliver the allocated operation (UKR or TKR). The same&#xD;
      surgeon will perform the operation for both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all surgeons are able to exhibit this equipoise. They may hold a preference for one&#xD;
      treatment over the other often due to experience/expertise with one type of operation.&#xD;
      Interestingly, a surgeon may also believe the patient may benefit from one particular&#xD;
      operation even though they may not be able to perform it themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipoise is difficult to investigate or establish. Self declaration has been used as the&#xD;
      main approach but in order to sufficiently secure this state the following aspects are&#xD;
      important:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The equipoise considered must be patient- or individual-based equipoise rather than an&#xD;
           overall or general category equipoise based on operation type. The surgeon must consider&#xD;
           their position for each individual patient. Only if they believe that either operation&#xD;
           will be suitable for an individual patient can the patient then be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No surgeon will ever knowingly perform what they consider a substandard surgical&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to complete the trial by seeking to maximise surgeon participation, an&#xD;
      'expertise'-based delivery of the intervention will also occur. For this approach there must&#xD;
      be a surgeon with expertise in TKR and a surgeon with expertise in UKR in the same centre who&#xD;
      will act together as a 'delivery unit'. Patients recruited to the study who are under the&#xD;
      care of such a surgeon ('expertise surgeon') will be randomised to one of the two groups and&#xD;
      treated by the appropriate surgeon. This 'expertise' approach allows for those UKR surgeons&#xD;
      who work alongside TKR surgeons to team up and participate in the study. Subsequent surgery&#xD;
      may be carried out by a surgeon different to that at the initial consultation. In such cases&#xD;
      the patient is internally referred to the other surgeon's operating list. No restriction is&#xD;
      made upon the number of delivery units within a centre. A surgeon can only be in one delivery&#xD;
      unit, that is, they are either an 'equipoise surgeon' or an 'expertise surgeon'.&#xD;

    <description>TOPKAT will be pragmatic in terms of implant selection for the knee replacement operation. Providing the inclusion criteria are met, surgeons will be entirely free to use an implant of their choice or will use the current implants used at their institution. Implant type used on each patient will be recorded.&#xD;
A partial knee replacement or UKR involves only the diseased area of the joint being replaced. The healthy compartment of the knee is retained and artificial implants are inserted in place of the diseased area. This is done via a minimally invasive surgical procedure.</description>

Providing the inclusion criteria are met, surgeons will be entirely free to use an implant of their choice or will use the current implants used at their institution. Implant type used on each patient will be recorded.&#xD;
A total knee replacement involves all surfaces of the knee being replaced. The procedure involves excising both diseased and normal femoral condyles, the tibial plateau and often the patella. This is done through a large skin incision which provides easy access to the knee joint. Each component will be replaced with an artificial implant, which may be cemented in position.</description>
