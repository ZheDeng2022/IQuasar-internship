    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized open-label -phase III study that aims to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of Zoladex® combined with Aromidex® for 3-2 years after SERMs (tamoxifen and&#xD;
      Fareston®) as an adjuvant therapy for 2-3 years with the efficacy of tamoxifen up to 5 years&#xD;
      for premenopausal breast cancer women with hormone receptor positive, lymph node positive or&#xD;
      tumor ≥4cm. According to St. Gallen's guideline, hormone receptor positive was defined as&#xD;
      endocrine responsive and endocrine response uncertain categories (table 3-1), and only those&#xD;
      with ER or PR expression undetectable were considered as HR negative. The pathological&#xD;
      evaluation of axillary lymph node could be done by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) when axillary&#xD;
      nodes were clinically impalpable accompanied with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or&#xD;
      directly through ALND when axillary nodes appeared to be positive in clinical examination.&#xD;
      Based on the operating standard of local medical institution, identifying the numbers of&#xD;
      lymph nodes to do the pathological evaluation and to do the dissection of I- or II-station&#xD;
      nodes accurately.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  patients with no nodes positive after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, lymph node&#xD;
                  positive must be evaluated during surgery. Its definition was the either of&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Patients diagnosed as occult breast cancer clinically are found to pathologically have&#xD;
             primary invasive carcinoma or DCIS with micro-invasive lesion in ipsilateral breast,&#xD;
