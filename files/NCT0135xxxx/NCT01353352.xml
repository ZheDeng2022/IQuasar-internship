  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck injuries are a common problem among blunt trauma victims with more than 8,000,000 cases&#xD;
      being seen annually in U.S. and Canadian EDs. While the majority of these cases represent&#xD;
      soft tissue injuries, 30,000 patients suffer cervical spine fractures or dislocations and&#xD;
      approximately 10,000 suffer spinal cord injury. There are no readily available national&#xD;
      Canadian data on ED visits such as those provided by the U.S. National Hospital Ambulatory&#xD;
      Medical Care Survey. The prevalence of potential neck injury can, however, be reasonably&#xD;
      estimated for Canadian EDs. Extrapolation, on a population basis, from reliable U.S. figures&#xD;
      suggests that 1.3 million potential neck injury patients are seen annually in Canada. Only&#xD;
      0.9% of these patients are found to have cervical spine fractures or dislocations.&#xD;

      Background: Canadian emergency departments (EDs) annually treat 1.3 million patients who have&#xD;
      suffered blunt trauma from falls or motor vehicle collisions and who are at risk for cervical&#xD;
      spine injury. Most such cases are alert and stable adults and less than 1% has a c-spine&#xD;
      fracture. Most trauma victims transported in ambulances are protected by a backboard, collar,&#xD;
      and sandbags and, on arrival at the ED, are sent to high acuity resuscitation rooms, where&#xD;
      they remain fully immobilized for hours until physician assessment and radiography are&#xD;
      complete. This prolonged immobilization is often unnecessary and adds considerably to patient&#xD;
      discomfort and also adds to the burden of our overcrowded Canadian EDs in an era when they&#xD;
      are under unprecedented pressures. These patients use valuable ED resuscitation room space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses usually do not evaluate the c-spine of trauma patients but the investigators believe&#xD;
      that they should be able to safely assess alert and stable ambulance patients and &quot;clear&quot; the&#xD;
      c-spine of low-risk cases on arrival at the triage station. Patients could then be much more&#xD;
      rapidly, comfortably, and efficiently managed in other areas of the ED. An expanded role for&#xD;
      nurse decision-making has the potential to improve trauma care efficiency in all Canadian&#xD;
      hospitals. Very little research has been done in this area of nurses' clearing patient&#xD;
      c-spines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical decision rule is derived from original research and is defined as a decision&#xD;
      making tool that incorporates three or more variables from the history, examination, or&#xD;
      simple tests. This Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) is comprised of simple clinical variables and&#xD;
      was designed to allow clinicians to &quot;clear&quot; the c-spine without radiography and to decrease&#xD;
      immobilization times. The investigators also validated the accuracy of the rule when used by&#xD;
      physicians. The investigators have now finished a funded study to validate the accuracy and&#xD;
      reliability of the CCR when used by ED triage nurses at 6 hospitals. The investigators&#xD;
      completed a funded implementation trial at 12 Canadian hospitals to evaluate the impact on&#xD;
      patients of the CCR when used by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of phase IV of the Canadian C-Spine Rule project is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and potential impact of an active strategy to empower ED triage nurses to evaluate and&#xD;
      clear the c-spine of very low-risk trauma patients. Specific objectives are to: 1) Determine&#xD;
      safety by screening for: a) Missed fractures and b) Serious adverse outcomes; 2) Determine&#xD;
      clinical impact by measuring: a) C-spine clearance rates by nurses, b) Length of time until&#xD;
      c-spine clearance; 3) Evaluate performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule for: a) Accuracy, b)&#xD;
      Nurse accuracy in interpretation, and c) Nurse comfort and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators propose a cohort study which evaluates outcomes during a 12-month&#xD;
      period at 5 hospital EDs, including 3 community and 2 teaching hospital sites. Enrolled will&#xD;
      be consecutive, alert and stable adult trauma patients presenting to the ED with neck pain or&#xD;
      with c-spine immobilization on an ambulance stretcher. Participating will be ED triage nurses&#xD;
      who previously underwent a structured educational strategy to learn the CCR and who&#xD;
      successfully participated in the 24-month phase IIb validation study at the same sites. These&#xD;
      nurses will be empowered by medical directive to &quot;clear&quot; the c-spine of patients according to&#xD;
      the CCR, thus allowing them to remove c-spine immobilization and to triage patients to a less&#xD;
      acute area of the ED. These outcomes will be assessed: 1) Measures of safety: a) Number of&#xD;
      missed fractures, b) Number of serious adverse outcomes; 2) Measures of clinical impact: a)&#xD;
      C-spine clearance rates by nurses, b) Length of stay in ED, and c) Patient satisfaction; 3)&#xD;
      Performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule: a) Accuracy, b) Nurse accuracy of interpretation,&#xD;
      and c) Nurse comfort. The investigators estimate a sample size of 1,500 patients will be&#xD;
      accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This evaluation study (phase IV) is an essential step in the process of&#xD;
      developing a new clinical decision rule / guideline for nurses to clear the c-spine. Once the&#xD;
      investigators have established safety and potential impact in phase IV, the investigators can&#xD;
      move to the final step (phase V), a multicenter implementation across Canada to study actual&#xD;
      impact. The investigators believe that teaching ED triage nurses to clear the c-spine of very&#xD;
      low-risk trauma patients has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and&#xD;
      comfort of patient care in our busy Canadian EDs. Ultimately, the investigators expect the&#xD;
      results of this study to be used by ED triage nurses throughout Canada.&#xD;
