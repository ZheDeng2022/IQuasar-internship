  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cyclophosphamide and veliparib&#xD;
      when given together in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it&#xD;
      started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide together with veliparib may work better in&#xD;
      treating breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of veliparib (ABT-888) that can be combined&#xD;
      with metronomic dose cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the macroH2A1.1 and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase 1 (PARP1) expression status in archival paraffin embedded tumor specimens from&#xD;
      either the primary tumor or metastatic disease is predictive of clinical benefit with&#xD;
      veliparib (ABT-888) plus cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and cyclophosphamide PO QD on days&#xD;
      1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase I: Patients must have histologically confirmed breast cancer (metastatic breast&#xD;
             cancer [MBC]) that is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) negative (as&#xD;
             determined by local pathology or reference laboratory), and have disease that is&#xD;
             metastatic (stage IV [TxNxM1]) or locally advanced and not amenable to potentially&#xD;
             curative surgical resection (eg, clinical stage IIIB-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2/neu negative disease (performed on primary tumor and/or metastatic lesion using&#xD;
             commercially available/approved assay in local institutional or reference laboratory),&#xD;
             according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American&#xD;
             Pathologists (CAP) guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend for metastatic&#xD;
             breast cancer &quot;…biopsy documentation of first recurrence, if possible, and&#xD;
             determination of hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone&#xD;
             receptor [PR]) and HER2 status….&quot;; therefore, histologic and/or cytologic confirmation&#xD;
             of metastatic disease is encouraged whenever feasible, but not required; in some&#xD;
             circumstances, histologic confirmation may not be feasible (eg, bone metastases not&#xD;
             amenable to biopsy and elevated cancer antigen [CA]27-29 tumor marker); for patients&#xD;
             who have had histologic confirmation of metastatic disease, it is required that the&#xD;
             biopsy confirm that the metastatic tumor is ER and/or PR positive, and HER2/neu&#xD;
             negative; for patients in whom biopsy confirmation of metastatic disease is not&#xD;
             feasible, it is required that the primary tumor be ER and/or PR-positive and HER2/neu&#xD;
             negative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) or&#xD;
             non-measurable disease, with measurement obtained within 4 weeks of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase I: Patients must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
             metastatic disease; patients with deleterious germ line mutations in breast cancer&#xD;
             (BRCA)1 or BRCA2 are not required to have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had progressive disease after at least one line of endocrine&#xD;
             therapy for metastatic disease (includes relapse while receiving endocrine therapy);&#xD;
             there should be at least 1 week interval between the last endocrine treatment for an&#xD;
             aromatase inhibitor and at least 2 weeks for tamoxifen or fulvestrant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2 (Karnofsky &gt;=&#xD;
             60%)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases are eligible if they have been treated&#xD;
             with radiation and have stable brain metastases at least 3 months after radiation and&#xD;
