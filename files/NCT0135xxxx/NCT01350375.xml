  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the therapeutic utility of BOTOX in reducing the degree of&#xD;
      Forward Head Posture (FHP) with associated headache and myofascial pain, decreasing the&#xD;
      frequency of headache, and improving the overall quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study&#xD;
      investigating the use of BOTOX in the treatment of patients with FHP and associated headache&#xD;
      using a novel fixed site injection paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen subjects will be randomized to receive BOTOX® and fifteen will receive placebo&#xD;
      injections. Study subjects will receive one cycle of injections, up to a maximal total dosage&#xD;
      of 250U. The study duration is approximately 4 months and is composed of a Screening Visit&#xD;
      (Visit 1, Month -1), a Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Day 0), and three Follow-Up Visits 1 month&#xD;
      apart (Months 1, 2 and 3).&#xD;
