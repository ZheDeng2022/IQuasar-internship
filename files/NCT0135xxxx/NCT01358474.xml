    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participants have changes in dopamine cells in&#xD;
      their brain using DaTSCANâ„¢ brain imaging. Dopamine cell loss occurs in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) and other degenerative Parkinsonian disorders, but does not occur in most other movement&#xD;
      disorders such as essential tremor or dystonia. DaTSCAN, which is also known as&#xD;
      123I-Ioflupane, is a new compound that has been developed by General Electric, Inc. and has&#xD;
      been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help doctors detect changes in&#xD;
      dopamine. This test is performed by injecting DaTSCAN into a vein in the arm, and after a few&#xD;
      hours, a large amount of DaTSCAN temporarily accumulates in an area of the brain where there&#xD;
      are a lot of dopamine brain cells. Because DaTSCAN contains a small amount of radioactive&#xD;
      iodine, it allows doctors to use a special machine called single photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) scanning to detect the location and amount of radioactivity in the brain&#xD;
      and help determine if there are changes in brain dopamine. It is hoped that this study will&#xD;
      help doctors detect the presence of dopamine changes even before symptoms are present. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate DaTSCAN in people with PD, those who are at risk for developing PD (e.g.,&#xD;
      those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep disorder (iRBD) and those who are heterozygous&#xD;
      or homozygous for Gaucher's disease (GBA) mutations) and those who are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
