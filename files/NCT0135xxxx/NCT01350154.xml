  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is done to evaluate whether treatment with the drug sildenafil (RevatioÂ®) can&#xD;
      improve muscular, cardiac, cerebrovascular or cognitive function in patients with Beckers&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy when compared to placebo (inactive medication). The study is based on the&#xD;
      recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Adamo&#xD;
      et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with Becker&#xD;
      dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal&#xD;
      conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of&#xD;
      muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting&#xD;
      in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits&#xD;
      degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the&#xD;
      basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Current&#xD;
      hypothesis: Sildenafil restores the cyclic GMP function affected in muscular dystrophy wit&#xD;
      nNOS deficiency resulting in improved muscle, cardiac, cerebrovascular and cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical trial including people with Becker's muscular dystrophy and established&#xD;
      deficiency in muscular content of nNOS protein consist of three sub-studies focusing on each&#xD;
      of muscle function, cardiac function and brain function. In muscular dystrophy the dystrophin&#xD;
      cellular complex usually located to muscle cells, is disrupted resulting in a known reduced&#xD;
      nNOS activity. The reduced nNOS leads to reduced cyclic GMP production. nNOS and cyclic GMP&#xD;
      are involved in the vascular response in striate muscle, cardiac vessels as well as the&#xD;
      cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia and regional activation. In muscular dystrophy, the&#xD;
      is an affected muscular and cardiac function and in some patients a changed cognitive&#xD;
      function in described. Whether such is related to a reduced nNOS function and subsequent cGMP&#xD;
      production is not fully understood. Inhibition of cGMP degradation by inhibiting the cGMP&#xD;
      degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) using PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil may&#xD;
      result in restoration of vascular responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a double blind, randomised, balanced, placebo-controlled cross-over&#xD;
      study performed during a 10 week treatment period. The patients will receive 4 weeks of&#xD;
      either sildenafil or placebo with a 2 week washout period in between treatments. The study&#xD;
      out-come parameters will be performed on two consecutive days at baseline, 4 weeks and 10&#xD;
      weeks, at two collaborating centers, Rigshospitalet for muscle and cardiac parameters and&#xD;
      Glostrup Hospital for cerebrovascular and cognitive parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints relate to each sub-study, assessing and comparing individual changes&#xD;
      from baseline and during placebo/sildenafil treatment.&#xD;
