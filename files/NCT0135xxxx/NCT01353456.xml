  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, multimodal approach for postoperative pain control has been advocated.Combinations&#xD;
      of traditional and novel pharmacological agents are administered, aiming to improve&#xD;
      analgesia, spare opioid consumption, minimise adverse effects, and improve postoperative&#xD;
      bowel function in colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the novel agents suggested is dexmedetomidine. It is a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor&#xD;
      agonist, which has been demonstrated to have anaesthetic, sedative and analgesic-sparing&#xD;
      effects. Furthermore, a significant reduction in postoperative morphine consumption by using&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been achieved when dexmedetomidine was administered&#xD;
      before operation. The drug also reduces cate-cholamine secretion, thereby reducing stress and&#xD;
      leading to a modest reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be particularly&#xD;
      beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease, while respiratory rate is not affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators would like to evaluate the analgesic effects of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, which is administered intraoperatively with morphine, followed by&#xD;
      postoperative PCA morphine infusion, for postoperative pain for open and laparoscopic&#xD;
      colorectal surgery. Cyclooxy-genase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and rescue intramuscular pethidine&#xD;
      will also be incorporated as part of the multimodal analgesia regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good pain control can help to decrease cardiovascular complications. Emerging data has&#xD;
      suggested a key role of soluble CD40L as inflammatory mediators of atherosclerotic lesion&#xD;
      progression. The investigators would like to evaluate the effect of our analgesic regimens on&#xD;
      soluble CD40L peri-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intraoperative dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      pain and improve recovery and outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached at the pre-admission clinic or in the general ward before&#xD;
      operation. The analgesic modalities will be explained and patient will be recruited into&#xD;
      study if s/he agrees. Patient will then be randomised into one of the two groups receiving&#xD;
      intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative PCA morphine (D), or&#xD;
      intraoperative morphine only then postoperative PCA morphine (M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation, blinding, and preparation of dexmedetomidine and placebo Patients who undergo&#xD;
      open and laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery will be stratified in randomisation. For&#xD;
      each type of operation (colonic and rectal), randomisation will be based on using blocks of 5&#xD;
      patients to ensure both groups having equal sample size. A computer-generated random sequence&#xD;
      will be used to select the allocation order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the allocated analgesic modalities, i.e.&#xD;
      the administration of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine or normal saline (placebo) will be&#xD;
      prepared by clinical staff who will not participate in observation and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group D, dexmedetomidine will be prepared by adding 2ml of the drug (100μg/ml) to 48ml of&#xD;
      0.9% sodium chloride injection, which make up to a total of 50ml. The final concentration for&#xD;
      administration is thus 200μg in 50ml, i.e. 4μg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group M, a syringe of 50ml normal saline will be prepared as placebo. As both&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine and placebo will look the same as 50ml clear liquid in syringe, both patient&#xD;
      and investigator will be blinded to the substance administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed at pre-admission clinic or at the general ward. Blood for&#xD;
      soluble CD40L with other routine investigations will be taken. Bowel preparation will start&#xD;
      one day before operation. Patient will fast since midnight before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and intraoperative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients will be anaesthetised according to the protocol as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive no sedative premedication. On arrival in the operation theatre, a&#xD;
      16-gauge intravenous cannula will be placed under local analgesic. Pulse, pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure measurement will be checked every 5 minutes throughout the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol 2mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5μg/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg will be used for general&#xD;
      anaesthesia induction. Anaesthesia will be maintained with mixture of isoflurane, air and&#xD;
      oxygen. Isoflurane concentration will be titrated to optimal heart rate and blood pressure by&#xD;
      the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal blanket and infusion fluid warmer will be used to aim at maintaining core body&#xD;
      temperature at 35.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius. A urinary catheter will be inserted to monitor&#xD;
      urine output. Intermittent pneumatic compression device will be applied to the lower limbs&#xD;
      for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the discretion of the anaesthesiologist, hypotension will be treated with intravenous&#xD;
      ephedrine or phenylephrine. Hypertension or tachycardia will be treated with isoflurane up to&#xD;
      2% end-tidal concentration (~1.5 MAC). If persisted, beta-blockers such as labetalol or&#xD;
      arterial vasodilators such as hydralazine may be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isoflurane will be switched off after closure of the inner layer of the wounds. Reversal will&#xD;
      be achieved by intravenous neostigmine 50μg/kg and atropine 20μg/kg after operation. Patient&#xD;
      will then be transferred to recovery room for monitoring for at least 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic modalities and pain assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for the two analgesic modalities are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative PCA morphine.&#xD;
      Patient will receive a loading dose of 1μg/kg (0.25ml/kg) intravenous dex-medetomidine over&#xD;
      10 minutes before induction, and then followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5μg/kg/h&#xD;
      (0.125ml/kg/h) until wound closure. Bolus dose of 0.1mg/kg morphine sulphate will be given&#xD;
      intravenously prior to incision. At the third and forth hour, morphine sulphate 0.1mg/kg may&#xD;
      be given in divided dose titrated to patient's response. On arrival in the recovery room,&#xD;
      boluses of 2mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes until NRS pain score is&#xD;
      less than 4. A PCA machine will then be connected. The machine will be configured to give 1mg&#xD;
      of morphine at a time and the lockout duration will be set to 5 minutes. No basal infusion&#xD;
      will be given and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1mg/kg per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group M: intraoperative morphine then postoperative PCA morphine. All procedures for Group D&#xD;
      patients will be followed, but dexmedetomidine administration will be replaced by placebo&#xD;
      (normal saline) of the same volume and rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: Starting from postoperative day 1, when patient resumes fluid diet, oral&#xD;
      celecoxib 200mg will be given twice daily for 3 days or until discharge, whichever earlier.&#xD;
      From day 4 onwards, one tablet of dologesic (paracetamol plus dextropropoxyphene) will be&#xD;
      given every 4 hours as needed until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From postoperative day 0, rescue analgesic in the form of intramuscular pethidine 0.5mg/kg&#xD;
      will be prescribed every 4 hours if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the administration of PCA morphine, respiratory rate, SpO2 and sedation score will be&#xD;
      monitored every hour; blood pressure and pulse, numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at&#xD;
      rest and during cough, cumulative doses and tries/goods, as well as side effects will be&#xD;
      recorded every 4 hours. Patient will be seen by anaesthesiologist every day to assess the&#xD;
      adequacy of analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCA morphine will be administered for at least 2 days. On postoperative day 2, if NRS pain&#xD;
      scores during cough is less than 4 on a clinically low morphine consumption, PCA will be&#xD;
      stopped; if equals or greater than 4, or still on a high PCA consumption, it will be&#xD;
      continued. Assessment will be repeated daily. If NRS pain score during cough remains at 4 or&#xD;
      above on day 5, patient will be evaluated for complications and managed at the discretion of&#xD;
      the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After PCA morphine has stopped, NRS pain scores at rest and during cough, dose and frequency&#xD;
      of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early mobilisation is encouraged after operation. On postoperative day 1, patient will be put&#xD;
      on fluid diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical team will be responsible for postoperative assessments, such as recording daily&#xD;
      gastrointestinal function (bowel sound, flatus and bowel opening), postoperative&#xD;
      complications (if any) and readiness for discharging patient (good pain control with oral&#xD;
      analgesics, ambulatory, resumption of bowel function, i.e. stool or flatus, have 2 to 3 feeds&#xD;
      without vomiting or abdominal distension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for soluble CD40L and other routine investigations will be taken at post-operative day&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's satisfaction on analgesia will be asked using NRS from zero to 10 upon discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
