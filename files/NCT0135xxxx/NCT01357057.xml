  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to develop and validate a predictive score of 1-year&#xD;
      outcomes in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients receiving aneurism coiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using our database filled up prospectively, the investigators plan to collect clinical,&#xD;
      biological and radiological admission characteristics of coiled SAH cases and their 1-year&#xD;
      Rankin outcome score during 5 years (2003-2007). The investigators plan to confirm our score&#xD;
      in a validation cohort (from 2008 to 2009).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to screen all patients who were consecutively admitted from January 1,&#xD;
      2003 to our neurosurgical intensive care unit after a clinical diagnosis of SAH confirmed by&#xD;
      cerebral angiography and treated with a coiling procedure. Patients for whom a decision was&#xD;
      made by the treating physician to either forego any invasive treatment or to perform open&#xD;
      surgical clipping were excluded. Clinical, biological and radiological characteristics will&#xD;
      be recorded during the course of hospitalization. This observational study will be performed&#xD;
      according to standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission characteristics. At admission, the investigators plan to anonymously record age,&#xD;
      sex, GCS, presence of motor deficit, presence of clinical seizure and WFNS score. The GCS&#xD;
      refers to the value at admission before any treatment with sedative drugs. The cohort was&#xD;
      divided into two groups, an admission coma group for patients with GCS&lt;13 (WFNS 4 or 5), and&#xD;
      a non-coma group for patients with GCS313 (WFNS 1 to 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission biological sampling of venous blood are routinely performed to measure S100beta and&#xD;
      troponin per standard clinical practice in our ICU. Troponin I and S100beta levels will be&#xD;
      considered high for values higher than 0.5 mg/L (corresponding to 5 times the maximum normal&#xD;
      range) to be consistent with previous studies and to ensure high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission radiological characteristics are obtained from the admission CT-scan and the&#xD;
      initial angiogram. The CT-scan will be reviewed by a neuro-radiologist and classified&#xD;
      according to the modified Fisher score. Hydrocephalus and intraventricular hemorrhage at&#xD;
      admission were also registered. Aneurysm site and number of aneurysms were obtained from the&#xD;
      initial angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU Management. The ICU management will not be modified for this study. Briefly, a central&#xD;
      venous line and an arterial catheter are routinely inserted at admission before coiling. An&#xD;
      external ventricular drain (EVD) is inserted in patients with CT evidence of hydrocephalus,&#xD;
      WFNS grade between III to V, or a transcranial Doppler pulsatility index greater than 1.2,&#xD;
      suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. The EVD is routinely connected to an external&#xD;
      pressure strain gauge to monitor ICP according to a recently published protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After coiling, systolic arterial blood pressure is maintained between 130 and 150 mm Hg by a&#xD;
      titration of IV norepinephrine. ICP elevation higher than 20 mm Hg is treated by&#xD;
      cerebra-spinal fluid drainage, increased minute volume by mechanical ventilation when not&#xD;
      already implemented, deepening of sedation and, rarely, moderate hypothermia (target core&#xD;
      temperature between 35.5 to 36.5°C). An additional CT was performed whenever the clinical&#xD;
      status deteriorated. Acetaminophen and insulin are used as needed to avoid hyperthermia and&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, respectively. For ventilated patients, arterial carbon dioxide partial&#xD;
      pressure (PaCO2) was maintained between 35 and 40 mm Hg and peripheral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SPO2) above 97%, when deemed possible. Oral or enteral nutrition was started as soon as&#xD;
      possible. All patients received seizure prophylaxis from admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral Vasospasm management strategy. The investigators used our standard strategy for&#xD;
      cerebral vasospasm management. To summarize, all patients receive IV nimodipine at 2 mg/hr&#xD;
      from admission until the end of the second week after admission, except during periods of&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypoxia and ICP elevation. Patients are switched to oral nimodipine (60 mg&#xD;
      orally every 4 hrs) at the time of ICU discharge to the ward, for a total treatment period of&#xD;
      21 days. The neurologic and hemodynamic status are assessed at least every 4 hours. TCD was&#xD;
      performed at least once a day during the first 10 days. In unsedated patients, in the event&#xD;
      of clinical deterioration, new symptoms (uncontrolled cephalalgia, confusion, seizure, motor&#xD;
      deficit), mean TCD velocities above 120 cm/s or a greater than 50 cm/s change in mean TCD&#xD;
      velocity (ref) or after an increase in S100(, cerebral angiogram was performed. As is&#xD;
      standard practice, cerebral angiogram was performed after CT-scan ruled out other&#xD;
      complications. In sedated patients, since clinical symptoms are not able to be assessed; only&#xD;
      the TCD and S100( criteria were used to evaluate the need for cerebral angiogram. Each&#xD;
      vasospasm episode is treated by intra-arterial nimodipine administration, followed by&#xD;
      intra-arterial milrinone 2 mg if necessary (ref), and repeated each day if necessary.&#xD;
      Mechanical angioplasty is used as second-line treatment when necessary. Additionally,&#xD;
      hypertensive therapy is reinforced with a target SBP between 160 and 180 mm Hg. Occurrences&#xD;
      of vasospasm and of ischemic vasospasm (neurological symptoms directly linked to artery&#xD;
      spasm) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Outcome. The primary outcome is systematically assessed using the Rankin outcome&#xD;
      scale at ICU-discharge and then 6 months and 1 year later. The GCS, WFNS, and the Fisher&#xD;
      scores will be compared to our new score for the prediction of 1-year mortality and 1-year&#xD;
      full recovery (defined as Rankin 0 to 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. To identify factors that independently predicted 1-year mortality,&#xD;
      multivariable analysis will be performed using backward stepwise logistic regression to enter&#xD;
      variables that yielded p &lt; 0.05 in the univariate analyses. The investigators will use an&#xD;
      approximation of the odds ratio from the significant values of the stepwise logistic&#xD;
      regression to construct a new score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will construct receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of this score&#xD;
      and compared the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the ABC, the WFNS, the GCS and the&#xD;
      Fisher score to predict 1-year mortality and 1-year full recovery (defined as Rankin score&#xD;
      0-1). Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA version 11 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
