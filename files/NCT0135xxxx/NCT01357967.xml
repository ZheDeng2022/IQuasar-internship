  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there are increasing data about intensity dependent amplitude change (IDAP: N100&#xD;
      amplitude slope) of auditory evoked Event Related Potential (ERP) components for its role on&#xD;
      surrogate marker of central serotonergic activity. A high N100 amplitude slope reflects low&#xD;
      serotonergic neurotransmission and vice versa. There are a couple of studies reporting&#xD;
      associations of N1 amplitude slope with response to Citalopram (positive correlation) and&#xD;
      Reboxetine (negative correlation) treatment in major depressive disorder patients (2,3). The&#xD;
      investigator also published a case series about SSRI super-sensitivity and SSRI induced mania&#xD;
      in patients with aberrantly high N100 slope (4). And serotonin transporter gene polymorphism&#xD;
      was studied for its role about pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (5, 6, 7). Serotonin&#xD;
      promoter gene was known to have significant relationship with N100 amplitude slope (8).&#xD;
      Furthermore previous study showed that N100 amplitude slope was well correlated with&#xD;
      hypomanic and hyperthymic personality (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusively from above results, the investigator hypothesized that if depressive patients&#xD;
      show aberrant high or low N100 amplitude slope (N100 response outliers), they will not&#xD;
      response well to SSRI medication. They will response better to quetiapine XR adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy. In this study, the investigator will confirm it by comparing treatment effect&#xD;
      between SSRI monotherapy and quetiapine XR adjunctive in aberrant N100 responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis First visit depressive patients might have monopolar or bipolar depression. If&#xD;
      depressive patients show aberrantly high or low N100 amplitude slope, they will not response&#xD;
      to SSRI medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have aberrantly high or low N100 amplitude slope will response better to&#xD;
      quetiapine XR adjunctive therapy.&#xD;

      1.2 Rationale for this study The development of better strategy for treatment of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder and other mood disorder is a very important issue for patients, mental&#xD;
      health provider and government. So far, treatments of depressive illness have been based on&#xD;
      mainly trial and error method and physician's personal experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the development of new strategy for predicting better treatment response group of&#xD;
      quetiapine XR would be great contributions for basic brain science and mental health fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary target of this study is to prove the following hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have aberrantly high or low N100 amplitude slope will response better to&#xD;
      quetiapine XR adjunctive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have aberrantly high or low N100 amplitude slope will show higher dropout rate&#xD;
      for SSRI monotherapy compared to quetiapine XR adjunctive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Overall study design and study plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted by open, randomized, two armed, and observational phase IV&#xD;
      study. The investigator will compare treatment response between Quetiapine XR and SSRIs to&#xD;
      major depressive disorder patients showing aberrant response of N100 amplitude slope. The&#xD;
      investigator will use SSRIs drugs (paxil CR, es-citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline) as&#xD;
      comparator drug. The investigator will recruit drug naive patients but if there were previous&#xD;
      antidepressant medication, washout periods will be required for one week. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted as single centre study, and patients will be enrolled based on the DSM-IV major&#xD;
      depressive disorder criteria, and also aberrant response of N100 amplitude (N100 slope &lt;&#xD;
      0.21, or &gt; 1.59, this criteria can be revised base on our newly published data). In and&#xD;
      out-patients status of patients will recruited together. The treatment duration will be six&#xD;
      weeks from beginning of pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for measuring the LDAEP (N100 amplitude slope)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording took place in an electrically shielded and sound attenuated room adjacent to the&#xD;
      recording apparatus (Synamps, Neuroscan ®). Subjects were seated with open eyes in a slightly&#xD;
      reclined chair with a head rest. Evoked responses were recorded with 32 electrodes referred&#xD;
      to Cz. Pure sinus tones (1000 Hz, 80 ms duration with 10 ms rise and 10 ms fall time, ISI&#xD;
      randomized between 500 and 900 ms) of 5 intensities (55, 65, 75, 85, 95 dB sound pressure&#xD;
      level) were presented binaurally in a pseudo-randomised form by audiometry headphones. Data&#xD;
      were collected with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz and an analogous bandpass filter (1-30 Hz).&#xD;
      Analysis was performed with the Scan® software package version 4.3. One hundred ms&#xD;
      prestimulus and 300 ms poststimulus periods were evaluated for about 100 sweeps of every&#xD;
      intensity (all together 500 sweeps). For artifact suppression, all trials were automatically&#xD;
      excluded from averaging, if the voltage exceeded ± 70uV in any one of the 32 channels at any&#xD;
      time point of the averaging period. For each subject, the remaining sweeps were averaged&#xD;
      separately for the five stimulus intensities. At least 30 artefact-free sweeps/intensity had&#xD;
      to be averaged. N1 peaks (80-140 ms) and P2 peaks (100-250 ms) were determined&#xD;
      semi-automatically at the Cz electrode (referred to linked-mastoids). The IDAP was calculated&#xD;
      as linear regression slope with stimulus intensity as independent and N1/P2 amplitude as&#xD;
      dependent variable.&#xD;
