      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals&#xD;
           over 55 years of age. It can cause permanent loss of central vision, which is important&#xD;
           for seeing fine details and long distances. AMD has two forms: wet AMD and dry AMD. Most&#xD;
           people with AMD have dry AMD. But dry AMD can progress to wet AMD. Wet AMD is the more&#xD;
           serious form and can result in severe vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A method to identify and monitor the early to middle stages of AMD may help researchers&#xD;
           develop new treatments to stop the disease before it becomes severe. In early dry AMD,&#xD;
           people cannot see well at night. Researchers want to study whether a procedure that&#xD;
           measures how the eye adjusts to the dark can help to identify and monitor early to&#xD;
           middle dry AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of using a dark adaptation protocol to identify and monitor&#xD;
      early to middle dry age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 50 years of age who have no AMD. Others who have early to middle dry AMD in&#xD;
      at least one eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, and a full eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will last 5 years and require at least 9 visits to NIH. (First visit; study&#xD;
           visits at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and 3 yearly followup visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 10 people will be asked to come back to the clinic 1 week after their first visit.&#xD;
           They will be asked to test the device to be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have baseline exams. These questions will be about problems that&#xD;
           affect their eyes under different lighting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At every visit, participants will answer questions about general health and current&#xD;
           medications (including any vitamins or supplements). They will also have a full eye exam&#xD;
           and a 20- to 40-minute test. This test measures how fast the eyes recover in response to&#xD;
           decreasing levels of light. The test also measures how sensitive the eyes are to these&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to have these tests at the yearly followup examinations. They&#xD;
           will be treated with the standard of care for any eye conditions they have or may&#xD;
           develop during the study.&#xD;

      Objective: This study is designed to investigate the use of dark adaptation as a functional&#xD;
      endpoint for progression of eyes with no to intermediate age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD). To that aim, correlating structural features (obtained from multimodal imaging) as&#xD;
      well as genetic and systemic factors obtained from biospecimens with functional measures&#xD;
      (including dark adaptation, visual acuity and low luminance) will be done to understand the&#xD;
      relationship of disease relevant factors and to create a model of disease pathogenesis and&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Two hundred forty (240) participants will be initially accrued; however, up&#xD;
      to 280 participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled. Participants will have&#xD;
      varying degrees of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Group 0 (N=40) is defined as&#xD;
      participants without AMD meaning no large drusen (greater than or equal to 125 microns) or&#xD;
      advanced AMD in either eye. Group 1 (N=40) is defined as participants with large drusen&#xD;
      (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in the study eye and no large drusen or advanced AMD&#xD;
      (choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or geographic atrophy (GA)) in the fellow eye. Group 2&#xD;
      (N=40) is defined as participants with bilateral large drusen (greater than or equal to 125&#xD;
      microns) with or without retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary changes. Group 3&#xD;
      (N=40) is defined as participants with large drusen (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in&#xD;
      the study eye and advanced AMD (CNV or GA) in the fellow eye. Group 4 (N=40) is defined as&#xD;
      participants with findings of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) defined as having (1) the presence&#xD;
      of reticular inter-lacing patterns on at least one en face imaging method (color photography,&#xD;
      autofluorescence or infrared) and (2) confirmation of previously described findings of&#xD;
      hyperreflective material located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the&#xD;
      photoreceptor ellipsoid zone on SD OCT in those areas. Current participants in this study&#xD;
      have been graded and categorized into this cohort. Up to 40 diabetic participants will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single center, exploratory, observational, longitudinal evaluation of dark&#xD;
      adaptation response in AMD participants over five years and long-term evaluation of dark&#xD;
      adaptometry (DA) change as a predictor for AMD progression and visual acuity (VA) loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is to determine mean change, including the distribution&#xD;
      of change, in dark adaptation response between baseline and months 12 and 24 for Groups 0, 1,&#xD;
      2, 3 and 4. The secondary outcomes for each of the five groups are to determine mean change&#xD;
      in dark adaptation response from baseline at months 3, 6, 18, 36, 48 and 60 and to determine&#xD;
      mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the study eye from baseline at months&#xD;
      3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60. Exploratory outcomes for each of the five groups are to&#xD;
      correlate mean BCVA of the study eye with mean dark adaptation response at baseline and&#xD;
      months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 and to correlate AMD severity, including grading by an&#xD;
      external Reading Center, with dark adaptation response at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18,&#xD;
      24, 36, 48 and 60. Images from all visits may be sent to the Reading Center; however, only&#xD;
      the baseline and annual visits are required to be graded. This study will also analyze renal&#xD;
      function in AMD participants. Additionally, exploratory analysis of the small sample of&#xD;
      diabetic participants will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures for the genetic testing and RNA sequencing performed on participants&#xD;
      co-enrolled in the Biobank protocol (12-EI-0042) include the interaction of key parameters of&#xD;
      phenotype (such as visual acuity, dark adaptation, and retinal features on ocular imaging)&#xD;
      with genetic variants and other biomarkers identified from biospecimens, and the&#xD;
      characterization of new experimental models of eye health and disease.&#xD;

        Two hundred forty participants (240) will be initially accrued; however, up to 280&#xD;
        participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled. In the event that a&#xD;
        participant withdraws from the study prior to month 12, an additional participant will be&#xD;
