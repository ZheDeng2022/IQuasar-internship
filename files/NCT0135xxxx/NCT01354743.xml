      The purpose of this study is to provide data to support combination treatment of the upper&#xD;
      face with Perlane-L® and Dysport™. This study will assess the outcome of upper face&#xD;
      rejuvenation in the temporal fossa; outcome of glabella and/or periorbital regions will also&#xD;
      be assessed as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;

Muscle mass will be graded separately for males and females as +, ++, or+++ (light/small, moderate/medium, or heavy/large) by assessment of the procerus/corrugator muscles. Male patients will receive 0.3 mL to 0.4 mL (60, 70, or 80 units) in five equally divided doses of Dysport™ Female patients will receive 0.25 mL to 0.35 mL (50, 60 or 70 units) in equally divided doses of Dysport™ at 5 designated injection sites in the glabellar region&#xD;
Subjects will be treated with Dysport™ 20 or 30 units bilaterally to crow's feet.&#xD;
Subjects will be treated at baseline and if maximum amount of product has not been used at 1 month follow up subject will receive a touch up. No further treatment will be done for the remaining study visits.</description>
