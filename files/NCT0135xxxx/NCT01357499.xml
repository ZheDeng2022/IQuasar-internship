      The purpose of this study is to investigate if remote ischemic preconditioning by combining&#xD;
      limb ischaemia with electric muscle stimulation of the ischemic muscle provokes better&#xD;
      results in preconditioning the human heart than limb ischaemia alone does.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that protection from ischemia reperfusion can be achieved by brief&#xD;
      periods of ischemia applied at a remote site during an injurious ischemic event (remote&#xD;
      postconditioning). The purpose of this study is to investigate if the combination of brief&#xD;
      periods of limb ischemia in combination with electric muscle stimulation at the same site&#xD;
      could exceed the preconditioning effect of limb ischemia alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators thought to perform 2 different forms of remote ischaemic&#xD;
      preconditioning in patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first patient group a blood pressure cuff will be applied at the lower leg. Ischemia&#xD;
      will be induced by inflating the cuff to a pressure of 200 mmHg for 5 minutes. Afterwards&#xD;
      reperfusion will be allowed for further 5 minutes. This cycle will be repeated 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second patient group electric muscle stimulation at the same site (HiToP 191) will be&#xD;
      performed additionally throughout the whole preconditioning cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preconditioning, the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be performed by 3&#xD;
      PCI-ballon inflations, each lasting for 2 minutes. Between the inflations coronary&#xD;
      reperfusion will be allowed for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Effects of preconditioning will be evaluated by analysing the ST-deviation, caused by&#xD;
      angioplasty in an intracoronary (derived by PCI wire) and surface ecg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the maximum of chest pain during the 3 inflation cycles and troponin levels 24 h after&#xD;
      PCI will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Immediately after the preconditioning cycle the PCI ballon will be positioned in the coronary artery lesion and inflated for 2 minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion. This cycle will be repeated for 3 times without any interruption. Intracoronary ECGs and 12 lead surface ecgs will be taken immediately before and at the end of each ballon inflation (two minutes after beginning the intracoronary ballon inflation). after taking the ecgs the ballon will be deflated.&#xD;
The st-deviations will be analysed.</description>
