  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis (ie. life-threatening infections) is triggered by harmful microorganisms or&#xD;
      their toxins in the blood or tissues. These harmful agents damage the lining of blood vessels&#xD;
      which can lead to inflammation, blood clot formation, and vessel obstruction. In Canada,&#xD;
      there are approximately 90,000 patients with severe sepsis each year. Of these, 30% to 50%&#xD;
      will die. The identification of highly reliable outcome predictors in severe sepsis patients&#xD;
      is important for several reasons including: to help describe the severity of sepsis, to&#xD;
      classify patients for enrollment in clinical studies, and to monitor a patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment and procedures. In the investigators lab, the investigators examined the&#xD;
      incremental usefulness of adding multiple biomarkers to clinical scoring systems for&#xD;
      predicting ICU mortality in patients with severe sepsis. In a preliminary study of 80&#xD;
      patients with sepsis, the investigators found that high levels of plasma DNA predicted ICU&#xD;
      death better than any other clinical or biological factor. In this grant, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to confirm these findings in an external group of 400 patients in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
      The investigators also plan to study how plasma DNA levels change over time and whether high&#xD;
      plasma DNA levels can be used to distinguish sepsis from other critically ill conditions. For&#xD;
      this the investigators will compare the investigators septic patients to a cohort of 600&#xD;
      patients in the ICU with other conditions. The investigators believe this research has the&#xD;
      potential to significantly improve the management and treatment of septic patients.&#xD;

      DYNAMICS STUDY (DNA as prognostic marker in ICU patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator: Patricia Liaw, PhD (McMaster University) Coinvestigator: Alison&#xD;
      Fox-Robichaud, MD (McMaster University) Funding source: CIHR, 2010-2015 Budget: $794,086&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-page Protocol summary This is a new 5-year CIHR funded multi-centre prospective&#xD;
      observational study. The overall objective is to gain insight into the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      plasma DNA (ie. cell-free DNA) in severe sepsis patients and in other critically ill&#xD;
      patients. In our pilot study of 80 severe sepsis patients, we found that plasma DNA had&#xD;
      extremely high prognostic utility in this patient population. Using Receiver Operating&#xD;
      Characteristic (ROC) curves in a multivariate logistic model, we demonstrated that the Area&#xD;
      Under the Curve (AUC) for plasma DNA is 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-1.00). Furthermore, plasma DNA&#xD;
      levels obtained at &quot;day 1&quot; (ie. within 24 hours of meeting the inclusion criteria for severe&#xD;
      sepsis) did not differ significantly from the levels measured in subsequent days. In other&#xD;
      words, plasma DNA levels in nonsurvivors were high at &quot;day 1&quot; and remained high; plasma DNA&#xD;
      levels in survivors were low at &quot;day 1&quot; and remained low. These finding suggests that at&#xD;
      study inclusion for severe sepsis, the nonsurvivor patients had already reached &quot;a point of&#xD;
      no return&quot; (with the standard of care available at the time the patients in the pilot study&#xD;
      were recruited).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to validate the prognostic utility of plasma DNA prospectively in an independent&#xD;
      cohort of severe sepsis patients (n=400). We will also study a broad cohort of non-septic ICU&#xD;
      patients (n=600) to determine if elevations in plasma DNA are specific to severe sepsis, or&#xD;
      if it is more generally associated with high mortality risk. These non-septic ICU patients&#xD;
      include the following: multiple trauma, shock on presentation, neurosurgery, aneurysm,&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage, burns). The overall research coordinator for this study is Ellen&#xD;
      McDonald. Participating centres include Hamilton (Patricia Liaw, Alison Fox-Robichaud,&#xD;
      Deborah Cook), Ottawa (Laurlyn McIntyre), London (Claudio Martin, Doug Fraser), Vancouver&#xD;
      (Peter Dodek), Toronto (John Marshall, Jennifer Tsang), Laval Quebec (Francois Lallouche),&#xD;
      and Calgary (Brent Winston).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected daily during the first week, then once a week thereafter for&#xD;
      the duration of the patients' stay in the ICU. Blood sample will also be collected on the&#xD;
      same schedule except that weekend blood samples will be skipped. Freezerworks Unlimited will&#xD;
      be used for barcoding and tracking of all plasma samples. All samples will be shipped to&#xD;
      Hamilton for biomarker analyses. Clinical data will be managed with the iDataFax software&#xD;
      with statistical support from Janice Pogue at the Population Health and Research Institute&#xD;
      (Hamilton). The primary outcome is ICU mortality. The secondary outcomes are (a) the temporal&#xD;
      relationships between plasma DNA levels and other markers of inflammation and blood clotting,&#xD;
      and (b) the temporal relationships between plasma DNA levels and clinical parameters (e.g.&#xD;
      SOFA and MODS scores, interventions, use of blood products and plasma expanders).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the Hamilton Health Sciences in&#xD;
      November 2010. Deferred consent has been approved. Although we are not performing any DNA&#xD;
      sequencing analyses on the patient samples (ie. we are simply quantifying how much DNA is in&#xD;
      the plasma), we are also collecting Paxgene DNA tubes in the event that future&#xD;
      as-yet-undetermined studies require DNA for gene sequencing studies. Our local Ethics Board&#xD;
      has approved a separate Genetic Consent form to request and extra blood samples for Paxgene&#xD;
      DNA tubes. As of May 2012 we have completed recruitment in the sepsis arm. We are starting to&#xD;
      close some sites to enrolment as we near study completion&#xD;
