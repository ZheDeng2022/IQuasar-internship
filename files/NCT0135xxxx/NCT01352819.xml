      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation as an&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment for reducing some of the symptoms of advanced, levodopa-responsive&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the first study in Parkinson patients outside the US with a Deep Brain Stimulation&#xD;
      system using constant current instead of constant voltage and using a lead with an active&#xD;
      electrode tip.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, non-randomized, multi-centered study&#xD;
      for 12 months in duration from implantation with the subjects being used as their own&#xD;
      control. The primary outcome assessment will occur at three months: however, subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be&#xD;
      performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
