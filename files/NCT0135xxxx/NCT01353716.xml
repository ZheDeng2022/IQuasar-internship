  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of&#xD;
      Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC. DTG is metabolized primarily by uridine diphosphate&#xD;
      glucuronyltransferase (UGT)1A1, with a minor role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and with renal&#xD;
      elimination of unchanged drug being extremely low (&lt; 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of&#xD;
      the total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the feces but it is unknown if all or part of&#xD;
      this is due to unabsorbed drug or some percentage of biliary excretion of the glucuronide&#xD;
      conjugate which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. The&#xD;
      current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies states&#xD;
      that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment should be conducted even&#xD;
      for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile, because renal impairment can&#xD;
      inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned as an open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study to evaluate plasma&#xD;
      DTG pharmacokinetics following oral administration to subjects with severe renal impairment&#xD;
      (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) and matched healthy controls. Results from this study are&#xD;
      expected to enable the development of appropriate dosing recommendations in patients with&#xD;
      renal impairment.&#xD;
