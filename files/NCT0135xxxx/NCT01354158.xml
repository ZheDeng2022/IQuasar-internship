    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to determine the efficacy, duration of action and safety of escalating&#xD;
      dose of droxidopa on systemic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow and vasoactive hormones and&#xD;
      catecholamines during upright seated posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. What is the lowest dose of droxidopa that increases seated SBP to 115±5 mmHg in men and&#xD;
      105±5 mmHg in women?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When does the defined increase in SBP occur after oral ingestion of droxidopa?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long does this dose of droxidopa sustain SBP at these levels?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the vital signs and the subjective symptomology following droxidopa&#xD;
           administration?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. What is the MFV response to droxidopa administration in hypotensive individuals with SCI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does an increase in SBP correspond to an increase in MCA MFV?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. What is the vasoactive hormone and catecholamine response to droxidopa administration in&#xD;
      hypotensive individuals with SCI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does droxidopa administration result in a change in APR, Aldo or NE in hypotensive&#xD;
           individuals with SCI?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), due to partial to complete interruption of sympathetic&#xD;
      pathways from the brainstem to the cardiovascular system are prone to blood pressure&#xD;
      dysregulation including hypotension which is worsened during orthostasis. It is well&#xD;
      established that orthostatic hypotension (OH) hinders the rehabilitation process during the&#xD;
      acute phase of SCI but also may hamper the resumption of independence and activity in persons&#xD;
      with chronic SCI. Surprisingly, only a few reports exist on the use and efficacy of an alpha&#xD;
      receptor agonist (midodrine hydrochloride) to restore blood pressure to more normal levels in&#xD;
      persons with tetraplegia. Our group has recently reported normalization of supine blood&#xD;
      pressure with a relatively low dose of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (NOSi),&#xD;
      nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In addition to an alpha agonist and a NOSi, the use&#xD;
      of a norepinephrine (NE) precursor, droxidopa, may be safe and efficacious for the treatment&#xD;
      of orthostatic hypotension in a human model of SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that the blood pressure-raising effect of&#xD;
      3,4-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (droxidopa) occurs independently of the central nervous&#xD;
      system in human models of neurologic OH by conversion to norepinephrine (NE) in neuronal and&#xD;
      non-neuronal tissue. Oral droxidopa is taken up by the more peripheral sympathetic neurons,&#xD;
      converted to NE, stored and released appropriately during postural stress. Droxidopa has been&#xD;
      used for the effective treatment of OH in several human models of neurologically caused&#xD;
      autonomic disorders, such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy, autoimmune autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy . The effectiveness of&#xD;
      droxidopa at improving orthostatic blood pressure in persons with SCI has not been studied.&#xD;
      To date, only a single case on the use of the drug in a person with SCI has been reported and&#xD;
      the use droxidopa in that case was successful. The purpose of this proposal is to determine&#xD;
      the dose effectiveness, duration of action and any adverse events following droxidopa&#xD;
      administration in hypotensive individuals with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy, duration of action and safety of escalating dose of droxidopa on&#xD;
      systemic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow and vasoactive hormones and catecholamines&#xD;
      during upright seated posture.&#xD;
