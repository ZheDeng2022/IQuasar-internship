    <textblock>
      Metformin is a biguanide that is marketed as an oral anti-diabetic drug. Metformin treatment&#xD;
      in concert with diet and exercise is the consensus first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM), and therefore it will likely be an adjunct therapy for all assets in&#xD;
      development by GSK for the treatment of T2DM. Metformin has potent effects in lowering&#xD;
      circulating glucose concentrations, and it is believed to have additional benefits in&#xD;
      improving macrovascular outcomes, fatty liver disease and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Its&#xD;
      use in a significant proportion of T2DM subjects is limited by contraindications of heart&#xD;
      failure and renal insufficiency or gastrointestinal side effects. The mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      its glucose-lowering effect and adverse event profile of metformin are not well understood.&#xD;
      Whilst activation of AMP kinase may be important for therapeutic effect, changes in incretin&#xD;
      secretion and bile acid excretion have been described, but not consistently linked to its&#xD;
      therapeutic effect or AE profile. The aim of this study is to recruit T2DM patients on&#xD;
      prescribed metformin monotherapy to further investigate how the glucose effects are related&#xD;
      to the alterations in bile acid absorption, incretin and lipid profiles by studying these&#xD;
      parameters on and off the drug. This will be done in combination with frequent capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose monitoring to ensure patient safety. This study will facilitate the development&#xD;
      of a pharmacodynamic model that can be used by clinical teams developing non-absorbable NCEs&#xD;
      such as iBAT inhibitors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As metformin has become first-line therapy for T2DM patients in many countries, it is&#xD;
      important to ensure early-on in development that novel anti-diabetic NCEs work well as&#xD;
      add-ons to this drug. Furthermore, the broad spectrum of effects of metformin that may be&#xD;
      related to its glucose-lowering action offers the opportunity to use this drug as an&#xD;
      investigative tool to explore the relationship between the various pharmacodynamic endpoints.&#xD;
      In this situation, reliable PD endpoints are essential because systemic PK measurements are&#xD;
      not available to track how a NCE target is being activated or inhibited. Therefore, a clearer&#xD;
      understanding of metformin's mechanism of action as it relates to glycaemic control, lipid&#xD;
      metabolism, bile acid excretion and gastrointestinal adverse effects will enable the&#xD;
      EnteroEndocrine (EE) project teams to design more efficient studies for the evaluation of&#xD;
      non-absorbable NCEs targeted to receptors that are accessible from the gut lumen, including&#xD;
      the ileal bile acid transport inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the complexity of metformin kinetics within the gut, it is proposed to follow the&#xD;
      rise and fall of fasting blood glucose during metformin washout and re-introduction,&#xD;
      respectively, to determine the two appropriate timepoints for more detailed investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, subjects will be studied on 4 occasions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whilst on their usual stable dose of metformin (baseline state),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 7 days after stopping metformin to replicate the washout paradigm frequently used in&#xD;
           early phase T2DM studies in GSK&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When fasting capillary glucose has increased by 25% from the pre-metformin washout level&#xD;
           or two weeks from the start of the wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After metformin is re-introduced, when fasting capillary glucose has returned to the&#xD;
           pre-metformin washout level (baseline state established at screening )&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will entail the withdrawal and re-introduction of metformin under closely&#xD;
      supervised conditions. The withdrawal of metformin will be for a maximum period up to three&#xD;
      weeks and the glucose increases projected are not expected to result in significant long-term&#xD;
      risk for the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects do not already test blood glucose at home, a glucometer, instructions on its use,&#xD;
      and testing strips will be provided to them for capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring&#xD;
      during withdrawal and reinstatement of metformin. They will be instructed to test their blood&#xD;
      glucose twice a day, fasting before breakfast and before dinner, and at any time they are&#xD;
      concerned that blood glucose may have risen excessively. A written diary card will be kept by&#xD;
      each subject for recording CBG values, beginning approximately 7 days before discontinuation&#xD;
      of metformin after baseline assessments are completed during visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting CBG values &gt;15mM or &lt; 3.5mM must be reported to the site at once. If fasting CBG are&#xD;
      &gt;15mM or &lt; 3.5 mM on any two consecutive days during the wash-out period, the subject will be&#xD;
      discontinued and the usual dose of metformin will be reinstated, if appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are required to call the study centre while not in the unit or to alert site staff&#xD;
      while in the clinical unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When they have CBG values that are &gt;15mM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When they have CBG values that are &lt;3.5mM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When they have any concerns relating to their CBG levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When they have rapid, unexplained changes in their blood glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will attempt to contact the subjects daily to check on the CBG values and to&#xD;
      record any adverse events whilst the subject is at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged to keep their usual lifestyle in term of diet and exercise for&#xD;
      all duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Entero-Test device is simple, safe device for the collection of duodenal bile. It is well&#xD;
      tolerated, although some subjects may feel slight nausea on removal. Some blood may be seen&#xD;
      on the string when removed. This occurs if the string &quot;nicks&quot; the oesophagus on removal, this&#xD;
      is very minor trauma that heals rapidly and is not a cause for concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary enpoints-During metformin wash out and when treatment reinstated, pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      endpoints will include the following as data permit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24h profiles of blood glucose and insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faecal and serum bile acid profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enteroendocrine peptide profiling including but not limited to tGLP-1, tGIP, and tPYY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum lipid analysis including but not limited to fasting HDL and LDL cholesterol,&#xD;
           fasting and prandial TGs, ApoA1, ApoB and ApoE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints- • Relative bile acid composition as determined by EnteroTest bile string&#xD;
      sampling of duodenal bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Sparse metformin PK profiles will be determined from plasma samples&#xD;
