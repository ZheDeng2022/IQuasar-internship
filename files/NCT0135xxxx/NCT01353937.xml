  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers, a complication of diabetes leading to 80.000 lower limb amputations&#xD;
      annually in the US, are a significant burden to our health system, costing more than a&#xD;
      billion dollars annually. Here, we propose a novel combination of two drugs (Mozobil® and&#xD;
      Regranex®Gel) to mobilize a specific sub-type of stem cells (endothelial progenitor cells)&#xD;
      from the bone marrow and traffic them toward the wound, increasing the blood supply that&#xD;
      subsequently improves wound healing. Because we are using the human body's own resources to&#xD;
      regenerate itself by targeting and correcting the underlying pathophysiology, we believe that&#xD;
      this novel therapy yields great promise in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because diabetes impairs wound healing by altering fibroblast function, promotes chronic&#xD;
      infection and diminishes blood supply to the skin, the lifetime risk of a person with&#xD;
      diabetes developing a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is as high as 25%. Current strategies focus&#xD;
      independently on the fibroblast dysfunction (growth factors such as PDGF/Regranex® Gel), on&#xD;
      the chronic infection (debridement, antibacterial dressings) or on the blood supply (VAC®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is different from the other projects because we propose to combine two drugs in&#xD;
      a dual approach to first improve the fibroblast function using PDGF/Regranex® Gel and second&#xD;
      to induce neovascularization in DFU by recruiting progenitor cells into the wound through a&#xD;
      combination therapy of subcutaneous AMD3100 (Plerixafor/Mozobil®) with topical PDGF/Regranex®&#xD;
      Gel. By contrast to novel stem cell therapies where cells are extracted, processed ex vivo&#xD;
      and engrafted into the wound (exogenous stem cell therapy), here we propose to keep the stem&#xD;
      cells in vivo (endogenous stem cell therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the first aim of the study will be to launch a prospective evaluator-blind&#xD;
      pilot phase I/II safety and efficacy study to evaluate the clinical effect of AMD3100&#xD;
      (Plerixafor/Mozobil®) treatment with topical PDGF/Regranex® Gel compared to historical&#xD;
      controls (standard of care and PDGF). AMD3100 (240 µg/kg SC) will be administered daily for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Our primary endpoint will be the measure of the percentage of change in area of the&#xD;
      wound at 4 weeks (surrogate endpoint). In a second aim, we will measure the effect of AMD3100&#xD;
      treatment with PDGF using a quality-of-life index dedicated to DFU (DFS-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we are addressing the underlying physiopathology in a dual approach, because we are&#xD;
      avoiding the need for ex vivo processing and because both drugs are FDA approved, we believe&#xD;
      that this novel therapy yields great promise in the treatment of DFUs.&#xD;
