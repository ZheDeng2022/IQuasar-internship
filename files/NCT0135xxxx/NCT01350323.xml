  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a pilot, prospective, interventional, case-control study investigating aqueous&#xD;
      levels of VEGF in eyes with AMD-related NV treated with intravitreal bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of neovascularization was based on its anatomic localization as ascertained by&#xD;
      multimodal imaging employing FA (fluorescein angiography), ICGA (indocyanine green&#xD;
      angiography) and OCT (optical coherence tomography) as recently proposed by Freund et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures and follow-up At baseline all the patients underwent BCVA measurement&#xD;
      using early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart at 4 meters, fundus&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, FA, ICGA and sd-OCT. All examinations were repeated in occasion of the&#xD;
      follow-up appointments with exception of angiographic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic tests and OCTs scans were recorded using Spectralis sd-OCT (Spectralis SD-OCT,&#xD;
      Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMT was calculated after acquiring a sequence of 145 horizontal sections recorded in the&#xD;
      high-resolution mode (1024 A-scans/30 degrees) and covering an area of 20 degrees&#xD;
      (horizontal) × 15 degrees (vertical) with a distance of ~30 µm between individual sections.&#xD;
      On follow-up examinations, the imaging processing software allowed reevaluation at exactly&#xD;
      the same location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images were then processed by the &quot;Thickness Map&quot; analysis program. Field 1 of the map&#xD;
      analysis protocol (central 1 mm) was used for central retinal thickness calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aqueous Sampling and Bevacizumab Injections All patients with AMD-related neovascularization&#xD;
      received three intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml of bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech&#xD;
      Inc, South San Francisco, California, USA) at baseline, month 1 and month 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before injection, topical anesthesia was induced by tetracaine (1%) eye drops.&#xD;
      Povidone-iodine was applied to the eyelid margins, the lashes, the conjunctiva bulbi and the&#xD;
      fornices. After application of a sterile drape, a lid speculum was inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before each intravitreal injection, aqueous sampling was performed by aspirating&#xD;
      0.05-0.1 ml of aqueous using a 30-gauge needle connected to a tuberculin syringe at the&#xD;
      temporal limbus. All the samples were collected in the operating theatre under operating&#xD;
      microscope control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection was then performed using a 30-gauge needle in the&#xD;
      inferotemporal quadrant at 3.5 mm to 4 mm posterior to the limbus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The undiluted aqueous samples were transferred into sterile containers and immediately stored&#xD;
      in a -80°C freezer until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Reference samples were obtained from 14 age-matched patients undergoing&#xD;
      cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aqueous humor samples were obtained in the same fashion described above for eyes with&#xD;
      wet-AMD. The undiluted aqueous samples were transferred into sterile containers and&#xD;
      immediately stored in a -80°C freezer until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Assay Collected samples were gradually equilibrated to&#xD;
      room temperature before beginning the assay and diluted 1:1 with the sample diluent provided&#xD;
      by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VEGF content was determined on 50 µl of diluted sample with a human VEGF ELISA kit&#xD;
      (EHVEGF, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois, USA) according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instruction and using an extended standard curve including a 16, 8 and 4 pg/ml standard&#xD;
      point. All assays were performed in duplicate. The minimum detectable concentration of VEGF&#xD;
      was 3.5 pg/ml. Values inferior to 3.5pg/ml were considered equal to 1 for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
