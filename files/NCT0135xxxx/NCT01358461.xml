      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently demonstrated a highly significant increase in muscarinic receptor&#xD;
      density in the myocardium of infants deceased from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)&#xD;
      compared to those of infants deceased from identified causes 1. Muscarinic receptor&#xD;
      overexpression was found in all SIDS samples studied to date. It was associated with an&#xD;
      average increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, appearing as a compensatory mechanism to&#xD;
      oppose the cardiac muscarinic receptor overexpression. Similar vago-cardiac abnormalities&#xD;
      were detected in a rabbit model of vagal hyperreactivity that the investigators first&#xD;
      described some years ago2. In these hyperreactive animals, expression of muscarinic receptors&#xD;
      was also enhanced in blood white cells. Noticeably, the pattern of changes in these cells&#xD;
      paralleled the pattern of changes in the heart. Thus, muscarinic abnormalities in cardiac&#xD;
      tissues could be inferred with high confidence from those measured in lymphocytes.This was&#xD;
      the first report of a vago-cardiac abnormality in sudden infant death syndrome. The&#xD;
      investigators findings also provided original and important perspectives for the&#xD;
      identification and therapeutic management of infants at risk of sudden death. As such, the&#xD;
      publication of the investigators work raised a major interest from the population and from&#xD;
      the scientific and medical communities, in particular cardio-pediatricians. ObjectivesThe&#xD;
      objective of the present clinical project is to validate, in human lymphocytes, muscarinic&#xD;
      receptor expression level (assessed by quantitative RT-PCR) as a circulating biomarker of&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system dysfunction and more specifically, of vagal hyperactivity and of&#xD;
      risk of sudden death. The project will include 2 major items, conducted in parallel:1.&#xD;
      evaluation of the muscarinic receptor expression in lymphocytes from adults with vagal&#xD;
      syncopes (n=60 patients from an existing file versus 60 controls) (Cardiology unit + Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation Centre (CIC) + Laboratory of Neurobiology and Cardiovascular Pharmacology); 2.&#xD;
      evaluation of the muscarinic receptor expression in lymphocytes from children with vagal&#xD;
      syncopes (n=60 versus 60 controls) (Pediatry unit + Clinical Investigation Centre +&#xD;
      Laboratory of Neurobiology and Cardiovascular Pharmacology).PerspectivesThis project&#xD;
      represents the first step of validation of a circulating marker of vagal hyperactivity and of&#xD;
      risk of SIDS in human. Once this step is completed, the investigators will start with the&#xD;
      prospective study &quot; muscarinic receptor expression in lymphocytes and SIDS &quot; (cord blood&#xD;
      collected at birth and follow up of the new-borns) (Maternity ward + CIC + Laboratory of&#xD;
      Neurobiology and Cardiovascular Pharmacology). Then therapeutic preventive management becomes&#xD;
      a realistic objective. A therapeutic clinical study will then be started with atropinic&#xD;
      drugs, in order to test their potential protective action against sudden death. The final&#xD;
      objective of the investigators research is the prevention of SIDS through i) identification -&#xD;
      as soon as birth - of new-borns at high risk and ii) appropriate prophylactic therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators work also opens exciting perspectives in the field of the still poorly&#xD;
      understood vagal disorders in children and adults such as vagal pauses.1 Livolsi et coll,&#xD;
