  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of overfeeding and exercise on&#xD;
      blood levels of hormones associated with regulating appetite, also thought of as feelings of&#xD;
      hunger and satiety (fullness). Previous studies have shown that non-obese people have&#xD;
      different amounts of these hormones in their blood compared to obese people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise will promote improved insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      corresponding beneficial changes in obese individuals. The investigators predict exercise&#xD;
      induced changes in 24-hour plasma hormone levels will be associated with improved appetite&#xD;
      during overfeeding in obese individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized cross-over design, participants will complete two separate six-day &amp; seven&#xD;
      night inpatient stays (separated by at least 4 weeks) at the University of Wisconsin&#xD;
      Hospital's Clinical and Translational Research Core (CTRC). During each six-day &amp; seven night&#xD;
      visit, participants will be fed an energy balance diet (energy intake = energy expenditure)&#xD;
      for the first three days followed by three days of overfeeding (130% of the energy balance&#xD;
      diet). During one of the inpatient periods, participants will exercise twice daily (once in&#xD;
      the morning, once in the evening) for a total of approximately 120 minutes per day on an&#xD;
      indoor exercise bicycle at ~50% of maximal aerobic fitness. During the other inpatient visit,&#xD;
      participants will not exercise and will be inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the effect of short-term positive energy balance and exercise&#xD;
      on 24-hour plasma levels of hormones related to hunger and satiety. These hormones include&#xD;
      leptin, ghrelin, insulin, and peptide YY in sedentary lean and obese men and women. Our&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that when an obese person exercises, average 24-hour plasma leptin&#xD;
      levels will increase in obese individuals during overfeeding compared to energy balance&#xD;
      feeding, but fail to do so under sedentary conditions. In contrast, the investigators predict&#xD;
      lean individuals will have an appropriate increase in average 24-hour leptin levels in&#xD;
      response to overfeeding regardless of exercise treatment. Thus, the investigators suggest&#xD;
      that a failure in the average 24-hour leptin response to overfeeding sets an obese person up&#xD;
      for continued slow weight gain, as the leptin hunger signal fails to detect short-term&#xD;
      overfeeding and does not produce a response. The investigators hypothesize that exercise will&#xD;
      promote improved insulin sensitivity and increased leptin in the obese. The investigators&#xD;
      predict that changes in average 24-hour plasma leptin levels will correlate with&#xD;
      self-selected energy intake in lean individuals, but only during overfeeding plus exercise in&#xD;
      obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because the hunger and satiety response in humans is complex, this study will&#xD;
      characterize the average 24-hour plasma levels of ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, and&#xD;
      peptide YY, which stimulate satiety or fullness, in lean and obese individuals to determine&#xD;
      if plasma levels are altered in obesity and in response to short-term positive energy&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, this study involves the banking of blood tissue specimens for future research. If it&#xD;
      is decided such analysis is of scientific value, genetic analysis will be conducted for&#xD;
      alterations in genes involved in the synthesis of, or receptors for, hunger and satiety&#xD;
      hormones to be investigated under this study design.&#xD;
