  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-invasive study using a standard doppler echocardiographic transducer which&#xD;
      records signals emanating from the lungs (TPD). These signals are caused by pulsation of&#xD;
      blood vessels in the lung tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovations in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The software processing of the reflected ultra-sound waves from the lung rendering a&#xD;
           reproducible, clear and strong signal in sync with the cardiac cycle,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The observation based on pilot studies that blowing hard against resistance during&#xD;
           recording (something called a Valsalva maneuver), affects the lung signal weakening it&#xD;
           and even obliterating it as the pressure rises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that since the signal comes from the blood vessels in the&#xD;
      lung, the pressure at which the recorded signal disappears during the Valsalva maneuver&#xD;
      represents the blood pressure in the lungs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current methods for noninvasive measurement of pulmonary arterial blood pressure by standard&#xD;
      echo-doppler equipment are fraught with uncertainty. So much so that patients being screened&#xD;
      and followed for pulmonary arterial hypertension require right heart catheterization. An&#xD;
      invasive and uncomfortable and potentially dangerous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to confirm our preliminary observation that there is good correlation&#xD;
      between Valsalva maneuver pressure and pulmonary arterial blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients undergoing right heart catheterization for clinical reasons will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study itself is short, about 30 minutes, painless and done with the patient either&#xD;
      sitting up in bed or semi-reclining. The probe is positioned over the right chest wall and&#xD;
      the patient is requested to successively blow into a mouthpiece at rising pressures, to&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained using TPD to asses pulmonary arterial pressure will be compared to the&#xD;
      results obtained at catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is part of the development phase of the technology.&#xD;
