  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each potential subject will be screened before the start of the study to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility for participation. Just prior to vaccination, a 10 mL venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken from each eligible subject, for baseline titration of circulating anti-HA antibodies.&#xD;
      Immediately thereafter, each subject received one dose of vaccine (0.5 mL) by intramuscular&#xD;
      injection into the upper arm. Subjects will be asked to stay at the site for 30 minutes&#xD;
      post-vaccination to observe for immediate reaction. Subjects will be monitored for adverse&#xD;
      events during the study. At three weeks (±3 days) after the vaccination, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to return to the site for final collection of blood samples.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity profiles for influenza virus vaccine strains (2010-2011 season) of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline for anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibodies by hemagglutinaton inhibition (HAI) at 21 days post immunization</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-one days after vaccination, serum samples will be taken and tested for anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibodies by hemagglutinaton inhibition (HAI), and assays will be performed at Adimmune Corporation designated central laboratory. Subjects will be considered to be seronegative if serum HAI titer&lt;1:10. The seroconversion is defined as the post-vaccination serum at least 40 for whom had negative pre-vaccination or a fourfold or greater increase in HAI titers in subjects who had positive pre-vaccination serum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded on diary cards(a grid of check boxes for each event and each day) during the immediate post-vaccination period by all participants. In general, reactogenicity events will be recorded for 7 days after vaccination. The selection of the events to be collected systematically is based on events expected to occur with wild-type influenza infection.&#xD;
In regard to the long term safety of the study vaccine, the significant and/or serious adverse event(s) will be recorded during the 6 months follow up after vaccination.</description>
