  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Status EPILEPTICUS (SE) is a major medical emergency. The incidence per 100,000 population&#xD;
      has been estimated at 9.9 episodes in Europe and 41 episodes in the US. The overall morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality associated with convulsive SE (CSE) is 60% at three months. The alteration of&#xD;
      functional prognosis of these patients is more conventionally attributed to the cause than to&#xD;
      CSE itself. Longer seizure duration, progression to refractory status EPILEPTICUS and&#xD;
      presence of cerebral insult are strong factors independently associated with a poor&#xD;
      functional outcome. These three factors offer may be amenable to improvement and hope for&#xD;
      preventive strategies. Current guidelines recommend the use of anticonvulsant treatment whose&#xD;
      goal is prompt cessation of clinical and electrical seizures. None of these treatments has&#xD;
      demonstrated NEUROPROTECTICE property. Therapeutic moderate hypothermia (between 32 and 34 °&#xD;
      C) showed interest in neuroprotection of post anoxic coma patients after a cardiovascular&#xD;
      arrest on ventricular fibrillation by reducing morbidity and mortality in about 20% without&#xD;
      major side effects. This technique has been used successfully in various pathologies such as&#xD;
      stroke or traumatic brain injury. Pathophysiological mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis&#xD;
      and neurotoxicity induced by persistence of seizures can be blocked by therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia. Recent work on experimental models of SE demonstrated neuroprotective and&#xD;
      anticonvulsant interest of therapeutic hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia has also been&#xD;
      successfully used in some cases of particularly refractory CSE. Its early use in patients&#xD;
      with SE would have a double interest: neuroprotective and anticonvulsant. There is currently&#xD;
      no published studies or ongoing to determine the interest of its early use in patients with&#xD;
      CSE.&#xD;

      Thus, the current study AIMAS at evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of a&#xD;
      procedure of moderate hypothermia therapy, between 32 ° and 34 ° C for 24 hours, to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality at 3 months (+ / - 1 week) in mechanically ventilated ICU patients&#xD;
      with convulsive status EPILEPTICUS.&#xD;
