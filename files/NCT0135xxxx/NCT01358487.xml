      The purpose of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to study whether individuals WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED will participate&#xD;
           in an online study to prevent clinical depression and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to estimate the percentage of participants who will complete online assessments at 1, 3,&#xD;
           and 6 months when receiving either a) email reminders + monetary online incentives or b)&#xD;
           email reminders + monetary incentives + phone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: RECRUITMENT IS COMPLETED.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2002, NIMH released an initiative that called upon researchers to improve psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions for unipolar and bipolar depression. The Workgroup charged with this task&#xD;
      recommended that researchers consider the &quot;development of interventions that PREVENT onset&#xD;
      and recurrence of clinical episodes in at-risk populations and [the] development of&#xD;
      user-friendly interventions and nontraditional delivery methods to increase access to&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions&quot; (Hollon et al., 2002, p. 610). The overall goal of this&#xD;
      research program aims to address these two priorities by adapting an empirically-validated&#xD;
      depression intervention to the Internet. The current research study will eventually provide&#xD;
      an online site to study whether clinical episodes of depression can be prevented by making&#xD;
      the online Website available to people who are NOT currently depressed, but may be at risk&#xD;
      for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: the NIMH-funded pilot study. For Study 1, the investigators will conduct usability&#xD;
      testing with 60 participants (half English-speaking and half Spanish-speaking) recruited at&#xD;
      San Francisco General Hospital with the sole purpose of providing feedback on the Healthy&#xD;
      Mood Management Project Website being developed. The investigators will not be testing the&#xD;
      intervention itself on these usability testing participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then recruit 150 participants (half English-speaking [NOW COMPLETED]&#xD;
      and half Spanish-speaking [STILL RECRUITING]) WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY DEPRESSED to use the&#xD;
      Healthy Mood Management Project Website online. In this part of the study the investigators&#xD;
      will compare follow-up completion rates obtained by (email reminders + monetary incentives)&#xD;
      versus (email reminders + monetary incentives + phone call follow-ups). All participants will&#xD;
      get automatic email reminders with links to return to the study site to fill out FU surveys&#xD;
      at 1, 3, and 6 months. All participants will also be offered monetary incentives that can be&#xD;
      obtained online. In addition, half of the participants (chosen at random) will receive phone&#xD;
      calls if they do not complete follow-up surveys online. This will allow us to determine&#xD;
      whether the phone call follow-ups significantly improve follow-up rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monetary incentives will be provided as online gift certificates to Amazon.com. The&#xD;
      incentives will be provided by sending the participant a code which allows the user to&#xD;
      purchase products (books, etc.) up to the amount provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups to be compared are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Email reminders + incentives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Email reminders + incentives + phone calls (to collect data if not done online)&#xD;
