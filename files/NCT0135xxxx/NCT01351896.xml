      This phase II trial studies the effect of lenalidomide and vaccine in treating patients with&#xD;
      early-stage asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;
      Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It may&#xD;
      also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
      Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving&#xD;
      lenalidomide together with vaccine therapy may make a stronger immune response and kill more&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of early-stage, high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      patients achieving a response (&gt;= 4-fold increase from baseline and/or antibody&#xD;
      concentrations &gt;= 0.35 ug/mL in 6 of 7 type-specific anti-pneumococcal antibody levels) after&#xD;
      2 doses of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugated vaccine (Prevnar 13, PCV13 [pneumococcal&#xD;
      polyvalent vaccine]) administered concurrent with versus sequential to low-dose lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete response (CR) rate after 2 years of lenalidomide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to first treatment (TFT), defined as the time from diagnosis to&#xD;
      first non-lenalidomide therapy for progressive CLL as described by International Workshop on&#xD;
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the incidence of infection and invasive pneumococcal infections following&#xD;
      treatment with the PCV13 vaccine and either concurrent or sequential lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the frequency of humoral and cellular immune response to CLL tumor antigens&#xD;
      following treatment with the PCV13 vaccine and either concurrent or sequential lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the safety and toxicity associated with long-term lenalidomide exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To perform correlative pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies and correlate these&#xD;
      with vaccine/tumor immunologic and disease response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (concurrent PCV13 and lenalidomide): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO)&#xD;
      once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 24 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive 13-valent&#xD;
      protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 of courses 3&#xD;
      and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (sequential PCV13 and lenalidomide): Patients receive PCV13 IM on days 1 and 78 (cycles&#xD;
      1 and 3). Patients also receive low-dose lenalidomide as in arm 1 beginning on day 1 of cycle&#xD;
      4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 24 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal&#xD;
             exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had any treatment for their CLL/SLL, including but not limited to&#xD;
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy, prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No corticosteroid use will be permitted within two weeks prior to study, except for&#xD;
             maintenance therapy for a non-malignant disease; maintenance therapy dose may not&#xD;
             exceed 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet consensus criteria for the treatment of CLL/SLL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (within 6 months of study entry) of deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) are not eligible; patients with a distant&#xD;
             history (greater than 6 months before study entry) of venous thromboembolic disease&#xD;
             are eligible, but should receive prophylactic aspirin or low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributable to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to thalidomide, lenalidomide or any component of PCV7 or PCV13,&#xD;
             including the diphtheria toxoid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject is considered&#xD;
             by his or her physician to have a 2 year survival expectation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is an&#xD;
             immunomodulatory agent (IMID) with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy will be eligible if they otherwise meet required hematologic parameters and&#xD;
             are not receiving an antiviral agent with known or potential interaction with&#xD;
             lenalidomide; because the primary aim of this study is to measure the immune response&#xD;
             to pneumococcal vaccination, only patients with CD4 cell counts &gt;= 200 and viral load&#xD;
             &lt; 50 will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated for autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia within the last 6 months or are direct antiglobulin test/Coombs test&#xD;
             or indirect antiglobulin test positive at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have developed erythema nodosum characterized by a desquamating rash&#xD;
             while taking thalidomide or similar drugs in the past are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the potential for H2-blockers to modulate antibody response to pneumococcal&#xD;
             vaccine, patients must discontinue treatment with H2-blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine,&#xD;
             etc.) prior to beginning protocol therapy&#xD;
