  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When shallow tubewells replaced highly contaminated surface water as the primary source of&#xD;
      drinking water in Bangladesh in the late 20th century, contemporary studies demonstrated no&#xD;
      reduction in diarrheal disease with this improvement in water source. This lack of&#xD;
      improvement in transitioning to tubewells is consistent with the lack of significant health&#xD;
      gains observed in intervention studies focusing on water quality improvements at the source.&#xD;
      In contrast, high quality intervention studies that improve water quality at the point of use&#xD;
      through treatment of water in households show a 39% reduction in diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is within a typical setting in rural Bangladesh where&#xD;
      households use shallow tubewell water for drinking. The investigators will randomly assign&#xD;
      1800 households who have a child between the ages of six months and two years to one of three&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 will receive a safe water storage vessel with a lid and a narrow mouth/tap&#xD;
      and Aquatabs, an effervescent water purification tablet that utilizes sodium&#xD;
      dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) as the chlorine donor. Group 2 will only receive a safe water&#xD;
      storage vessel with a lid and a narrow mouth/tap. Group 3 will receive no water intervention&#xD;
      and continue their standard habits and practices. Every month a field research assistant will&#xD;
      visit each participating household and collect information on the prevalence of diarrhea&#xD;
      among children between the ages of six months and two years, as well as children between the&#xD;
      ages of two and five years if present in the household. Diarrhea prevalence in the 48 hours&#xD;
      and 7 days preceding the visit will be recorded. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea between the following groups: (1) households that receive&#xD;
      chlorine and storage container versus households that only receive storage container to&#xD;
      assess the effect of chlorination, (2) households that only receive storage container versus&#xD;
      households that receive no intervention to assess the effect of safe storage, and (3)&#xD;
      households that receive chlorine and storage container versus households that receive no&#xD;
      intervention to assess the combined effect of chlorination and safe storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drinking water from shallow tubewells that are intermittently contaminated with enteric&#xD;
      pathogens contributes importantly to diarrhea among children in rural Bangladesh.&#xD;

      Setting: The investigators will conduct the study in the Fulbaria upazila of Mymensingh&#xD;
      district, where groundwater chemistry has been proven to be amenable to disinfection with&#xD;
      chlorine. Groundwater in many areas in Bangladesh is rich in iron and other ions that react&#xD;
      with chlorine and limit its capacity to provide adequate disinfection. Groundwater testing in&#xD;
      Fulbaria has shown that chlorination works effectively at this location, as discussed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop Intervention: This is an efficacy study, i.e. it is trying to answer the question: if&#xD;
      tubewell water were effectively chlorinated and/or safely stored in homes, what would be the&#xD;
      impact on childhood diarrhea. To efficiently answer this question, the investigators will&#xD;
      strive to optimize the use of the intervention in those households randomized to receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Chlorinating water has been shown to be an effective way of disinfecting water&#xD;
      in the home (Arnold and Colford, 2007). The investigators will use Aquatabs for chlorination,&#xD;
      which are effervescent water purification tablets that utilize sodium dichloroisocyanurate&#xD;
      (NaDCC) as the chlorine donor. NaDCC was judged to be a safe and appropriate treatment for&#xD;
      water by the World Health Organization (Clasen and Edmondson, 2006) and has been tested and&#xD;
      found acceptable to a community of urban residents in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Clasen et al.,&#xD;
      2007a). Aquatabs are also easier to store, handle and correctly dose than liquid forms of&#xD;
      chlorine (Clasen and Edmondson, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groundwater Testing: To optimize the use of Aquatabs and determine the appropriate dose to be&#xD;
      assigned to study participants, the investigators collected water samples from 52 shallow&#xD;
      tubewells geographically spread out over all 13 unions in Fulbaria. Water was collected in 5L&#xD;
      and 10L jerry cans with a narrow mouth and lid. One Aquatabs tablet was added to each vessel,&#xD;
      resulting in a free chlorine dose of 2 mg/L in the 10L container and 4 mg/L in the 5L&#xD;
      container. Remaining chlorine residual in the vessels was measured half an hour and 24 hours&#xD;
      after the addition of the tablet to assess whether it meets the target criteria of having a&#xD;
      minimum residual of 0.2 mg/L at 24 hours (to ensure adequate disinfection) and a maximum&#xD;
      residual of 2 mg/L at half an hour (to minimize taste and odor concerns). It should be noted&#xD;
      that the 2 mg/L taste/odor threshold the investigators are targeting is well under the WHO&#xD;
      health limit of 5 mg/L. Based on the testing results, the investigators determined that using&#xD;
      one Aquatabs with a 10L jerry can provides the optimal chlorine dose in Fulbaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Groups: The study will have the following three arms, which will allow us to&#xD;
      establish the respective roles of household water treatment and safe water storage in&#xD;
      preventing diarrheal illness in children in the rural Bangladesh setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - Aquatabs and Safe Storage Vessel: Households in this group will receive Aquatabs&#xD;
      for water purification, a safe water storage container to prevent contamination during&#xD;
      storage in the home, and training and encouragement to treat and safely store their water&#xD;
      using the provided products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Safe Storage Vessel: Households in this group will receive a safe water storage&#xD;
      container, and training and encouragement to safely store their water using the provided&#xD;
      products. If our study shows that treatment of tubewell water at the household level is&#xD;
      effective in protecting children's health, they will receive a six-month supply of water&#xD;
      treatment tablets at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - Standard Practices: Households in this group will not receive any water treatment&#xD;
      or storage intervention during the study. They will continue their usual water collection and&#xD;
      storage practices. If our study shows that treatment and safe storage of tubewell water at&#xD;
      the household level is effective in protecting children's health, they will receive the same&#xD;
      safe water storage container as Groups 1 and 2 as well as a six-month supply of water&#xD;
      treatment tablets at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Households: Households to participate in the study will be recruited through a&#xD;
      systematic sample from a subset of villages in Fulbaria selected based on field factors such&#xD;
      as ease of transport and proximity to the field office. The inclusion criteria will include&#xD;
      (1) using a shallow tubewell that is free from iron complaints as the bari's primary source&#xD;
      of drinking water and (2) having a child between the ages of six months and two years living&#xD;
      in the bari. The primary caregiver in the household that has the child in the target range&#xD;
      will be recruited into the study. If there are multiple households in the bari that have a&#xD;
      child between the ages of six months and two years, one of the households will be randomly&#xD;
      selected and the primary caregiver in the selected household will be recruited. Recruited&#xD;
      households will be randomized into one of the three study arms by block randomization through&#xD;
      a randomly generated, pre-established sequence that will determine which intervention will be&#xD;
      allocated to the household.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promotion of Interventions: The intervention will continue for five months. At the first&#xD;
      visit to the households, Groups 1 and 2 will be provided with a plastic water storage&#xD;
      container with a lid and a narrow mouth/tap, and Group 1 will also be given a one-month&#xD;
      supply of tablets. Households will be taught through demonstrations and a flipchart with&#xD;
      illustrations how to use the tablets as well as how to properly use and clean the safe&#xD;
      storage containers, and they will be encouraged to use them regularly. They will also be&#xD;
      given an instructions sheet with illustrations that will be left at a visible spot in the&#xD;
      household and serve as a reminder to clean the containers and if applicable add the water&#xD;
      treatment tablets. A field research assistant who is not part of the evaluation team will&#xD;
      visit the household once per month to encourage regular water treatment and safe storage,&#xD;
      replenish the supply of tablets and address any issues with the maintenance and cleaning of&#xD;
      the safe storage vessels. The rest of the protocol has been written assuming that households&#xD;
      will receive monthly promotion visits. However, if the pilot study shows that more frequent,&#xD;
      intensive promotion leads to significantly better uptake, in the full-scale study the&#xD;
      investigators will consider replacing the monthly promotion frequency with more frequent&#xD;
      promotion visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: There will be one baseline visit and five follow-up visits to participating&#xD;
      households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit: The investigators will conduct a baseline survey including demographics,&#xD;
      household description, socioeconomic status, pre-intervention water, sanitation and hygiene&#xD;
      habits and baseline levels of diarrhea in children between the ages of six months and two&#xD;
      years. If there are any children in a recruited household that are between the ages of two&#xD;
      and five, the investigators will collect diarrhea data on them as well to allow comparison of&#xD;
      our results to other findings in the literature that focus on children under the age of five.&#xD;
      During the baseline visit, the investigators will assess the microbial quality of the&#xD;
      tubewell and stored water for each study household using the hydrogen sulphide (H2S) test.&#xD;
      Tubewell and stored water samples from a subset of 150 households (50 from each study arm)&#xD;
      will be analyzed for total coliforms and E. coli using membrane filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits: Every month a field research assistant will visit each participating&#xD;
      household to conduct a follow-up survey and collect information on the prevalence of diarrhea&#xD;
      among children between the ages of six months and five years in the 48 hours as well as 7&#xD;
      days preceding the visit. The investigators are using a 48-hour recall because this typically&#xD;
      provides a more valid estimate than longer recall periods which lead to under-reporting of&#xD;
      health outcomes (Alam et al., 1989, Ramakrishnan et al., 1999, Feikin et al., 2010). The&#xD;
      investigators are also using a 7-day recall because recent findings indicate that while this&#xD;
      longer recall period leads to only minimal bias in terms of the accuracy of recall it can&#xD;
      result in significant gains of statistical power (Arnold et al., unpublished data). The&#xD;
      investigators will visit households once every month, because more frequent visits provide&#xD;
      little additional statistical power due to correlation of repeated measures on the same&#xD;
      individuals (Schmidt et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the investigators will also collect information on user compliance with the&#xD;
      interventions by asking about type and timing of water treatment practices, counting the&#xD;
      number of remaining tablets and inspecting the water storage facilities, as well as asking&#xD;
      participants when and how they cleaned the storage container. The investigators will also&#xD;
      collect water samples from the tubewell and storage container in households to assess the&#xD;
      microbial quality of the water, explore the extent of contamination at the source versus in&#xD;
      the home and gauge the effectiveness of the interventions in preventing contamination. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform H2S testing in half of study households and total coliform/E.coli&#xD;
      testing with membrane filtration for a subset of 150 households (50 from each study arm).&#xD;
      Moreover, for each household in the Aquatabs group, the investigators will analyze stored&#xD;
      water samples for residual chlorine concentration to monitor compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Testing: Water samples will be placed on ice and transported to the Fulbaria field&#xD;
      office where the appropriate tests will be conducted by the field microbiologists. All&#xD;
      testing will be performed promptly upon transporting the samples to the field office. The&#xD;
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S) test is a simple low-cost test (Sobsey and Pfaender, 2003). Twenty ml&#xD;
      of water will be added in H2S bottle and incubated at room temperature for 24-48 hours. If&#xD;
      the colour of the water changes to black, it will indicate that the water is contaminated&#xD;
      with coliform which will indicate that the water is unfit for human consumption. For membrane&#xD;
      filtration, collected water samples will be quantitatively tested for total coliforms and E.&#xD;
      coli using the DelAgua kit with MI Broth (Whatman Inc, New Jersey, USA). For residual&#xD;
      chlorine testing, the investigators will use the n,n-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD)&#xD;
      colorimetric method which is part of the DelAgua kit.&#xD;
