      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can cause liver damage. They can also cause serious illness,&#xD;
      including liver cancer, and even death. This study will follow people who have hepatitis B or&#xD;
      hepatitis C. The purpose is to understand more about how these viruses affect the immune&#xD;
      system over the long term (up to 10 years). The study will also compare how these viruses&#xD;
      affect people who do and do not have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To do a long-term study of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection in people do and do not&#xD;
           have HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age who have hepatitis B or hepatitis C and have a regular&#xD;
      doctor for their medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Those who do not&#xD;
           have a regular doctor to provide medical care during the study will not be able to take&#xD;
           part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have yearly visits with study researchers for up to 10 years. These&#xD;
           tests will be done at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire (optional) on emotions, sexual behaviors, use of alcohol and drugs, and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, including HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue sample collections for those who have had a liver or other tissue biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may leave the study at any time. They will receive the standard of care&#xD;
           from their regular doctor throughout the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic viral hepatitis is a major health problem affecting millions globally. The&#xD;
      immunosuppressed population, especially those with HIV infection, remains at particular risk&#xD;
      and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the US and worldwide,&#xD;
      with high rates in those who are cirrhotic, and is the 10th most common cause of death in the&#xD;
      US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-hepatitis coinfection is problematic in that HIV patients are currently living longer on&#xD;
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).. Those who are coinfected with HBV and/or HCV&#xD;
      progress more rapidly to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Further research on the epidemiology,&#xD;
      optimal screening and new therapeutic approaches in persons with advanced liver disease, in&#xD;
      the setting of effective treatment for viral hepatitis is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to characterize viral liver disease and&#xD;
      factors affecting the natural history of viral liver disease in persons with and without HIV&#xD;
      with an emphasis on those living in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The cohort will be&#xD;
      designed to study research questions with respect to liver disease, disease pathogenesis&#xD;
      using genomics, proteomics, and immunologic disease models. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      study of the immunopathogenesis of HBV and HCV disease progression in HIV infected subjects.&#xD;
      In addition, this is an invaluable opportunity to determine the prevalence and risk factors&#xD;
      associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, the longterm effects of HCV&#xD;
      clearance with DAAs, along with biomarker profile(s) for diagnosis and outcome. Moreover,&#xD;
      this will serve as a catchment protocol to select appropriate participants for novel HBV and&#xD;
      HCV therapeutic trials.&#xD;
