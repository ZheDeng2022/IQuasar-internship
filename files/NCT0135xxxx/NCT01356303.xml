    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label clinical study prospectively enrolling 40 metastatic patients&#xD;
      with non small cell lung cancer. The study will enroll patients at King Abdulaziz Medical&#xD;
      City, Riyadh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-sites will be open for patient accrual in selected centers in the Kingdom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cisplatin/docetaxel is established standard in the first line management of metastatic&#xD;
      non small cell lung cancer in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of this regimen was not studied systematically in Middle Eastern population. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of this regimen in our patient population&#xD;
