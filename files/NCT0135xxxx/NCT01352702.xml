    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether dabigatran reduces clopidogrel mediated ADP&#xD;
      induced platelet aggregation measured by MEA as compared to phenprocoumon after a two-week&#xD;
      treatment with either agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (OAC) is the standard care for reducing&#xD;
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Just recently the direct, competitive thrombin&#xD;
      inhibitor dabigatran has been approved by the FDA for stroke prevention in patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. In a large multicenter trial it was shown that dabigatran was at least&#xD;
      as effective as Vitamin K antagonists in the prevention of stroke without an increase of&#xD;
      major hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 % of patients who undergo coronary stenting and need DAT with aspirin and&#xD;
      clopidogrel need in addition OAC for the reduction of cardiac, cerebral and systemic&#xD;
      thromboembolic events5. These patients will therefore need triple therapy, a therapy which is&#xD;
      associated with increased bleeding complications. Although phenprocoumon given solely without&#xD;
      clopidogrel has no impact on ADP induced platelet aggregation, it has been shown that&#xD;
      phenprocoumon significantly attenuates the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADP induced platelet aggregation measured with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA)&#xD;
      is a marker for the efficacy of the clopidogrel therapy and (i) a low response (AUC ≥ 468) to&#xD;
      clopidogrel has been associated with an increase of ischemic events such as stent thrombosis&#xD;
      and (ii) patients with an enhanced response to clopidogrel (AUC ≤ 188) have higher bleeding&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore crucial to evaluate whether an additional antithrombotic therapy such as&#xD;
      dabigatran alters clopidogrel mediated ADP induced platelet aggregation. While it has been&#xD;
      shown that intravenous administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin further&#xD;
      reduces ADP induced platelet aggregation in patients on clopidogrel therapy, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether dabigatran has also an impact on ADP induced platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of dabigatran on ADP induced platelet aggregation we will randomize&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation and the need for oral anticoagulation and current&#xD;
      clopidogrel therapy for a two-week treatment with either dabigatran or phenprocoumon and we&#xD;
      hypothesize that dabigatran is superior to phenprocoumon in the reduction of ADP induced&#xD;
      platelet aggregation. Patients who are not concomitantly treated with clopidogrel are being&#xD;
      studied in a different trial with a similar study design (Dabi ADP-1).&#xD;
