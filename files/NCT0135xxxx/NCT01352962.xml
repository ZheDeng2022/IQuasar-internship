      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gemcitabine and carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used to treat several types of cancer,&#xD;
      including cancer of the pancreas, bladder, ovaries, and lung. Lenalidomide, a drug that&#xD;
      prevents the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, has been approved for treatment of&#xD;
      certain blood cancers, but it has not yet been approved for use in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and carboplatin. Researchers are interested in determining the safest and most&#xD;
      effective dose of this combined form of chemotherapy for solid tumors, particularly for&#xD;
      urothelial cancer (tumors of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and&#xD;
           carboplatin as a treatment for solid tumor cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and&#xD;
           carboplatin as a treatment for urothelial (bladder) cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have&#xD;
           not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with urothelial cancer that&#xD;
           has not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,&#xD;
           and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with urothelial cancer will receive lenalidomide alone for the first 14&#xD;
           days of a 21-day cycle before starting the first full treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin on day 1&#xD;
           only, of every 21-day treatment cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily at home for the&#xD;
           first 14 days of each cycle. Participants will be asked to take aspirin or other&#xD;
           medications to prevent the possibility of blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may receive up to six cycles of treatment with this combination. If after&#xD;
           six cycles the cancer has not grown or has shrunk, participants may continue to take&#xD;
           lenalidomide alone for an additional 6 months (total of 12 months of therapy) or until&#xD;
           the cancer recurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with blood samples, physical examinations, and tumor&#xD;
           imaging studies through the cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the end of the last treatment cycle, participants will have followup visits every&#xD;
           3 months for the next 18 months, then every 6 months for another 18 months, and then&#xD;
           yearly.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine plus carboplatin is an accepted first-line therapy in patients unfit for&#xD;
           cisplatin chemotherapy with metastatic urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumor&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both non-clinical and clinical data support targeting angiogenesis in urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma and other solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both non-clinical and clinical data support targeting the immune system in urothelial&#xD;
           carcinoma and other solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide has both anti-angiogenic and potent immunomodulatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide has been safely coadministered with cytotoxic therapy in patients with&#xD;
           solid tumors and non-clinical studies demonstrate possible synergy with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      lenalidomide which can be safely combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors that are unfit for cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily evaluate the progression free survival, response rate and overall&#xD;
           survival in patients with advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors treated with the&#xD;
           combination of lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of treatment on a set of 4 laboratory parameters (including&#xD;
           Treg, sIL-2R, VEGF and CTC.) in the expansion cohort of patients with bladder cancer&#xD;
           treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients with histologic documentation of an advanced solid tumor with&#xD;
           unresectable or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urothelial cancer patients should be ineligible for cisplatin based on one or more of&#xD;
           the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 mL/min (but greater than or equal to 30 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Solitary kidney&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior combination systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease allowed for patients&#xD;
           with UC, except single agent radiosensitizing chemotherapy (not considered prior&#xD;
           systemic therapy), or prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (including&#xD;
           cisplatin-based) is allowed provided if it was completed (Bullet) 6 months prior to&#xD;
           diagnosis of metastatic disease; or prior intravesical therapy is permitted. Up to 1&#xD;
           line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is permitted for non UC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory evaluation must meet safety requirements, including a creatinine clearance&#xD;
           greater than 30 using the Cockroft-Gault formula; may not be pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single-institution phase I study of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8)&#xD;
           and carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) plus escalating doses of lenalidomide (GCL) in patients&#xD;
           with advanced/metastatic UC and other solid tumors ineligible for cisplatin therapy.&#xD;
           Lenalidomide will be administered once daily on days 1 through 14 every 21 days at&#xD;
           escalating dose. An expansion cohort at the MTD of an additional 15 patients with&#xD;
           bladder cancer will be enrolled in order to determine whether there are differences&#xD;
           between pre-treatment and post-treatment levels of the following parameters: Treg, sIL-&#xD;
           2R, VEGF and CTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin in combination&#xD;
           with lenalidomide unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients&#xD;
           who achieve stable disease, a partial response, or a complete response after completion&#xD;
           of 6 cycles will be eligible to continue lenalidomide alone at the same dose and&#xD;
           schedule until disease progression. Restaging evaluations will occur after every 3&#xD;
           cycles of treatment (approximately 9 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on a standard 3+3 design with 4 dose levels per cohort, a maximum of 24 patients,&#xD;
           with the potential for an additional 3 patients with CrCl&gt;60 mL/min, may need to be&#xD;
           evaluated to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) of lenalidomide in this combination therapy. With an expansion cohort of 15&#xD;
           patients at MTD, a total of 42 subjects may be enrolled over 1.5 -3 years.&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the possibility of infection reactivation, patients who are known seropositive&#xD;
             for or who have active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are NOT&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
