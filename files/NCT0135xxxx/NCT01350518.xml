  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether increased intake of dietary fiber&#xD;
      during a 12-week, low-calorie weight loss intervention affects abdominal fat change and&#xD;
      improves cardiovascular risk factors in African-American women more than a standard weight&#xD;
      loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are testing two main hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Women in the high dietary fiber intervention group will lose significantly more&#xD;
      abdominal fat around their organs than women in the standard fiber group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Women in the high dietary fiber intervention group will have lower blood&#xD;
      pressure, fasting glucose, fasting lipids and inflammatory factors at 3-months compared to&#xD;
      women in the control group.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To test, in a small clinical trial of 30 pre-menopausal African American&#xD;
      women, whether increased intake of dietary fiber embedded in a 12 week weight loss&#xD;
      intervention will reduce VAT accumulation more than a standard weight loss intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Women in the high dietary fiber intervention group will lose significantly more&#xD;
      VAT than women in the standard fiber group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To test, in a small clinical trial of 30 pre-menopausal African American&#xD;
      women, whether increased intake of dietary fiber embedded in a 12 week weight loss&#xD;
      intervention will improve cardiovascular risk factors more than a standard weight loss&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Women in the high dietary fiber intervention group will have lower blood&#xD;
      pressure, fasting glucose, fasting lipids and inflammatory factors at 3-months compared to&#xD;
      women in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To characterize our ability to recruit and retain 30 African-American,&#xD;
      premenopausal women to a 12 week weight loss intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine participant compliance with serum and other measurement&#xD;
      evaluations and dietary compliance logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized masked controlled trial design of 30 pre-menopausal African&#xD;
      American women aged 20-50 years with BMI ≥ 30 kg/ m2 and waist circumference &gt; 88 cm&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of fiber supplementation on change in abdominal fat deposition. The&#xD;
      fiber intervention will be nested within a 3-month weight loss trial. The placebo and active&#xD;
      interventions will appear identical to the participant. The only person who will know of the&#xD;
      intervention (fiber vs. placebo) is the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) (former General Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center) Nutrition staff. All women will have ~ 800 kcal/day calorie restriction, for&#xD;
      12 weeks, designed lead to 0.5 kg - 0.9 kg per wk weight loss or 9-18 kg lost during the&#xD;
      study. Diets will all contain at least 0.8 grams of protein/kg IBW and be limited to 15 grams&#xD;
      total fiber. Calorie restriction will occur either through CRU prepared meal replacements or&#xD;
      participant instituted calorie restriction learned via nutritional education sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized and started on the 12-week study intervention on a rolling&#xD;
      basis. At any one time, there will be 8 women enrolled in the study. The enrollment will&#xD;
      continue until all 30 women are started. The women will not be held and then started as a&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although enrollment will be rolling, participants will be randomized in groups of eight to&#xD;
      ensure that the capacity of the metabolic kitchen is always maintained. The randomization&#xD;
      will be to one of four groups (1- intervention/feeding; 2- intervention/nutritional&#xD;
      education; 3- placebo/feeding; 4-placebo/nutritional education). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of these four groups at the close of her baseline visit. Randomization will&#xD;
      occur via envelope. There will be an envelope for fiber intervention and one for caloric&#xD;
      restriction method. The intervention envelope will contain four fiber cards (marked B) and&#xD;
      four placebo cards (marked A). The calorie restriction envelope will contain for meal&#xD;
      replacement cards (marked D) and four nutrition education cards (marked C). Participants will&#xD;
      be given randomization assignment by CRU staff. The PI and participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      the fiber intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two main settings, the CRU and each participant's home. All&#xD;
      clinical measurements, nutritional education, meal replacement pick- up and distribution&#xD;
      dietary supplements will take place at the CRU. The CRU has agreed to: 1) perform CT, RMR,&#xD;
      and anthropomorphic measures as indicated for screening, baseline and 12-week follow-up; 2)&#xD;
      draw, process and assay blood, as indicated, for screening, baseline and 12-week follow-up;&#xD;
      2) to provide two nutritional education sessions, two weeks apart (for the nutrition&#xD;
      education group); 3) to prepare and distribute lunch and dinner (for the meal replacement&#xD;
      group); 4) prepare and distribute daily fiber supplements for all participants; and 5) to&#xD;
      prepare, distribute and collect weekly food compliance logs from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Fiber Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefiber® powder will be used as our dietary supplement intervention. Benefiber® powder&#xD;
      contains wheat dextrin, a 100% natural fiber. It's taste-free, sugar-free, dissolves&#xD;
      completely in noncarbonated beverages and soft foods, and won't thicken. Benefiber® powder&#xD;
      can be mixed into any hot or cold beverage such as water, coffee, or juice; into soft foods&#xD;
      such as applesauce, pudding or yogurt; or cooked into recipes for such foods as muffins,&#xD;
      sauces or soups, without affecting the taste or consistency. Benefiber® powder is not&#xD;
      recommended for carbonated beverages. Benefiber has a shelf life of 2 years when stored at a&#xD;
      controlled room temperature of 20-25°C (68-77°F). Benefiber® Powder, which contains less than&#xD;
      20 ppm of gluten and is therefore considered &quot;gluten-free,&quot; based on both the FDA and the&#xD;
      Codex Alimentarius Commission's proposed definition of less than 20 ppm. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive 3 supplement packets to be consumed per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each active dietary supplement packet contains 8 grams of Benefiber® powder and 3 grams of&#xD;
      TRUE® lemon flavoring, a 100% natural with no artificial ingredients or sweeteners,&#xD;
      preservatives, sodium or gluten. The TRUE® Lemon product is made from cold-pressed and&#xD;
      crystallized lemons which contain 0 calories and 0g carbohydrates. Each placebo dietary&#xD;
      supplement packet contains 8 grams of Splenda and 3 grams of true lemon sweetener. Each&#xD;
      packet is designed to be added to 8 oz of fluid. The three packets should be consumed each&#xD;
      day in a total of 24 fluid ounces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Loss Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a daily caloric restriction of ~ 800 kcal in order to facilitate a&#xD;
      loss of 0.5 kg - 0.9 kg per week weight loss or a 9-18 kg loss during the 12-week study&#xD;
      period. All participants will undergo a resting metabolic rate determination using&#xD;
      MedGraphics Ultima™ metabolic cart and the accompanying Breeze software. Based on the caloric&#xD;
      need determined to maintain weight, a new caloric plan, 800 kcal lower than basal needs, will&#xD;
      be determined. At minimum, however, all women will receive 1000 kcal per day. Once caloric&#xD;
      goals are determined, these will be achieved with through CRU-prepared meal replacements or&#xD;
      participant- instituted calorie restriction techniques learned via nutritional education&#xD;
      group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receiving nutritional education will two individual sessions (spaced approx. 2&#xD;
      weeks apart). The nutritional sessions will focus on knowledge, self-regulation, motivation,&#xD;
      experience and environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be weighed at baseline and then weekly until the close of the study,&#xD;
      week 13. Additionally, all participants will, with CRU-prepared meals, be asked to return&#xD;
      uneaten food, record any foods eaten that were not part of the plan and complete weekly food&#xD;
      compliance logs. Participants with self-directed food selection after nutritional education&#xD;
      will be asked to completed detailed records of foods selected each day. All logs and food&#xD;
      records will be reviewed by the PI and the CRU study dietician. If participants have: 1)&#xD;
      increased weight by ≥ 5 pounds between weigh-in sessions; 2) a trend of weight gain for two&#xD;
      consecutive sessions; or 3) failed to return 2 consecutive food logs; they will be flagged&#xD;
      for additional nutritional counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES Study Outcomes: The primary outcome, change in VAT between baseline and 12 weeks,&#xD;
      will be obtained via repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. The secondary outcomes are change&#xD;
      in CVD risk factors (blood pressure, fasting lipids, insulin sensitivity, C-reactive protein)&#xD;
      and liver attenuation. Abdominal fat mass will be measured at the L4/L5 vertebral regions by&#xD;
      CT. Height and weight will be measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively, and&#xD;
      BMI will be calculated (kg/m2). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be obtained after&#xD;
      a 5-minute rest; the average of the final two of three measurements will be used in analysis.&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples will be collected for the measurement of glucose, insulin, LDL,&#xD;
      HDL,25-OH vitamin D, ghrelin, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein. Insulin resistance will be calculated via a HOMA model. Covariates such as smoking&#xD;
      status, physical activity, alcohol intake, sleep, and depressive symptoms will be ascertained&#xD;
      at baseline.&#xD;
