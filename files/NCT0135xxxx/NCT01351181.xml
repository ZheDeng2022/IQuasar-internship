  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II diabetes is an important condition with a UK prevalence of 3.54% affecting&#xD;
      approximately 2.5 million people across the country. Diabetics have a fivefold increased risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease and over 65% of diabetics will die from coronary heart disease or&#xD;
      stroke. Exercise is one of the management tools along with medication and weight reduction&#xD;
      available to improve diabetic control reducing morbidity and mortality. Exercise promotion&#xD;
      might be more effective at a population level if it could be incorporated in a simple form as&#xD;
      part of pre-existing routine care. This case control study seeks to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of written exercise advice given to Type II diabetics at the time of their annual review. The&#xD;
      study will be open to all Type II diabetics in a single general practice attending their&#xD;
      routine nurse led annual review. The intervention uses leaflets prepared as part of a&#xD;
      previous study the Time2Act study and assessment will be by self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;
      Follow up will be over 12 months but the study design will allow for longer durations.&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of exercise as an intervention but have&#xD;
      often been hospital-based and used exercise interviews as the main intervention rather than&#xD;
      incorporating exercise advice into structures already established in routine Primary Care. If&#xD;
      this study demonstrates that a simple intervention carried out as part of routine care has a&#xD;
      positive effect if only at a low level then disseminating this knowledge across the country&#xD;
      would bring significant benefits to Type II diabetics.&#xD;

      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate whether incorporating a simple low-cost, low&#xD;
      resource intervention into routine diabetic care in General Practice is effective in&#xD;
      producing a sustained change in activity levels across significant numbers of patients. Even&#xD;
      if the change in activity level is small on an individual patient level but is widespread&#xD;
      across the practice's diabetic population then the intervention will be of value. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be measured using a validated self reporting questionnaire (SPAQ-Scottish&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire) to measure changes in the amount of exercise undertaken.&#xD;
      During routine diabetic care a wide range of information is recorded on the clinical system&#xD;
      in part to satisfy QoF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) requirements it will be possible to&#xD;
      further analyse the dataset by parameters such as age, sex and social class as well as seeing&#xD;
      whether there is a change in blood pressure, weight, lipid profile and HbA1C (glycosylated&#xD;
      haemoglobin- a measure of medium term diabetic control). The intervention is simple and if&#xD;
      effective could form part of the routine ongoing care of Type II Diabetics. If extended over&#xD;
      a longer period it might be possible to extract data relating the intervention to illness and&#xD;
      death rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of an intervention, from a known Health Care Professional in a familiar setting,&#xD;
      at an interview where the patient's expectation is to receive advice and hopefully therefore&#xD;
      be receptive to that advice, with regular reinforcement as part of routine care may mean that&#xD;
      the initial intervention can be straight forward. This study seeks to answer this question by&#xD;
      deliberately choosing written information which was in an unsuccessful arm of a previous&#xD;
      study ~ the Time2Act study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original study design was to record baseline activity levels in the target population&#xD;
      with an appropriate assessment tool, carry the intervention and then record any changes in&#xD;
      activity levels and biometric and biochemical parameters at intervals . This could have been&#xD;
      considered as an audit and part of 'normal care' and therefore some investigators might argue&#xD;
      that formal patient consent was not required. However following discussions with the team at&#xD;
      Queen Mary's University of London (QMUL) this would weaken the study as it would be difficult&#xD;
      to assess the effects of any confounding factors. The presence of a control group would make&#xD;
      the study more valid. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) would have been the ideal design&#xD;
      but constraints of time and outcomes measured by a questionnaire would have required a larger&#xD;
      than practical study of long duration. A Case Control study was therefore chosen and will act&#xD;
      as a pilot for follow up work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Type II diabetics over 18 attending the Diabetic Annual Review (DAR) will be eligible to&#xD;
      be included in the research. The DAR is offered between 3 and 12 months from initial&#xD;
      diagnosis. This will exclude newly diagnosed diabetics who might have undergone DESMOND&#xD;
      courses. Type II diabetics under 18 are followed up by the paediatric team and would not&#xD;
      normally be called for review in the practice. Other exclusion criteria relate to conditions&#xD;
      where the patient is either unable to understand the advice given or physically unable to&#xD;
      follow it. Patients with dementia who are physically able to participate will not be excluded&#xD;
      as long as consent can be obtained from them or their next of kin or legal representative.&#xD;
      Input from their General Practitioner (GP) in the surgery will be valuable here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be sought from all participants. Consent will be obtained by the site&#xD;
      investigator Dr J D Hill following a written invitation. They will be an opportunity for&#xD;
      individuals to discuss the study face to face with Dr Hill or the registered GP. The GPs will&#xD;
      have had information about the study in writing as well as discussed it at a Practice&#xD;
      meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of activity should be available to all diabetics and it is important that&#xD;
      patients with limited understanding are not excluded. Consent would therefore be sought from&#xD;
      their responsible carer e.g. someone who hold power of attorney or similar instrument.&#xD;
      Pre-notification lists will be passed to the registered GP prior to invitations being sent&#xD;
      out to allow them to exclude inappropriate patients e.g. terminally ill. The main researcher&#xD;
      has experience in assessing capacity in his full time work as a General Practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, Burdens and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      To a degree there is some risk to participants in both arms of the study. The intervention&#xD;
      group who will be encouraged to increase their activity levels could be construed to be at&#xD;
      risk from injury from unaccustomed exertion (e.g. muscle aches) or it may reveal an&#xD;
      underlying undiagnosed pathology (e.g. angina). The advice leaflet has been carefully&#xD;
      designed to provide a graded increase in activity to minimize these risks and participants&#xD;
      will have the opportunity as the study is based in their surgery to seek advice regarding any&#xD;
      unexpected symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of the study the control group will receive 'normal care' in all respects&#xD;
      including general advice to increase activity and access to information from Diabetes UK.&#xD;
      They may perceive this as a lower level of care. Both groups will have increased contact with&#xD;
      the surgery during the study which will be organized in such a way to minimize intrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits are expected in two phases. Initially the intervention group should see a&#xD;
      positive health return on their increased activity which will then be rolled out as part of&#xD;
      normal care across the whole patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling within the surgery is subject to tight controls overseen by the nominated&#xD;
      Caldicott guardian and the practice is compliant with the regulations attached to the IMT DES&#xD;
      (Information Technology Direct Enhanced Service) which is regulated by West Sussex PCT.&#xD;
      Information will be held on the secure Clinical System. Staff handling patient information&#xD;
      will have access to this data as part of their normal duties and will be subject to NHS codes&#xD;
      of confidentiality. For statistical analysis off site patients surgery number (not NHS&#xD;
      number) will be used as an identifier. The only way to trace this back to an individual would&#xD;
      be to have access to the password protected Surgery system. Information which comes to light&#xD;
      during the study indicating a serious risk will be fed back to the main investigator and&#xD;
      thence to the registered GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator as General Practitioner&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period patient contacts will take place where it may be clinically&#xD;
      appropriate to encourage exercise to a study participant. One's primary responsibility is for&#xD;
      patient care independent of the study so advice will not be withheld but any written&#xD;
      information given will be from organizations such as Diabetes UK and not the study leaflet.&#xD;
      Normal care will therefore be maintained. At the end of the study future practice will be&#xD;
      guided by the results.&#xD;
