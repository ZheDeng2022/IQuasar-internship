  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the commonest type of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a&#xD;
      type of cancer of a cell called a lymphocyte which makes up part of the immune system.&#xD;
      Although most patients are cured with chemotherapy used as initial treatment, about 20-30% of&#xD;
      patients still experience relapse. Curing relapsed disease is much less successful, even with&#xD;
      the use of high doses of chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. There is then an urgent need&#xD;
      for effective, new agents to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have&#xD;
      relapsed or who have developed resistance to other forms of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is using a drug called AZD1152 which interferes with the ability of a cancer cell&#xD;
      to divide and grow. It has been used before in patients with other types of cancer, but never&#xD;
      before in lymphoma patients. Responses in other cancers have been seen, particularly in&#xD;
      leukaemia which is a disease related to lymphoma. The investigators are planning to use this&#xD;
      agent in 15 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in which potentially curative&#xD;
      treatments have failed. The main aim is to see whether the drug shows any activity in this&#xD;
      type of lymphoma. This will be mainly assessed using CT and PET scans. The investigators are&#xD;
      also investigating how well a blood test can predict both the response to the drug and the&#xD;
      toxicity of the drug - this is called a biomarker study and forms part of the clinical trial.&#xD;
      The other main aim of the study is to assess the toxicity of the treatment. Previous studies&#xD;
      in humans suggest the drug is reasonably well tolerated, although side effects such as&#xD;
      stomatitis (soreness of the mouth) and suppression of the bone marrow (leading to risk of&#xD;
      infection and bleeding) have been seen.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below Lab Test Value&#xD;
             required Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9g/dL White Blood Count (WBC) ≥ 2x109/L Platelet count ≥&#xD;
             100x109/L Absolute Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0x109/L; Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST&#xD;
