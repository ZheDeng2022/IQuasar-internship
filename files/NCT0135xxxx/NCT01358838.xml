  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Scars can be highly disfiguring and may result in functional impairment and&#xD;
      psychosocial problems. Recently, fractional laser therapy (FLT) has been introduced as a&#xD;
      promising novel treatment modality for scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 10600&#xD;
      nm FLT for the treatment of different types of scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective observer blinded randomised controlled split-lesion trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Thirty consecutive patients, aged at least 18 years, with hypertrophic or&#xD;
      atrophic scars who give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Two similar test regions of the scar will be randomly allocated to either 3 sessions&#xD;
      of FLT (UltraPulse Encore 10600 nm Total FX) with an interval of 4 weeks or no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Blinded Physicians Global Assessment is the main outcome&#xD;
      variable. Secondary variables are Patient's Global Assessment, blinded clinical assessment of&#xD;
      the scar on a scale from 0-3 (erythema, pigmentation, texture, hypertrophy, atrophy,&#xD;
      pliability), Patient and Observer Scar Scale (POSAS), objective colour measurements by&#xD;
      reflectance spectroscopy (LAB) and chromameter (erythema index, melanin index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Subjects participating in the study will be requested to visit the SNIP&#xD;
      (Amsterdam) 3 times for treatment and 2 times for follow-up. The time investment per visit&#xD;
      will be 30 minutes for treatment sessions and 20 minutes for follow-up visits. FLT using a&#xD;
      10600 nm laser device is a minimally invasive laser procedure with FDA approval for both the&#xD;
      device (Lumenis Encore 10600 nm) and the indication (scar). Local side effects are erythema&#xD;
      (always; 1-2 weeks), oozing (often; 1-3 days), swelling (always, 1-4 days), blisters &lt; 0.5cm&#xD;
      (occasionally) and blisters &gt; 0.5cm (very rare). No systemic side effects are known for this&#xD;
      laser device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome measures involve non-invasive procedures. The laser treatment (FLT) requires&#xD;
      local anesthesia. The amount of topical anesthetic used for infiltration is low&#xD;
      (approximately 5% of the maximum dose) which minimizes the risk for local or systemic side&#xD;
      effects due to the anesthetic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All together the burden due to the study is moderate, side effects are generally local and&#xD;
      mild. Systemic side effects are not reported with this treatment. There is an indirect&#xD;
      benefit for the participating subject. In case of improvement of the treated test regions,&#xD;
      this therapy can be directly utilized to treat the whole scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the relative lack of alternative treatment options in many of these scars, the&#xD;
      balance between burden, possible side effects and prospect for improvement is very favorable.&#xD;
