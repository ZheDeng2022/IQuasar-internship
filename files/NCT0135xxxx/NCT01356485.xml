  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Anemia is caused by an inherited hemoglobin disorder. Healthy red blood cells are&#xD;
      discoid and can deform and move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of&#xD;
      the body. In sickle cell disease, as red blood cells circulate and oxygen is released in the&#xD;
      circulatory system, the deoxygenated abnormal hemoglobin S can begin to polymerize. When this&#xD;
      occurs, the red blood cells can become sticky and elongated. These sickled red blood cells&#xD;
      are less flexible and will obstruct small blood vessels and block normal red blood cells from&#xD;
      traveling through the circulatory system, which limits oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.&#xD;
      This is known as a &quot;sickle crisis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from a sickle crisis experience severe pain and are at risk of stroke,&#xD;
      heart attack or even death. By lowering the level of oxygen pressure at which sickling occurs&#xD;
      and opening the vasculature and rapidly delivering oxygen directly to ischemic tissues, the&#xD;
      addition of MP4CO to existing treatment protocols may alleviate pain associated with a sickle&#xD;
      cell crisis, abort a crisis and/or potentially reduce the duration of a crisis. This could&#xD;
      mean less time in the hospital and an improved quality of life for patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no specific agent has been approved to treat sickle cell crisis, to reduce the&#xD;
      severity of a sickling crisis, or to shorten the duration of admission. Current therapy for a&#xD;
      sickling crisis is limited to hydration and symptomatic pain relief with opiates when pain is&#xD;
      severe enough to cause admission to hospital. Administration of oxygen by inhalation alone&#xD;
      has not proven effective. Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to Hb S and, while attached, prevents&#xD;
      and reverses polymerization of Hb S chains and consequent distortion of the red blood cell.&#xD;
      Carbon monoxide at very low doses also acts as a messenger to cells, reducing inflammation,&#xD;
      reducing oxygen requirements, and preventing programmed cell death (apoptosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MP4 molecule can be modified to carry CO and other gases to enhance therapeutic benefit&#xD;
      for certain patients. MP4CO is therefore designed to deliver therapeutic, non-toxic levels of&#xD;
      CO, to provide an immediate metabolic signal to cells and to reduce inflammation. Once the CO&#xD;
      is released from the compound, the MP4 molecule gets oxygenated in the lung and then delivers&#xD;
      oxygen to ischemic tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously published studies provide a good foundation to postulate that a chemically&#xD;
      modified hemoglobin such as MP4CO might have the ideal properties as an oxygen therapeutic&#xD;
      agent for treatment or reversal of a sickling crisis. The initial release of CO from MP4CO is&#xD;
      predicted to have a therapeutic effect including immediate stabilization of Hb S to prevent&#xD;
      further polymerization and reverse existing sickling, vasodilation of capillaries, and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. The subsequent circulation of the MP4 molecule as an oxygen&#xD;
      therapeutic agent (after converting to MP4OX following oxygenation in the lungs) will help to&#xD;
      1) preferentially oxygenate ischemic cells, 2) reverse partially sickled red cells, and 3)&#xD;
      improve oxygenation of local tissues, thereby potentially ameliorating the painful VOC caused&#xD;
      by red blood cell sickling. In addition, MP4CO has enhanced chemical stability, which enables&#xD;
      storage at room temperature while minimizing methemoglobin formation.&#xD;
