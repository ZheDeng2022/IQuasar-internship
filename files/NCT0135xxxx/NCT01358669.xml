  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hip replacement surgery is a successful way of dealing with the pain and immobility&#xD;
      caused by hip arthritis, 10% of the hip replacements carried out in the UK fail within 10&#xD;
      years. The main reason for this is the development periprosthetic osteolysis, that is, loss&#xD;
      of bone around the site of the hip replacement. The osteolysis is thought to be due to the&#xD;
      small particles of debris worn from the surfaces of the hip implant. These particles cause a&#xD;
      reaction in the blood cells around the joint which in turn affects bone cells and leads to a&#xD;
      loss of bone around the implant. The joint implant will then eventually become loose and&#xD;
      unstable, a condition known as aseptic loosening. At present the only way to treat aseptic&#xD;
      loosening is to have another operation to secure the hip joint, known as revision surgery.&#xD;
      Revision surgery is not always successful and exposes the patient to the risk of major&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we explore the potential for giving a medication (denosumab) that may prevent&#xD;
      the loss of bone around the hip replacement implant. We will recruit patients who have been&#xD;
      listed for revision surgery. One group of patients will be given a single dose of denosumab;&#xD;
      another group will be given a placebo (dummy drug). At the time of the revision surgery a&#xD;
      small sample of the bone from around the hip replacement will be taken and examined under the&#xD;
      microscope. Comparisons will be made between the patients having the denosumab and those&#xD;
      having placebo to find out whether the denosumab is having a beneficial effect on the bone&#xD;
      surfaces. If successful, this study will lead to further studies to develop the use of&#xD;
      denosumab to prevent aseptic loosening.&#xD;

      This is a single centre, double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of denosumab compared&#xD;
      to placebo in adults undergoing revision surgery of total hip arthroplasty due to prosthesis&#xD;
      related osteolysis. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either denosumab or placebo. 15 participants will be assigned to each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 60mg denosumab by injection as a single dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo by injection as a single dose After they have given informed consent, all&#xD;
           participants will have a screening visit (Visit 1). Participants who are eligible after&#xD;
           completing all screening assessments will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two&#xD;
           treatments. All screening procedures will be completed within 14 (±7) days before&#xD;
           beginning the medication. Study medication will be given at visit 2, which will occur 8&#xD;
           weeks (56 ±7 days) before the date of the planned revision surgery. Participants will&#xD;
           attend for 5 visits in total as shown below. Visit 1, Baseline, 2 weeks (±7 days)before&#xD;
