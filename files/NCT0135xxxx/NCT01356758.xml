  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common inflammatory disease of the skin and joints with a prevalence of 1-3%&#xD;
      in the caucasian population of Northern Europe and the US. Similarly to other inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases there is now substantial and accumulating evidence that psoriasis has a systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that patients suffering from psoriasis have increased prevalence of traditional&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, tobacco use and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. This would logically explain an increased rate of cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      but even when adjusting for theses risk factors, psoriasis carry an independent risk for&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent large epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between psoriasis and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atopic dermatitis has been linked to ischemic stroke in one study, but besides this, the&#xD;
      disease has not been associated with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, convincing and increasing evidence is supporting that psoriasis induce&#xD;
      accelerated atherosclerosis and hence cardiovascular disease and mortality. In particular,&#xD;
      this is seen in young patients with early disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is believed to be driven by cytokines produced by Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. A&#xD;
      number of these cytokines are suggested to be atherogenic. In contrast, another chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease, atopic dermatitis, is predominantly driven by Th2 lymphocyte derived&#xD;
      cytokines, some of which may inhibit atherosclerotic processes. It is therefore, of interest&#xD;
      to compare the presence of cardiovascular disease in these two inflammatory skin diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: That the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and especially coronary artery&#xD;
      disease is increased in psoriasis patients and that this process can be influenced by&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis with biological treatment.&#xD;
