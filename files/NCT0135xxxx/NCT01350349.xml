  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among older adults the combination of depression, cognitive impairment (memory problems), and&#xD;
      disability contribute to a worsening of physical and mental health and to poor treatment&#xD;
      outcomes. Antidepressants help fewer than 40% of depressed elders with memory problems&#xD;
      achieve remission from their depression. Interventions involving talking therapy are&#xD;
      underdeveloped and understudied. Therefore, this research study will test the efficacy of&#xD;
      Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH), a new home-delivered psychosocial intervention for elders&#xD;
      with major depression, memory problems, and disability. PATH focuses on the subject's&#xD;
      &quot;ecosystem&quot; (the patient, the caregiver, and the home-environment) and targets behavioral&#xD;
      problems related to both depression and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATH is delivered in a subject's home, where cognitively impaired, disabled elders face most&#xD;
      of their difficulties. Local Home Delivered Meals programs will refer clients who have&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and are interested in research. All participants will have an&#xD;
      available caregiver (family, significant other, or professional) and will be randomized to 12&#xD;
      weekly sessions of PATH or Supportive Therapy, the current standard of care for talking&#xD;
      therapy. The study will test whether home-delivered PATH is more effective than&#xD;
      home-delivered Supportive Therapy in reducing the subjects' depression and disability and in&#xD;
      increasing self-efficacy over the 12-week treatment period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression, cognitive impairment and disability often coexist in older adults and contribute&#xD;
      to medical and psychiatric morbidity and mortality. We developed and propose to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of a new psychosocial intervention, Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH), for patients&#xD;
      with major depression, cognitive impairment (up to the level of mild to moderate dementia)&#xD;
      and disability. The proposed R01 study meets a critical need of this population, i.e. a&#xD;
      treatment alternative for patients in whom antidepressants may have limited efficacy and for&#xD;
      whom psychosocial interventions are underdeveloped and understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal innovation of PATH is its personalized approach focusing on the patient's&#xD;
      ecosystem (i.e. the patient, the caregiver, and the home-environment) and targeting&#xD;
      behavioral problems related to both depression and disability. PATH is delivered at the&#xD;
      patients' home, teaches the patient-caregiver dyad problem-solving skills, and incorporates&#xD;
      environmental adaptations (including notes, signs, reminders, calendars, voice alarms) to&#xD;
      improve the patient's functioning.&#xD;
