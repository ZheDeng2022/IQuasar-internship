  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for over 50% of heart failure&#xD;
      cases in the United States, affecting a primarily elderly population. No treatment has been&#xD;
      shown to affect mortality in HFpEF, which is more than 50% at five years a hospitalization.&#xD;
      This project explores the underlying cardiovascular physiology of patients with HFpEF with&#xD;
      the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that would allow improved treatment of this&#xD;
      devastating disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a difficult disease to diagnose due&#xD;
      to nonspecific symptoms and clinical findings. The disease occurs in the elderly, who often&#xD;
      have other illnesses and signs of aging that make diagnosis of heart failure more difficult.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been suggested that HFpEF, which has primarily been thought to be a&#xD;
      diastolic disease, is in fact multifactorial, with elements of abnormal systolic function and&#xD;
      increased vascular stiffness playing a role in disease pathology. No treatment has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce the high mortality of the disease. However, few studies have evaluated this&#xD;
      population of patients during periods of increased physiologic stress, despite the consistent&#xD;
      clinical presentation of impaired exercise tolerance with few symptoms at rest. This study&#xD;
      explores the multifactorial physiology of HFpEF, with a detailed investigation of the&#xD;
      specificity of abnormalities in contractile reserve and vascular stiffness for this disease,&#xD;
      and exploration of the modifiability of these abnormalities. The techniques used are&#xD;
      non-invasive, involving echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac function, and measurement of&#xD;
      arterial stiffness using tonometry. The first aim of the study is to explore the specificity&#xD;
      of a potential diagnostic test for HFpEF by investigating the change in ejection fraction&#xD;
      before and after β-adrenergic stimulation with low-dose dobutamine in HFpEF compared to other&#xD;
      groups important to distinguish clinically, specifically patients with shortness of breath&#xD;
      due to pulmonary disease, and those with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy&#xD;
      without clinical heart failure. In the second aim, the study will investigate the ability of&#xD;
      the calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, to restore normal contractile responses of the&#xD;
      myocardium. In the third aim, the role of arterial stiffness in drug responses in HFpEF will&#xD;
      be explored. It is anticipated that improved understanding of the complex physiology of this&#xD;
      multifactorial disease gained through this study will lead to more rational design of large&#xD;
      clinical trials studying promising agents for HFpEF that impact not only diastolic function,&#xD;
      but contractile reserve and arterial properties as well.&#xD;
