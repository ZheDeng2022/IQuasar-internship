      The purpose of this study is to determine if intrathecal administration of baclofen can&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of severe tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people with autism spectrum disorder do not like to be touched. This is referred to as&#xD;
      tactile defensiveness. Baclofen is a drug approved for treatment of spasticity in patients&#xD;
      with conditions such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
      Intrathecal means that baclofen is administered by injection into the spinal canal. In this&#xD;
      study, each patient will undergo a trial administration of intrathecal baclofen and the&#xD;
      effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have three visits in connection with the study. First, there will be a&#xD;
      screening visit in which the investigators determine if the patient is eligible to&#xD;
      participate in the study. To participate, each patient must have autism spectrum disorder,&#xD;
      severe tactile defensiveness, and meet other listed criteria. At the second visit, each&#xD;
      patient will undergo the intrathecal baclofen trial procedure. The procedure used is the&#xD;
      standard procedure to determine if intrathecal baclofen is effective for treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity. In this study however, instead of evaluating the effect of intrathecal baclofen&#xD;
      on spasticity, the investigators will evaluate the effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms&#xD;
      of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder. The trial procedure and evaluation&#xD;
      will require about one day. At the third visit, the follow up visit, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate and discuss the patient's response to the treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of autism prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exhibits these specific symptoms of autism:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tactile Defensiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be scored as &quot;Always&quot; for &quot;Reacts emotionally or aggressively to touch&quot;&#xD;
             on a modified Short Sensory Profile Questionnaire. Additionally, patients must score&#xD;
             &quot;Always&quot; or &quot;Frequently&quot; in the other categories of a modified Short Sensory Profile&#xD;
             Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Allergy to baclofen or compounds with similar structure&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to be evaluated by the chosen efficacy measures&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator will place the patient&#xD;
             at increased risk of adverse events or preclude completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concomitant use of any medication that in the opinion of the principal investigator is&#xD;
             contraindicated with intrathecal baclofen administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of child-bearing potential who have a positive urine pregnancy test at visit 2&#xD;
