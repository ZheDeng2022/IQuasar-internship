    <textblock>
      The principal morbidity following axillary node dissection within the scope of breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery is the post-operative development of lymphocele. According to the literature,&#xD;
      incidence can vary from 4 to 89% depending on the type of surgery, whether or not a drain is&#xD;
      inserted or a compression dressing applied and the time at which the drain is removed… In our&#xD;
      experience, the incidence is 40% [IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute) data focusing on 70 patients&#xD;
      between November 2008 and February 2009]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraging results in terms of reducing postoperative lymphoceles as well as drainage&#xD;
      duration and volume using Octreotide have been recorded in two recent studies. A new molecule&#xD;
      developed by Novartis Laboratories, namely pasireotide, is a somatostatin analog possessing&#xD;
      strong affinity for several somatostatin receptors (30 to 40 times greater for sst1 and sst5,&#xD;
      5 times greater for sst3 and equivalent for sst2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a pre-surgical injection of&#xD;
      pasireotide LAR in reducing the postoperative incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles following&#xD;
      axillary node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of prolonged release pasireotide on the&#xD;
      duration of postoperative drainage, the daily drainage volume, the total drainage volume, the&#xD;
      number of repeated lymphocele aspirations and the volume, the total volume of lymph&#xD;
      aspirated, the incidence of postoperative febrile episodes, the length of hospital stay, and&#xD;
      the length of time to onset of adjuvant chemotherapy. It is also to assess the safety of&#xD;
      prolonged release pasireotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a preoperative prolonged&#xD;
      release pasireotide injection in the reduction in the incidence of symptomatic, postoperative&#xD;
      axillary lymphoceles following mastectomy-axillary node dissection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, has demonstrated its efficacy in the medical management of&#xD;
      postoperative gastro-intestinal and pancreatic fistulae. Two recent studies have shown its&#xD;
      value in reducing lymphoceles following axillary node dissection performed as part of breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal morbidity following axillary node dissection within the scope of breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery is the postoperative development of lymphocele following the removal of an axillary&#xD;
      drain. This may be a source of pain, repeated aspiration, infection and delayed local&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pasireotide, a somatostatin analog under evaluation and possessing a high affinity for&#xD;
      somatostatine receptors (30 to 40 times greater for sst1 and sst5 receptors, 5 times greater&#xD;
      for sst3 and equivalent for sst2) is an attractive molecule in this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the encouraging results published with octreotide and the greater effects&#xD;
      anticipated with pasireotide, the investigators want to assess the benefit of preoperative&#xD;
      administration of pasireotide in reducing the incidence of axillary lymphoceles following&#xD;
      mastectomy - axillary node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatostatin is a hormone that is widely distributed in the nervous and gastropancreatic&#xD;
      system responsible for a variety of pharmacological and physiological effects. It can inhibit&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endocrine and exocrine secretion and has an anti-inflammatory action (1).&#xD;
      The direct effect of somatostatin on lymphatic flow has only been observed on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several series report the use of octreotide in the treatment of chylous ascites or in the&#xD;
      management of thoracic duct injury (2). Although its mechanism of action has not been studied&#xD;
      in depth, it probably acts by inhibiting splanchnic blood flow and limiting the absorption of&#xD;
      triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatostatin receptors have been demonstrated in lymphatic tissues, including those not&#xD;
      associated with the intestinal tract. It is therefore probable that the inhibitory action of&#xD;
      somatostatin on gastrointestinal lymphatic flow may also apply elsewhere in the body, and to&#xD;
      the lymphatic system in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatostatin might therefore decrease lymphatic flow following essentially axillary&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new molecule, pasireotide, is currently in clinical development. This molecule is a&#xD;
      somatostatin analog possessing an affinity 30 to 40 times greater for sst1 and sst5&#xD;
      receptors, 5 times greater for sst3 and comparable for sst2 than octreotide. It could&#xD;
      therefore have a greater effect than octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gradual release form must be injected intramuscularly prior to surgery. An effective&#xD;
      plateau concentration is obtained after 10 days regardless of the selected dosage (20, 40, or&#xD;
      60 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the many articles in the literature detailing the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      octreotide on gastrointestinal and pancreatic fistulae and on regression of chylous ascites&#xD;
      and chylothorax, a few articles have attempted to highlight its effect on postoperative&#xD;
      lymphoceles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, two articles have highlighted the positive effect of somatostatin analogs in&#xD;
      reducing drainage volume and the incidence of lymphoceles following axillary node dissection&#xD;
      in breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another more recent article by Mahmoud et al. (5) showed the same beneficial effects on the&#xD;
      mean daily drainage volume (104 vs 145 ml, p=0.0001), the total duration of drainage (12.7 vs&#xD;
      25 days, p=0.0001) and the need for postoperative aspiration of lymphoceles (90 vs 40%,&#xD;
      p=0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006, in a different field (that of renal transplantation), an article by Capocasale et&#xD;
      al.Pasireotide is an injectable somatostatin analog. Like natural somatostatin and known&#xD;
      analogs, its pharmaceutical efficacy depends on its binding to somatostatin receptors. There&#xD;
      are five of these (sst 1 to 5); they are expressed in various bodily tissues under normal&#xD;
      physiological conditions. Somatostatin analogs activate these receptors, which in turn reduce&#xD;
      cell activity and inhibits hormone synthesis. (7). Octreotide and lanreotide, which are&#xD;
      currently used, have a strong affinity for the sst2 receptor and moderate affinity, if any,&#xD;
      for the other types. Pasireotide possesses greater affinity than octreotide for certain&#xD;
      somatostatin receptors: 30 times greater for sst1, 5 times greater for sst3 and 40 times&#xD;
      greater for sst5. It possesses equivalent affinity for sst2 and none (like octreotide) for&#xD;
      sst4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, the incidence of axillary lymphoceles following surgery for breast cancer&#xD;
      varies considerably: a recent meta-analysis of 66 studies revealed an incidence of 4 to 89 %&#xD;
      depending on whether or not drainage was being carried out, the type of surgery (conservative&#xD;
      or not), the time at which the drain was removed and whether or not a compression dressing&#xD;
      was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experience, the incidence at Hôpital Tenon is 40%. This percentage has been&#xD;
      corroborated by Gustave Roussy Institute data, which recorded an incidence of 39.3% in out of&#xD;
      70 patients who underwent surgery between November 2008 and February 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several teams have reported their use of Sandostatin® or other somatostatin analogs in the&#xD;
      management of patients suffering from inoperable peritoneal carcinoma (9-12). This treatment&#xD;
      was used as supportive therapy and reduced the incidence of symptoms associated with an&#xD;
      obstructive syndrome. It fact, it can reduce gastrointestinal secretions. Some authors have&#xD;
      even suggested that somatostatin analogs possess an anti-tumor effect (9). Octreotide is&#xD;
      recommended by AFSSAPS in the treatment of palliative care patients presenting with&#xD;
      intestinal occlusion in peritoneal carcinoma. Since a Marketing Authorization (MA) has been&#xD;
      granted for the use of somatostatin analogs in patients presenting with a gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endocrine tumor, the use of pasireotide does not raise any specific ethical issue.&#xD;
