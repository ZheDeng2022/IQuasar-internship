  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation of carotid baroreceptors (baropacing) acutely decreases arterial&#xD;
      pressure in patients with refractory hypertension. The reduction in blood pressure seems to&#xD;
      be mediated through sympathetic inhibition with concomitant reduction in the activity of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system. Indeed, switching on and off the stimulation is accompanied by&#xD;
      decreases and increases in central sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow, respectively. Plasma&#xD;
      renin concentration also decreases with acute electrical baroreflex stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some patients chronic baropacing is associated with long-term blood pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is sparse information as to the relative contribution of blood pressure&#xD;
      regulating systems to account for the acute and chronic effects of baropacing. Sympathetic,&#xD;
      renal, and vascular mechanisms are of special interest. Furthermore, technical aspects of&#xD;
      electrical baroreflex stimulation may play a role, e.g. worsening of the electrical contact&#xD;
      between the stimulating electrodes and the baroreceptor afferents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to answer the following primary questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does chronic electrical stimulation of carotid baroreceptors inhibit sympathetic&#xD;
           vasoconstrictor tone also in the long-term?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone increase on switching off chronic baropacing? Such&#xD;
           an increase would confirm electrical integrity of the system and proper contact to the&#xD;
           baroreceptor afferents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation decrease renal vascular resistance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation influence glucose delivery to skeletal&#xD;
           muscle and change insulin sensitivity? The study follows an open-label observational&#xD;
           design and it is planned to recruit up to 30 patients over 3 years.&#xD;

        Patients with implanted devices for electrical baroreflex stimulation are recruited&#xD;
        according to inclusion and exclusion criteria until good quality recordings have been&#xD;
        obtained in 20 patients during both stimulator settings (ON and OFF) in the corresponding&#xD;
        study arm. After obtaining written informed consent patients will be investigated in the&#xD;
        laboratory.&#xD;
