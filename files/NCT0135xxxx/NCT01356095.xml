  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased emphasis on evidence based practice in recent years a gap remains between&#xD;
      evidence and practice, particularly in resource poor countries. Few studies to date have&#xD;
      examined the use of knowledge translation strategies to improve health care outcomes in low&#xD;
      income countries. However, given that the majority of health care in these settings is&#xD;
      provided by workers with less training and limited resources, the theoretical potential for&#xD;
      knowledge translation strategies to improve health care delivery and outcomes by integrating&#xD;
      best evidence into routine practice may be greatest in these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation (KT) is an approach to changing health care provider behavior to reduce&#xD;
      the gap between evidence and practice in health care delivery. There has been a tendency for&#xD;
      knowledge translation interventions to employ generic, &quot;off the shelf&quot;, strategies, and apply&#xD;
      them to deal with specific issues. This generic approach, fails to recognize the variability&#xD;
      in the specific characteristics of health care settings, in terms of their patient&#xD;
      populations, health care systems, and health care providers. These characteristics, whether&#xD;
      they function as barriers or facilitators to change, make a generalized approach to KT&#xD;
      ineffective, where a tailored strategy, which specifically adjusts its approach to measured&#xD;
      local barriers and facilitators may achieve better alignment of practice to evidence. This is&#xD;
      likely to be particularly true in low income countries where the majority of health care is&#xD;
      provided by non-physician health care workers, working within a wider range of health care&#xD;
      systems, with variable and unique patient populations and resource constraints. Given the&#xD;
      potential to significantly impact health care outcomes at relatively low cost, further&#xD;
      research is needed both to develop methods for identifying potential barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to KT strategies in specific resource poor settings, and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of KT strategies tailored to address the identified barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effectiveness of a two part knowledge translation intervention&#xD;
      tailored to address factors identified in a previous study as functioning as barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to treatment adherence among patients on treatment for tuberculosis or combined&#xD;
      tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment, targeting improved patient adherence and health&#xD;
      outcomes, in a specific low income country.&#xD;
