      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Stereophotogrammetry (SP) uses four sets of digital cameras to generate a three-dimensional&#xD;
      computer image. Unlike other types of evaluations which require radiation, SP only uses&#xD;
      computer images to learn more about physical deformities such as scoliosis or about the&#xD;
      placement of fat on the body. To refine the SP process, researchers are interested in&#xD;
      collecting images and body data from individuals with skeletal structural problems such as&#xD;
      scoliosis or chest wall deformities, individuals who are overweight or obese, and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use stereophotogrammetry to study different individual body types and refine existing&#xD;
      imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 2 years of age who have spine, rib, or chest wall deformities; are&#xD;
      overweight or obese (body mass index greater than 25); or are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history. The&#xD;
           physical examination will include measurements of range of motion and joint mobility,&#xD;
           torso width and length, and other observational data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers and participants in the obesity group will also have bioelectric&#xD;
           spectroscopy (bioimpedance), which uses an additional machine to measure how fat is&#xD;
           spread in different parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the physical examination has been completed, participants will have SP photographs&#xD;
           taken. Participants will be asked to remove all clothing from the torso, stand with arms&#xD;
           raised at the center of four cameras, and remain still while several images are taken. A&#xD;
           complete image takes less than 1 second.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with spine or rib deformities, or who are in the obesity group, may also&#xD;
           volunteer to return for followup SP imaging, once a year for 5 years, to study progress&#xD;
           over time.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to determine which outcome measures derived from&#xD;
      analysis of SP images are reliable within the healthy population and can distinguish between&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and those with scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and obesity. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include comparing SP outcome measures with clinical and radiographic measures to&#xD;
      test concurrent validity and to determine if the SP outcome measures correlate with clinical&#xD;
      and radiographic measures taken over time. The ultimate goal is to develop SP as a&#xD;
      measurement tool to be employed in clinical research involving the study of scoliosis, rib&#xD;
      and chest deformities and the truncal distribution of adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for this study consists of healthy volunteers, persons with scoliosis and/or&#xD;
      chest wall deformities, and persons with obesity. Men and women of all races, ethnicities,&#xD;
      and ages greater than two years may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be carried out in three phases. In Phase I, we will analyze images of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers captured by the SP scoliosis and chest-wall deformity ( scoliosis )&#xD;
      software to identify the outcome measures that show minimal or no variance. We will also&#xD;
      examine if healthy volunteers gender, age, height, and BMI contribute to the differences of&#xD;
      these outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase IIa, images captured from subjects with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities will&#xD;
      be processed by scoliosis software to determine the set of meaningful variables (those that&#xD;
      show significant differences between the two populations). In Phase IIb, images captured of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be processed using obesity software to determine the set of variables&#xD;
      showing minimal or no variance among the data from healthy volunteers when controlling for&#xD;
      the effects of potential confounders. Variables that continue to have minimal or no variance&#xD;
      will be considered meaningful with respect to obesity analysis software. Those variables&#xD;
      achieved from obesity image analysis will be compared to the set from the healthy volunteers&#xD;
      to determine which variables show significant differences between the healthy volunteer and&#xD;
      obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase III, healthy participants, scoliosis/chest wall deformity, and obesity participants&#xD;
      who are scheduled to return to NIH as part of another NIH protocol will be invited to return&#xD;
      for yearly re-imaging up to a total of five years in order to analyze changes over time and&#xD;
      compare them with concurrent radiographic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to develop outcome measures for use in future research. These&#xD;
      outcome measures will be developed from software which analyzes images derived from the&#xD;
      stereophotogrammetry system.&#xD;

                  eligible so long as they can cooperate with physical examination and imaging&#xD;
                  procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be able to stand independently for imaging. This limits enrollment&#xD;
                  to subjects 2 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must agree to capture of image of their bare torso above the waist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Healthy volunteers must be without scoliosis, or chest wall deformities, and with&#xD;
                  BMI below overweight range. For adults, BMI must be less than or equal to 25. BMI&#xD;
                  for children and adolescents will be corrected according to the guidelines&#xD;
                  designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in Appendices&#xD;

               -  Adults with BMI less than or equal to 25 and children and adolescents with adjust&#xD;
                  BMI below the overweight range AND with imaging confirmed scoliosis and/or chest&#xD;
                  wall deformities will be recruited from participants in NIH intramural protocols&#xD;
                  or referred by outside physicians and will be eligible to participate in phase&#xD;
                  IIa of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Adults (subjects who are 18 years of age or older), must either present a&#xD;
                       previously obtained clinical standing scoliosis xray film dated no more than&#xD;
                       12 months prior to the study visit or obtain a scoliosis series x-ray at the&#xD;
                       National Institutes of Health Clinical Center to provide confirmation of&#xD;
                       scoliosis. Therefore, xrays may be done for research purposes in adults if&#xD;
                       there is prior imaging indication but no scoliosis series xray films taken&#xD;
                       within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Children must present a previously obtained clinical standing scoliosis film&#xD;
                       dated no more than six months prior to the study visit to provide&#xD;
                       radiological confirmation of scoliosis. No xrays will be done for research&#xD;
                       purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Volunteers who have undergone spinal fusion surgery must show a&#xD;
                       postoperative film that shows that the instrumentation is intact and that&#xD;
                       desired spinal fusion has occurred. Xrays may be done for research purposes&#xD;
                       in adults if there is prior imaging indication but no scoliosis x-ray series&#xD;
                       films taken within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with BMI greater than 25 (or for children and adolescents defined&#xD;
                  according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as&#xD;
                  &quot;overweight&quot;) AND without deformities of the torso will be eligible to&#xD;
                  participate in phase IIb, the obesity portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with deformities of the torso OR with BMI greater than 25 may be&#xD;
                  eligible to participate in Phase IIIa or IIIb and be followed yearly over the&#xD;
                  course of five years&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities that are followed over&#xD;
                       the course of the five years must provide clinically obtained films with at&#xD;
                       least a difference of a year between the current and previous films. In&#xD;
                       adults, if the curve changes, it is clinically indicated to get a follow-up&#xD;
                       film and subsequent scoliosis xray films may be taken at the NIH CC. Those&#xD;
                       who do not require clinical films cannot be included in the scoliosis/chest&#xD;
                       wall deformities group followed over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For subjects of BMI greater than 25, volunteers will be invited to be&#xD;
                       followed over time using SP if they have a change in their body composition&#xD;
                       over time (if they have not yet attained physical maturity, if they&#xD;
                       participate in weight loss program, or report a significant weight gain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to tolerate having points on the torso marked with a surgical ink&#xD;
             marker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with contact or respiratory isolation status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with pacemakers or other electrical or conducting metal medical devices&#xD;
             implanted in their torso will not be able to participate in the normal volunteer and&#xD;
             obesity groups due to contraindication to participation in bioelectric spectroscopy&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with electrical or conducting metal medical devices in their arms or legs&#xD;
             that are not limited to one side of the body will not be able to participate in the&#xD;
             normal volunteer and obesity groups because it will cause data distortion in the&#xD;
             bioelectric spectroscopy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to tolerate stroboscopic camera flash&#xD;
&#xD;
