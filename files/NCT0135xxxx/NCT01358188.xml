    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease (GD), the inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase is&#xD;
      characterized with accumulation of abnormal lipid in cells of the immune system, called&#xD;
      macrophages. Lipid engorged macrophages, then become activated, and are also called &quot;Gaucher&#xD;
      cells&quot;. The mechanisms leading to macrophage activation is not fully known, however several&#xD;
      findings in individuals with GD, such as non-specific inflammation,clinically resembling a&#xD;
      rheumatic disease with an increased sedimentation rate, joint pain, and extreme fatigue, in&#xD;
      addition poor wound healing, and a predisposition to diabetes may suggest an inappropriately&#xD;
      functioning immune system in GD. The pathways leading to macrophage activation could be&#xD;
      related to the accumulation of lipid metabolites or through the effects of other immune&#xD;
      cells. In this study, immunologic profiling and functional assays will be performed in&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples from patients with GD. The identification of the immunologic basis&#xD;
      of GD will lead to the the development of new disease markers and different treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Activated lipid engorged macrophages are the hallmark for Gaucher disease (GD). The evidence&#xD;
      for this activation comes from the clinical finding of 1000-fold increase of serum&#xD;
      chitotriosidase, a chitinase specifically secreted from activated macrophages. While these&#xD;
      markers decrease with the initiation of therapy, they are not specific for organ involvement.&#xD;
      The mechanisms of this macrophage activation is unclear, however, the presence of a&#xD;
      non-specific inflammatory response (e.g. high sedimentation rate), poor wound healing and&#xD;
      insulin resistance in Gaucher patients point to its clinical relevance. The finding of T, B&#xD;
      and NK cell abnormalities in Gaucher patients also suggest either direct effects of GD lipid&#xD;
      metabolites or indirect mechanisms via macrophages. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms&#xD;
      of macrophage activation and the crosstalk with other immune cell types could provide&#xD;
      mechanistic insights for pathogenesis of GD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in GD the mechanisms leading macrophage activation could&#xD;
      be related either directly to the accumulation of the lipid metabolites or through the&#xD;
      effects of other cells of the immune system. To determine the pathways leading to macrophage&#xD;
      dysregulation in GD, the investigators will evaluate the functional response of monocytes&#xD;
      isolated from GD patients and profile of T cell and NK cell subsets in peripheral blood of&#xD;
      these patients. The investigators will then assess whether macrophage dysfunction in GD is&#xD;
      caused by an primary alteration immune response (NK and T cells response) or secondary due to&#xD;
      the direct effects of substrate accumulation performing immunological profiling of GD patient&#xD;
      blood samples, and through functional assays. Identification of the immunological basis of GD&#xD;
      pathogenesis could lead to the development of both biomarkers and novel approaches for&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions to alleviate disease symptoms. In addition, our studies will reveal&#xD;
      novel effects of the accumulation of the lipid substrate in GD in modulating macrophage and&#xD;
      lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
