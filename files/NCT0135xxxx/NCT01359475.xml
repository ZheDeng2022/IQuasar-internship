  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preformed stainless steel crowns have been used in Pediatric Dentistry to restore badly&#xD;
      broken down primary teeth since 1950. They are generally considered more expedient to place&#xD;
      than large multi-surface amalgam or composite restorations and have a longer life. They have&#xD;
      been used successfully in clinical practice for many years and have presented little in the&#xD;
      way of adverse events. The major drawback is the poor esthetics along with lingering concerns&#xD;
      over potential health hazards associated with the nickel content. Several attempts have been&#xD;
      made to improve upon the esthetics of stainless steel crowns such as veneering the buccal and&#xD;
      occlusal surfaces and substituting composite resin for the entire crown, but to date none of&#xD;
      these approaches have been very successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetal resin has been used in a number of applications in medicine and dentistry, and&#xD;
      recently has met with early success when tested as a substitute for stainless steel crowns.&#xD;
      It has a number of excellent physical and mechanical properties including a low coefficient&#xD;
      of friction, good wear resistance, high fatigue resistance, good impact strength and&#xD;
      resistance to creep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the clinical performance of preformed acetal resin&#xD;
      crowns and preformed stainless steel crowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the clinical performance of acetal resin crowns&#xD;
      with preformed stainless steel crowns when used to restore primary molar teeth.&#xD;

      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 25 subjects contributing a minimum of 40 acetal crowns ( on primary molar teeth&#xD;
      will be recruited from the patient pool of the pediatric dentistry clinic at Barzilai Medical&#xD;
      Center, Ashkelon and enrolled into the study. A maximum of four crowns will be placed in any&#xD;
      subject. It is estimated that it will take approximately 14 weeks to place all crowns and&#xD;
      complete the baseline examination.&#xD;
