      The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time diagnostic technique with e- Ab sensor&#xD;
      for specific EGFR mutation detection in clinical specimens of NSCLC patients, the&#xD;
      investigators conduct a prospective clinical study. In comparison with results from direct&#xD;
      sequencing of EGFR, the investigators evaluate the performance of e- Ab sensor, including&#xD;
      reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reaction (such as detection of EGFR&#xD;
      mutations other than L858R and DelL746-A750). The potential factors which may interfere with&#xD;
      the results would be investigated. With such technique, the investigators can obtain EGFR&#xD;
      mutation information of NSCLC patients in cost-saving and time-saving way and can offer more&#xD;
      individualized treatment for the investigators patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development of&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High EGFR mutation rate is found in certain population,&#xD;
      including female, non-smoker, East Asian, and adenocarcinoma. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that patients of NSCLC with mutant EGFR would have better survival, which was related to EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.1-2 IPASS study has shown that longer progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) under gefitinib treatment than that under carboplatin-paclitaxel, in patients&#xD;
      with lung adenocarcinoma and clinical characteristics suggesting high EGFR mutation rate.3&#xD;
      However, only some EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment, especially deletion in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21.4-5 Two&#xD;
      recent phase III randomized clinical trials evaluated gefitinib treatment and chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients of advanced NSCLC with sensitive EGFR mutaions.6-7 In patients with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      and sensitive EGFR mutations, PFS under gefitinib was 9.2~10.8 months, longer than that under&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore, to develop individualized treatment for patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC, it is important to have EGFR mutation status at the time of diagnosis. Current&#xD;
      techniques available for detection of EGFR mutation need direct sequencing of EGFR tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase domains, which are costly and time-consuming. 8 For detection for specific EGFR&#xD;
      mutations, mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies were developed to detect E746-A750&#xD;
      deletion in exon 19 and L858R in exon 21. In the pilot study, the immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
      assay using mutation-specific antibodies showed a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of&#xD;
      99%.9 Recent two studies examining the performance of the mutation-specific antibodies&#xD;
      disclosed inconsistent sensitivity and specificity. In the study by Akhiko Kawahara et al,&#xD;
      IHC assay of NSCLC tumor specimens with anti-delE746-A750 antibody showed a sensitivity of&#xD;
      79%, which was 83% by IHC assay with anti-L858R antibody.10 In the other study by Atsuko&#xD;
      Kitamura et al, IHC assay with anti-delE746-A750 antibody showed high specificity but low&#xD;
      sensitivity (99% and 40%, respectively). IHC assay with anti-L858R antibody also showed high&#xD;
      specificity but low sensitivity (97% and 36%, respectively). The overall sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of these two mutation-specific antibodies were 96% and 47%.11 The discrepancy&#xD;
      between these two studies was currently unknown. Another study conducted in Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center showed the performance of these two mutation-specific&#xD;
      antibodies would be affected by the cutoff of IHC score.12 For anti-L858R antibody, the&#xD;
      sensitivity was 76%-95% and the positive predicted value was 99%-100%. For anti-delE746-A750&#xD;
      antibody, the sensitivity was 85%-67% and the positive predicted value was 99%-100%. It is&#xD;
      unknown if the performance of these mutation-specific monoclonal antibodies could be enhanced&#xD;
      with the use of automated quantitative system (AQUA). However, such techinique needs&#xD;
      equipment and further cost, and couldn't offer immediate information about EGFR mutation to&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrosensing antibody probing system (e- Ab sensor), which was developed for the rapid and&#xD;
      sensitive detection of hapten, proteins, or viral antigen in medical samples, will be used&#xD;
      for analyzing the interaction kinetics between mutation specific anti-EGFR and its antigen&#xD;
      (EGFR with E746-A750 deletion or L858R mutation) present in the specimens of patients with&#xD;
      lung cancer. The system incorporates the use of engineered semiconducive antibodies or virus&#xD;
      in vertical and lateral chip (eAbchip) or lateral flow through (eAbsignal) formats. In&#xD;
      electrosensing antibody probing, semiconductive antibodies are bound as a suitable&#xD;
      electrosensing probe, which specifically and selectively binds targeted molecules (i.e.&#xD;
      specific mutant EGFR) in the test specimens. From assessment of the electric signature of&#xD;
      semiconductive mutation-specific anti-EGFR antibodies, the eABprobe could offer sensitive&#xD;
      detection and precise quantification of specific mutant EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a real-time diagnostic technique with e- Ab sensor for specific EGFR mutation&#xD;
      detection in clinical specimens of NSCLC patients, we conduct a prospective clinical study.&#xD;
      In comparison with results from direct sequencing of EGFR, we evaluate the performance of e-&#xD;
      Ab sensor, including reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reaction (such as&#xD;
      detection of EGFR mutations other than L858R and DelL746-A750). The potential factors which&#xD;
      may interfere with the results would be investigated. With such technique, we can obtain EGFR&#xD;
      mutation information of NSCLC patients in cost-saving and time-saving way and can offer more&#xD;
      individualized treatment for our patients.&#xD;
