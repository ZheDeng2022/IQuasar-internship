      The purpose of this clinical trial is to both clarify the efficiency of autologous&#xD;
      periodontal ligament (PDL) stem cells to regenerate periodontal tissue in periodontitis&#xD;
      patients with deep intraosseous defects (&gt;5 mm) and to confirm the safety of using autologous&#xD;
      stem cells in clinical periodontal regenerative medicine. This is a single-centre,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled study. This study has been approved by the ethical committees&#xD;
      of School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      according to the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that causes pathological alterations in the&#xD;
      tooth-supporting tissues, potentially leading to tooth loss. National surveys have shown that&#xD;
      the majority of adults in the population suffer from moderate periodontitis, with up to 15%&#xD;
      of the population being affected by severe generalized periodontitis at some stage in their&#xD;
      lives. The significant burden of periodontal disease and its impact on general health and&#xD;
      patient quality of life point to the clinical need for effective management of this&#xD;
      condition. The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is predictably regeneration of a&#xD;
      functional attachment apparatus destroyed by peridontitis, which involves the formation of a&#xD;
      new cementum, periodontal ligament (PDL), and alveolar bone. To date, several therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures have been attempted to achieve this ambitious purpose, including root surface&#xD;
      conditioning, bone graft placement, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) and the use of enamel&#xD;
      matrix-derived proteins or growth factors. However, current regenerative techniques that are&#xD;
      used either alone or in combination have limitations in attaining complete and predicable&#xD;
      regeneration, especially in advanced periodontal defects, where deep intraosseous defects&#xD;
      have been shown to be high-risk sites for progression of periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to histologic evidence, the GTR technique combined with bone graft is the most&#xD;
      predictable regenerative procedure in the treatment of such periodontal defects, although&#xD;
      basically, current available GTR-based therapies are still crude and of poor clinical&#xD;
      predictability. During periodontal regenerative procedures, the remaining healthy periodontal&#xD;
      ligament (PDL) plays a key role in the regeneration of new compartments, and the cells of PDL&#xD;
      tissues are the only cells that seem to have the capacity to form new attachment apparatus..&#xD;
      The regenerative capacity of the PDL itself is attributed to a few progenitor cells&#xD;
      maintaining their proliferation and differentiation potential in the periodontium. Recent&#xD;
      advances in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine have presented opportunities for&#xD;
      tissue engineering in periodontal therapy. To date, a large number of studies have reported&#xD;
      that stem cells, in conjunction with different physical matrices and growth factors, have the&#xD;
      capacity to regenerate periodontal tissues in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that PDL-derived progenitors are committed to several developmental&#xD;
      lineages, i.e., osteoblastic, fibroblastic and cementoblastic. This property determines the&#xD;
      PDL cells as a desirable cell population capable of regenerating a functional periodontal&#xD;
      attachment apparatus. It has been shown that PDL cells may prevent ankylosis and root&#xD;
      resorption and may possibly also produce a new PDL inserted into the tooth and adjacent bone.&#xD;
      Moreover, roots covered with alveolar bone cells induce a cementum-like tissue formation,&#xD;
      suggesting that cementoblast and osteoblast precursors commonly originate from the alveolar&#xD;
      bone. Thus, PDL-derived cell sources are one of the most promising candidates for cell-based&#xD;
      therapies and tissue-engineering-associated periodontal regeneration, and positive&#xD;
      pre-clinical results have already been achieved both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together,&#xD;
      the results of these investigations demonstrate that PDL cells are capable of preventing&#xD;
      epithelial down-growth and root resorption, with the periodontal healing pattern being&#xD;
      characterized by connective tissue adaptation involving parallel bundles resting on root&#xD;
      dentin. The formation of new bone and cementum varies from a complete absence to coverage of&#xD;
      parts of the debrided root surfaces mainly at the borders of the defects, to a thin layer of&#xD;
      newly formed cementum with complete new bone formation covering the entire previously denuded&#xD;
      root surface. The heterogeneity of results obtained may be explained by the small number of&#xD;
      specimens used, the different types of periodontal defects observed and the stability of the&#xD;
      carriers utilized to deliver the cells (i.e., hyaluronic acid and blood clots). In addition,&#xD;
      one may speculate that PDL cell differentiation is highly sensitive to differences in the&#xD;
      microenvironment, resulting in different types of periodontal healing. However, the clinical&#xD;
      application of autologous PDL-derived cells are currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All over the world, periodontitis remains highly prevalent, can lead loss of the affected&#xD;
      teeth, and thus threaten quality of life for middle-aged population as far as oral functions&#xD;
      are concerned. Unfortunately in clinic, no current periodontal treatments can, at best, heal&#xD;
      the scar in the affected region and ever regenerate lost periodontal tissue or normal&#xD;
      structure and functionality. Considering that the &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;teeth&quot; have various aesthetic&#xD;
      and functional roles to play, establishing a brand-new treatment that enables the&#xD;
      regeneration of periodontal tissue is very important. It is clear that there is both a&#xD;
      clinical need for such treatments and a vast patient resource. Interestingly, there is&#xD;
      mounting data that demonstrates the induction of periodontal tissue regeneration by PDL stem&#xD;
      cells in animal models. In particular, a number of studies show that topical administration&#xD;
      of PDL stem cells enhances periodontal tissue regeneration in models of artificial loss of&#xD;
      periodontal tissue in beagles and non-human primates. This suggests that PDL stem cells may&#xD;
      be safe and effective in the regeneration of periodontal tissues in periodontitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I clinical trial for 20 healthy male volunteers by local administration of&#xD;
      autologous PDL stem cells, neither adverse reactions nor rise of any antibody were observed&#xD;
      (unpublished data). Importantly, several groups have commenced small-scale pilot/feasibility&#xD;
      studies, leading sufficient information to move cell-based therapy into the clinical arena.&#xD;
      It is therefore we established this clinical protocol to further test the efficiency and&#xD;
      safety of stem cells in the treatment of periodontal deep intraosseous defects.&#xD;
