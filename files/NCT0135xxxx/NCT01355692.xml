  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of people suffering from diabetes is rapidly increasing, from an estimated 110&#xD;
      million in 1994 to 221 million in 2010. Diabetic macular edema is the most common reason for&#xD;
      reduction in visual acuity in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard care for diabetic macular edema is focal and /or grid retinal photocoagulation.&#xD;
      During photocoagulation, small laser burns are applied to the retina, the sensory tissue that&#xD;
      lines the back of the eye. Studies have shown that photocoagulation of clinically significant&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema substantially reduces the risk of visual loss, increase the chance of&#xD;
      visual improvement and decrease the frequency of persistent macular edema. However, it&#xD;
      remains unknown whether the destruction of sensory layer of the retina during&#xD;
      photocoagulation that may cause visual field defects is necessary for successful treatment or&#xD;
      is just an unwanted and unnecessary side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these concept, a photocoagulation technique was developed to treat the retina&#xD;
      selectively (SRT - Selective retinal therapy), with minimal or no damage to the sensory&#xD;
      layers. While the treatment is very similar to regular photocoagulation, the SRT laser uses&#xD;
      much lower energy and very short pulses. As a result, treatment does not result in visible&#xD;
      burns to the retina and previous studies have shown that the sensory layer remains intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of SRT on the resolution of the edema.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Best corrected ETDRS visual acuity letter score &gt;=24 (app. 20/320 or better)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Definite retinal thickness due to diabetic macular edema by on clinical exam at or&#xD;
             within 500 to 3000 microns of the macular center (radius) for which the investigator&#xD;
             believes laser photocoagulation is not indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A thickness equal or less than 315 microns in the central subfield (confirmed by&#xD;
             SD-OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A thickness of &gt;2 SD of norm in one or more inner or outer subfields on SD-OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Maximal focal/grid laser not yet applied (within areas of thickening between 500 and&#xD;
             3000 microns from center of macula, not all microaneurysms treated with direct laser&#xD;
             and not all other areas of thickening treated with grid laser). Maximal or complete&#xD;
             laser treatment is defined as direct treatment to all microaneurysms within areas of&#xD;
             edema and grid treatment to all other areas of macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within prior 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No recent medical treatment for DME (e.g., intravitreal/peribulbar steroids within&#xD;
             past 4 months or intravitreal anti-VEGF injection within past 2 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, any other intraocular surgery,&#xD;
             scleral buckle, glaucoma filter, cornea transplant, etc.) within prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy within prior 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Macular edema is not considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema&#xD;
&#xD;
             o An eye should not be considered eligible (1) if the macular edema is considered to&#xD;
             be related to cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or SD-OCT suggests that&#xD;
             vitreoretinal interface disease (eg. vitreoretinal traction or epiretinal membrane) is&#xD;
             the primary cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate&#xD;
             fundus photos.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No ocular condition (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the first 12 months of the&#xD;
             study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular&#xD;
             glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Glaucoma per se is not an exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation in the&#xD;
             study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic control)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients in poor glycemic control who recently (&gt;3 months) initiated intensive insulin&#xD;
             treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next 3 months&#xD;
             should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A patient with only one functioning eye (i.e., letter score 0 in contra-lateral eye)&#xD;
