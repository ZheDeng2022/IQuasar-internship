  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When performing a resection of the right colon due to cancer one aims not only to remove the&#xD;
      tumor bearing bowel segment, but also lymph nodes draining the affected area. These lymph&#xD;
      nodes are located along the arteries supplying the right colon. Through using a preoperative&#xD;
      CT scan which can map these arteries very precisely one can ligate these vessels closer to&#xD;
      their origin and thus remove more lymph nodes which may potentially harbor cancer cells. This&#xD;
      study aims to compare patients operated more radically through use of preoperative CT which&#xD;
      maps the mentioned arteries with patients operated in the standard way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Norwegian gastrointestinal cancer group has recommended D3 resection as the standard&#xD;
      operative technique for colon cancer. D3 resection implies ligation of the blood vessels at&#xD;
      their origin. There is evidence that the recurrence free period and survival improves with&#xD;
      the number of lymph nodes harvested at surgery. However, the current practice in Norway,&#xD;
      while performing right hemicolectomy for cancer is to ligate the feeding vessels for the&#xD;
      right colon on the right hand side of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). Significant&#xD;
      arterial stumps have been demonstrated in patients operated for right colon cancer with this&#xD;
      technique (right colic artery and ileocolic artery vascular stumps with an average length of&#xD;
      3.5 cm and 2.5 cm, respectively). This leaves reason to believe that a certain number of&#xD;
      central lymph nodes remain after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex anatomical relationship between the right colic artery and ileocolic artery with&#xD;
      the superior mesenteric vein make D3 resection demanding, especially if the right colic&#xD;
      artery lies posterior to the SMV. These relationships are investigated in detail in&#xD;
      postmortem anatomical studies. These studies show that the right colic artery lies most often&#xD;
      anterior to the SMV, while the ileocolic artery lies most often posterior to the SMV. Data&#xD;
      has also been provided that a CT angiography can verify these relations as well as postmortem&#xD;
      anatomical studies in living patients, thus allowing the surgeon to be aware of them prior to&#xD;
      surgery. This could prove to be crucial in planning the procedure.&#xD;
