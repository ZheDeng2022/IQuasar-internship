      Acute dyspnea and chest discomfort are common complaints. Distinguishing between the entities&#xD;
      that may present with such symptoms can be difficult. This project aims to study - venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE) - a difficult diagnosis that can easily be missed yet its treatment is&#xD;
      highly effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VTE represents a spectrum of disease ranging from deep vein thrombosis to pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      (PE). Early diagnosis of PE is usually based on suspicion raised by clinical symptoms&#xD;
      combined with a medical history of obvious predisposing factors. However, in around 30% of&#xD;
      cases PE occurs in the absence of any predisposing factors. Individual clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PE is generally associated with hypoxaemia, but up to 20% of patients with PE have a normal&#xD;
      arterial oxygen pressure .Classic ECG changes are generally associated with the more severe&#xD;
      forms of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-markers such as Plasma D-dimer (DD) have been investigated extensively in recent years.&#xD;
      It has been shown that a normal DD level renders acute PE or DVT unlikely; on the other hand&#xD;
      DD is not useful for confirming VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT angiography(CTA) has become the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature for&#xD;
      suspected PE. Yet as in DD the pre-test probability of PE based on the clinician's abilities&#xD;
      highly affects the results of the CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While VTE is a fairly common and sometimes lethal condition its diagnosis is difficult and&#xD;
      based more on clinical hunches than on highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. It's&#xD;
      quite evident that finding a novel, sensitive and even more importantly specific biomarker&#xD;
      for PE would change the current approach and work-up needed for reaching a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose using serum levels of surfactant associated protein (SAP) as such a bio-marker.&#xD;
      Surfactant is a unique phospholipoprotein secreted solely by type II alveolar cells in the&#xD;
      lungs. About 90% of the surfactant structure is composed of phospholipids and the remaining&#xD;
      10% is composed of specific proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims: PE causes ischemic damage to lung tissue. Such damage will&#xD;
      ultimately lead to a rise of serum SPA. The primary objective of this project is to ascertain&#xD;
      the fact that indeed there is a rise of serum SPA among patients diagnosed with PE, what is&#xD;
      the time-concentration profile of such rise and is the rise correlated to the size of the&#xD;
      embolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be designed as a prospective study consisting of several steps. The&#xD;
      measurement of serum SPA will be done by commercially available ELISA kits. All patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled by researchers from both the ER and internal B ward at the Rambam Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable implications to Medicine: If indeed SPA levels will be proven to be a novel&#xD;
      bio-marker for PE this could ultimately lead to a totally different approach in the&#xD;
      classification and treatment of patients presenting with signs that may be associated with&#xD;
      PE.&#xD;
