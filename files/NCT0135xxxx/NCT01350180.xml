  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the biggest problems facing prostate cancer patients and their treating physicians is&#xD;
      who needs to be treated and when. Common clinical and pathological parameters are useful&#xD;
      (PSA, Gleason score, etc.) but do not clearly predict who will benefit from treatment and who&#xD;
      will fail. Genetic markers for tumor aggressivity would be of greater value. The finding that&#xD;
      the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is associated with an increase risk of cancer progression is&#xD;
      important. TMPRSS2 is controlled by androgen (testosterone) and ERG is part of a family of&#xD;
      proteins which have a role in controlling cell growth, cell specialization and producing&#xD;
      tumors. As a consequence of this gene fusion, production of the ERG protein increases in the&#xD;
      presence of testosterone and could be key to the development of prostate cancer, resistance&#xD;
      to treatment and poor outcome. The PTEN gene is known to have a role as a tumor suppressor.&#xD;
      Its deletion is a contributing factor in the development of prostate cancers and poor&#xD;
      outcome. The coexistence of the two markers could be associated with a higher risk of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there have been no studies regarding the presence of either of these two markers or&#xD;
      their coexistence in high risk prostate cancer patients who, despite radiation therapy and&#xD;
      androgen suppression, develop biochemical failure (their PSA levels rise once again).&#xD;
      Patients participating in the PCS IV study (high risk prostate cancer treated with radiation&#xD;
      therapy plus either 18 or 36 months of hormonal suppression) who have had biochemical failure&#xD;
      or 3 years of follow-up post hormonal therapy will be approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor blocks from consenting patients will be collected and analyzed for the presence of the&#xD;
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and the PTEN deletion at the Pathology Department of the Jewish&#xD;
      General Hospital. Statistical analysis will be carried out to see whether either or both&#xD;
      markers are present, whether they are associated with certain clinical and pathological high&#xD;
      risk factors, and whether they can be used to predict which patients will fail treatment.&#xD;

    <description>biopsy samples of patients treated for high risk prostate cancer with radical radiation and hormonal therapy who have either biochemical failure or 3-year post treatment follow-up free of cancer recurrences will be tested for the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and the PTEN deletion. The results between the two groups will be compared to see if either DNA changes are an indicator of disease recurrence.</description>
