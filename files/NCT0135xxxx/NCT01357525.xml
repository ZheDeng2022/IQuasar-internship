  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to further investigate the impact of Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy following pancreatic resection with a close or positive margin. The investigators&#xD;
      hope to improve local control, and through the use of a shortened treatment schedule, allow&#xD;
      patients to begin systemic therapy earlier.&#xD;

      Radiation simulation will be done in Shadyside Radiation Oncology department&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced CT based simulation will be obtained prior to any adjuvant treatment (2-4&#xD;
      weeks post-op depending on healing). The target volume will be identified based on fiducial&#xD;
      marker placement at time of surgery as well as a detailed discussion and image review with&#xD;
      the operating surgeon. This are will be contoured on axial CT images obtained at 1.25 mm&#xD;
      slice thickness. These volumes will then be reconstructed into a 3-dimensional image set for&#xD;
      SBRT planning. Subjects will be simulated in the treatment position (supine with arms raised)&#xD;
      on the CT scanner table the appropriate immobilization. OptirayÂ® contrast will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/s. A helical CT scan of the abdomen will&#xD;
      be acquired with intravenous contrast starting 30 seconds prior to CT acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4D CT data acquisition for the same axial extent will be obtained. The images will then be&#xD;
      electronically transferred from the CT workstation via DICOM3 to the appropriate treatment&#xD;
      planning workstation in the department of radiation oncology. Based on axial CT images,&#xD;
      fiducial marker placement, review of the pathology report, and a detailed discussion with the&#xD;
      operating surgeon, contours will be drawn of the clinical target volume (CTV), which is&#xD;
      defined as the area at risk for microscopic disease. The planning target volume (PTV) will be&#xD;
      equivalent to the CTV unless motion is detected on the 4D motion study. If there is motion,&#xD;
      the amount of motion in the superior-inferior, lateral, and anterior-posterior directions&#xD;
      will be the margin given. Surrounding normal and critical structures will also be contoured&#xD;
      by the treating radiation oncologist including the kidneys, liver, small bowel, spinal cord,&#xD;
      and stomach if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Planning An SBRT plan will be created by a medical physicist&#xD;
      based on the PTV contoured on the CT scan. The plan will be to deliver fractionated SBRT to&#xD;
      the isodose line best encompassing the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful evaluation of each plan will be conducted by the radiosurgical team to ensure that&#xD;
      normal tissues and critical structures tolerances are maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum dose (in Gy) within the treatment volume (MD), prescriptions dose (PD), and the&#xD;
      ratio of MD/PD (as a measure of heterogeneity within the target volume), prescription isodose&#xD;
      volume (PIV in mm3), tumor volume (TV in mm3), and the ratio of PIV/TV (as a measure of dose&#xD;
      conformity of the treatment relative to the target) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation during treatment The subjects will be carefully followed while on active treatment&#xD;
      and post-treatment for 24 months, or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment following SBRT All patients will have been seen in a multi-disciplinary pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer clinic. As such, they will be set up with a medical oncologist. Following completion&#xD;
      of SBRT as described in this protocol, the patient's medical oncologist may, at his/her&#xD;
      discretion, administer systemic therapy according to the current standard of care or the UPMC&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;

    <description>The FACT-G is a 27 item questionnaire that assesses physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. will be provided to patients and self-administered prior to SBRT, after completion of SBRT, and at each follow-up. The survey takes 5 minutes to complete and employs as five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Subscale scores added to obtain total score. Scoring range is between 0-108 points. Negatively worded items are reverse scored prior to summing so that higher subscale and total scores indicate better QoL.</description>
