    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if SGN-35 (brentuximab vedotin) can help&#xD;
      to control ALCL, LyP or MF in patients with at least 1 of the 3 skin lymphomas. The safety of&#xD;
      the study drug will also be studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody that is designed to find a certain protein (called CD30)&#xD;
      on cancer cells and bind to it. It is designed to then enter the cell and release a molecule&#xD;
      that may kill the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will begin receiving brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin by vein over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle. If you have side effects&#xD;
      after your first dose and your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, future doses may be&#xD;
      lowered or delayed for up to 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have any reactions at the infusion site after you receive the study drug during Cycle&#xD;
      1, you may be given acetaminophen (Tylenol) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      before all following infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinic visit, including follow-up visits (described below), you will have full skin&#xD;
      exams. You will be checked to see how much of your skin's surface has lesions. Up to 6 skin&#xD;
      lesions will be selected to be photographed and measured at each visit. Your private areas&#xD;
      will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be taken unless&#xD;
      there are lesions on your face. You will not be able to be identified in the photographs. The&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will also be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of all study cycles (before you receive the study drug):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs that you may be taking and if you are having any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 5 questionnaires about your quality of life and itching symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have not had a lesion biopsy within the last 6 weeks you will have a lesion&#xD;
           biopsy to check the status of the disease and for PGx testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the study drug for up to 8 cycles. You will be taken off study if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease has a complete response, you may receive the study drug for 2 more cycles if&#xD;
      the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease has complete response, then comes back, you may receive the study drug for 8&#xD;
      more cycles if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are doing better at the end of 8 cycles but the disease is not in complete remission,&#xD;
      the study doctor may allow you to receive the study drug every 3 weeks at the full dose or&#xD;
      every 2 weeks at a lower dose for 8 additional cycles. If you continue to have improvement&#xD;
      after these 16 cycles, the study doctor may allow you to continue receiving the study drug.&#xD;
      The study doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3-4 weeks after you have stopped taking the study drug, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you are having any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 5 questionnaires about your quality of life and itching symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4-6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a lesion biopsy to check the status of the disease and for PGx testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You or your primary doctor may be contacted for long-term follow-up on the status of the&#xD;
      disease, any study-related nerve damage (including loss of motor or sensory function) you&#xD;
      have, and your overall health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be every 12-16 weeks for the first 2 years after the last dose. Then, the&#xD;
      follow-up will be every 6 months (+/- 1 month) up to a maximum period of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Brentuximab vedotin is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for use in patients with ALCL. It is currently being used for LyP and MF for&#xD;
      research purposes only. You will receive $15 coupons for valet parking for each clinic visit&#xD;
      you make during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 84 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a biopsy confirmed diagnosis based on a combination of histological&#xD;
             and clinical criteria of CD30+ lymphomatoid papulosis, CD30+ primary cutaneous&#xD;
             anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (pc-ALCL), or CD30+ mycosis fungoides for the phase&#xD;
             II trial. There is no specific limit or validated amount other than positive cells on&#xD;
             1HC cells in tumor cells.&#xD;

             or visceral organs) may be included so long as pc-ALCL was the primary diagnosis for&#xD;
             at least 6 months before systemic involvement was confirmed. MF patients must be stage&#xD;
             IB or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systemic involvement (i.e., nodal, bone marrow or visceral organ involvement) will be&#xD;
             evaluated by CT and/or PET and bone marrow biopsy(if indicated on patients with blood&#xD;
             involvement) in patients with pc-ALCL or MF at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients' biopsies must be histologically confirmed CD30 positive within 36 months of&#xD;

             radiation therapy, phototherapy, topical chemotherapy, or have failed systemic therapy&#xD;
             of at least one single agent (e.g., methotrexate or bexarotene or other non-CD30&#xD;
             antibody) or one multi-agent chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
             vincristine, and prednisone). pc-ALCL classified patients are required to have one or&#xD;
             more cutaneous tumors that by history have been present for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All patients must be considered an eligible candidate for systemic therapy as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator. To be eligible, LYP patients must be in need of&#xD;
             systemic therapy ie have scarring or active lesions (&gt;/=10 per month), or any number&#xD;
             of active lesions on face, hands or feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have the following minimum wash-out from previous treatments: a. &gt;/= 4&#xD;

             prescription or topical therapy. c. &gt;/= 12 weeks for any immunotherapy (e.g.,&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody). Patients with rapidly progressive disease may be treated earlier&#xD;
             than the required washout period; patients should have recovered from prior&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must be available for periodic blood sampling, study-related assessments, and&#xD;
             management of toxicity at the treating institution.&#xD;
