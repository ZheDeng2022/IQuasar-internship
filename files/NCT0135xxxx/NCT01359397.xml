  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is estimated that in the Netherlands each year approximately 900 patients with&#xD;
      gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction are candidates for&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Randomized studies comparing chemotherapy versus best supportive care have&#xD;
      shown that survival and quality of life are prolonged with chemotherapy. However, no&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen is clearly superior with regard to prolongation of survival. Therefore,&#xD;
      tolerability of treatment and ease of administration (outpatient compared to inpatient) are&#xD;
      important considerations for the development of novel treatment schedules. Study design: This&#xD;
      is an open-label, multicentre, phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine chemotherapy (B-DOC)&#xD;
      as first-line therapy in patients with inoperable locally advanced or recurrent and/or&#xD;
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction. In case of HER2&#xD;
      positive inoperable locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction trastuzumab is added to this regimen (B-DOCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint Progression free survival defined as the time measured from B-DOCT study,&#xD;
      Protocol version 3.0 dated January 18, 2011 Page 5 / 60 the day of registration to first&#xD;
      progression or death. Secondary endpoints Toxicity Overall survival, defined as the time from&#xD;
      registration to death Response rate defined as the percentage of partial and complete&#xD;
      responses Duration of response defined as time from response to first progression&#xD;
      Translational research on pharmacogenomic and biological factors that may predict treatment&#xD;
