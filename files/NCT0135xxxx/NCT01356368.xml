  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at piloting the concept of customization of chemotherapy based on molecular&#xD;
      markers in patients with stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) and IV with performance status ≤&#xD;
      2 with pathologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will not test or&#xD;
      compare individual regimen but rather it will test the approach of customization concept as a&#xD;
      whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will help in designing more definitive trials in our patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of advanced NSCLC cancer includes various chemotherapies with equivalent&#xD;
      regimens that have reached a therapeutic plateau. The selection of these regimens is&#xD;
      completely empirical and physician dependent. Potential predictors of specific agent efficacy&#xD;
      exist in the form of tumor molecular markers that are a reflection of the individual's&#xD;
      genetic make up. Thus our study aims at utilizing these markers to more efficiently select&#xD;
      the regimen in order to maximize the benefit to the patients rather than using empiric&#xD;
      approaches. Fortunately, each of our selected regimens contains active and well-studied&#xD;
      agents in the treatment of lung cancer (Table 1). This pilot study will help us determine the&#xD;
      benefit, and safety of this approach (not individual regimen). The study is not to compare&#xD;
      individual regimens but it aims at testing the whole concept of customization of chemotherapy&#xD;
      based on molecular markers to help us in the future at selecting regimens based on these&#xD;
      markers and not empirically. The results then will be used to determine more definitive&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, circulating tumor cells in the blood represent the future distant metastases&#xD;
      that result in disease progression to incurable stages. The circulating tumor cells have the&#xD;
      ability to cross into vessels, travel in circulation, and exit the vessels into tissues where&#xD;
      they have the capability to grow. Therefore, these cells may express different biological and&#xD;
      molecular features from the stationary cells in the primary tumors. Therefore, exploiting&#xD;
      these circulating tumor cells for augmenting treatment approaches is of vital importance and&#xD;
      utility.&#xD;
