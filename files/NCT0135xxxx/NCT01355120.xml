  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm clinical phase II study to further&#xD;
      characterize the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with or without systemic&#xD;
      pretreatment metastatic ocular melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DeCOG-MM-PAL11-Trial will be continued only for patients with ocular melanoma because&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma patients have already been recruited. In&#xD;
      order to allow the separate subgroup analysis as planned in the protocol for ocular melanoma&#xD;
      it is mandatory to focus the recruitment to this patient population. Only this will guarantee&#xD;
      a valid evaluation of all cohorts. Ocular melanoma is defined as melanomas originated from&#xD;
      uvea, the choroid, the ciliary body and conjunctiva. (see McCartney ACE &quot;Pathology of ocular&#xD;
      melanomas&quot; British Medical Bulltta, 1995, Vol 51, No 3 pp 678-693) The same criteria and&#xD;
      treatment procedure as those used before will be applied for the patients with advanced&#xD;
      ocular melanoma. Since no treatment standard in those patients does exist, also patients&#xD;
      without prior systemic treatment can be included in this study. Therefore, the 5th inclusion&#xD;
      criterion has been adapted in order to enrol the eligible patients.&#xD;

      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the anti-CTLA-4 mAb Ipilimumab monotherapy of each patient in the scope of&#xD;
      this trial is defined as induction plus re-induction of eligible patients until 12 months&#xD;
      after first receipt of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will be applied to melanoma patients according to the protocol of the completed&#xD;
      Medarex study MDX-010-20: Ipilimumab by IV infusion, 3 mg/kg, day 1 (Week 1), 22 (Week 4), 43&#xD;
      (Week 7), 64 (Week 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who progress following stable disease of â‰¥ 3 months duration starting from diagnosis&#xD;
      at week 12 tumor assessment or patients who have progressed following an initial response&#xD;
      (partial or complete) assessed at week 12 may be offered additional cycles of therapy with&#xD;
      the originally assigned treatment regimen until off-treatment criteria are met, provided they&#xD;
      meet re-treatment eligibility requirements. No patient will be re-treated if they experience&#xD;
      a Grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal or certain other immune-related adverse events (irAE)&#xD;
      (refer to section 5.2 and 5.3). No patient with disease progression following the first cycle&#xD;
      of study medication will be permitted to be re-treated with study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease will be assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks and for patients with stable disease&#xD;
      or better responses, thereafter every 12 weeks in the absence of PD with a maximum of one&#xD;
      year. Response evaluation will be done according to immune-related response criteria (Wolchok&#xD;
      et al., CCR 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who prematurely discontinued treatment due to a drug-related adverse event prior&#xD;
      to Week 12 (in the absence of disease progression) will return for all study visits and&#xD;
      procedures including Week 12 and, if appropriate, further re-staging assessments. Any patient&#xD;
      with documented progression at any scheduled re-staging visit and who will not receive any&#xD;
      re-induction will undergo no further re-staging visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival will be assessed every 3 months after the final dose of Ipilimumab until the end of&#xD;
      the follow-up phase for the individual patient. FU phase for each subject is 1 year following&#xD;
      first treatment dose. End of study will be at recruitment finished plus 1 year post start of&#xD;
      treatment of last patient thus ensuring that 1 year survival rate can be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study is 1 year post LPFV. Recruiting period for the ocular melanoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period of recruiting 12-18 months Enrolment start date (FPI): QIII 2011 Enrolment finish date&#xD;
      (LPI): QI 2013 End of study: QI 2014&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient requires concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon,&#xD;
             or other non-study immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive&#xD;
             agents; other investigation therapies; any other systemic therapy for cancer including&#xD;
             any other experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient requires chronic use of systemic corticosteroids. Systemic steroids for&#xD;
             management of symptoms due to brain mets should be avoided if possible or subject&#xD;
             should be stable on the lowest clinically effective dose. Topical or inhalational&#xD;
             steroids are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
             including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are&#xD;
             patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic&#xD;
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune&#xD;
             vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune&#xD;
             origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Symptomatic CNS metastases (Remark: Asymptomatic stable, untreated or pretreated&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) metastasis are allowed)&#xD;

          6. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient is known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or other&#xD;
             chronic infections (HBV, HCV) or has another confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive&#xD;
             or immunodeficient condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability&#xD;
             to give informed consent or to comply with the trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Lack of availability for clinical follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that&#xD;
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to&#xD;
             unacceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Other serious illnesses, e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics or bleeding&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with serious intercurrent illness, requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential: Refusal or inability to use effective means of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with melanoma who have another active, concurrent, malignant disease are not&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous&#xD;
             cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Previous treatment with ipilimumab&#xD;
