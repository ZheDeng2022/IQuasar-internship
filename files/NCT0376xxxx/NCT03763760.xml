  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Study is to test a higher dose of steroids(Dexamethasone) given just prior&#xD;
      to surgery in the setting of Fast-Track Hip-surgery with Arthroplasty in a group of expected&#xD;
      High Pain Responders and the effect on postoperative pain and postoperative inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study compares a new High-Dose dosage of steroids in the treatment of postoperative pain&#xD;
      after Hip Arthroplasty in a Fast-Track setting in a group of expected High Pain Responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compare the already used dose(medium dose) with a new high dose(HD) steroid&#xD;
      given as an intravenous bolus after the spinal anaesthesia has been given, but before the&#xD;
      surgery starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that by attenuating the inflammatory response to the surgery itself by the&#xD;
      steroid Dexamethasone, the investigators expect a reduction in postoperative pain upon&#xD;
      ambulation 24 hours after unilateral Hip Arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to Unilateral Total Hip Arthroplasty because of Hip-osteoarthritis at&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospital, Capital Region of Denmark or Vejle Hospital, South Region of Denmark are&#xD;
      screened and offered inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be randomized and double blinded. One group will be treated, as the&#xD;
      current guideline in the investigator's Orthopedic fast-track Arthroplasty center, with the&#xD;
      medium dose of steroid (0,3 mg dexamethasone/kg bodyweight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other group wil be treated with a high dose of steroid (1,0 mg dexamethasone/kg&#xD;
      bodyweight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be monitored the first 7 days after surgery, during the admission to the&#xD;
      hospital, and by a Pain-diary in the patients own home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will be taken preoperatively and postoperatively to determine the effect of the&#xD;
      highdose steroid on the inflammatory response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of patients with moderate postoperative pain in a 5 meter walk test 24 hours postoperatively after total knee-arthroplasty.&#xD;
Pain is monitored by the Visual Analog Scale(VAS) 0-100 mm, where 0 is no pain and 100 mm is the worst pain. Moderate pain is considered a VAS &gt;30 mm.</description>

    <description>Pain summarized over the first 7 days after surgery, assessed by a summation of the Visual Analog Scale(VAS)-scores in the first 7 days as noted in the pain diary filed in by the participants.&#xD;
Pain is monitored by the Visual Analog Scale(VAS) 0-100 mm, where 0 is no pain and 100 mm is the worst pain one can imagine. Moderate pain is considered a VAS &gt;30 mm.</description>

    <measure>Why still in hospital, an audit into the reasons the patient has not yet been discharged from the ward.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An investigation into reason of why our patients remain in the hospital in the days after total Knee Arthroplasty in our Fast-Track center. This is investigated through a questionnaire previously used in a similar investigation in our center.&#xD;
The questionnaire is filled in by our project nurse. the questionnaire is a checkmark schedule with predetermined reasons to stay in hospital like low bloodpressure, sedation, dizzyness, lack of physiotherapy and medical and surgical complications.&#xD;
The outcome assesment will be descriptive.</description>
