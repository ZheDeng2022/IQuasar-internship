    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety of the Quadrivalent Influenza&#xD;
      Vaccine (QIV). Safety is assessed throughout the study period, and includes solicited&#xD;
      injection site and systemic reactions (Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination); unsolicited adverse&#xD;
      events up to Day 28, and serious adverse events occurring throughout the study.&#xD;

      Study duration for previously unvaccinated participants aged 6 months to 8 years is&#xD;
      approximately 56 days. Study duration for previously vaccinated participants aged 6 months to&#xD;
      8 years and any participant aged 9 years and older is approximately 28 days.&#xD;
