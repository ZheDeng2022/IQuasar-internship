    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of esophageal cancer is ranked seventh in the world, and the mortality rate&#xD;
      ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer&#xD;
      is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the&#xD;
      failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators designed a single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced cancerous&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
