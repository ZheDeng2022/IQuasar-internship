    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter Humanitarian Device&#xD;
      Exemption (HDE) study to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of the&#xD;
      poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) Scaffold (&quot;Scaffold&quot;) in subjects with&#xD;
      thoracic AIS A traumatic spinal cord injury at neurological level of injury of T2-T12 as&#xD;
      compared to standard of care open spine surgery. Subjects will be randomized in a blinded&#xD;
      manner to one of two study arms, the Treatment or &quot;Scaffold&quot; Arm and the Standard of Care or&#xD;
      &quot;Comparator&quot; Arm. Subjects in the Scaffold Arm will have the Scaffold implantation&#xD;
      immediately following standard of care open spine surgery. Subjects in the Comparator Arm&#xD;
      will have standard of care open spine surgery and will not receive the Scaffold. The subjects&#xD;
      will be blinded to their study arm for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate whether the Scaffold is safe and demonstrates probable benefit&#xD;
      for the treatment of complete T2-T12 spinal cord injury as compared to standard of care open&#xD;
      spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory Objective: To enhance the clinical evidence for the Scaffold in the treatment of&#xD;
      complete thoracic spinal cord injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Use: The Scaffold is intended for use in patients age 16-70 years diagnosed with a&#xD;
      T2-T12 neurological level of injury functionally complete (AIS A) spinal cord injury for whom&#xD;
      open spine surgery, (e.g., laminectomy, spine stabilization) which allows access to the dura&#xD;
      of the injured spinal cord, is recommended as an option. The Scaffold is intended to be&#xD;
      implanted in a cavity at the epicenter of the spinal cord contusion during open spine&#xD;
      surgery. The Scaffold is intended for use in recent (≤7 days) spinal cord injuries that do&#xD;
      not involve penetrating injury to the cord or complete severing of the cord.&#xD;

    <description>The investigational product (&quot;Neuro-Spinal ScaffoldTM&quot; or &quot;Scaffold&quot;) is a porous bioresorbable polymer scaffold comprised of a synthetic biomaterial, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) (PLGA-PLL). The Scaffold is cylindrical in shape (3 mm diameter) and is available is three lengths (6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm) for optimal fit in the intraspinal lesion cavity.&#xD;
