  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UNC Get REAL &amp; HEEL (GR&amp;H) program has provided after treatment support for women with a&#xD;
      breast cancer diagnosis since 2006. The 16-week program includes an individualized training&#xD;
      program and the opportunity to continue working out in the GR&amp;H facilities at the conclusion&#xD;
      of the 16-week program. The purpose of this protocol is to implement a research agenda at&#xD;
      GR&amp;H that will examine the efficacy of the program. The primary aim of this study is a&#xD;
      pre-post test of the impact of the GR&amp;H program (standardized combination of aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance training) on VO2peak1,2. The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate quality&#xD;
      of life as well as cardiorespiratory function (vascular health), physical function (muscular&#xD;
      strength, body composition), cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes (fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, quality of life). Exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact&#xD;
      of exercise on biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) immune cell function - total leukocyte&#xD;
      count, T and natural killer cells, monocytes, and neutrophils count and activity, and (3)&#xD;
      circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the impact of the Get REAL and HEEL research program (standardized combination of&#xD;
      aerobic and resistance training) on change in V02peak from pre to post 16-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the impact of the GR&amp;H program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      training) on change in cardiorespiratory function, immunology, physical function parameters,&#xD;
      cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes from pre to post 16-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate changes in all measures annually over the 5 year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report on enrollment, recruitment, and attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact of exercise on&#xD;
      biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) total leukocyte, lymphocyte (T cells and natural killer&#xD;
      cells), monocyte and neutrophil counts and T cell proliferation assays, natural killer&#xD;
      cytotoxicity assays, and cytokine production from stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, and&#xD;
      (3) circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete pre-intervention assessments, questionnaires and blood draw at&#xD;
      week 1 and 2 pre-intervention, followed by a 16-week aerobic and resistance training exercise&#xD;
      program (intervention). Participants will complete assessments, questionnaires and blood&#xD;
      draws at week 1 and 2 following the intervention and then again at 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
      following intervention. Questionnaires only will be administered at year 2, 3,4 and 5&#xD;
      following intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Ultrasound -- LogicView™ software (General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA) will be used to generate real-time panoramic cross-sectional images of the VL. Three panoramic scans at a gain of 50dB and a depth of 5.0 cm. All image analyses will be completed using Image-J software (version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, USA) with each image area individually scaled from pixels to centimeters via the straight-line function. The polygon function will be used to determine the CSA of the VL by selecting a region including mostly muscle and minimal surrounding fascia. Greater EI values represent greater fibrous (non-muscular) composition.</description>

        Potential study participants with confirmed early-stage breast cancer will be screened&#xD;
        through a review of daily clinic schedules for patients seen at the North Carolina Cancer&#xD;
        Hospital. Patients must have recently completed their initial treatment (be within one year&#xD;
        of completion).&#xD;

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible for this protocol if they have&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  histologically confirmed early stage (non-metastatic) breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and have recently (within 1 year) completed their initial treatment (they may continue&#xD;
             to be on endocrine treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exclusions will be made based on ethnicity or race, although patients must be able to&#xD;
        read and speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must provide IRB-approved signed written informed consent. The consent&#xD;
        includes access to their medical records, including demographic and billing information,&#xD;
        diagnoses, treatments, and laboratory results. Participants may also be asked to provide&#xD;
        permission to contact their non-UNC doctors for additional medical record information, and&#xD;
        may also require a medical release from various treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Interested persons must agree to adhere to the 16-week GR&amp;H protocol and complete all blood&#xD;
        draws, assessments and questionnaires to the best of their ability. The informed consent&#xD;
        will also include annual follow-up assessments and questionnaires for up to 5 years after&#xD;
        they have completed the 16-week program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are approached about participating in LCCC1630 and decline to do so are able&#xD;
        to join GR&amp;H as a supportive care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Interested persons will be excluded from study participation if&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  they do not have evidence of a cancer diagnosis or completion of surgery, radiation&#xD;
             and/or chemotherapy treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  or if they have previously completed the GR&amp;H exercise program. Entirely at the&#xD;
             discretion of GR&amp;H investigators, physical function and other assessments conducted at&#xD;
             baseline may also determine that a patient is not medically suitable for the GR&amp;H&#xD;
             protocol. Consented patients who are determined to be medically not suited for the&#xD;
             GR&amp;H protocol (unevaluable) will remain in the study for analyses comparing those who&#xD;
             are evaluable with those who are not.&#xD;
