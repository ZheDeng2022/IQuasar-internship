    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine dispersible and immediate release tablets in HIV-1-infected&#xD;
      children less than 12 years of age.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of fixed-dose&#xD;
      combination abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) dispersible and immediate&#xD;
      release tablets in HIV-1-infected children less than 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be enrolled into one of five ABC/DTG/3TC dosing groups based on their weight.&#xD;
      The first 5-7 children within each weight-band will undergo intensive PK assessments 5-10&#xD;
      days after starting ABC/DTG/3TC to confirm dose selection. Children will remain on their&#xD;
      initial dose of ABC/DTG/3TC through Week 4. After Week 4, ABC/DTG/3TC dosing will be adjusted&#xD;
      based on PK results at the individual or weight-band level, and/or an individual child's&#xD;
      growth and weight gain over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up study visits for all participants will occur at Weeks 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48.&#xD;
      Some participants may attend additional study visits at Weeks 2, 6, 8, 16, and/or 20. Study&#xD;
      visits may include physical examination, study drug adherence and tolerability&#xD;
      questionnaires, blood collection, and intensive PK sampling. Following the Week 48 study&#xD;
      visit, some children may continue on the study for up to 144 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Less than 12 years of age at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Accrual will initially be restricted to children six months (180 days) of&#xD;
                  age and older. Once the Protocol Team has confirmed that data are available to&#xD;
                  support the specified weight band dosing for children less than six months of&#xD;
                  age, this restriction will be lifted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight 6 kg to less than 40 kg at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve at entry or has been taking a stable ART regimen&#xD;
             for at least six consecutive months at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: For ART-naïve children, receipt of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis prior&#xD;
                  to diagnosis of HIV infection is permitted. For these children, ascertainment of&#xD;
                  this criterion may be based on parent or guardian report only, but available&#xD;
                  medical records should also be reviewed in relation to this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: For ART-experienced children (on a stable ART regimen), dose and&#xD;
                  formulation changes (e.g., for growth) within the six months prior to entry are&#xD;
                  permitted. For these children, ascertainment of this criterion must be based on&#xD;
                  medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For ART-experienced children (on a stable ART regimen), has had a suppressed HIV viral&#xD;
             load (HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/mL) for at least six consecutive months prior to&#xD;
             entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: To fulfill this criterion, at least two documented HIV-1 RNA results less&#xD;
                  than 200 copies/mL must be available, one based on a specimen collected at least&#xD;
                  six months prior to entry and one based on a specimen collected within 30 days&#xD;
                  prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Any documented HIV-1 RNA result greater than or equal to 200 copies/mL&#xD;
                  based on a specimen collected within six months prior to entry is exclusionary&#xD;
                  (see exclusion criterion below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, has normal, Grade 1, or Grade 2 laboratory test results for all of the&#xD;
             following, based on testing of specimens collected within 30 days prior to entry and&#xD;
             grading per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric&#xD;
             Adverse Events (refer to the study protocol for guidance on severity grading):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (greater than or equal to 8.5 g/dL or greater than or equal to 5.25&#xD;
                  mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (greater than or equal to 600 cells/mm^3 or greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 0.600 x 10^9 cells/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count (greater than or equal to 50,000 cells/mm^3 or greater than or&#xD;
                  equal to 50.00 x 10^9 cells/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; bedside Schwartz formula; greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) (less than 5.0 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (less than 5.0 x ULN)&#xD;

               -  Total bilirubin (less than 2.6 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Direct bilirubin (less than or equal to ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Laboratory tests may be repeated during the screening period (i.e., within&#xD;
                  30 days prior to entry), with the latest results used for eligibility&#xD;
                  determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: For treatment-experienced children on an atazanavir-containing ART regimen,&#xD;
                  Grade 3 or higher total bilirubin is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, has a negative test result for hepatitis B surface antigen based on&#xD;
             testing of a specimen collected within 30 days prior to entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed HIV-1-infection based on documented testing of two samples collected at&#xD;
             different time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sample #1 may be tested using any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Two rapid antibody tests from different manufacturers or based on different&#xD;
                       principles and epitopes&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  One enzyme immunoassay OR Western Blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR&#xD;
                       chemiluminescence assay&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  One HIV total nucleic acid test&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sample #2 may be tested using any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Rapid antibody test. If this option is used in combination with two rapid&#xD;
                       tests for Sample #1, at least one of the three rapid tests must be United&#xD;
                       States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, and the third rapid test&#xD;
                       must be from a third manufacturer or based on a third principle or epitope.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  One enzyme immunoassay OR Western Blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Whole blood, plasma, or serum samples must be tested. If both samples are tested&#xD;
                  using antibody tests, at least one of the samples must be tested in a laboratory&#xD;
                  that operates according to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice guidelines and&#xD;
                  participates in an appropriate external quality assurance program. If nucleic&#xD;
                  acid testing is used, at least one test must be performed in a Clinical&#xD;
                  Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified (for US sites) or Virology&#xD;
                  Quality Assurance (VQA) certified (for non-US sites) laboratory. For tests&#xD;
                  performed in other settings, adequate source documentation including the date of&#xD;
                  specimen collection, date of testing, test performed, and test result must be&#xD;
                  available. FDA approved testing methods should be used when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-B*5701-negative based on documented testing at any time prior to entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Documented testing is required even if the potential participant has&#xD;
                  received ABC prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females of reproductive potential (defined as having experienced menarche), not&#xD;
             pregnant based on testing performed at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females of reproductive potential who are engaging in sexual activity that could&#xD;
             lead to pregnancy, willing to use two methods of contraception while receiving study&#xD;
             drug, based on participant and parent or guardian report at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One of the two methods must be highly effective; highly effective methods include&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal&#xD;
                  ligation, or salpingectomy) and the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Contraceptive intrauterine device or intrauterine system&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subdermal contraceptive implant&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Progestogen injections&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The highly effective method must be initiated prior to study entry. The second&#xD;
                  method should ideally be a barrier method. Male or female condom use is&#xD;
                  recommended with all other methods of contraception for dual protection against&#xD;
                  pregnancy and to avoid transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
                  infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on parent or guardian report at entry, child is expected to be available for 48&#xD;
             weeks of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent or legal guardian is willing and able to provide written informed consent for&#xD;
             child's study participation and, when applicable per local institutional review&#xD;
             board/ethics committee (IRB/EC) policies and procedures, child is willing and able to&#xD;
             provide written informed assent for study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
