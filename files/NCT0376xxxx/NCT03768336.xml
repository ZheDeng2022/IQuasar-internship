  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted&#xD;
      resiliency group program, called the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP-AYA), to&#xD;
      reduce stress and promote stress-management among adolescents and young adults who have&#xD;
      completed treatment for cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program, or 3RP, was developed by researchers at the MGH&#xD;
      Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. The 3RP is a group program that-through a&#xD;
      variety of mind-body approaches, such as imagery, relaxation, and yoga-seeks to buffer stress&#xD;
      and promote psychological resiliency and physical well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3RP has not yet been carried out with adolescent or young adult individuals who have&#xD;
      recently completed treatment for cancer. As such, the investigators have adapted the original&#xD;
      3RP to target the specific needs of adolescent and young adult patients who are transitioning&#xD;
      off active treatment. The investigators are conducting this study to see if the adapted&#xD;
      program, the 3RP-AYA, is effective at reducing stress and stress-related symptoms for people&#xD;
      of at least age 16 who have completed treatment for cancer within the past five years.&#xD;
