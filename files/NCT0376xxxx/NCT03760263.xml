      Release Tacrolimus&#xD;
    </textblock>

      1. Background and Rationale- The novel once-daily extended-release tacrolimus (ERT) has&#xD;
           been shown to be non-inferior to twice-daily tacrolimus (TDT) during induction&#xD;
           immunotherapy for kidney transplantation. The ERT (Envarsus) has a MeltDose technology&#xD;
           that allows for steadier absorption of tacrolimus throughout the entire gastrointestinal&#xD;
           tract. This drug has decreased peak to trough fluctuation. This decrease in variability&#xD;
           and stabilized trough level should allow for easier achievement of target drug levels&#xD;
           with fewer clinic visits and drug level assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To assess the safety of ERT versus TDT and effectiveness in achieving tacrolimus&#xD;
                trough therapeutic range during the first 6 months after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Primary End-Point&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Ability to achieve center specific target tacrolimus trough levels at the determined&#xD;
           intervals after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Percent of levels in range 2. As most levels occur in the first 6 months, a 6-month time&#xD;
      frame will be used for the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Secondary End-Points i. Number of dose adjustments required ii. Time in therapeutic range&#xD;
      for tacrolimus trough levels during intervals after transplantation based on the Rosendaal&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time within goal for each time period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time within larger goal of 6-11 iii. Number of lab draws required to achieve trough&#xD;
           tacrolimus levels iv. Time to get in therapeutic range v. Cost associated with&#xD;
           maintaining therapeutic troughs of tacrolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject Selection a. Subjects will be selected from patients scheduled to receive a&#xD;
           living donor or deceased donor kidney transplants at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital b.&#xD;
           Inclusion Criteria i. Age 18-70 ii. Receiving a kidney transplant at Sentara Norfolk&#xD;
           General Hospital iii. Able to give informed consent c. Exclusion Criteria i. Multi-organ&#xD;
           transplant ii. Previous functioning transplant iii. Prior surgery to the&#xD;
           gastrointestinal tract that alters the normal anatomy with the exception of&#xD;
           cholecystectomy iv. Women of childbearing potential who cannot or are unwilling to&#xD;
           maintain adequate contraception during the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Patients will be offered enrollment in the study prior to transplant and Informed&#xD;
           Consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Patients will be randomized to standard twice-daily tacrolimus (Prograf) or&#xD;
           once-daily extended-release tacrolimus (Envarsus) at a ratio of 1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods a. Informed Consent to participate in this study will be obtained prior to&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Study subjects will receive usual care induction immunosuppression with&#xD;
           Anti-thymocyte globulin or basiliximab, steroids and mycophenolate per the center's&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized and started on tacrolimus within 72&#xD;
           hours after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to study initiation, numbered packets will be created including randomized group&#xD;
           and the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The packets will be used in order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The group will be determined using the random number generator using values from 1-99&#xD;
           where a value of 1-66 will have an ERT assignment in the study packet and a value of&#xD;
           67-99 will have a TDT assignment in the study packet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Subjects randomized to the study group will start ERT at 8mg (or 4mg if concern for&#xD;
           delayed graft function) as a single daily dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Subjects randomized to the control group will start TDT at 8mg (or 4mg if concern&#xD;
           for delayed graft function) divided in half for a dose every 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. If a subject weighs less than or equal to 55kg, then the subject will receive a&#xD;
           reduced dose of either ERT or TDT at the provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Subjects' tacrolimus levels in the study will follow our regular post-transplant&#xD;
           care. This center uses an outpatient nursing protocol for most patients. If a patient is&#xD;
           excluded from the nursing protocol, their tacrolimus levels will be managed individually&#xD;
           and changes will be made at the nephrologist's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Prograf protocol (appendix A) ii. Envarsus protocol (appendix B) e. All other care is&#xD;
           routine (nothing done solely for the purpose of research). Other routine care includes:&#xD;
           i. Weekly clinic visits and labs for the first month, every other week for the second&#xD;
           month then a minimum of monthly through 6 months post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. During those visits, labs will be drawn, including a tacrolimus level, regardless of&#xD;
           study arm. Subjects will receive our routine nephrologist and nurse visits while in&#xD;
           clinic. Other specialists (surgeon, dietician, pharmacist, diabetes educator) will see&#xD;
           the subjects, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Dose changes will either be made in clinic or with a phone call to the subject&#xD;
           after clinic, if necessary. Tacrolimus dose changes will be directed by our nurse&#xD;
           protocols (appendix A and B). If the subject is excluded from the nursing protocol, the&#xD;
           level and dose will be managed by the nephrologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Investigator Responsibilities- The principal investigator will be responsible to ensure&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. all IRB required training for staff and investigators is completed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. all staff and investigators comply with the institution's patient and subject safety&#xD;
           requirements,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. data collection requirements are maintained. 6. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Continuous variables will be analyzed using student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U, where&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Categorical variables will be analyzed using the chi2 test or Fischer's Exact test where&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Power analysis for the primary endpoint which will evaluate each level and whether it is&#xD;
      in range or not i. Alpha =0.05, beta =0.8 ii. Prior data shows 41% of levels in range for&#xD;
      TDT. We predict that ERT dosing will have 53% of levels in range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. With a ratio of 2:1, the minimum will need 406 ERT levels (~38 patients) and 203 TDT&#xD;
      levels (~19 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. The number of patients is based on patients having 11 levels in the first 6 months, the&#xD;
      minimum number of based on our protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data collected includes : i. Inclusion/Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. If excluded, reason for exclusion ii. Randomization to Prograf or Envarsus iii.&#xD;
      Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Race&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Induction (thymoglobulin/basiliximab)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. CMV donor/recipient exposure status (+/+, +/-, -/+, or -/-)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Living or deceased donor iv. Transplant outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Rejection (Yes/No and if yes, time interval post-transplant in days). Defined as requiring&#xD;
      steroids, thymoglobulin, and/or IVIG 2. BK viremia (Yes/No and if yes, time interval&#xD;
      post-transplant in days) 3. CMV viremia (Yes/No and if yes, time interval post-transplant in&#xD;
      days) v. Tacrolimus level with time interval post-transplant in days (Yes/No/Not timed&#xD;
      correctly) vi. Tacrolimus dose 8. HIPPA Concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will collect data on patient demographics, treatments and outcomes of&#xD;
           treatments. Patient data collected will be de-identified of Protected Health Information&#xD;
           (PHI) and will not alter patient treatment. This study is designed to address fully&#xD;
           HIPAA's requirements for health data that are collected with patient consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study data may be made available to third parties, e.g., in the case of an audit&#xD;
           performed by regulatory authorities, provided the data are treated confidentially and&#xD;
           that the subject's privacy is guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects identities will not be identifiable or disclosed if results from the study are&#xD;
           published.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Data handling&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. The key to patient coding for identification (see Appendix C) and data collection forms&#xD;
      will be kept on a password protected computer in a locked office which is only accessible by&#xD;
      the investigators and research assistants. To maintain compliance with IRB requirements, the&#xD;
      study data will be maintained for the required period of three years. Once the study is&#xD;
      completed and data is retained for a minimum of 3 years per the requirements of the IRB, the&#xD;
      identifiable data will be destroyed .&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Human Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Due to the nature of the study, there is a potential risk in regards to breach of&#xD;
           patient confidentiality. This will be reduced with the collection of the patient's MRN&#xD;
           as the identifier, which will then be given a code (see Appendix C), and the storage of&#xD;
           this data on a password protected computer in a locked office. The records will be&#xD;
           secured for three years according to Federal regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. There are risks with blood draws that are bruising, swelling at site, and, in rare cases,&#xD;
      nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Both formulations of tacrolimus (ERT and TDT) are approved for this indication,&#xD;
      prevention of rejection after kidney transplant. Expected adverse events have been identified&#xD;
      from approval studies. Any serious adverse events will be reported to Veloxis's safety&#xD;
      partner, UBC. The study team has the forms to fill out. Any adverse events that require FDA&#xD;
      notification will be reported to MedWatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Benefits i. Subjects who are randomized to receive ERT will receive 6 months-worth of&#xD;
      study drug provided by the drug company. After 6 months, the subject's insurance company will&#xD;
      be billed for the drug and patients may be responsible for a copayment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Subjects will not have to pay to participate in the study. iii. Subjects will not be paid&#xD;
      to participate in the study. 11. Request for Support&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. The PI requests a 6-month supply of ERT for each subject randomized to the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. A request for funding for direct study activities will be requested when the research&#xD;
      center and the sponsor have agreed to the study protocol.&#xD;
