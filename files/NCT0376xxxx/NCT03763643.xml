  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open label, clinical trial to test that&#xD;
      hypothesis that plasmapheresis plus rituximab prior to kidney transplantation can prevent&#xD;
      recurrent FSGS in children and adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent FSGS is a risk factor for graft lost: Recurrence of FSGS can occur rapidly, within&#xD;
      minutes of transplantation, and can lead to immediate onset of proteinuria and graft&#xD;
      dysfunction. Recurrent FSGS is definitively diagnosed with a kidney biopsy. Early kidney&#xD;
      biopsies in recurrent FSGS often demonstrate only extensive foot process effacement with the&#xD;
      classic focal sclerosis appearing only after months of proteinuria. Recurrent FSGS is the&#xD;
      single most important cause of graft failure in patients with FSGS. Patients with recurrent&#xD;
      FSGS have significantly decreased graft survival compared to patients without recurrence and&#xD;
      often require multiple kidney transplants in their lifetime. A number of clinical risk&#xD;
      factors for recurrent FSGS have been identified including prior recurrence, Caucasian race,&#xD;
      rapid progression of primary FSGS to ESRD within 3 years, mesangial hypercellularity on&#xD;
      primary biopsy and living donor transplant, however these findings are inconsistent among&#xD;
      various small studies. 3 A recent study from Europe identified late steroid resistant FSGS&#xD;
      (nephrotic syndrome that is initially responsive to steroids, then later resistant) as a&#xD;
      strong risk factor for recurrence. These findings have been replicated in our recent&#xD;
      retrospective study of a North American cohort from the Midwest Pediatric Nephrology&#xD;
      Consortium (N=116) that showed risk of recurrent FSGS was 70.6% in children with late steroid&#xD;
      resistant FSGS compared to 35.8% risk in children with initial steroid resistant FSGS&#xD;
      (manuscript in preparation). Genetic risk factors for late steroid resistant FSGS are&#xD;
      unknown. In the same study Investigators identified native kidney biopsy findings that may&#xD;
      predict risk of recurrence. Unfortunately, an individual's risk of recurrent disease cannot&#xD;
      be predicted accurately prior to transplant. Thus, patients with FSGS have a high risk of&#xD;
      recurrent disease post-transplant that is difficult to predict and patients have poor kidney&#xD;
      transplant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmapheresis is utilized as a treatment for recurrent FSGS once it occurs: Several&#xD;
      therapies for recurrent FSGS have been attempted with varying degrees of success but there&#xD;
      remains no proven treatment for recurrent FSGS post-transplant. 7-10 The demonstration of a&#xD;
      possible causative circulating factor by Savin et. al. 11 galvanized the field to attempt&#xD;
      plasmapheresis to remove 'the permeability factor' as a therapy for recurrent FSGS.&#xD;
      Therefore, recurrent FSGS is most often treated with plasmapheresis to remove the circulating&#xD;
      factor and this is effective in a subset of patients. The results of uncontrolled single&#xD;
      center case reports and series suggest a benefit from plasmapheresis 12-14 although graft&#xD;
      loss from recurrent disease remains unacceptably high. Patients who do not respond to&#xD;
      plasmapheresis have rapidly progressive chronic kidney disease. These patients have been&#xD;
      treated with alternate agents such as rituximab, abatacept, or high dose cyclosporine with&#xD;
      variable responses.15-17 Ideally, therapies will be identified to prevent recurrent FSGS&#xD;
      before it occurs. Prevention of recurrent FSGS will lead to longer kidney transplant survival&#xD;
      and reduced health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatments are available to prevent the recurrence of FSGS after transplant: Since 2005,&#xD;
      there have been 3 published studies that have utilized a variety of protocols of&#xD;
      plasmapheresis for the prevention of recurrent FSGS with inconsistent results. 18-20 The&#xD;
      University of Minnesota pediatric transplant program has utilized pre-emptive plasmapheresis&#xD;
      in children at risk for recurrent FSGS since 2006. In a recent review of our data, the&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent FSGS post-transplant was not significantly different in patients who&#xD;
      had undergone pre-emptive prophylactic plasmapheresis versus historic controls who had not&#xD;
      (31% vs. 23%, p 0.5) (manuscript in press). Although this is a retrospective study, the data&#xD;
      seems to suggest that plasmapheresis alone is not effective for preventing recurrence of&#xD;
      FSGS. In addition, as stated above, the benefit of plasmapheresis in the treatment of&#xD;
      recurrence is reported. 12-14 Thus, plasmapheresis with additional preemptive strategies to&#xD;
      prevent recurrent FSGS are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab has been used to treat recurrent FSGS and is a promising novel therapy to prevent&#xD;
      recurrent disease. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B cells that&#xD;
      leads to B cell depletion that has been used successfully for the treatment of primary&#xD;
      steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome as well as steroid sensitive and resistant FSGS. 21,22&#xD;
      Rituximab may act in FSGS via alterations in B-cell/T-cell interactions leading to changes in&#xD;
      cytokine secretion or co-stimulation. Alternately, rituximab may have a direct effect on&#xD;
      podocyte structure and function as it has been found to bind directly to the sphingomyelin&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b protein on the surface of podocytes. 23 Recent systematic&#xD;
      reviews on the use of rituximab in the treatment of post-transplant FSGS (either with or&#xD;
      without plasmapheresis) demonstrate partial or complete remission in ~60% of treated&#xD;
      patients.15,24 The use of preemptive rituximab has been reported to be effective in&#xD;
      preventing recurrent FSGS in 4 patients at very high risk due to prior graft loss from&#xD;
      recurrent disease, however randomized controlled trials have not been performed. 25 Given the&#xD;
      effectiveness of rituximab in the treatment of some patients with both primary and recurrent&#xD;
      FSGS and the report of successful preemptive use of rituximab in high risk transplant&#xD;
      patients, treatment with Rituximab in patients with FSGS prior to kidney transplant is a&#xD;
      promising novel therapy to prevent recurrent disease. Preventing recurrent FSGS, rather than&#xD;
      treating it once it has already occurred, is likely to minimize graft injury and prolong&#xD;
      graft life, therefore preemptive strategies are needed.&#xD;
