  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify if postoperative aspirin use leads to a delay in fracture&#xD;
      healing. NSAIDs have long been avoided in the management of fractures, due to the belief that&#xD;
      they may impair fracture healing. As aspirin is frequently prescribed for long-term&#xD;
      management of various medical conditions, it is worth understanding if continuing to take&#xD;
      aspirin during the process of fracture healing has a clinically significant effect on the&#xD;
      rate of fracture healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite any new clinical research on aspirin's effects on fracture healing, it is now being&#xD;
      used more commonly in the setting of fracture due to its effectiveness as a means of VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis following major orthopedic surgery.5 Additionally, aspirin offers the benefit of&#xD;
      acting as an analgesic and many patients are prescribed aspirin in the long-term management&#xD;
      of various health conditions. With all of the potential therapeutic benefits of aspirin, it&#xD;
      is worth understanding whether prescribing this medication following operative fracture&#xD;
      repair may impose a risk of delayed fracture healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing surgical repair of ankle fractures at UAB who are deemed healthy enough&#xD;
      for orthopedic surgery will be enrolled. Patients with multiple traumatic injuries, patients&#xD;
      taking any type of blood-thinner medication, and patients taking aspirin prior to the start&#xD;
      of the study will be excluded. No other exclusions will be made based on prior health&#xD;
      conditions. There will be a group of patients that receives no aspirin and a group that does&#xD;
      receive aspirin. Approximately 250 patients will be randomly assigned to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified for potential enrollment based on their plan to undergo surgical&#xD;
      repair of ankle fracture at UAB hospital during the IRB approval period. This study will&#xD;
      follow patients following routine protocol for ankle fracture repair and follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into a group that is prescribed aspirin (325 mg) post-operatively vs. not&#xD;
      prescribed aspirin. Patients will be followed throughout their recovery process. Patients&#xD;
      will be scheduled for follow-up appointments with the operating physician at 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following surgery. Patients will be asked to give a&#xD;
      pain score (scale 1-10) and complete an SF-12 functional outcomes survey at each follow-up&#xD;
      appointment. In line with normal protocol following fracture repair, radiographs will also be&#xD;
      taken at each follow-up appointment to monitor the progression of fracture healing.&#xD;
