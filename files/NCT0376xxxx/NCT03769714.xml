  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the of the study is a reduction in minimally invasive supracervical hysterectomy&#xD;
      postsurgical pain, which may result in less need for supplemental opioid pain medications,&#xD;
      fewer opioid related adverse events, and a better recovery experience for patients, which may&#xD;
      offer an economic benefit to health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracervical preoperative dose of Exparel during minimally invasive (robotic--assisted or&#xD;
      traditional laparoscopy) supracervical hysterectomy reduces cumulative pain scores for up to&#xD;
      24 hours and reduces overall requests for break through (additional) analgesia with opioid&#xD;
      consumption compared with placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exparel is a local analgesic that utilizes bupivacaine in combination with the proven product&#xD;
      delivery platform, DepoFoamÂ®. Exparel (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is a&#xD;
      liposome injection of bupivacaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, indicated (bupivacaine&#xD;
      liposome injectable suspension) for administration into the surgical site to produce&#xD;
      postsurgical analgesia. Liposomal drug- containing formulations can provide for controlled&#xD;
      drug release over an extended period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall length of hospital stay (LOS) for patients undergoing laparoscopic (robot-&#xD;
      assisted or traditional laparoscopy) supracervical hysterectomy varies widely in published&#xD;
      reports; typical durations range between 0 days and 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is because in recent years there has been a trend toward use of enhanced or &quot;fast-&#xD;
      track&quot; discharge protocols to reduce LOS in patients undergoing this procedure, predicated&#xD;
      primarily on reducing the time to achieve tolerance of oral liquid/food intake and improved&#xD;
      GI function. Most patients experience moderate to extreme pain after surgery and effective&#xD;
      postsurgical pain management is a key factor affecting patient recovery. Multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      techniques involving analgesics, such as local anesthetics, oral or parenteral nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications, and oral or parenteral opioids, are recommended as the safest&#xD;
      and effective approach to postsurgical pain control. Local anesthetics administered during&#xD;
      surgery are frequently used as part of multimodal analgesic regimens; however, the duration&#xD;
      of analgesia with these agents is short (12 hours). Bupivacaine has a long history of use in&#xD;
      the surgical setting, and the efficacy of bupivacaine HCl administered perioperatively via&#xD;
      wound infiltration or acute postsurgical pain is well established. A novel formulation of&#xD;
      bupivacaine, ie, liposome bupivacaine (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, NJ), has&#xD;
      been developed to address the need for longer-acting local anesthetics that can be&#xD;
      administered as a single dose. The question becomes whether this drug is effective for&#xD;
      postsurgical analgesia if given preoperatively via the intracervical stroma during minimally&#xD;
      invasive gynecologic surgical procedures, specifically laparoscopic (robot--assisted or&#xD;
      traditional laparoscopy) supracervical hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracervical/intracervical injections are used for cervical/uterine manipulation in various&#xD;
      obstetrical and gynecological procedures. Lukas et al used the intracervical/paracervical&#xD;
      block prior to hysteroscopic polypectomy, with good pain scores following the procedure and&#xD;
      no serious adverse effects were noted. In addition, Chauan et al also noted good pain control&#xD;
      with intracervical injection with lidocaine in patients undergoing a hysterosalpingography,&#xD;
      which involves distended the uterus and injecting dye. Mankowshi et al also studied both&#xD;
      intracervical and paracervical injections of lidocaine for first trimester suction curettage&#xD;
      and found no difference between the two forms ensuring that both effective means of&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the U.S., surgical site infections (SSI) affect 1 in 24 patients that undergo inpatient&#xD;
      surgery. Most surgical site infection take place after day 5 , which will be out of the scope&#xD;
      of timeframe for conduct of the survey. However a SSI can make the differentiation of pain&#xD;
      from the surgery itself and pain from a complication of surgery difficulty to differentiate.&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to specify where the pain is and ask if they have any associated&#xD;
      vaginal discharge, foul smelling odor, and difficulty urinating and or passing a bowel&#xD;
      movement. These responses will be tracked, and if the participant shows signs of a SSI, the&#xD;
      patients may warrant a closer followup in the office and or asked to go directly to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED). The patients will still be included in the study but special note&#xD;
      will be made of how many participant had SSI in the discussion portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study. After IRB approval, 52 subjects will&#xD;
      be consented to participate in the study. The study includes subjects undergoing minimally&#xD;
      invasive (robot--assisted or traditional laparoscopy) supracervical hysterectomy under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. This study will include women (35 - 75 years) who have American Congress&#xD;
      of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Association of Gynecologic&#xD;
      Laparoscopists (AAGL) physical classification status for a minimally invasive (robotic-&#xD;
      assisted or traditional laparoscopy)supracervical hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done prior to recruitment of patient via computer software. There will&#xD;
      be two groups with numbers 1-52, no numbers will be repeated. Each patient that is recruited&#xD;
      will be assigned a number from 1-52 (in sequential order); the master list will be kept with&#xD;
      the pharmacy director. Group A (control, n=26) to receive 20ml of saline while Group B&#xD;
      (study, n=26) to receive 20ml of liposomal bupivacaine (EXPAREL) into the stroma of the&#xD;
      cervix at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions (innervation insertion points of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMC Pharmacy will prepare an individualized numbered bubble wrapped amber package&#xD;
      accordingly to the randomization. It will be prepared prior to the recruitment and kept in&#xD;
      the fridge in 4th floor PACU pharmacy. After the patient is consented and given a subject&#xD;
      number, the package with the corresponding number will be picked up from the pharmacy and&#xD;
      given to either the resident/attending (not involved in the study) who will share the&#xD;
      contents of the package with the anesthesia team. While prepping, the same individual will&#xD;
      inject the contents. The syringe will covered as to disguise the contents of the syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will show a short video on how to prepare the Exparel as well the injection&#xD;
      component in order to diminish the differences between the individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of pain will be assessed preoperatively in the holding area, PACU arrival, 12,&#xD;
      24, and 48 hours postoperatively using a numeric rating scale (NRS) at rest for pain with 0 =&#xD;
      no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. Pain inquiries will assess low pelvic/suprapubic area&#xD;
      and lower abdominal pain, type of pain (dull, achy, sharp, stabbing, etc.) and radiation of&#xD;
      pain to a surrounding area. Other endpoints will include number of patients who required&#xD;
      break through (additional) opioid analgesic medications, median time to first break through&#xD;
      opioid use, total opioid analgesic requirement. The time, day and number of requests for&#xD;
      break through (additional) analgesia will be noted by gynecologic surgery team (Resident or&#xD;
      Fellow) participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is home the patient will have a Pain Medication Diary that the investigators&#xD;
      will provide for the patient prior to discharge. The patient will bring at the post-operative&#xD;
      visit and or mail it in.&#xD;
