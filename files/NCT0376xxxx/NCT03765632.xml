    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-cohort, longitudinal, single-center, clinical&#xD;
      study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101&#xD;
      (autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced ex vivo with EFS (Elongation&#xD;
      Factor 1α Short form) Lentiviral Vector (LV) encoding for the human ADA gene) administered to&#xD;
      ADA-SCID subjects between the ages of &gt;/=30 days and &lt;18 years of age, who are not eligible&#xD;
      for an Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched sibling/family donor and meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. The OTL-101 product is infused after a minimal interval of at&#xD;
      least 24 hours following the completion of reduced intensity conditioning. For subjects who&#xD;
      successfully receive the OTL-101 product, pegademase bovine (PEG-ADA) Enzyme Replacement&#xD;
      Therapy (ERT) is discontinued at Day+30 (-3/+15) after the transplant. After their discharge&#xD;
      from hospital, the subjects will be seen at regular intervals to review their history,&#xD;
      perform examinations and draw blood samples to assess immunity and safety.&#xD;
