  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypotension during general anesthesia remains a factor of poor outcomes, increases&#xD;
      the risk of myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury and 1-year mortality. Furthermore,&#xD;
      arterial hypotension may also decrease cerebral perfusion contributing to worsen neurological&#xD;
      outcome. It seems necessary to monitor cerebral perfusion during anesthesia and to define&#xD;
      individual dynamic targets of blood pressure. The goal of this study is to evaluate cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion change in adult patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during a&#xD;
      standardized propofol-remifentanil anesthesia induction. Cerebral perfusion will be evaluated&#xD;
      and compared using the simultaneously measure of TCD, NIRS and BIS. Those measures will be&#xD;
      also repeated during and after treatment of arterial hypotension episodes in both groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Main objective : the blood pressure target to maintain cerebral perfusion is related to&#xD;
      patient´s characteristics or comorbidities and it remains uncertain which threshold of blood&#xD;
      pressure to use during general anesthesia. Thus, it seems necessary to monitor cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion during anesthesia and to define individual dynamic targets of blood pressure. The&#xD;
      measure of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity by transcranial doppler (TCD) is a&#xD;
      clinical method to assess cerebral perfusion during general anesthesia and several studies&#xD;
      have reported the hemodynamic impact on cerebral blood flow during induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral perfusion can also be approached by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) which measures&#xD;
      continuously cerebral oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bispectral index (BIS) which allows a simplified form of continuous electroencephalogram&#xD;
      monitoring to assess depth of anesthesia could also report cerebral hypoperfusion quantified&#xD;
      by the count of burst suppression ratio (SR). Potentially, those tools need to be combined to&#xD;
      assess cerebral perfusion properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate cerebral perfusion change in adult participants with or&#xD;
      without cardiovascular risk factors during a standardized propofol-remifentanil anesthesia&#xD;
      induction. Cerebral perfusion was evaluated and compared using the simultaneously measure of&#xD;
      TCD, NIRS and BIS. Those measures will be also repeated during and after treatment of&#xD;
      arterial hypotension episodes in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design : this is a single-center, interventional, category II prospective study&#xD;
      (minimal risks and constraints) Population concerned :the study involves major patients who&#xD;
      beneficiate from intraoperative hemodynamic optimization with norepinephrine (as&#xD;
      noradrenaline tartrate) for maintaining blood pressure under general anaesthesia in&#xD;
      interventional neuroradiology in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Proceedings : all monitoring (TCD, BIS, NIRS) are collected from the healthy side,&#xD;
      contralateral to the interventional side. BIS, NIRS and continuous non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure are all connected to the main monitor. For all participants, data from TCD, NIRS,&#xD;
      BIS and hemodynamic data are collected at three distinct periods the day of the procedure :&#xD;
      (1) baseline or during pre-oxygenation at FiO2 21% (inspiratory fraction oxygen) in awake&#xD;
      patients, (2) before Orotracheal Intubation and (3) just after mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients presenting a hypotensive episode at any time of the procedure, all parameters are&#xD;
      collected before and at the peak effect of a 10µg bolus of norepinephrine Individual&#xD;
      benefit:there is no benefit for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective benefit: It seems necessary to monitor cerebral perfusion during anesthesia and to&#xD;
      define individual dynamic targets of blood pressure. During general anesthesia, cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion can be impaired and requires specific monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and minimal constraints added by the research : no added risk. This clinical research&#xD;
      work is &quot;non-interventional&quot; on adult patients who benefit from a neuroradiological&#xD;
      intervention. All measures are obtained non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were assigned to one of two groups according to cardiovascular risk factors. Major&#xD;
      risk factor was age &gt; 50 years old and minor risk factors were history of congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, history of cardiovascular event, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into the high-risk group (Hi-risk) if they have at least one&#xD;
      major criterion or two minor criteria or into the low risk group (Lo-risk) if they present&#xD;
      with no or one minor criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their interventional neuroradiology procedure, all patients' routine monitoring will&#xD;
      consist of electrocardiogram, pulsated oxygen saturation, end-tidal C02 (carbon dioxide),&#xD;
      respiratory rate, tidal volume and monitoring of neuromuscular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) &lt; 65 mmHg or &lt; 80% baseline) were treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 µg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, data from TCD, NIRS, BIS and hemodynamic data will be collected at three&#xD;
      distinct periods: (1) Baseline or during pre-oxygenation at FiO2 21% (Inspiratory Fraction&#xD;
      Oxygen) in awake patients, (2) Before Orotracheal Intubation and (3) just after mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients presenting a hypotensive episode at any time of the procedure, all parameters&#xD;
      were collected before and at the peak effect of a 10µg bolus of norepinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of selected subjects : Selection of patients up to 100 analysable patients Number of&#xD;
      Centre : 1 Research Agenda inclusion period: 24 months Duration of participation (treatment +&#xD;
      follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology procedure so maximum 1 day Total&#xD;
      duration: 24 months Number of planned inclusions by centre and month : 5 Number of subjects&#xD;
      required : 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes of parameters across time, during induction and/or during vasopressors boluses will&#xD;
      be tested by using a paired Student-t test after testing the normality of distribution.&#xD;
      Correlation between change of MAP and Vm during induction will be done using Spearman test.&#xD;
      Complete analysis will also be performed and compared between Low-risk and High-risk&#xD;
      patients. The analysis of vasopressor boluses will also be performed according to the time of&#xD;
      the administration: boluses which are given immediately after induction of anesthesia (early)&#xD;
      and boluses given after a 30 minutes period of constant intra-venous calculated&#xD;
      concentrations of anesthesia (late). All statistical analyses were performed using R&#xD;
      statistical software (The 'R' Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results&#xD;
      are expressed as means (± SD). A two-sided p value of 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions: incidence of Hi-risk&#xD;
      patients of 50%, as previously reported, incidence of burst suppression during induction in&#xD;
      low risk patients of 20% difference of incidence of burst suppression between low- and&#xD;
      high-risk patients at 30%, power at 80% and type I error at 5%. Accordingly, the calculated&#xD;
      sample size is 100 patients for the entire population.&#xD;
