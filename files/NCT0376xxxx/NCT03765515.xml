      Protocol synopsis Title of Study: A Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Clinical Study to&#xD;
      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Q-Fix All-Suture Anchor in Arthroscopic Repair of&#xD;
      Shoulder Soft Tissue in Chinese Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, multicenter, comparative, randomized, concurrent control Study&#xD;
      Type: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Study Product: Q-Fix All-Suture Anchor Comparison&#xD;
      Group Twinfix Ti Suture Anchor Study Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Q-Fix All-suture Anchor in patients requiring the repair of soft&#xD;
      tissue of shoulder who receive the arthroscopic repair of soft tissue using Q-Fix All-suture&#xD;
      Anchor, when compared with the patients receiving the treatment with Twinfix Ti Suture&#xD;
      Anchor. The result of this trial will be used for the Q-Fix All-suture Anchor registration in&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to confirm that the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of subjects receiving the treatment with Q-Fix All-suture Anchor is non-inferior to&#xD;
      that of the subjects receiving the treatment with Twinfix Ti Suture Anchor during the same&#xD;
      period, at 6 months after the repair of soft tissue of shoulder, taking the mean Constant&#xD;
      score as efficacy endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s): The secondary objective of this study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Q-Fix All-suture Anchor at 12 months after repair of soft tissue of shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Rationale: The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is Constant score at 6&#xD;
      months after operation. The non-inferiority testing is performed for efficiency of primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint; the test hypothesis is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invalid hypothesis: H0: μ1-μ2 ≤ -δ Alternative hypothesis: H1: μ1-μ2 &gt; -δ Where, μ1 and μ2&#xD;
      are the mean Constant scores in the test and control group, respectively. δ is the&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin, which is set to 10. The hypothesis will be tested by two-sided t-test&#xD;
      at the alpha level of α=0.025 (one-tailed test). the A non-inferior test will be conducted on&#xD;
      the Constant scores in the test and control groups. The 95% confidence interval for the&#xD;
      difference between two groups will be calculated. If the lower limit of 95%CI for the&#xD;
      efficiency difference between two groups is greater than -9, it is considered that the test&#xD;
      group is non-inferior to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 128 (64 in each group) Number of Study Sites: Approximate 5 clinical sites&#xD;
      Targeted Global Regions: China&#xD;

Next to this there is a physician rated part (shoulder strength 25 points and range of motion 40 points) which totals 65 points.</description>

    <description>The Smith &amp; Nephew's marketed Twinfix Suture Anchor is selected as the control product. This product is composed of anchor, suture, suture needle and inserter. The anchor is made of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy conforming to ISO5832-3. The Durabraid suture is made of polyester (Polyethylene terephthalate) conforming to YY 0167. Ultrabraid suture is made of two materials of UHMWPE and polypropylene monofilaments conforming to GB/T 19701.1. The suture needle is made of Type 420B stainless steel conforming to YY/T 0726. The stem portion of inserter that comes into contact with the body is made of Type 630B stainless steel conforming to YY/T 0726.</description>
