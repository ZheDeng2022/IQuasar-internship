      Major Problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diabetes have an increased risk of heart disease, heart failure, and death from a&#xD;
      cardiovascular cause. Diabetes prevents efficient metabolism of fuel, causes inflammation and&#xD;
      vascular disease that blocks normal blood flow, and inhibits the function of the heart after&#xD;
      injury. These changes make diabetics more susceptible to heart attacks and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resveratrol is found in grapes and red wine and has been shown to have beneficial effects in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. In previous studies the investigators have shown that resveratrol can&#xD;
      improve heart metabolism and function in pigs with diabetes and chronic lack of blood flow to&#xD;
      the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe resveratrol will help reverse the negative effects of diabetes on&#xD;
      the heart. The questions are: 1.How does the molecular machinery in the hearts of patients&#xD;
      with diabetes differ from patients without diabetes? 2.Will resveratrol have an effect on&#xD;
      heart metabolism, intracellular signaling, inflammation and blood vessel function? 3.Will&#xD;
      resveratrol improve the number and function of cardiac stem cells, cells involved in heart&#xD;
      repair? The investigators have been safely collecting tissue from the hearts of patients&#xD;
      undergoing heart surgery. Preliminary studies show the investigators can isolate and study&#xD;
      cells. The investigators have collected and assessed the function of endothelial cells, a&#xD;
      measure of vascular health and can measure the level of endothelial injury and have studied&#xD;
      the make-up of caveolae, structures on the cell membrane that are important for cell&#xD;
      signaling and are negatively impacted by diabetes. This study is a unique collaboration among&#xD;
      cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and basic scientists.&#xD;

      Patients with diabetes and metabolic diseases such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia&#xD;
      have a myocardial environment that results in endothelial dysfunction, altered metabolism and&#xD;
      little potential for regeneration by intrinsic or extrinsically delivered therapies. Based&#xD;
      upon work in animal and cell culture models of human disease, caveolae, lipid rafts found on&#xD;
      the cell membrane of endothelial cells and myocytes, are important in cell signaling and&#xD;
      metabolism. A growing body of literature suggests that disruption of membrane lipid&#xD;
      microdomains in diabetes can lead to altered signaling that contributes to cardiovascular&#xD;
      pathology. One possible method to improve the &quot;endothelial health&quot; of the heart could involve&#xD;
      normalizing metabolic processes and decreasing signals that lead to inflammation and pathways&#xD;
      that lead to fibrosis in the myocardium. This presents an opportunity to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      our diabetic patients and improve the success of future therapies aimed at improving&#xD;
      endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in abundance in red wine, activates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an&#xD;
      NAD+-dependent deacetylase, which influences a diverse array of metabolic pathways. Studies&#xD;
      in cultured cells, small animal models, and humans demonstrate that SIRT1 is involved in&#xD;
      endothelial function, mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin production, inflammation, and glucose&#xD;
      and lipid homeostasis. These processes are often dysfunctional in patients with diabetes and&#xD;
      other metabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that molecular pathology of diabetes on cardiac&#xD;
      endothelium can be corrected with orally supplemented resveratrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in by first assessing endothelial function,&#xD;
      lipidomic signatures, and cell signaling in patients with and without diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The&#xD;
      second Aim of this proposal is a pilot placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial that&#xD;
      will assess the effects of supplemental resveratrol in diabetic patients undergoing CABG with&#xD;
      CPB. The goal will be to better understand the influence of resveratrol on key molecular&#xD;
      signals that determine endothelial function, calveolar makeup and function, as well as&#xD;
      cytoprotective signaling and responses in the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Define the molecular pathology of diabetes on cardiac cells and tissues in&#xD;
      non-diabetic and diabetic patients undergoing surgical revascularization. We will assess the&#xD;
      effects of DM on endothelial function and damage, lipidomics, caveolar expression, disrupted&#xD;
      receptor expression and neuregulin signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effect of resveratrol on the microvascular function of diabetic patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical revascularization. Through a pilot randomized placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial, the investigators will evaluate the effect of resveratrol on endothelial damage at the&#xD;
      time of cardiopulmonary bypass, endothelial function, and cell signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will further our understanding of how resveratrol impacts patients in a controlled&#xD;
      setting, and will allow for a thorough and complete investigation of how the supplement&#xD;
      affects this patient population clinically and on a molecular level. The data will inform the&#xD;
      development of larger studies examining the benefits of resveratrol in diabetes and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Finally, the investigators successful completion of this trial will inform the&#xD;
      study of other therapeutics where direct myocardial effects are being considered.&#xD;
