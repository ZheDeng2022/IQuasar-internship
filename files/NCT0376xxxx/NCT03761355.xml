  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical simulation is a technique that creates a situation or environment to allow persons to&#xD;
      experience a representation of a real event for the purpose of practice, learning,&#xD;
      evaluation, testing or to gain understanding of systems or human actions Non-technical skills&#xD;
      in pediatric simulation are the skills of communication, leadership, teamwork, situational&#xD;
      awareness, decision-making, resource management, safe practice, adverse event minimization,&#xD;
      and professionalism, also known as teamwork skills. Mindfulness is the self-regulation of&#xD;
      attention with an attitude of curiosity, openness and acceptance. Executive functions include&#xD;
      a collection of interrelated functions that are responsible for purposeful, goal-directed,&#xD;
      problem-solving behavior. In this project, the investigators aim to check whether features of&#xD;
      mindfulness and executive functions can be used to predict teamwork skills of medical&#xD;
      students during repeated high-fidelity simulations in emergency pediatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will include simulation center in Bialystok, Poland. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct this project over a time of 2 years. Team project is made up of 5 persons, including&#xD;
      psychologist, simulation instructors and pediatricians. Participants will be students of&#xD;
      medical faculty in medical university. The investigators expect to include at least 340&#xD;
      students in the study which will result in 180 assessed as main or second leaders in repeated&#xD;
      simulations. Team project will assess the students during high-fidelity pediatric emergency&#xD;
      simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of assessment of medical students during pediatric emergency simulations: features of&#xD;
      mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale), assessment of executive functions (The&#xD;
      Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions - Adult), non-technical skills (Ottawa&#xD;
      Crisis Resource Management scale &amp; checklist), technical skills (checklists) and stress. The&#xD;
      researchers first will examine association between mindfulness or executive functions and&#xD;
      demographic variables. And finally team project will assess the possibility of prediction of&#xD;
      non-technical performance level during medical simulations with the use of mindfulness and&#xD;
      executive functions assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general the investigators anticipate that the results of the study will lead to the better&#xD;
      understanding of mechanisms that influence non-technical skills in medical students during&#xD;
      pediatric emergency cases.&#xD;

      Research Project Objectives / Research Hypothesis High-fidelity simulation is an effective&#xD;
      tool in creating psychological reality of pediatric emergency care. Non-technical skills play&#xD;
      a pivotal role in management of life-threatening cases in children. Mindfulness is the&#xD;
      self-regulation of attention with an attitude of curiosity, openness and acceptance. It is&#xD;
      possible that mindfulness could enhance medical students' capacity for focused attention and&#xD;
      concentration by increasing present moment awareness. On the other hand executive functions&#xD;
      include a collection of interrelated functions that are responsible for purposeful,&#xD;
      goal-directed, problem-solving behavior. It is likely that mindfulness and executive&#xD;
      functions and their relationship are important players in emergency cases. Repeated&#xD;
      simulations could be a crucial tool for stress management and improving skills in&#xD;
      high-fidelity scenarios. In this project, the investigators aim to define whether features of&#xD;
      mindfulness and executive functions can be used to predict non-technical skills of medical&#xD;
      students during repeated high-fidelity simulations in emergency pediatric care. The&#xD;
      researchers hypothesize that: 1) being mindful improves the performance during simulation 2)&#xD;
      better executive functions result in better non-technical skills of medical student 3)&#xD;
      repeated simulations will reduce stress and influence performance during scenarios 4) there&#xD;
      are some potential correlations between executive functions and mindfulness 5) it is possible&#xD;
      to predict non-technical performance with the assessment of mindfulness and executive&#xD;
      functions of students during pediatric emergency cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project methodology This is a multi-center, investigator-initiated prospective&#xD;
      study. The project will include simulation center in Poland (Medical University in&#xD;
      Bia≈Çystok). The researchers will conduct this project over a time of 2 years. Team project is&#xD;
      made up of 5 persons, including psychologist, simulation instructors and pediatricians.&#xD;
      Participants will be students of medical faculty in medical university. Methods: First, to&#xD;
      increase the awareness of scientific community of the area of interest, the scientists will&#xD;
      prepare and publish the review of the current literature in the field of mindfulness,&#xD;
      executive functions and emergency medicine. Then, the researchers will adapt six&#xD;
      high-fidelity scenarios in the field of pediatric emergency for the requirements of the&#xD;
      project. The team project expect to include at least 340 students in the study which will&#xD;
      result in 180 assessed as main or second leaders in repeated simulations. For the&#xD;
      accomplishment of the aims of this study researchers will need: high-fidelity simulation&#xD;
      rooms = emergency rooms with full medical equipment, high-fidelity simulators, audio-video&#xD;
      systems for recording and playing scenarios, ECG Holters, debriefing rooms, computers and&#xD;
      software. All above mentioned equipment is available in simulation centers and the&#xD;
      investigators have the professional staff experienced in high-fidelity simulation and&#xD;
      assessment of non-technical skills in medical students. Demographic features will be assessed&#xD;
      in all participants: age, sex, year of medical faculty, medical school. The history of&#xD;
      previous high-fidelity simulations in participating students will be collected. Methods of&#xD;
      assessment of medical students during pediatric emergency simulations: features of&#xD;
      mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale), assessment of executive functions (The&#xD;
      Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions - Adult), non-technical skills (Ottawa&#xD;
      Crisis Resource Management scale &amp; checklist), technical skills (checklists) and stress&#xD;
      (heart rate, heart rate variability with Holter ECG, blood pressure, Stress-O-Meter and the&#xD;
      State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory). Data analysis strategy: The study team will first examine&#xD;
      association between mindfulness or executive functions and demographic variables (gender,&#xD;
      age, university). Then the researchers are going to construct the regression model to explain&#xD;
      the variability of features included in Ottawa scale. And finally the study team will assess&#xD;
      the possibility of prediction of non-technical performance level during medical simulations&#xD;
      with the use of mindfulness and executive functions assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact of the research project on the development of science To date more than 150&#xD;
      students were enrolled for the preliminary research. The preliminary results showed that: in&#xD;
      the first simulation the students' non-technical performance is weak, one of the main&#xD;
      problems in non-technical skills is the fixation error and it is more frequent in simulations&#xD;
      with two cases at one time, in the repeated simulations non-technical skills are improving,&#xD;
      there is a growing interest in mindfulness training among medical students, technical skills&#xD;
      depend of theoretical introduction and students' preparation for the classes, concerning&#xD;
      stress the statistically significant increase in heart rate but not blood pressure in&#xD;
      students after each simulation was observed . These data clearly show that the proposed study&#xD;
      concept is a promising line of basic investigation with solid potential for defining a&#xD;
      predictive link between mindfulness, executive function and non-technical skills of medical&#xD;
      students during pediatric emergency simulations. In general the investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      the results of the present study will lead to the better understanding of mechanisms that&#xD;
      influence non-technical skills in medical students during pediatric emergency cases. In the&#xD;
      future this research will be used for an overall improvement in team performance at emergency&#xD;
      events, which will ultimately translate into a subsequent reduction in the rate of errors and&#xD;
      adverse events in medicine. The team leaders also hope that an increased awareness of&#xD;
      non-technical skills in the emergency setting among medical students will have an indirect&#xD;
      beneficial effect on those skills in the day-to-day setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific results of the project will include: review manuscript and at least two&#xD;
      original manuscripts, all published in Journals with Impact Factor ‚â• 3, presentations on two&#xD;
      international meetings in Europe.&#xD;

    <description>We have chosen Ottawa Ottawa Crisis Resource Management Global Rating Scale to evaluate performance during our simulations. The following criteria will be evaluated: leadership skills (stays calm and in control during crisis, prompt and firm decision-making, maintains global perspective - &quot;big picture&quot;), situational awareness (avoids fixation error, reassesses and re-evaluates situation constantly, anticipates likely events), communication skills (communicates clearly and concisely, uses directed verbal /non-verbal communication, listens to team input), problem solving (organized and efficient problem solving approach, quick in implementation, considers alternatives during crisis), resource utilization (calls for help appropriately, utilizes resources at hand appropriately, prioritizes tasks appropriately). Each category is measured on a seven-point anchored ordinal scale with descriptive anchors. The higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
