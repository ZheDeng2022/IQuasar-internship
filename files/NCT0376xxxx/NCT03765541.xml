  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent preclinical and retrospective clinical data have suggested that dexamethasone might&#xD;
      sensitize leukemic cells to chemotherapy-induced cell death and thus limit the risk of&#xD;
      leukemic regrowth and relapse. Moreover, it has been experimentally shown that leukemic cells&#xD;
      in acute myeloid leukemia patients who relapse become sensitive to glucocorticoids treatment&#xD;
      highlighting a novel potential role for dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (R/R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to determine whether adding dexamethasone to standard salvage therapy&#xD;
      in the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia in adult patients (intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy amsacrine-cytarabine or azacitidine according to investigator's willingness)&#xD;
      results in a significant improvement of the overall survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia is poor ;&#xD;
      median survival is less than 1 year. High-dose cytarabine monotherapy or cytarabine-based&#xD;
      combination regimens are often used as salvage therapy with limited efficacy. A recent&#xD;
      retrospective study has shown that the addition of dexamethasone to intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
      was significantly associated with better disease-free and overall survival in hyperleukocytic&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia patients. The gene signatures of some molecular subgroups of acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia were highly enriched in genes responsive to dexamethasone, including acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia with NPM1 mutations which were particularly sensitive to the antileukemic&#xD;
      activity of dexamethasone both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, three recent preclinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that cytarabine-resistant or RUNX1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia cells&#xD;
      acquired sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Therefore, dexamethasone might sensitize leukemic&#xD;
      stem cells to chemotherapy-induced cell death and thus limit the risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period. Adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia are randomly assigned&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either standard salvage therapy in combination with dexamethasone&#xD;
      or standard salvage therapy alone. Standard salvage therapy is intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
      (amsacrine-cytarabine) or azacitidine according to the investigator's willingness. For those&#xD;
      patients with intensive chemotherapy amsacrine-cytarabine, the study treatment period&#xD;
      includes 1 induction cycle and up to 3 consolidation cycles. For those patients with&#xD;
      azacitidine, the study treatment period includes 3 cycles prior to the evaluation of the&#xD;
      complete remission and thereafter lasts until progression. Of note, any patients in the study&#xD;
      can undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation providing his/her disease is&#xD;
      controlled. After discontinuing the study treatment all patients must further carry out&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up visits every 3 months during the first and second year, and every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or the end of the&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs first. The end of the study is planned 5 years after the&#xD;
      randomization of the first patient. The primary endpoint is the overall survival.&#xD;
