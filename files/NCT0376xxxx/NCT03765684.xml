    <textblock>
      In Helsinki Birth Cohort 2018-2022 a large, longitudinal and well-phenotyped birth cohort of&#xD;
      infants and their parents will be established. Mothers, fathers/spouses and their children in&#xD;
      Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District are recruited in the study and newborn composition of&#xD;
      the children born in Helsinki Women's Hospital will be measured. Data on maternal and&#xD;
      paternal diet quality, physical activity and depression during and after pregnancy will be&#xD;
      collected and data from the hospital and national registers will be collected. Health of&#xD;
      offspring and parents will be followed during their later life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helsinki Birth Cohort 2018-2022 (HeBiCo) study is designed to find evidence between various&#xD;
      intrauterine exposures and offspring adiposity and later health. It will be examined how&#xD;
      different maternal (e.g. chronic diseases, ethnicity, BMI), and obstetric factors (e.g.&#xD;
      gestational weight gain, diagnoses during pregnancy) as well as parental lifestyle and&#xD;
      psychological aspects (e.g. diet quality, physical activity, depression and anxiety) are&#xD;
      associated with newborn body composition and later health (e.g. obesity and neurocognitive&#xD;
      health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study the participants are recruited on postnatal ward after&#xD;
      delivery. The umbilical cord blood sample will be collected of all the neonates. After a&#xD;
      consent the participants fill in the digital background, food frequency, depression and&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaires. If the parents do not give their consent, the umbilical&#xD;
      cord blood sample will be destroyed. Body composition of offspring will be assessed within 72&#xD;
      hours after birth. Registry data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the HeBiCo study is based on the HUS WomensHub treatment path and/or&#xD;
      Apotti platform. The second phase of the HeBiCo constitutes of the mother-child pairs (and&#xD;
      fathers/spouses) whose pregnancy can be followed from the early pregnancy to the end of the&#xD;
      pregnancy through treatment path. Body composition of offspring born in Helsinki Women's&#xD;
      Hospital will be assessed within 72 hours after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The future studies will include 1) the intervention studies with digital service concept&#xD;
      through WomensHub platform, and 2) the follow-up studies of offspring and parents in later&#xD;
      life (to establish e.g. growth trajectories and later metabolic health of offspring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the HeBiCo study was registered 3/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will be registered now.&#xD;

        The first phase of the Helsinki Birth Cohort (HeBiCo) will be constituted of all the&#xD;
        neonates whose body composition at birth can be obtained at Helsinki Women's Hospital, and&#xD;
        whose mothers and fathers/spouses fill out the questionnaires after delivery (background,&#xD;
        food frequency (FFQ), and depression questionnaires (EPDS, CES-D)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the second phase of HeBiCo, participants will be recruited any time during pregnancy and&#xD;
        also at postnatal ward after delivery.&#xD;
