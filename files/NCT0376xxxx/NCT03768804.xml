    <textblock>
      In patients with weak pumping function of the heart, uncoordinated contraction of the&#xD;
      chambers can be corrected using a cardiac resynchronization therapy (&quot;CRT&quot;) pacemaker. These&#xD;
      devices make patients live longer by improving how the heart pumps and reducing symptoms such&#xD;
      as breathlessness. However, not all patients benefit from CRT and programming devices&#xD;
      optimally can greatly influence success. Predicting the correct timings of contraction&#xD;
      between the atria (top chambers of the heart) and the ventricles (bottom chambers), as well&#xD;
      as between the left and right ventricles, especially when heart rate increases during&#xD;
      exercises, is challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new approach to optimizing CRT programming has been proposed known as 'fusion-pacing'. This&#xD;
      allows the electrical wave from the heart's own conduction system to merge or fuse with the&#xD;
      impulse from the pacemaker in the left ventricle. The timing of the pacemaker's impulse is&#xD;
      continuously adjusted to measurements the device makes of the hearts natural conduction. What&#xD;
      is not clear is how effective 'fusion-pacing' is during exercise when the hearts natural&#xD;
      conduction changes rapidly and unpredictably. We plan to investigate this by monitoring the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (&quot;ECG&quot;) whilst accurately measuring exercise performance and ability during&#xD;
      a cardiopulmonary exercise test (&quot;CPET&quot;) on an exercise bike. We will also ask participants&#xD;
      to rate their perceived exercise intensity to see whether fusion pacing improves ECG&#xD;
      resynchronization, exercise performance, and patients' symptoms compared to standard&#xD;
      programming.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure represents a significant health problem, with the last national heart failure&#xD;
      audit demonstrating prevalence in the United Kingdom of 900,000 patients, accounting for 5%&#xD;
      of all acute hospital admissions. This is expected to increase with an ageing population.&#xD;
      Despite improvements in medical therapy, prognosis remains poor, with an in- hospital&#xD;
      mortality of 9.6%, and an estimated mortality of 30-40% at 1 year after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that cardiac resynchronization&#xD;
      therapy pacemaker devices (&quot;CRT&quot;) are an effective therapy for patients with poor pumping&#xD;
      function and altered electrical conduction of the heart (left bundle branch block, &quot;LBBB&quot;),&#xD;
      improving both morbidity and mortality. However, only 60-70% of patients notice a symptomatic&#xD;
      improvement with CRT and even in patients who do respond, response can often be improved&#xD;
      further by optimising how the device is programmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRT devices improve coordination of heart pumping by pacing both ventricles of the heart. A&#xD;
      key function of this is to coordinate the timing of contraction of the the atria and the&#xD;
      ventricles (atrio-ventricular, or &quot;AV&quot;, optimisation). This allows maximal filling of the&#xD;
      left ventricle with blood. More recently, it has become important not only in standard&#xD;
      bi-ventricular (&quot;BiV&quot;) pacing, but to allow left ventricular pacing to be timed with&#xD;
      intrinsic conduction to the right ventricle to provide CRT (so called 'fusion' pacing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple methods have been described to assess AV optimisation, including echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurements. However, echo based methods are labour intensive, and their value is uncertain.&#xD;
      Device algorithms utilising analysis of the intra-cardiac electrogram (&quot;IEGM&quot;) have become an&#xD;
      attractive alternative due to their rapid and automated nature, although evidence suggests&#xD;
      that they may not have clinical benefit over using fixed AV delays. In addition, intrinsic AV&#xD;
      conduction is known to alter with exercise, normally becoming shorter. Optimisation of AV&#xD;
      delays in CRT on exercise has been shown to improve cardiac output. Device algorithms can&#xD;
      therefore allow dynamic adjustment of AV delays as they change with exercise and heart rate&#xD;
      (rate-adaptive AV delay or &quot;RAAVD&quot;). Indeed, use of individually tailored RAAVD in CRT&#xD;
      patients has demonstrated an increase in exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with heart failure and LBBB often have normal intrinsic right ventricular activation&#xD;
      through the right bundle. Utilization of timed left ventricular (&quot;LV&quot;) pacing to merge (or&#xD;
      fuse) with this intrinsic conduction may confer benefits over standard BiV pacing, but&#xD;
      requires relatively normal intrinsic AV conduction as well as correct timing of LV pacing to&#xD;
      right ventricular (&quot;RV&quot;) activation. Algorithms now exist which allow dynamic reassessment of&#xD;
      intrinsic conduction and so adjustment of the optimal AV delay. They can therefore compensate&#xD;
      for changes in the intrinsic AV delay on exercising, and so maintain adequate fusion pacing&#xD;
      and CRT optimisation. One such software algorithm is SyncAV, developed by Abbott (Abbott&#xD;
      Vascular, 3200 Lakeside Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054-2807). SyncAVTM assesses&#xD;
      intrinsic AV conduction every 256 beats. It then sets a shorter programmed AV delay by&#xD;
      subtracting a set period (known as the &quot;delta&quot; - adjustable but nominally set to 50ms) from&#xD;
      the intrinsic time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that fusion pacing gives benefit in terms of both acute pumping&#xD;
      function of the heart and long term response to CRT. However, what remains unclear is whether&#xD;
      the effect of dynamic AV optimisation and fusion pacing is maintained on exercise. Firstly,&#xD;
      the re-analysis and adjustment intervals may be insufficient to allow effective fusion&#xD;
      throughout exercise. It is therefore possible that with rapidly changing heart rates this&#xD;
      coordinated timing is lost, leading to inefficient conduction of electricity through the&#xD;
      heart. This could result in large periods of time on exercising without effective CRT and so&#xD;
      poor exercise tolerance. Secondly, there is evidence that in patients with heart failure AV&#xD;
      intervals do not alter with change in heart rate in a similar way to healthy controls. One&#xD;
      study found that the degree of change is greater on exercise, whilst one demonstrated that in&#xD;
      a CRT population only a third of patients had shorter optimal AV delay intervals on exercise,&#xD;
      with a third being unchanged and a third longer. The use of a fixed &quot;delta&quot; in SyncAVTM may&#xD;
      therefore result in incorrect adjustment of AV intervals as intrinsic conduction changes,&#xD;
      with the effectiveness of SyncAV therefore depending on how the intrinsic interval changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a prospective single-centre randomized single-blind crossover study to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of SyncAV on exercise, by randomising participants to either&#xD;
      use of SyncAV or fixed AV delays, and then carrying out cardiopulmonary exercise testing&#xD;
      (&quot;CPET&quot;).&#xD;
