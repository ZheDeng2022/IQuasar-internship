  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American and Latina women, as well as women living in poverty, are an identified&#xD;
      health disparities population for HIV. Risks for HIV are compounded in this population when&#xD;
      additional risk factors are present, including other sexually transmitted infections,&#xD;
      intimate partner violence, substance use disorders, and homelessness or housing insecurity.&#xD;
      Knowledge of one's HIV serostatus is key to linkage to care, improving HIV outcomes, and&#xD;
      decreasing the spread of HIV. However, roughly a third of African American women and over&#xD;
      half of Latina women have never been tested (CDC, 2016a). Barriers to testing include&#xD;
      socioeconomical inequality, racial discrimination, low health literacy, and inadequate access&#xD;
      to quality healthcare, among others. Novel methods for increasing HIV testing in this&#xD;
      important health disparities group are greatly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test a reinforcement-based intervention to increase HIV testing and repeat&#xD;
      testing among African American, Latina, and women living in poverty who have risk factors for&#xD;
      HIV. We are partnering with multiple community-based organizations, several of which are&#xD;
      non-traditional providers of HIV services (e.g., domestic violence agency, homeless shelter),&#xD;
      to address systemic and structural issues that serve as barriers to testing. A primary aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of training community-based providers to deliver a&#xD;
      reinforcement-based intervention for promoting HIV testing. In addition, we will compare&#xD;
      standard referral services for HIV testing plus HIV risk reduction education to the same plus&#xD;
      reinforcement for HIV testing (and repeat testing) using a randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      334 participants. Women in both groups will be encouraged to seek HIV testing; be provided&#xD;
      with the resources to do so (list of testing sites, bus passes if needed); and will receive&#xD;
      basic education about HIV prevention using a widely available web-based resource&#xD;
      (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/). Women in the reinforcement group will also be provided with&#xD;
      $25 for undergoing an HIV test, with a $15 bonus if they have the test in the next 7 days&#xD;
      ($40 total). During the next 12 months, they can receive an additional $25 for undergoing up&#xD;
      to 2 more tests separated by 12 weeks, with $15 bonuses for each test completed within 7 days&#xD;
      (+/- 7 days) of the scheduled date at 6- and 12-months post-initial test. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the reinforcement intervention will result in greater proportions of women receiving an&#xD;
      HIV test (and repeat HIV tests) compared to standard services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, approximately 50 clinicians from our partner sites will be trained on&#xD;
      both the non-reinforcement and reinforcement approaches to increasing HIV testing. Primary&#xD;
      clinician outcomes are clinician knowledge and attitudes about HIV, testing, and&#xD;
      reinforcement interventions. These will be assessed pre- and post-training and at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals thereafter. A secondary outcome is clinician satisfaction with the training. Once&#xD;
      clinicians are trained to competence, 334 women at our partner agencies will be randomized.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and at 3-, 9-, and 15-month follow-ups. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is objective reports of HIV testing, verified by testing centers. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are HIV risk behaviors, test results, self-efficacy, client attitudes towards testing, and&#xD;
      HIV knowledge. In addition, this study will include a careful analysis of costs of the&#xD;
      reinforcement intervention to allow for estimates of its cost-effectiveness in increasing HIV&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether a reinforcement intervention delivered&#xD;
      by community providers is superior to standard referral procedures plus HIV education in&#xD;
      increasing rates of HIV testing among women at the highest risk of HIV infection. A wide&#xD;
      range of community partners that serve some of the highest risk groups of women were chosen&#xD;
      to ensure highly generalizable results. If efficacious, the intervention has the potential&#xD;
      for widespread adoption and implementation.&#xD;
