      Evaluation the safety and efficacy of Pembrolizumab (PEM) when administered in combination&#xD;
      with standard Azacitidine (AZA) in nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutated AML patients with molecular&#xD;
      relapse defined by the presence of measurable residual disease (MRD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azacitidine is an effective and well established therapy in patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). In fact, in previous measurable residual disease (MRD) triggered studies,&#xD;
      azacitidine allowed for a delay towards an overt hematological relapse in the majority of&#xD;
      patients. However, the majority of patients ultimately relapsed even though they received&#xD;
      multiple cycles of preemptive therapy. Hypomethylating agents (HMA) can enhance antitumor&#xD;
      immune responses by upregulating tumor antigene expression, class 1 major histocompatibility&#xD;
      complex, and co-stimulatory molecules, while concurrently dampening this antitumor effect by&#xD;
      upregulating expression of checkpoint receptors or ligands, including programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Upregulation of these immune checkpoint molecules&#xD;
      might be a mechanism of resistance to hypomethylating drugs. It has been shown that PD-L1&#xD;
      Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is up-regulated acute myeloid leukemia cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 34 (CD34+) cells and importantly, patients resistant to treatment with&#xD;
      hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine have an up-regulated expression compared to&#xD;
      responding patients. In addition, it is known that PD-1 promoter demethylation correlates&#xD;
      with a higher PD-1 expression and a worse response rate to hypomethylating agents as well as&#xD;
      a shorter overall survival. In this context it is of note that PD-1 promoter demethylation&#xD;
      can be caused by hypomethylating agents and hence the mode of action of the drug itself could&#xD;
      cause resistance to therapy in these patients. This might also explain why hypomethylating&#xD;
      agents are not curative and can not eradicate early leukemic progenitor cells. The&#xD;
      investigators, therefore, perform a phase II trial evaluating a combination therapy of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and azacitidine in nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutated AML patients with MRD and&#xD;
      impending hematological relapse after conventional chemotherapy. This trial aims at improving&#xD;
      response rates observed with single agent azacitidine within the studies NCT00422890 and&#xD;
      NCT01462578.&#xD;
