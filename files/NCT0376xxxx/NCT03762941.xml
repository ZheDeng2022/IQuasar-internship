      Elderly dependent on homecare, admitted acutely, are fragile. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the difference in the definition and rating of Quality of Life (QoL) among acute&#xD;
      admitted elderly i) with and ii) without homecare background.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a cross sectional study and will be conducted at three Emergency&#xD;
      Departments (ED) within the Region of Southern Denmark; Hospital of Southern Jutland,&#xD;
      Hospital of Southwest Jutland and Hospital Lillebaelt. The study method is based on a QoL&#xD;
      questionnaire preformed as a structured interview with elderly who are acutely admitted in an&#xD;
      ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly persons who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate during their&#xD;
      admission. Written information about this study will be handed from the nurse in the ED. If&#xD;
      the elderly accept she/he will get further oral information from the researcher. Written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained if the elderly wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Including patients from three different EDs will presumably provide a broad selection, with&#xD;
      elderly persons who live both in the city and in rural areas and thereby representing a&#xD;
      general sample of the Danish population.There may be a variation in cause of hospitalization&#xD;
      related to seasonal changes. To present a broad selection, the inclusion period will involve&#xD;
      summer, fall, and winter. Inclusion and all structured interviews will be performed during&#xD;
      admission by two persons: the responsible researcher and a research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome QoL will be accessed and evaluated by the Schedule for the Evaluation of&#xD;
      Individual Quality of Life - direct weighting (SEIQoL-DW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homecare: Receiving &quot;personal&quot; homecare for more than 2 hours per week. Furthermore numbers&#xD;
      of hours of homecare a week will be registered for each participant to see if there is any&#xD;
      difference in QoL connected to number of hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readmission: Readmissions 30 days after discharge from the primary index admission (yes/no).&#xD;
      Readmission is defined as; an unscheduled hospitalization for any reason and where the&#xD;
      patient has stayed at the hospital overnight within 30 days after discharge from the index&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes and variables will be collected through;&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a structured interview during hospitalization; The Ph.D student and the research assistant&#xD;
      are responsible for conducting the interviews. The patients will at the interview be asked&#xD;
      about; Aspect and index score of QoL, cognitive functioning (OMC score), marital status,&#xD;
      length of education and social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patients' records during hospitalization; The Ph.D student is responsibility for&#xD;
      collecting following information in the patients' record; Last admission, hours of homecare,&#xD;
      use of home nursing, primary reason for hospitalization and comorbidities. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked specific for permission to access journal data. Variables from the patients' record&#xD;
      will be extracted after the informed consent for participation is obtained. The information&#xD;
      from the journal will be handled from health professionals in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patients' record 30 days after discharge; Variables after 30 days will be counted from&#xD;
      the discharge form the index admission. The Ph.D student is responsibility for collecting the&#xD;
      information in the patient record about readmission and length of hospital stay under the&#xD;
      same terms as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome QoL are accessed and evaluated by SEIQoL-DW which are assessed in a&#xD;
      structured interview. First the interviewer elicits five areas of life considered most&#xD;
      important by the participant. Secondly, the participant rates the level each of these areas&#xD;
      from worst possible to best possible on a visual analogue scale (SEIQoL - VAS) and thirdly&#xD;
      the participant is asked for the relative importance of each area by a direct weighting (DW)&#xD;
      procedure. The DW procedure uses a pie chart consisting of five coloured segments. Each&#xD;
      colour represents an area chosen by the respondent. The areas can be adjusted in size to&#xD;
      reflect the relative importance of each area (greatest importance is the largest pie area).&#xD;
      The total value of all five segments equals 100. To calculate the participants QoL at the&#xD;
      moment, each area will be divided by 100. By multiplying the level of the area by the weight&#xD;
      for each area and adding up the values for each area, a SEIQoL-DW index score will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
