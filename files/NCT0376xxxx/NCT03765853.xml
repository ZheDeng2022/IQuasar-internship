  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower back pain (LBP) during pregnancy is a frequent syndrome: it concerns two thirds of&#xD;
      pregnant women. This complaint isn't routinely searched for and therefore underdiagnosed.&#xD;
      Furthermore, few solutions are given to these women in order to reduce their pain, and&#xD;
      indirectly to improve everyday life. What's more, LBP is the cause of many work&#xD;
      interruptions. Physical exercise during pregnancy is recommended by the National College of&#xD;
      Gynaecologists and Obstetricians for low risk pregnancies. Several techniques have proven to&#xD;
      be efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to assess the benefit of regular practice of standardised&#xD;
      Stretching Postural® postures in patients presenting &quot;de novo&quot; lower back pain during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stretching Postural® technique comprises of static postures involving muscular&#xD;
      contractions and stretches. This allows the strengthening of the postural muscles, including&#xD;
      the paravertebral muscles. After a short learning period, postures can be done autonomously&#xD;
      by the patients. The postures are adaptable to each and everyone's morphology and physical&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is an open, prospective, randomised monocentric superiority trial in parallel&#xD;
      branches involving major patients during low risk pregnancies. These women suffer from &quot;de&#xD;
      novo&quot; lower back pain during the second and third trimesters of their pregnancies. Each&#xD;
      patient will be randomly assigned to one of the following 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stretching Postural® group (group A): usual prevention methods (ergonomic education) and&#xD;
           Stretching Postural® postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Control&quot; group (group B): usual prevention methods only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting &quot;de novo&quot; LBP are included in the study after a routine consult then&#xD;
      randomly separated into two groups. During the initial consult, the physician assesses&#xD;
      inclusion and judgement criteria, collects informed consent from the patients and teaches&#xD;
      them the usual prevention methods as well as, concerning group A, Stretching Postural®&#xD;
      postures. Computerized support agendas are given in order to improve observance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated at day 0 (initial evaluation), after 4 weeks (intermediate) and after&#xD;
      8 weeks (final), according to the main judgment criterion, as well as on secondary pain&#xD;
      criteria by the Concise Pain Questionnaire, on their quality of life, the rate of work&#xD;
      interruptions and their satisfaction rate. Neonatal outcome is collected at birth.&#xD;
      Intermediate phone interviews will allow psychological support and improve observance.&#xD;
      Inclusion is scheduled to last 22 months; each subject will be followed during a period of 2&#xD;
      months. The total duration of the study is 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results are a decrease in back pain and an improvement of the quality of life in&#xD;
      group A. Decrease in pain scale, equivalent to overall pain during the last week between the&#xD;
      two groups will be our main judgment criterion. In order to detect a difference of 1.5 pain&#xD;
      scale points (on a scale from 1 to 10) with an alpha risk of 5%, 80% magnitude and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 2, 56 subjects are necessary; 28 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This study will allow for a better diagnosis of lower back pain during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and, consequently, for the implementation of routine means of care such as&#xD;
      collective or private lessons in Stretching Postural® and the supply of personalised&#xD;
      prevention documents.&#xD;
