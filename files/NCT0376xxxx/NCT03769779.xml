  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, the present study is designed to contribute to the body of literature by&#xD;
      investigating the effect of 12-weeks of lutein supplementation on multiple parameters of skin&#xD;
      health and appearance in healthy women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel twelve-week study of the&#xD;
      performance of an oral test product to evaluate the effects of twelve weeks of lutein&#xD;
      supplementation on skin health and appearance in healthy women. A seven-day washout period&#xD;
      will precede the evaluation period. The subjects in each cohort will use consume one softgel&#xD;
      of their assigned test product (treatment or placebo) daily in the morning with breakfast for&#xD;
      12 weeks. Changes in skin condition and appearance as well as blood chemistry will be&#xD;
      assessed using results from expert visual grading, instrumental assessments, skin and blood&#xD;
      assays and subjective questionnaire responses. Subjects will be recruited during the winter&#xD;
      season to account for seasonal variations of skin parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation points will occur pre-application (Baseline; Week 0) and after 42 and 84 days of&#xD;
      use (D42, D84; Week 6, Week 12). Data will be collected on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Skin Hydration 2. Skin texture/smoothness 2. Reduction of facial fine lines and wrinkles&#xD;
      3. Skin elasticity and firmness 4. Sagging skin, dry skin, skin tone, appearance from expert&#xD;
      clinical grading and subjective questionnaire responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Skin hydration 7. Skin collagen 8. Skin lipid content. 9. Skin Carotenoids&#xD;
