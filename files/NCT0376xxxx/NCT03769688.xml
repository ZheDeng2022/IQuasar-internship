  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The composition of a woman's vaginal microbiota has a significant impact on her reproductive&#xD;
      tract health and general quality of life. Approximately one-third of all women currently have&#xD;
      bacterial vaginosis (BV), a polymicrobial condition in which the vaginal microbiota is not&#xD;
      dominated by Lactobacillus species, leading to increased risk of various reproductive tract&#xD;
      maladies and negative impact on well-being. It has been suggested by epidemiological studies&#xD;
      that vaginal microbiota are readily transferable from one woman to another. Here,&#xD;
      investigators aim to explore the hypothesis that vaginal microbiota can be engrafted from one&#xD;
      woman to another in a controlled clinical setting by using cervicovaginal secretions (CVS), a&#xD;
      process referred to as vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT).&#xD;

    <description>Determination of recurrence of BV in participants by Amsel's criteria. Amsel's criteria includes the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH of the vagina being &gt; 4.5, the presence of clue cells in gram stained vaginal discharge smears and a positive whiff test. According to Amsel, if 3 of the 4 criteria are positive, the patient has bacterial vaginosis</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after VMT procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of recurrence of BV in participants by Nugent score. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus morphotypes; decrease in Lactobacillus scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-variable rods (Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes; scored as 0 to 2). A total score of 7 to 10 is consistent with bacterial vaginosis without culture.</description>
