  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Norway. In 2016, 3402 new cases were&#xD;
      diagnosed (3371 in women). Breast cancer is still the second most common cause of death from&#xD;
      cancer among women with 585 breast cancer deaths in Norway in 2015. The majority of the&#xD;
      patients (70-75 %) belong to the Luminal subtypes, which comprise the hormone receptor&#xD;
      (oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)) positive tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important systemic adjuvant therapy in luminal breast cancers is a long-lasting&#xD;
      administration of per-oral anti-oestrogen medication. A systemic hypo estrogenic state in the&#xD;
      body may be created by the selective oestrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen or by inhibitors&#xD;
      of the peripheral systemic aromatization of adrenal androgens into estrogens (aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors). Initially, tamoxifen was given adjuvant for 2 years, later prolonged to 5 years&#xD;
      and recently an extension to 10 years has been recommended for premenopausal women. Aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors were introduced in Norwegian treatment guidelines in 2002. Currently, they are&#xD;
      recommended in postmenopausal patients for 5 years, either as monotherapy or in concert with&#xD;
      tamoxifen (aromatase inhibitors for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In premenopausal breast cancer patients, tamoxifen still is the drug of choice. Two of the&#xD;
      major underlying reasons for late recurrences in luminal breast cancer subtypes are&#xD;
      development of endocrine resistance to tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors or failure of&#xD;
      taking the medication as prescribed. Higher mortality has been shown for breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with reduced tamoxifen adherence. The patients' ability to follow instructions and&#xD;
      recommendations are probably overestimated in controlled trials due to patient selection and&#xD;
      close follow-up in the study setting. Some patients experience distressing side effects like&#xD;
      hot flushes, fatigue, joint pain, mood swings and vaginal dryness. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, there are few studies in Norway regarding discontinuation of endocrine treatment&#xD;
      in breast cancer. In this study they will investigate the long-term discontinuation pattern&#xD;
      to oral adjuvant systemic endocrine therapy in a large cohort of breast cancer patients&#xD;
      treated in St. Olav's hospital in Trondheim, Norway, and the association between adherence to&#xD;
      endocrine treatment and long-term survival.&#xD;

      After identifying all patients who were recommended endocrine therapy, data will be linked to&#xD;
      the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Adherence will be estimated based on to which&#xD;
      extent the patients actually have effectuated their prescriptions at Norwegian pharmacies. In&#xD;
      the 5-year long treatment period, the patients receive a prescription refill of tamoxifen or&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor tablets for a 100 days interval. Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) will&#xD;
      be used as proxy for adherence. The estimations will be performed in the following way: For&#xD;
      each patient, we will receive the total number of pills and the total length of time from&#xD;
      first to latest prescription effectuated. MPR is the number of pills divided by the total&#xD;
      number of days in the time from first prescription to discontinuation. Discontinuation will&#xD;
      be estimated to date for latest effectuation of the prescription plus 100 days (due to the&#xD;
      number of pills prescribed). From these estimations, we will categorize the patients in&#xD;
      groups taking MPR and total period of time into consideration. Taking prescript medication&#xD;
      equal to or more than 80% is considered as adherent (MPR â‰¥ 80 %). Likewise, non-adherence is&#xD;
      defined as MPR &lt; 80 %.&#xD;
