  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate if the extended release formulation of WD-1603 generates&#xD;
      anticipated plasma concentration profile. The study is an open-label, sequential, 3-way&#xD;
      crossover study to evaluate if WD-1603 generates anticipated plasma levodopa exposure&#xD;
      compared to Sinemet IR tablets in healthy subjects. The study comprises of a medical&#xD;
      Screening visit, three 2-night (3-day) Treatment periods, 2 outpatient visits, and a&#xD;
      Follow-up visit. Study drug administration in each Treatment period is separated by a washout&#xD;
      interval of 5 days. The Follow-up visit will occur approximately 7 days (±1) following the&#xD;
      last study drug administration. The duration of subject participation, including screening,&#xD;
      is approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Positive urine drug at Screening and Day -1 admission. Given the long half-life of&#xD;
             tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites, subjects with a positive result for&#xD;
             THC at Screening may be included at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive breath alcohol test. Subjects with a positive result at Screening may be&#xD;
             rescheduled at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, would complicate&#xD;
