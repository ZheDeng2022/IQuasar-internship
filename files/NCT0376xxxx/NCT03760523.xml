  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety and recommended dosing of Minnelide in Acute Myeloid&#xD;
      Leukemia (AML)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Minnelide as single-agent in relapsed/refractory (R/R)&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The oral formulation of Minnelide will be used. Minnelide is a prodrug of triptolide (a&#xD;
      potent heat shock protein (HSP) 70 inhibitor) with promising preclinical activity in AML.&#xD;

    <description>A 3+3 design will be used. The first 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1. If none experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), the next 3 patients will be treated at dose level 2. If a DLT is observed in 1 out of 3 patients at dose level 1, up to an 3 more patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose level. If 2 patients at dose level have DLTs, dosing will be lowered to dose level -1 (.5 mg daily, taken orally). If 2 or more of the up to 6 patients at any dose level have DLTs, the preceding dose will be declared the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). If more than 1 DLT occurs at Dose Level -1, the investigators will consider stopping the study. Once the MTD has been established, an additional 10 patients will be enrolled at this level to better characterize safety and tolerability.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Adults ages 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (excluding&#xD;
             acute promyelocytic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed patients must have received at least 1 induction chemotherapy regimen or two&#xD;
             cycles of a hypomethylating agent and achieved a Complete Response (CR), followed by&#xD;
             relapse of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory patients must have received at least 1 induction chemotherapy regimen or&#xD;
             two cycles of hypomethylating agent without achieving a CR.&#xD;

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known, active HIV, Hepatitis A, B or C infection (prior Hepatitis C infection that has&#xD;
