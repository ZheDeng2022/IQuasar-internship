  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) became the established treatment for overlap&#xD;
      syndrome (OS). It has been showed that the survival benefits of CPAP favored hypercapnic&#xD;
      patients. When considering hypercapnic stable COPD patients, survival benefits occurred when&#xD;
      the use of bi- level ventilation therapy was targeted to significantly reduce hypercapnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This highlights the relevance of hypercapnia and hypoventilation correction. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare the use of CPAP to Bi-level ventilation in hypercapnic OS&#xD;
      patients, since the later may correct not only the airway patency but also increase the&#xD;
      magnitude of each breath.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      represent two of the most prevalent respiratory disorders in clinical practice and their&#xD;
      coexistence is often described has &quot;overlap syndrome&quot; (OS) In patients with COPD, the&#xD;
      coexistence of OSA is associated with an increased risk of death from any cause, and&#xD;
      hospitalization because of COPD exacerbation. Treatment with continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) has been showed to be effective and associated with improved survival and&#xD;
      decreased hospitalizations. When CPAP became established treatment for overlap syndrome, a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis revealed that the hours of CPAP use were an independent predictor of&#xD;
      mortality. Furthermore, it has been showed that the survival benefit of CPAP favors&#xD;
      hypercapnic patients with overlap syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding hypercapnic stable COPD patients, the best results with long-term non-invasive&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation have been noted in studies using more intensive strategies of&#xD;
      ventilation, with higher inspiratory pressures and higher backup rates that improved or even&#xD;
      normalized daytime hypercapnia. In fact, survival benefits occurred when ventilation was&#xD;
      targeted to significantly reduce hypercapnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for typical COPD, overlap syndrome patients might also benefit from optimal daytime&#xD;
      hypercapnia correction, which could be better achieved using bi-level ventilation instead of&#xD;
      CPAP, since it could not only maintain airway patency but also improve alveolar ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare CPAP therapy to bi-level ventilatory support in overlap syndrome&#xD;
      patients, not only for the efficacy to achieve hypercapnia reduction, but also regarding&#xD;
      acute disease exacerbations, symptoms and treatment compliance. Therefore, the authors&#xD;
      designed a randomized controlled trial with recruitment and power calculations based on the&#xD;
      applicant's own data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the diagnosis, patients will be randomized either for CPAP or BPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CPAP is to be initiated, optimal pressure to maintain upper airway patency will be&#xD;
      determined. If there are continued obstructive respiratory events at 15 cm H2O of CPAP,&#xD;
      patients will cross-over to the BPAP study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding BPAP titration, patients will be treated with ventilators set in pressure support&#xD;
      spontaneous/timed mode, both inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP and&#xD;
      EPAP) will be manually titrated. EPAP will ensure optimal pressure for maintaining upper&#xD;
      airway patency and IPAP will be defined according to patient tolerance and pressure support&#xD;
      necessary to achieve normal PaCO2 values or to reduce baseline PaCO2 by 20% or more;&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months. Follow-up will include clinical evaluation&#xD;
      with physical examination and questionnaires (COPD Assessment test, Epworth Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
      and MRC dyspnea score), blood gas analysis, treatment adherence, AHI, nocturnal pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-month follow-up will also include lung function test, 6-min walking test and nocturnal&#xD;
      capnography.&#xD;

    <description>Epworth sleepiness scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.&#xD;
