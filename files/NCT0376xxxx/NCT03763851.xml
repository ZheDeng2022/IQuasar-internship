  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this innovative approach seeking effective therapeutic strategies, the investigators are&#xD;
      proposing to test the effectiveness of medical cannabis oil as an adjunct to palliative&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (RT) and Best Supportive Care to alleviate cancer pain that was only&#xD;
      partially relieved with conventional medications. Furthermore, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the effect of medical cannabis oil on health-related quality of life and symptoms that are&#xD;
      frequently associated with metastatic cancers including fatigue, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      insomnia and decreased appetite. The safety profile of medical cannabis oil with respect to&#xD;
      prolonged use of more than two weeks of administration, concomitant medication use and&#xD;
      palliative RT will also be examined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial&#xD;
      followed by an open-label extension phase of 12 weeks, to evaluate tolerability of medical&#xD;
      cannabis oil to reduce chronic pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive adult patients between the ages of 18 and 75, male and female, with cancer pain,&#xD;
      with an average weekly pain intensity score greater than 4 on the 11 points Numerical Rate&#xD;
      Scale (NRS), will be prospectively recruited and invited to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained by a Research Assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline documentation with standardized scales, patients will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cannabis group: Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) /Cannabidiol (CBD) ratio 1:1 capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo group: Placebo capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive palliative RT to the symptomatic site. Patients will have a&#xD;
           dose titration phase during the first week. The dose escalation will allow patients to&#xD;
           adapt to the potential adverse effects (AEs) of the medical cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits either in person or by phone will be at 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first phase of the study, patients who wish to participate in the&#xD;
      open-label extension phase will have the option to continue in the same treatment regimen.&#xD;
      For the placebo group, patients will have the option to receive the active treatment during&#xD;
      the 12-week open-label phase if the study physician feels it may potentially provide&#xD;
      benefits. Similarly, the dose will be titrated up in the placebo group who wants to receive&#xD;
      the active drug in the extension program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The open-label phase is 12 weeks long. For this open-label extension phase the follow-up&#xD;
      visits will be done after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
