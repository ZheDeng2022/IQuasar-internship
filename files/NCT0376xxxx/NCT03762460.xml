    <textblock>
      This feasibility study investigates the use of eHealth tools within routine medical treatment&#xD;
      for patients with depression in an outpatient psychiatric setting. The study investigates&#xD;
      whether patients find a mobile-optimized online eHealth tool to be acceptable and feasible,&#xD;
      and whether clinical and functional outcomes improve with use of the online eHealth tool,&#xD;
      compared to informational online resources for mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is increasingly recognized as the most common psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder and as one of the most common medical diagnoses worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement-based care (MBC) is an evidence-based approach for providing effective clinical&#xD;
      care to patients with MDD. MBC utilizes validated rating scales to assess symptom severity,&#xD;
      functional impairments, treatment adherence, and side-effect burden to personalize clinical&#xD;
      decision-making based on measured outcomes and clinical algorithms. However, despite evidence&#xD;
      demonstrating improved outcomes, MBC is still not routinely used by physicians. Barriers to&#xD;
      the use of MBC include lack of knowledge of which scales to use, how to incorporate&#xD;
      measurements into clinical charting systems, and the extra time needed for repeated&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team developed a web-based application (app) optimized for mobile devices to&#xD;
      address the treatment gap in MBC for people with depression, especially those who are working&#xD;
      while depressed. This user-friendly eHealth tool encourages patients to actively participate&#xD;
      in MBC by using their smartphones, tablets, or computers to screen, monitor, and manage&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and functional outcomes. Results can be easily displayed and printed to&#xD;
      share with clinicians, thereby affording health professionals a simple and cost-effective&#xD;
      means to integrate MBC into standard practices and to optimize treatment for MDD at the point&#xD;
      of care, without needing additional materials, equipment, or staffing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study investigates the feasibility of using a mobile-optimized online eHealth&#xD;
      tool to support MBC in routine clinical care for MDD within an outpatient psychiatric&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine both the clinical and practical utility of eMBC, this study will enroll&#xD;
      &quot;real-world&quot; patients with few exclusion criteria and undergoing naturalistic treatments so&#xD;
      that findings will be generalizable to other clinical settings and practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: As of April, 2020 (before recruitment started), because of the pandemic the study&#xD;
      protocol was changed to be fully virtual, with a change in the primary outcome to a patient&#xD;
      feasibility outcome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) is a self-report scale to assess symptoms of depression and consists of 16 items, 9 of which contribute to a summed total score (i.e., only the highest score of items 1-4, 6-9, and 15-16 are counted towards the total score). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms, with individual item scores ranging from 0-3 and total scores ranging from 0-27.</description>
