      Compassionate use access to belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) for eligible participants with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal immunoconjugate that binds&#xD;
      specifically to B-Cell Maturation Antigen. This program is intended to provide access to&#xD;
      belantamab mafodotin in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) and who are&#xD;
      refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody (e.g. daratumumab) alone or in combination, and to an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (i.e., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and to a proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor (PI) (i.e., bortezomib, ixazomib or carfilzomib). Patients considering this access&#xD;
      program should have no other therapeutic option, and not eligible for other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassionate use program (209233): Additional Criteria: patients must have failed at least&#xD;
      three lines of above stated prior therapy and should also be ineligible for all currently&#xD;
      approved standard of care for 4L+ MM in the requesting country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Expanded Access program (213304) is currently only available in the United States only.&#xD;
      The Individual Patient program (209233) is available in countries other than the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;

        equation) -- ≥ 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female Participants: Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;

             A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt;1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, during the&#xD;
                  intervention period and for at least 80 days after the last dose of belantamab&#xD;
                  mafodotin and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of&#xD;
                  reproduction during this period. The physician should evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;

             local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of belantamab mafodotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The physician is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and&#xD;

&#xD;
        • Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: Agree to use a male condom and&#xD;
        female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure&#xD;
