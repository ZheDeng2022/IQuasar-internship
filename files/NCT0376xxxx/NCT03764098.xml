  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this protocol, the investigators plan to collect pilot data to examine sex differences in&#xD;
      guanfacine's effect on 1) counteracting stress and stimulation based drinking behavior in the&#xD;
      laboratory and 2) improving clinical outcomes during a subsequent treatment phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, which will compare&#xD;
      guanfacine (6mg/day ER) to placebo (0mg/day) in treatment seeking adults meeting criteria for&#xD;
      DSM V alcohol use disorders (160, 40 per med x sex cell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility screening consists of an intake session and a physical exam. Subjects meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to 6mg/day ER guanfacine or matching placebo,&#xD;
      stratified by sex. Titration to steady state medication levels will occur over a 3 week&#xD;
      period (Weeks minus 3 to minus 1). Subjects will then complete three laboratory sessions&#xD;
      during Week 0 to evaluate ad lib consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each laboratory session, personalized imagery (within subject factor, stress,&#xD;
      stimulating, or neutral/relaxing, order balanced) will precede a 2 hour alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration period. Subjects will then begin a 6 week treatment phase (Week 1 to 6)&#xD;
      where medication is combined with a medical management platform delivered at weekly&#xD;
      appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment phase, medication will be tapered for 5 days, and a final follow&#xD;
      up evaluation will occur 1 and 3 months following the end of treatment. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures include the number of drinks consumed during the three self-administration sessions,&#xD;
      and reduction in percent heavy days of drinking during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are evaluated at each study appointment and will be tabulated. The date March&#xD;
      1, 2019 was used as the actual start date that was associated with the preliminary funding.&#xD;
      The study start date has been updated to reflect the beginning of the U54 grant.&#xD;
