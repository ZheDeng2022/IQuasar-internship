  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common problem in cancer patients. It negatively inﬂuences patients'&#xD;
      prognosis and quality of life. In gastrointestinal patients, it is also caused by insufﬁcient&#xD;
      food intake due to dysphagia, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, impaired digestion and&#xD;
      absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, influence of prior oncologic treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      radiotherapy), have been associated with prolonged hospital stay, more postoperative&#xD;
      complications and low survival outcome1-4. So, the proper assessment of nutrition status to&#xD;
      detect perioperative malnutrition may allow appropriate nutritional therapy and improve&#xD;
      survival5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the important factor which prolongs survival rate is good preoperative nutrition&#xD;
      status because it effects the postoperative nutrition outcome. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to correlate the association between pre- and postoperative nutrition status and surgical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nutrition Alert Form (NAF) is a clinical tool for determining nutritional status. The NAF&#xD;
      was modified from Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)6, and it is easy to use and does not&#xD;
      require nutritional expertise based on laboratory and physical examination. Therefore, the&#xD;
      NAF has been used extensively for screening of malnutrition in hospitalized Thai patients and&#xD;
      it can classify the nutritional status into three groups : NAF-A (Normal-Mild malnutrition),&#xD;
      NAF-B (Moderate malnutrition), NAF-C (Severe malnutrition)&#xD;

      Primary Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      - What is the relationship between the preoperative nutrition status and the postoperative&#xD;
      nutrition status in gastrointestinal cancer patients ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      - What is the relationship between malnutrition during preoperative and postoperative stages,&#xD;
      compared with postoperative complications?&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to study the association between pre- and postoperative&#xD;
      nutrition status compared with postoperative complications and surgical outcome. The results&#xD;
      of this study may affect future nutrition practices and encourage different behaviors in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer patients who prepare to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated by n=(z_(1-α/2)^2 p(1-p))/d^2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion (p) = 0.80, Error (d) = 0.064 Alpha (α) = 0.05, Z(0.975) = 1.959964 Power = 0.80&#xD;
      Sample size (n) = 178 Include drop out 10 % = 196 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 196 gastrointestinal cancer patients (esophageal, gastric, colon and rectum cancer), who&#xD;
      underwent scheduled surgery. Every patient underwent nutritional assessment by NAF before&#xD;
      surgery and (1 &amp; 3 months) after surgery at in the Department of Surgery, Ramathibodi&#xD;
      Hospital and Buriram Hospital from 20 November 2018. Patients with incomplete documents were&#xD;
      excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative nutrition status assess by NAF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative nutrition status at 1 month and 3 months assess by NAF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All postoperative complications were collected according to Clavin-Dindo Classification8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All case were included in this study, following TNM staging and others pathologic&#xD;
           parameters :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer type - Tumor grading&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node metastasis - Tumor depth&#xD;
