      This trial (Phase II) will assess the different methods of supporting families in finding&#xD;
      mental health and/or addictions (MHA) services for youth. Youth with MHA issues and their&#xD;
      families are particularly vulnerable in the MHA system, due to a lack of specialized support&#xD;
      and complicated transitions between services. This study will assess the potential impact of&#xD;
      Navigation on youth MHA symptom reduction or functional improvement, family functioning,&#xD;
      satisfaction with MHA services, as well as the cost-benefit of Navigation. This project will&#xD;
      seek to determine whether there is a difference for those youth with MHA issues and their&#xD;
      families who receive Navigation over those who find and access MHA care on their own.&#xD;

      This pilot feasibility trial (Phase I) assessed the feasibility to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial examining whether families of youth ages 13 to 26 with mental illness and/or&#xD;
      addiction concerns who receive Navigation services experience improved clinical outcomes&#xD;
      compared to families who interact with the MHA care system on their own (usual care). This&#xD;
      pilot feasibility trial (Phase I) assessed the different methods of supporting families in&#xD;
      finding mental health and/or addictions (MHA) services for youth. Youth with MHA issues and&#xD;
      their families are particularly vulnerable in the MHA system, due to a lack of specialized&#xD;
      support and complicated transitions between services. This study assessed the potential&#xD;
      impact of Navigation on youth MHA symptom reduction or functional improvement, family&#xD;
      functioning, satisfaction with MHA services, as well as the cost-benefit of Navigation and&#xD;
      sought to determine whether there is a difference for those youth with MHA issues and their&#xD;
      families who receive Navigation over those who find and access MHA care on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes for Phase I of this trial were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment rate as a measure of recruitment feasibility (baseline): tracking of&#xD;
           recruitment rate to determine whether it is high enough for a full-scale trial to be&#xD;
           feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in acceptability of study methods across time (two months and four months):&#xD;
           Acceptability of Procedures and assessments by participants as measure of protocol&#xD;
           feasibility (Questionnaire developed based on the Theoretical Framework of&#xD;
           Acceptability, Sekhon et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Completion Rate (four months): tracking of study completion rate to determine&#xD;
           whether it is high enough for a full-scale trial to be feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes for Phase I of this trial were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Caregiver Strain Across Time (baseline, two months, four months): Caregiver Strain&#xD;
           Questionnaire as measure of functional and health outcomes for the youth and family&#xD;
           (CSQ; Bickman et al., 2012). Clinical Outcome #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Youth Symptoms &amp; Functioning Across Time (baseline, two months and four months):&#xD;
           Symptoms and Functioning Severity Scale (SFSS, Bickman et al., 2012).Clinical Outcome&#xD;
           #2.Total Scale Range= Min: 26, Max: 130. Higher values = worst outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family Functioning Across Time (baseline, two months and four months) (baseline, two&#xD;
           months and four months): Olson Family Satisfaction Scale (FSS, Olson, 2010). Clinical&#xD;
           Outcome #3. Total Scale range = Min: 10, Max: 50. High values = better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Youth Emotion &amp; Behaviour Symptoms Across Time (baseline and four months): Child and&#xD;
           Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI, Sprafkin et al., 2010). Clinical Outcome #4. Total&#xD;
           Scale Range = Min 29, Max: 87. Higher values = worst outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Caregiver Quality of Life Across Time (baseline and four months): Medical Outcomes&#xD;
           Survey Short-Form (SF-36, RAND Health, 2018). Clinical Outcome #5. Total Scale Range =&#xD;
           Min: 36, Max: 180. Higher values = worst outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Youth Quality of Life Across Time (baseline and four months): Medical Outcomes Survey&#xD;
           Short-Form (SF-36; RAND Health, 2018). Clinical Outcome #6. Total Scale Range = Min: 36,&#xD;
           Max: 180. Higher values = worst outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Health Services Utilization over time (baseline and four months): Health Services&#xD;
           Utilization Questionnaire (Henderson et al., 2017) Reporting of usage of health services&#xD;
           for purposes of cost change estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health Services Utilization over time (baseline and four months): Child and Adolescent&#xD;
           Services Assessment (CASA; Ascher et al., 1996); Reporting of access of health services&#xD;
           for services usage estimates.&#xD;
