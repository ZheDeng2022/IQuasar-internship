      Purpose: To investigate of the respiratory function and swallowing function after respiratory&#xD;
      muscle training, and the manifestation of surface EMG of swallowing muscles, and the&#xD;
      lateralization of placement of electrodes in stroke patients. Methods: A prospective study.&#xD;
      Consecutive patients with diagnosis of stroke will be proved by magnetic resonance image or&#xD;
      computerized tomography. Stroke patients, aged 35-80 years old, with inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      weakness or swallowing disturbance will be enrolled and randomly divided into control group&#xD;
      (usual rehabilitation alone) and experimental group (inspiratory muscle strengthening&#xD;
      training (IMST) group for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness and expiratory muscle&#xD;
      strengthening training (EMST) for patients with swallowing disturbance, respectively. Each&#xD;
      patients will receive usual rehabilitation. In the meanwhile we will recruit 23 healthy&#xD;
      subjects for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive baseline characteristics, duration of stroke, Brunnstrom's stage,&#xD;
      muscle power, spirometry, peak cough flow, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP),maximal&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (MEP), resting heart rate, perception of dyspnea, resting oxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), hand grip strength of unaffected upper limb. And patients with swallowing&#xD;
      disturbance will receive swallowing screen test, Functional Oral Intake Scale to evaluate the&#xD;
      functional level of oral intake of food and liquid, and voice quality analysis for voice&#xD;
      quality and bilateral surface electromyography for measurement of masseter, oris orbicularis,&#xD;
      submental muscle and infraspinatus muscles. All of patients will be assessed again at 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with respiratory muscle weakness will receive IMT from 30% to 60 % of MIP through a&#xD;
      respiratory trainer for two sets of 30 breaths or 6 sets of 10 repetitions. For patients with&#xD;
      swallowing disturbance, EMST will commence from 15% to 75% of threshold load of an&#xD;
      individual's MEP, 5 sets, 5 repetition with one minute of rest between sets.. The training&#xD;
      resistance will be adjusted accordingly, with one or two minute of rest between sets. Both&#xD;
      group will receive respiratory training, twice per day, 5 days per week. For checking the&#xD;
      compliance of RMT at home, patients will be monitored by making a phone call to them once a&#xD;
      week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients commonly to have respiratory muscle weakness and swallowing disturbance.&#xD;
      Their cardiorespiratory function could be markedly impaired within 7 weeks after a stroke,&#xD;
      and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) reduced.&#xD;
      Dysphagic patients usually had reduced hyolaryngeal excursion. The contraction of&#xD;
      submandibular hyolaryngeal muscles (geniohyoid, mylohyoid, anterior digastric) and thyohyoid&#xD;
      muscles can influence on the hyoid bone and largynx . The decreased excursion and elevation&#xD;
      of hyolaryngeal complex has been considered as one of cause of penetration and aspiration in&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle training (RMT) could improve cough effectiveness and reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of pneumonia in acute stroke. RMT could significantly increase in MIP and MEP with training&#xD;
      intensity of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) varied from 30% to 60% of MIP, duration of 3&#xD;
      to 7 times per week and duration of each session from 10-30 minutes for a period of training&#xD;
      from 6 to12 weeks in subacute stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) had potential benefit for respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, swallowing and cough function. EMST could significantly increase duration of&#xD;
      activation with higher peak amplitudes of EMG signal of the submental muscles as compared to&#xD;
      dry and wet swallowing in stroke patients(Wheeler, et al. 2007) and it also had promising&#xD;
      outcomes for airway protection in persons with dysphagia second to neuromuscular impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing phase including oral phase, pharyngeal phase, pharyngeal and initial esophageal&#xD;
      pahased. Surface EMG (sEMG), a simple, noninvasive, radiation-free and reliable method, can&#xD;
      be used to screen and differentiate the swallowing disturbance by recording activity of&#xD;
      surface EMG over the swallowing muscles, including orbicularis oris, masseters, submental&#xD;
      muscles and infrahyoid muscles. The electric activity of sEMG can be filtered and rectified&#xD;
      as EkG-looking line. It can provide complementary information to assess the dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation of sEMG signals during swallowing in healthy adults has been reported And stroke&#xD;
      patients with middle cerebral artery infarction had delayed swallowing onset, pretrigger&#xD;
      duration of hyoid bone. The sEMG showed shorter duration of sEMG activity, latency between&#xD;
      the start of EMG activity and actual movement, shortened submental muscle activity, and&#xD;
      prolonged pretrigger duration during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Respiratory muscle training can activate the respiratory muscles, stimulate motor&#xD;
      cortex of central nervous system of speech, swallowing and respiratory function through the&#xD;
      certain process of neuroplasticity in brain and spinal cord. EMST could facilitate submental&#xD;
      muscle contraction, increase submental muscle force and elevate the hyolaryngeal complex&#xD;
      during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, rare reports regarding the relationship between the respiratory muscle training and&#xD;
      swallowing dysfunction in stroke patients. And stroke patients with different lesions may&#xD;
      have specific sEMG patterns; the differentiation of sEMG pattern of swallowing muscles in&#xD;
      different stroke disease with dysphagia is not explored yet, and also short of standards to&#xD;
      study the sEMG of swallowing muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will use a simple respiratory muscle training device(Threshold type) to&#xD;
      train respiratory muscles and follow up its effect on swallowing, cough, voice quality in&#xD;
      stroke patients with respiratory muscle weakness and/or swallowing disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-six stroke patients with respiratory muscle weakness, age between 35 to 80 years, will&#xD;
      be enrolled. The participants will be randomly assigned by a computer random number generator&#xD;
      into two groups, including the experimental group (RMT group plus usual rehabilitation) and&#xD;
      the control group (usual rehabilitation alone). All allocations will be concealed in the&#xD;
      opaque envelopes. The research assistant will enroll the participants, generate the&#xD;
      allocation sequence, and assign participants to their groups after obtaining the informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be randomized into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: IMST only: inspiratory muscle training for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness&#xD;
      (MIP less than 70% of normal range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: EMST: for patients with swallowing disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III: Control group will receive regular rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject with respiratory muscle weakness or swallowing disturbance, baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, including height, weight, body mass index, duration of the disease,&#xD;
      neurological level (Brunnstrom's stage), spirometry, peak cough flow, resting heart rate,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), MIP, MEP,&#xD;
      Borg's scale (0.5 to 10), 6-minute walking test, cough function, fatigue assessment scale and&#xD;
      caregiver stress scale. Pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength will be assessed&#xD;
      by an experienced technician in our pulmonary functional room as a baseline at the begin of&#xD;
      training program, and at end of program(6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: IMST only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMT will commence from 30% to 60 % of MIP and then adjust one level of training loading&#xD;
      according to the tolerance of continuously breathing through a respiratory trainer for two&#xD;
      sets of 30 breaths or 6 sets of 10 repetitions with one or two minute of rest between sets,&#xD;
      once per day, 5 days per week. Training resistance will be adjusted as tolerated. The loading&#xD;
      will be performed with the previous resistance setting or even lower if training load is not&#xD;
      tolerated or not completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During IMT, patients will be instructed to place their lips around breathing trainer in a&#xD;
      sitting position with a nose-clip, inhale with enough force to open the valve (inhale deeply&#xD;
      and forcefully), exhale through the mouthpiece (exhale slowly and gently), and then continue&#xD;
      inhaling and exhaling without removing the device from their mouths. The training load and&#xD;
      training program will be instructed by an experienced respiratory technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: EMST: for patients with only swallowing disturbance EMST will commence from 15% to&#xD;
      75% of threshold load of an individual's MEP, 5 sets, 5 repetition with one or two minute of&#xD;
      rest between sets, twice per day, 5 days per week. And training resistance will be adjusted&#xD;
      accordingly. The loading will be performed with the previous resistance setting or even lower&#xD;
      if training load is not tolerated or not completed. Each patients with swallowing disturbance&#xD;
      will receive swallowing screen test, Functional Oral Intake Scale, voice quality analysis and&#xD;
      surface electromyography by an experience physician and experienced speech therapist to&#xD;
      evaluate the functional level of oral intake of food and liquid, voice quality and&#xD;
      measurement of submental muscle strength respectively. And swallowing training program will&#xD;
      be conducted by an experienced speech therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GroupIII：Control group will receive regular rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's baseline characteristics, including height, weight, body mass index, and&#xD;
      duration of the disease, neurological level (Brunnstrom's stage), spirometry, resting heart&#xD;
      rate, rest respiratory rate, blood pressure, resting oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), MIP,&#xD;
      MEP, or the lowest resting SpO2, Borg's scale, six-minute walk work value and distance,&#xD;
      six-minute upper extremity ergometry, peak cough flow, non-affected upper limb strength,&#xD;
      fatigue assessment scale etc.&#xD;
