  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PTC596 in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced LMS and determine the overall safety profile of PTC596 in combination with&#xD;
      dacarbazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) for dose&#xD;
      finding. Treatment will be initiated at dose level 2 (DL2) (Dacarbazine 1000 milligrams per&#xD;
      square meter [mg/m^2] intravenously (IV) every 21 days in combination with PTC596 200&#xD;
      milligrams [mg] orally twice weekly) for the first participant. This dose level represents&#xD;
      the investigator's best assessment of the MTD based on available toxicity data for both&#xD;
      agents. For subsequent participants, the dose level at which treatment is initiated will be&#xD;
      selected based on the TITE-CRM using the most up to date dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      information from all participants previously treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue for each participant until evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression, or treatment discontinuation for another reason (study intervention&#xD;
      discontinuation and participant discontinuation/withdrawal).&#xD;
